GLOBAL BUSINESS UNITS (GBUs)
Kentz is organised into three global 
business units whose broad range of 
services allows for multiple entry points 
into the life of a project. These business 
units complement each other, providing 
high value services and complex project 
solutions to some of the world’s largest 
energy and resource companies.
EPC
Kentz offers a broad range of engineering and 
construction services, providing clients with fully 
designed and delivered turnkey solutions. Our 
approach to projects is client-focused, preferring a 
“one team” style of execution. Our full in-house team 
designs, engineers and builds complex facilities for 
our clients in remote and challenging locations 
throughout the world.
CONSTRUCTION
Kentz executes multi-disciplinary construction 
contracts that add significant value to a client’s 
end asset. We focus on the technically challenging 
areas of construction: the provision of structural, 
mechanical, electrical, instrumentation and piping 
services. Our construction management teams are 
highly experienced in the construction of new plant 
facilities, and the retrofit and expansion of existing 
plant facilities.
TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES
Through the Technical Support Services (TSS) 
business, Kentz offers a range of services for capital 
projects from front-end and detailed engineering, 
project and construction management, through to 
completions and commissioning of major energy 
plants. This has been a key area of growth for Kentz 
and highlights clients’ demand for our specialist 
engineering and construction capabilities.

GEOGRAPHIC REACH
OUR PLATFORM FOR GROWTH GRAPHIC
AMERICAS
Kentz has achieved strong 
growth in the Americas 
mainly due to the increased 
contributions of our 
Canadian operations. In 
2013, Kentz established new 
operations in Colombia with 
a core client and in January 
2014, we completed our 
acquisition of Valerus Field 
Solutions in the US which 
provides us with material 
entry into both the US and 
Latin American markets. 
MIDDLE EAST  
AND CASPIAN
Our core market which has 
experienced competitive 
pressures in recent years is 
showing signs of 
improvement. Kentz won 
several important new 
contract awards in 2013, 
many with our core client 
base. We continue to see 
further activity in Iraq, an 
important market in this 
region where we are focused 
on building a sustainable 
business with some of the 
world’s largest energy 
companies. 
AFRICA
The significant gas 
discoveries in East Africa 
provide an optimistic future 
for the oil and gas sector in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Kentz’s 
large presence in 
Mozambique and strong 
track record in LNG 
developments elsewhere 
positions us to provide our 
services to these exciting 
developments. 
AUSTRALASIA
The Australasia region was 
the largest region in the 
Group in terms of revenues 
and profits for 2013. The 
main focus in this market 
continues to be the 
significant investment by 
some of the oil majors in 
developing LNG facilities. 
Kentz has played a large part 
in these facilities since 2009 
and expect this activity to 
continue for the foreseeable 
future. 
FAR EAST AND RUSSIA
In Russia we continue to provide services to our clients in 
Sakhalin Island - a remote and challenging location. Our 
expansion into mainland Russia following the opening of our 
Moscow office is still at an early stage but we continue to 
evaluate opportunities and possible partnerships to position 
ourselves for major upcoming developments

indicators, see pages 18–19

Our flexible and agile business 
model, combined with robust 
strategies, enables Kentz to 
effectively deliver growth in 
its core businesses.
We operate a continuous 
strategic review process which 
allows our three GBUs to 
focus on sustaining long-term 
value generation. 04
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Our diversified business model, strong 
client relationships and dedicated 
workforce ensure that the outlook for  
our global operations remains positive.
OVERVIEW
Kentz has continued to make 
great progress during 2013. We have 
delivered another year of double 
digit earnings growth* due to a good 
balance of new business and natural 
growth, which is very encouraging 
given the uncertainty that abounds 
in our sector. Our diversified 
business model, our broad service 
offering and diverse geographical 
spread continued to deliver growth 
for our business. These elements, 
coupled with strong client 
relationships and dedicated 
workforce, ensure that the outlook 
for our global operations is positive. 
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
Many people in the investment 
community are posing the question 
of what impact the reduction in 
capital investment by the large 
global oil and gas companies is 
having on our business. Although 
we monitor what is going on in the 
macro-economic environment and 
the spending plans of our larger 
clients, we place a greater emphasis 
on the specific opportunities that 
exist for our services and whether 
these opportunities are continuing  
to exist and even grow. The 18% 
growth in our pipeline of prospects 
and 19% growth in backlog in 2013 
demonstrates the growing level of 
opportunities that exist for our 
business and provides confidence 
for 2014 and beyond. We have 
achieved improved business winning 
in Australasia, Middle East and Africa 
which has contributed greatly to the 
considerable growth in our backlog.

STRATEGY
Last year, we identified six strategic 
priorities to strengthen the Company 
and position it for the longer-term. 
We remain committed to developing 
our core markets in the Middle East 
and Australia, whilst simultaneously 
focusing on broadening our value 
adding specialist capabilities and 
seeking to leverage our capabilities 
across a growing operational 
footprint. I am pleased to say that we 
have made great strides in executing 
these initiatives, but we remain very 
conscious that we still have a lot of 
ground to cover. Having been a 
significant shareholder of Kentz 
since 1994, I have seen the Company 
transformed from a small private 
company to a significant player in oil 
and gas services. The addition of 
Valerus provides a great grounding 
for further expansion of our services. 
The Board is confident in the Group’s 
strategy and we are encouraged that 
our strong workforce worldwide is 
adapting well to the changes that its 
execution entails. 
ACQUISITION OF VALERUS  
FIELD SOLUTIONS
In December, we announced the 
proposed acquisition of Valerus Field 
Solutions (Valerus) for US$435m. 
Valerus is a US-based integrated 
oil and gas surface facility solutions 
provider which provides a full suite 
of products and services from the 
well-head to the pipeline as well as 
an integrated services capability. 
Valerus focuses on adding value 
through front end and conceptual 
design, with an emphasis on turnkey 
capability and delivering projects 
quickly and efficiently. A key part of 
our strategy, which was developed 
and approved by the Board in 2012, 
was the broadening of our ability to 
provide EPC services for medium- 
sized onshore process facilities. The 
transaction received overwhelming 
support from shareholders and the 
acquisition completed on the  
3 January 2014. I would like to 
welcome the Valerus staff to the 
Kentz Group and look forward to 
their continued success. The Board 
is confident the acquisition of 
Valerus will provide significant 
strategic, operational and financial 
benefits to the Group. 
PEOPLE
As a people-based business that 
operates in many of the world’s most 
remote and challenging locations, the 
importance of recruiting, managing, 
developing and retaining our team 
is an important factor in continuing 
to deliver services for clients and 
sustaining the Company’s growth. 
With the addition of Valerus to the 
Group, we now have approximately 
14,500 employees who provide 
complex solutions for our clients and 
help operate a global organisation 
across the 36 countries in which we 
operate. On behalf of the Board, I 
would like to thank all of our staff 
members for their hard work during 
2013 and for their continued 
commitment to Kentz. 
At the next Annual General Meeting 
in May 2014, Ed Power will not seek 
re-election to the Board and will 
retire as Executive Director and Chief 
Financial Officer (CFO). Ed has been 
with Kentz since 1990 and has 
played a pivotal role in developing 
Kentz into the strong respected 
company that it is today. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank Ed 
for his commitment and hard work 
over the past 23 years and wish him 
a very long and happy retirement.
I am pleased to introduce Meg 
Lassarat who will succeed Ed as 
CFO upon his retirement. Meg has 
over 20 years of global financial 
experience and has been 
instrumental in driving growth, 
identifying strategic alternatives 
and delivering positive bottom-line 
results in her career to date. Prior 
to joining Kentz, Meg was CFO of 
UniversalPegasus International, a 
professional engineering and field 
services organisation and also  
spent eight years as CFO of  
Mustang Engineering, part of 
the Wood Group.
OUTLOOK 
I am in a very fortunate position 
as Chairman of a strong growing 
company that continues to make 
great achievements year after year. 
Reports of improvements in the 
global economy and an outlook for 
2014 better than any since 2007 are 
encouraging but we must remember 
not to be complacent. Kentz is a 
service provider and our important 
clients depend on us to continually 
deliver for them. As an organisation 
we are committed to creating 
shareholder value by providing a 
high-quality service in a safe manner. 
The Board of Kentz is confident that 
the Group will continue to deliver 
value for all our stakeholders as we 
continue to broaden our offering.

Our strengths reinforce each other 
and develop our people and 
consistent vision, while our model 
is built on four key differentiators 
that make us agile and effective  
in our service delivery.
GLOBAL BUSINESS UNITS:
Kentz is organised in three 
Global Business Units – 
Engineering, Procurement 
and Construction (EPC), 
Construction and Technical 
Support Services. These 
business units give clients 
access to world-wide 
resources, providing 
flexibility and skills to 
execute demanding and 
complex projects in some  
of the most remote locations 
on earth. The collaboration 
between our business units 
enables us to provide clients 
with a quality service and 
certainty of delivery. Our 
broad service offering 
provides multiple entry 
points for Kentz into our 
clients’ projects. 
KEY DIFFERENTIATORS:
Kentz is a service provider 
to the energy and resource 
sector. Our capabilities allow 
us to provide a broad range 
of specialist services to clients 
throughout a project’s life. Our 
decentralised management 
structure locates our decision 
makers around the world, 
close to clients and projects. 
Our expertise and 
background in providing 
specialist construction 
services in remote and 
challenging locations provide 
certainty of delivery to clients. 
These factors set Kentz apart. 
CLIENT FOCUS:
Client focus is at the centre 
of everything we do. The 
structure of the Group and our 
service offering are focused on 
delivering projects for clients in 
the safest and most efficient 
manner. We are committed 
to providing a quality and 
innovative service to all our 
clients. We are continuously 
improving the quality of our 
work through client interaction, 
leadership, teamwork and work 
process improvement.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Through its well recognised 
reputation for excellent project 
execution, clients turn to Kentz for 
their toughest challenges. We have 
found that relationships built on the 
foundations of trust, respect and fair 
dealings have fostered the most 
advantageous projects from the 
clients’ perspective.
Kentz is proud to have developed 
strong relationships with many of the 
world’s largest and most respected 
energy and resource companies.  
Our business development teams, 
located in each of the regions where 
we operate, focus on developing and 
maintaining these client relationships, 
thus allowing us to identify and 
pursue market opportunities at an 
early stage. 
Investments by our clients are 
planned well in advance. Establishing 
and maintaining a good relationship 
with clients enables our development 
team to build market intelligence 
about upcoming project investments 
and to identify the opportunities that 
exist for Kentz.
Our pipeline of prospects, which 
was US$15.6bn at the end of 2013, 
contains a long list of opportunities 
that we have identified in each of our 
markets and with each of our clients. 
The development and maintenance 
of this prospect list is made possible 
through the close relationships we 
have developed with our clients. 
Once an opportunity is identified, 
the challenge is to maintain the 
client relationship and pursue the 
opportunity to a bidding stage. 
CONTRACT TYPES
Cost-reimbursable contracts are 
based on payments to Kentz for 
actual costs incurred in addition to a 
fee. The costs include direct costs for 
the performance of the services and 
indirect costs covering overheads. 
Cost reimbursable contracts 
normally offer Kentz the lowest 
level of risk and are used where 
commercially appropriate. 
Lump sum (fixed price) contracts 
are based on a fixed total price for 
a defined scope of work. The typical 
lump sum contract will generally 
include engineering, procurement 
of equipment and materials, logistics 
and construction and commissioning 
services. This is the highest risk 
category through which we contract 
our services.
Work unit-rate contracts are similar 
to fixed-price and are the agreed 
rates for the performance of specified 
work. These types of contract are 
most prevalent in the Construction 
business unit, where Kentz is able 
to take the performance risk on the 
project due to our proven execution 
capabilities on technically challenging 
construction projects. 
PROJECT EXECUTION AND FUNCTIONAL 
OVERSIGHT
Prior to submission of proposals for 
all projects with a higher level risk 
rating, the Risk Review Committee is 
tasked to ensure that all identifiable 
risks within a project are identified 
and evaluated. All risks are tabulated 
and either priced or excluded from 
the proposals. If the Kentz tender is 
successful, all projects with a higher 
level of risk are monitored in order 
to mitigate any effects of the 
identified risks. 
The Group Project Services (GPS) 
function provides oversight of all 
projects to monitor that they are 
performing as expected and that no 
unanticipated risks have occurred 
that will impact the overall outcome 
of the project. 
The GPS function has no Profit and 
Loss (P&L) responsibility and its 
sole function within the Group is to 
provide oversight to projects and 
highlight any areas where they 
believe there is a problem or 
potential problem. 
The project oversight function allows 
our project teams to identify and 
resolve any issues at an early stage 
and to mitigate the risks.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
Kentz’s capabilities to deliver such 
crucial services for clients on a 
global level distinguishes us from 
most of our peers. The risk in many 
projects lies with the physical 
construction of the asset and Kentz 
has its own construction workforce 
that has developed the skills, tools 
and experience to successfully 
complete these projects.
The provision of services to energy 
and resource companies leads Kentz 
to remote and challenging locations. 
Kentz’s success in providing high 
quality construction services in such 
difficult locations has allowed us to 
develop an extensive track record as 
being one of the few global 
construction contractors with the 
capability to deliver high quality 
projects for its clients.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
The distributed Kentz model 
ensures that key decision

our clients’ projects. The two 
key advantages are: 
• Having our senior executives 
close to projects and clients 
assist in winning and retaining 
business: constant dialogue is 
maintained and knowledge 
shared allowing Kentz to 
identify any upcoming 
client developments. 
• Occasional difficulties and delays 
are to be expected on large 
complex projects in remote and 
challenging locations. Having 
people with the authority to 
resolve any difficulties close 
to these projects allows Kentz 
to identify, resolve and 
communicate challenges to 
clients and act on any such 
issues quickly. 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
Kentz’s multiple entry points into 
a project afford the Group the 
opportunity to provide one client 
with services from all three of our 
business units. Alternatively, we can 
identify specific parts of the value 
chain on which we can focus 
business-winning efforts. Some of 
our services are concentrated on 
the early stages of a project and the 
project personnel often have a clear 
insight into the clients’ future needs. 
We can thus identify additional 
service offerings for other business 
units. The collaboration of our 
business units provides our clients 
with “one-team solutions” in the 
development of their project. 
Through our three business units, 
Kentz often has the opportunity for 
bidding on multiple contracts within 
a project. 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
Kentz initially started its 
international business and 
expertise primarily in oil, gas and 
chemicals projects in the Middle 
East and Africa. On this foundation, 
the Group has developed the 
expertise to deliver large scale 
projects for international energy 
clients in some of the most difficult 
conditions and remote locations on 
earth. Our solid experience in the 
oil and gas sector has led to repeat 
business from these clients and 
Kentz has expanded our core 
competencies to satisfy client 
needs in the wider energy and 
resources arena.  10
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Kentz is in a strong position 
given our geographical 
spread, value chain and 
service line flexibility not to be 
dependent on any particular 
sector, investment cycle or 
location of the world. 
INTRODUCTION
Kentz’s geographical spread, value 
chain and service line flexibility ensure 
that we are not dependent on any 
particular sector, investment cycle or 
location. Kentz works in 36 countries, 
providing a broad range of services to 
numerous sectors of the energy and 
resource industry. The flexibility of our 
business model provides the Group 
with significant opportunities in 
different markets and at various 
stages of the investment cycles. Given 
the committed and impressive client 
base that Kentz has developed over 
the past three decades and the high 
level of repeat business that we earn, 
the outlook for the business continues 
to be very strong. 
GEOGRAPHICAL OPPORTUNITIES
Kentz has earned the reputation as 
the can-do team for the construction 
of the new Australian LNG facilities. 
Australia represents 46% of the 
Group’s backlog at the end of 2013. 
However, the outlook for further LNG 
developments in Australia appears 
uncertain due to the globally 
uncompetitive cost structure locally. 
Kentz’s focus will be on completing 
the Gorgon LNG project which is due 
to produce its first LNG in mid-2015. 
The client is considering expansion 
of this development from the current 
three LNG trains to possibly four or 
five. Should this expansion proceed, 
Kentz is well placed to assist in this 
development project. Recently, 
Kentz was awarded a significant piece 
of work for both the electrical and 
instrumentation and mechanical 
packages for the two LNG trains at the 
Ichthys development in the Northern 
Territory of Australia. Final Investment 
Decision (FID) for this development 
was granted in January 2012 with 
Kentz already being awarded two 
contracts there to date. This 
development will provide revenues 
to Kentz for the next few years. In 
addition to this construction work, 
significant opportunities exist for 
Kentz to provide services during the 
opex phases at all LNG developments 
by our TSS business. 
The discovery of large amounts of gas 
in East Africa in recent years provides 
considerable opportunities for Kentz, 
particularly in Mozambique. Kentz has 
successfully operated in Mozambique 
for 16 years and our successful 
delivery of projects provides a strong 
foundation for future expansion. We

also have strong relationships with 
the local government and local 
communities, developed in part 
through our Corporate Responsibility 
efforts. Having gained experience in 
the LNG sector in the Middle East 
and Australasia, Kentz brings that 
experience and track record to 
Mozambique. That expertise, coupled 
with our knowledge of operating in 
Mozambique, uniquely positions Kentz 
to significantly influence the future 
development of LNG facilities there. 
Since entering the Canadian market 
in 2008, efficiently supporting the oil 
sands sector has been at the forefront 
of our Canadian strategy. We have 
generated sizable revenues and profits 
in the past three years from this sector 
but we are seeing some slowdown 
which will change the dynamic of our 
operations. However, the LNG market 
in Canada is looking more positive. 
According to BP’s Statistical Review of 
World Energy 2012, global LNG supply 
is expected to grow at twice the rate 
( 4.5% per annum) of total global gas 
production (2.1% per annum) by 2030. 
The International Energy Agency 
estimates the scale of new LNG 
projects will require a US$250bn 
investment over the next 30 years. 
Currently a total of seven planned LNG 
projects in Canada have been granted 
export licences with three others under 
review. As in Mozambique, Kentz has a 
strong presence in Canada and LNG 
experience with the oil majors in other 
parts of the world that puts us in a 
good position to benefit from the 
investment in LNG in Canada. 
The Middle East has been a core 
market for Kentz and we believe that 
this region will continue to be a source 
of continued growth for Kentz through 
our clients and their projects. The 2013 
results for Saudi Arabia were at record 
levels and the outlook for 2014 is also 
very positive. Bidding activity in the 
region increased in 2013 and won a 
number of new awards. Momentum is 
also building on the oil projects in Iraq 
that we have been following for some 
time. We have entered into a joint 
venture agreement with Foster 
Wheeler to provide services to the 
much anticipated Shell Majnoon 
project, which is a super-giant oil field 
and one of the richest oil fields in the 
world. We have made progress in 
winning new business in Iraq which 
suggests that this country will provide 
a larger part of our revenue stream in 
the near to medium term.
SECTOR ANALYSIS
At the end of 2013, the oil and gas 
sector represented 85% of our 
backlog with the remainder largely 
comprising petrochemicals and 
mining. In all parts of the world we 
continue to see investment from our 
clients in the oil and gas sector and 
this is evidenced by the increase in our 
pipeline of prospects which grew 18% 
in 2013 to US$15.6bn. 
Mining has represented a smaller part 
of our business in the past two years 
and is now 5% of our Group backlog, 
broadly in line with the previous year. 
We see some opportunities in Africa in 
the mining sector and we will continue 
to maintain our presence in the mining 
sector to be in a strong position when 
capital investment returns. Certainly 
for the short to medium term, we do 
not foresee mining becoming a larger 
part of our business. 
OUTLOOK
Reflecting on the significant Kentz 
project load in the oil and gas sector, 
our corporate outlook is influenced 
by underlying petrochemical pricing 
markets. The Brent crude oil price 
was broadly unchanged in 2013 and 
averaged US$109, ranging between 
US$97–US$119. The Energy 
Information Administration expects 
Brent crude to average US$105 in 
2013 and US$102 in 2014. Decisions 
made by our clients as to project 
viability are made with a longer term 
view on pricing and demand, a large 
decrease could create some 
uncertainty and delays. 
The key indicators suggest that 
the outlook for Kentz continues to 
be positive. We ended 2013 with a 
record backlog of US$3.1bn which 
increased to US$3.5bn when we 
completed the acquisition of Valerus 
on 3 January 2014. This is an increase 
of 35% on 31 December 2012 and 
accounts for approximately 75% 
of expected 2014 revenues of the 
combined Group. 
In addition to the sizeable backlog, 
the 18% growth in our pipeline of 
prospects highlights the considerable 
opportunities for our business and the 
continued investment by our clients. 
These key indicators coupled with our 
successful track record and exemplary 
performance provide confidence for 
another successful year in 2014.  12
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
2013 was another period of major success 
for Kentz and represents a key milestone 
in our growth. Kentz has achieved 
exceptional organic growth in its business 
in the six years since listing and the 
acquisition of Valerus complements and 
extends that growth and provides many 
benefits to the enlarged group. 
INTRODUCTION
Kentz continued its previous 
successes in 2013 and has achieved 
exceptional organic growth in its 
business in the six years since it 
listed. That growth is complemented 
and extended by the addition to the 
Group of Valerus, whose acquisition 
marks a key milestone in our 
growth strategy. 
Overall, the 2013 results are very 
positive. We achieved our stated 
target of double digit earnings 
growth* and realised a growth of 
17.3%. This growth was attributable 
to both our ability to develop natural 
growth opportunities through 
existing relationships as well as to 
attract new business. We ended 
the year with a record backlog of 
US$3.1bn, with the backlog of the 
enlarged Group at the end of 
February 2014 having grown to 
US$4.1bn. Further, a considerable 
amount of Valerus’ contracts are 
book and burn and do not form part 
of the Group backlog. Our backlog 
continues to offer a low risk profile 
for the Group with approximately 
78% of the year-end backlog being 
cost-reimbursable. In addition to the 
orders on hand, we have a pipeline 
of prospects of US$15.6bn that 
provides confidence for the future 
and demonstrates how our broad 
service offering continues to provide 
opportunities for growth.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Our Technical Support Services 
(TSS) business unit has had an 
exceptional year, growing its 
revenues by 60% and its backlog 
by 83%. We have increased our 
revenue in the North American 
market through the expansion of our 
operations in Canada and our entry 
into Alaska. 
Construction remains our largest and 
our core business unit and has had 
exceptional success in winning new 
projects. Our construction team 
has established new operations in 
Colombia and added further success 
with a new contract at the Ichthys 
LNG project in Australia. In February 
2014, we were awarded the 
US$640m structural, mechanical 
and piping construction contract 
in a 50:50 joint venture with UGL

Resources. There has been further 
bidding activity on other sizeable 
contracts at Ichthys which are due for 
award in the first half of 2014. 
Our strategy to grow EPC both 
organically and inorganically has 
achieved great success in 2013. The 
additional leadership, technical and 
sales resources have delivered a 30% 
increase in legacy EPC backlog, 
positioning us for significant growth 
in 2014 and beyond. The acquisition 
of Valerus has increased our technical 
capabilities, introduced us to a new 
client base and built a critical mass in 
the Americas region. We expect to 
deliver future growth through joint 
business winning opportunities.
CORPORATE ACTIVITY
During the year, the Group received 
approaches from two parties 
expressing their interest in acquiring 
the entire share capital of Kentz. As 
stated in our announcement in 
August, the Board of Kentz met and 
discussed these approaches, taking 
into account the growth plans that 
we had and the resulting value we 
saw for our shareholders. Having 
performed detailed analysis and 
receiving assistance from our 
advisors, the Board unanimously 
rejected each of these approaches 
and subsequently the interest from 
these parties ceased. The Board 
maintains that it made the correct 
decision and, as evidenced by our 
success through the latter half of the 
year, acted in the best interests of 
our shareholders.
SAFETY
In 2013, we worked a total of 
46,364,322 man-hours, and at 
0.14, our full year Total Recordable 
Incident Rate (TRIR) was down 26% 
from 2012’s TRIR of 0.19. Safety 
continues to be our core value, 
with the safety and health of all our 
employees being of vital importance 
to the organisation. Safety is also a 
paramount value of our clients and 
we work closely with each client to 
ensure that safety is given priority on 
all project sites to ensure that no one 
gets hurt and everyone goes home 
safe and well. 
PEOPLE
Kentz prides itself on the integrity, 
dedication, technical excellence and 
teamwork of all its employees. The 
strong workforce and teamwork 
provides for effective collaboration 
between business units and ensures 
that clients’ needs are fulfilled in the 
most efficient manner. I would like 
to thank all of our staff for their 
continued support, commitment 
and hard work. Our future 
accomplishments depend on our 
people and I have no doubt we have 
the people, skills and ambition to 
continue our success and realise 
further value for all our stakeholders. 
STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
In 2013, we began to implement 
the strategic initiatives to build our 
business capabilities and continue 
our exceptional performance. 
Acquiring engineering capability was 
a key objective that was met with the 
acquisition of Valerus Field Solutions 
on 3 January 2014. This new addition 
to the Kentz Group provides many 
benefits as well as opportunities 
to grow the Group through the 
expansion of the client bases of both 
entities and the global reach of the 
combined Group. We are continuing 
to implement the other initiatives 
and have made good progress 
already on many of these. 
The outlook for Kentz remains very 
positive. I am confident that 2014 will 
be a very busy and successful year. 
We have a strong order book and an 
abundance of opportunities that 
exist for our services in our core 
markets. We also have a strong 
workforce to execute these projects 
with the ultimate aim of creating 
further value for our shareholders.
Christian Brown
Chief Executive Officer
ACQUISITION OF VALERUS  
FIELD SOLUTIONS
We were very pleased to announce 
the proposed acquisition of Valerus 
Field Solutions (Valerus) in early 
December. Our strategy for EPC 
has been to expand our ability to 
provide EPC for small to medium 
onshore process facilities. The 
acquisition of Valerus provides a 
number of benefits to Kentz such 
as process engineering expertise to 
pursue further EPC opportunities, 
material entry into the US and 
Latin American markets, new 
clients and opportunities to sell 
Kentz’s services. 
The addition of Valerus to the Kentz 
Group brings 665 people including 
198 with demonstrable experience 
in gas handling and processing. 
Valerus is a strongly performing 
business with a track record of 
delivering high margins. One of 
the main aims of the transaction 
is to expand its service offering 
geographically through the broad 
network of Kentz’s operations. The 
business development teams from 
Kentz and Valerus are already 
engaging with each other to 
identify opportunities for the 
enlarged Group. 
The Board of Kentz believes that, 
consistent with our strategy, the 
acquisition of Valerus will help to 
establish Kentz as a recognised 
market leader in providing highly 
skilled process engineering, 
Engineering Procurement 
Construction Management 
(EPCM) and EPC services for 
small and medium sized oil and gas 
processing facilities worldwide.

QUESTION
Kentz has achieved another strong 
year of growth. How have your 
operations performed? 
ANSWER
Our target coming into 2013 was to 
deliver double digit earnings growth* 
and I’m delighted to say our adjusted 
earnings* grew by 17.3% in the year. 
Our TSS business unit has had a 
particularly strong year as we 
continue to offer our services to 
more clients in more locations. 
Revenue from our Construction and 
EPC business units have fallen in 
2013 but we expect to see an 
improvement in 2014. For 
Construction, slower progress in a 
couple of projects in the first half of 
2013 meant lower than expected 
revenues but we expect this will 
catch up in 2014. We are seeing 
more bidding activity in EPC in 
recent months with a number of 
awards being made to Kentz which 
provides confidence for this year and 
beyond. Of course, Valerus who we 
acquired on 3 January 2014 will also 
add significant revenues to the EPC 
business in 2014. 
QUESTION
The acquisition of Valerus is a 
significant addition to the Group. 
How will this new business change 
Kentz?
ANSWER
The acquisition of Valerus satisfies 
the strategic initiative of building out 
EPC. Valerus adds to our engineering 
capability and provides us with 
process engineering expertise to 
allow us to provide EPC for small to 
medium onshore process facilities. 
Valerus also provides material entry 
into the US and Latin American 
markets where Kentz’s exposure 
to date has been limited. We don’t 
plan to integrate Valerus into Kentz 
right away but we see great business 
development opportunities for the 
combined entity as there is little 
overlap in our respective 
client bases. 
QUESTION
You have worked in this industry for 
20 years and have now been CEO of 
Kentz for two years, what do you 
believe makes Kentz different?
ANSWER
I think it is important for us to 
continue to differentiate ourselves as 
our sector has disappointed many 
clients and investors in the past 
couple of years. Showing why we are 
different and not going to disappoint 
is key and mainly due to the 
following factors: 
1 We have developed strong client 
relationships through a proven 
track record of successful project 
execution over the past three 
decades. Fundamental to this 
success have been the 
outstanding contributions made 
by our highly skilled and 
motivated workforce and retaining 
this talent throughout the 
business cycle. The collaborative 
efforts of the projects teams 
create significant value in project 
execution and explains why 80% 
of our work is from clients that we 
have served in the past.
2 We have operating flexibility 
through a differentiated service 
offering across the entire project 
value chain so we can provide 
many services to one project. 
3 Our operations have geographical 
diversity which allows for global 
positioning to support projects 
worldwide.
4 Although we operate largely in the 
oil and gas sector, we are a service 
provider and work in other sectors 
such as mining, power and 
infrastructure which provide 
flexibility and further 
opportunities.
QUESTION
Many companies in this sector are 
experiencing delays or cancellations 
in projects which seems to be 
impacting their growth plans. How 
has Kentz been affected by changes 
in client behaviour?
ANSWER
To date, we have not seen any 
significant delays or cancellations  
to our projects. Delays to projects 
occur for a host of reasons, but our 
decentralised operating model 
ensures that frequent, meaningful 
communications with our clients 
provide us with the ability to foresee 
delays and respond before it seriously 
impacts our earnings.
There continues to be a huge 
opportunity for Kentz to provide its 
broad service offering to our clients. 
This is evident by the growing pipeline 
of prospects that has increased 18% in 
2013 and has grown steadily in the 
past five years. This is a metric we 
place a lot of emphasis on internally 
along with monitoring our clients’ 
investment plans.
QUESTION
Where will the focus be over the 
next 12 months?
ANSWER
During 2014, we will continue what 
we do best: to deliver projects for our 
clients ensuring that safety is always 
our greatest focus, enabling our and 
our clients’ staff to go home safe and 
well. We have grown strongly since 
we listed six years ago and I believe 
we will continue to grow and expand 
our operations, services and client 
base. We are making great strides in 
delivering our strategic initiatives and 
we are always looking to the future to 
ensure we have growth plans that will 
continue to create shareholder value.

Our Board and management team assess the Group’s 
performance according to a wide range of measures and 
indicators. Here we describe the financial and non-financial 
KPIs that we use to monitor performance.
DEFINITION
Measures the value of 
services and activities 
performed for our clients 
from operations around 
the world.
PERFORMANCE
During 2013, the Group 
achieved very strong 
growth in the Technical 
Support Services business 
unit, which increased 60% 
over 2012. This increase 
was somewhat offset by 
reduced revenues in both 
EPC and Construction 
business units. 
PROGRESS IN 2013
+6%
PROGRESS IN 2013
+13%
*
DEFINITION
A key measure that 
highlights the profits 
generated by the Group in 
the past year excluding 
any exceptional items. 
PERFORMANCE
PBT has increased by 13% in 
2013 over the prior year 
demonstrating that the 
Group has been successful 
in generating increased 
profit growth from the 
increased operating activity. 
Additionally, PBT growth is 
in excess of the 6% revenue 
growth points due to a 
higher margin achieved by 
the business in 2013.
PROGRESS IN 2013
+6%
*
DEFINITION
PBT margins demonstrates 
the ability of the Group to 
convert revenue into profit.
PERFORMANCE
The PBT margin has 
increased in 2013 to 7.1% 
from 6.7% in 2012. This 
improvement showed the 
Group’s ability to generate 
greater profits from 
revenue. 
PROGRESS IN 2013
+17%
*
DEFINITION
Diluted earnings per 
share represents the 
portion of the Company’s 
profit allocated to each 
outstanding share 
(adjusted for the potential 
dilutive effects of share 
options outstanding).
PERFORMANCE
Diluted EPS before 
exceptional items has 
increased by 17.3% in 2013 
to 68.07 cents per share. 
Given that PBT* has grown 
by 13%, the growth in 
diluted EPS shows the 
increased value being 
created for shareholders.

ONE KENTZ
“One Kentz” is a crucial element 
of our “2013 and Beyond” strategy, 
and a successful functional 
matrix structure is one of its vital 
ingredients. In addition to being 
organised across three global 
business units: Construction; 
Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction (EPC); and Technical 
Support Services (TSS), Kentz has 
specific functions in place that act as 
service providers and business 
partners to the business units. 
These functions are committed to 
adding value to the business and are 
responsible for:
• Providing maximum agility in the 
identification and deployment of 
high quality, technically 
competent resources
• Improving our ability to attract 
and retain functional resources
• Lowering our corporate costs by 
ensuring a higher utilisation of 
known resources from a global 
internal talent pool
Regional Managing 
Directors provide a regional 
point of coordination, 
collaboration and integration 
for all three business units 
and financial support teams.
• Bringing improved technical 
expertise to our increasingly large 
and technically complex projects 
• Providing technical oversight 
within their function to ensure that 
Kentz delivers predictable and 
repeatable technical excellence
DECENTRALISED STRUCTURE
Kentz has a decentralised 
management structure and members 
of the management team are not 
based in a central office but located 
throughout the world. 
This structure allows for greater client 
engagement and focus to ensure that 
project specific needs are met. 
Developing and maintaining 
client relationships is crucial to 
the success of our business. Our 
structure facilitates the building and 
strengthening of these relationships. 
It ultimately aids our business-
winning process and benefits our 
clients through effective delivery 
of their projects.
GBU RE-ALIGNMENT
Eoin Hurley retired from his full-time 
position as Chief Operating Officer 
of the Construction business unit at 
the end of 2013. From 1 January 2014, 
Mike Murphy was appointed Group 
President, Construction and TSS 
business units. The EPC business unit 
has been renamed Engineering and 
Projects and will continue to be led by 
Tush Doshi as Group President.
The newly acquired Valerus, which is 
led by Steve Gill, will be reported as 
part of the Engineering and Projects 
business unit.

“OUR EXPERIENCE OF WORKING 
IN ARCTIC CONDITIONS IN FAR 
EAST RUSSIA HAS ALLOWED US  
TO ENTER THE ALASKAN MARKET  
IN EARLY 2013 WITH THE AWARD  
OF COMMISSIONING WORK FOR  
THE POINT THOMPSON PROJECT.”
Our Technical Support Services (TSS) 
business has performed exceptionally 
well in the past few years and 2013 
was no different. Revenue increased 
by 60% over 2012 to US$654.1m with 
margins continuing to be robust. 
The business unit revenues as a 
proportion of Group revenues have 
grown sharply to 39% from 26% in 
2012. The TSS business will continue 
to pursue further growth through our 
strategy of globalising our TSS 
services and expanding our footprint. 
The TSS business unit had a backlog 
of US$1,128m at the end of 2013, 
which was an increase of 83% over 
2012. In addition to these orders  
on hand, there was also a pipeline  
of prospects of US$2,200m  
(31 December 2012: US$2,129m) 
which provides many opportunities 
for the future. 
AMERICAS
The TSS operations in Canada 
have delivered another strong 
performance in 2013. In 2012, we 
were awarded the mechanical, 
electrical and instrumentation 
scope of work at the Aurora Mine 
Relocation project in Fort McMurray. 
This is the first contract we have 
undertaken with Syncrude and it is 
very pleasing to have recorded very 
strong activity during 2013, which 
has exceeded our expectations. 
Our experience of working in arctic 
conditions in Far East Russia has 
allowed us to enter the Alaskan 
market in early 2013 with the award 
of commissioning work for the Point 
Thompson Project. The award of this 
contract in Alaska forms a foundation 
for Kentz to expand into this 
geographic region and build on the 
Group’s arctic engineering and 
construction expertise. 
AFRICA
Following the collaboration of 
the TSS and Construction business 
units work on the Ambatovy nickel 
mine in Madagascar, the TSS 
business unit was awarded a three 
year maintenance contract on the 
site. The maintenance project has 
performed very well in 2013 and is a 
good example of the enhanced level 
of opportunities that exist for Kentz 
given its broad service offering. 
AUSTRALASIA
The strategy for TSS in Australia 
continues to be a focus on providing 
operations and maintenance 
services to the LNG plants that have 
been constructed or are currently in 
the construction phase. This is an 
ongoing focus which our local 
business development team is 
following to enable our TSS 
business to develop a long-term 
presence in the region. 
MIDDLE EAST
Projects in Saudi Arabia have 
produced a strong result for the TSS 
business unit in this region. We have 
developed good relationships with 
many of the national oil companies 
that are providing many opportunities 
for our TSS team. Our relationship 
with Saudi Basic Industries 
Corporation (SABIC) is a good 
example of this. Kentz has worked 
with SABIC for 20 years and is now 
contracted to provide technical 
support services including Project 
Management, Construction Specialists 
and Construction teams to support 
the expansion project at IBN Rushd 
Petrochemical Complex. This project 
has had a successful performance in 
2013 and is due for completion 
in 2014. 
From 1 January 2014, I will lead the 
TSS and Construction business units 
in the role of Group President, 
Construction and TSS business units. 
TSS and Construction will remain as 
separate business units. However, 
the resources, leadership and 
support will be consolidated to 
maximise operating efficiency and 
business winning opportunity.

ENHANCING OUR 
CORE MARKETS
AND CAPABILITIES
The Middle East constitutes 
one of Kentz’s primary 
operating hubs, having 
established a base during 
the 1970s. In that time  
we have built many 
longstanding relationships 
with our strong portfolio of 
clients and are proud to 
continue supporting their 
evolving requirements with 
our broad service offering. 
We have delivered on our 
objectives of securing 
regional managers across 
the Middle East, Australasia 
and Africa. We recognise 
the need to take advantage 
of opportunities that are 
presented to Kentz. 
Through our decentralised 
management structure we 
are able to maximise these 
opportunities and support 
our clients across the 
value chain and life cycle 
of a project. 
The excellent work 
delivered by our TSS 
business unit has been key 
to our success this year. 
The quality of delivery has 
been crucial in driving 
growth for the business 
and in Kentz being 
recognised as a leading 
partner in executing 
complex projects. As a 
result, we were recently 
awarded a contract to

The provision of construction 
services to energy and resource 
clients has been at the core of our 
business for over three decades.  
Our core skills in construction 
differentiates us from most 
competitor companies and provides 
us with many opportunities to grow 
our business.
Revenue from the construction 
business unit has fallen slightly 
in 2013 to US$709.5m (2012: 
US$759.3m). Due to some timing 
issues, slower progress was made on 
projects in Australia and Africa due 
to factors outside Kentz’s control. 
We expect to see improved progress 
in both regions in 2014. Construction 
still remains the largest business unit 
in Kentz, representing 43% of Group 
revenues in 2013 (2012: 49%), with a 
backlog of US$1,496m at the end of 
December 2013 (December 2012: 
US$1,607m) and pipeline of 
prospects of US$4,994m 
(US$4,174m). 
AUSTRALASIA
We continue to make good progress 
on the mechanical, electrical and 
instrumentation scope of work for the 
Gorgon LNG project. This project is 
expected to be complete in mid-2015 
and therefore will form a large part of 
our revenues and profits from this 
business unit in 2014. We continue to 
maintain excellent relationships with 
our client and are assisting in every 
way possible to deliver this scope of 
work in line with the agreed timeline 
to allow Chevron to provide first LNG 
as per their schedule.
Post-Gorgon, we believe that the 
Ichthys LNG project in Northern 
Australia will be a significant source 
of revenue and profits for Kentz. 
Recently we were awarded the 
US$640m structural, mechanical 
and piping construction contract 
in a 50:50 joint venture with UGL 
Resources. This adds to the telecoms 
package our EPC business unit is 
now completing and the US$100m 
underground cabling contract our 
Construction business unit was 
awarded in 2013. The underground 
cabling contract is the preface to 
the electrical and instrumentation 
package which we have bid during 
2013 and which is due for award in 
the first half of 2014. 
AFRICA
We continue to maintain a good 
presence in East Africa through 
our work with Vale and Kenmare 
Resources. During 2013, Vale 
awarded us a contract to provide 
structural, mechanical, electrical and 
instrumentation services for the 
Nacala Corridor Project in northern 
Mozambique. In March 2014, we 
announced the award of Phase 2 of 
the Moatize coal mining project which 
is welcome progress for the mining 
sector in Africa. We also see some 
further prospects in mining in 
Mozambique in the near-term. 
Our longer-term focus remains on the 
LNG projects that are being planned 
for Mozambique. Kentz has a strong 
base within the country and good 
relationships with local government 
and local communities. Coupling this 
with our strong track record in LNG, 
in other parts of the world, Kentz is 
well positioned to compete for 
upcoming work. 
Due to prolonged labour disputes 
at the Medupi power plant in South 
Africa, slower progress was made 
during the first half of 2013. Progress 
improved in the second half and we 
continue to build momentum on our 
scope of the project. This continues 
to be a challenging project but we 
remain focused on completion in late 
2014/early 2015. 
AMERICAS
Activity in the oil sands business in 
Canada has been slowing, with many 
companies in the sector highlighting  
a downturn in their operations. In 
2013, our Canadian construction 
business achieved growth of over 
20%, mostly from our operations in 
Alberta. This growth demonstrates 
the benefit to the Group of having 
a broad service offering and the 
importance of having our own blue 
collar construction business. We 
believe that these advantages will 
yield further opportunities.
We expect some slow-down in the oil 
sands projects in the coming year and 
our focus is on opportunities in the 
LNG sector in Canada. We have 
identified a number of prospects in 
this sector and region to target during 
2014 and beyond. Winning these will 
strengthen our Canadian operations 
and provide another source of 
revenue. 
Our aim of acquiring a small 
Structural, Mechanical and Piping 
(SMP) company in Canada remains a 
key objective. Although the planned 
acquisition will be small, we intend 
it to provide us with capability to 
address the immediate opportunities 
that exist for these services. 
From 1 January 2014, the Construction 
business unit will be led by Mike 
Murphy who has assumed the role of 
Group President, Construction and 
Technical Support Services (TSS) 
business units. Construction and TSS 
will remain as separate business units 
however; the resources, leadership 
and support will be consolidated to 
maximise operating efficiency and 
business winning opportunity.

Operational Approach
Kentz is a leading global 
provider of construction 
solutions to clients through 
the provision of structural, 
mechanical, electrical, 
instrumentation and 
mechanical services. We 
have a vast amount of 
experience supporting our 
clients across the natural 
resource sector and 
appreciate the challenges 
presented across diverse 
geographies.
During 2013, Kentz 
completed plant wide 
construction services on 
the Barrick Gold & Goldcorp 
joint venture Pueblo Viejo 
mining project, in the 
Dominican Republic. 
The scope included 
electrical, instrumentation, 
fiber optic and loop 
checking activities 
associated with both wet 
and dry areas of the facility. 
The successful 
completion of this project 
was complemented by the 
safety record. It is through 
the continued focus on 
upholding our key value  
of safety first that Kentz 
completed delivery of their 
services with no lost time 
incidents occurring 
during the three million 
man-hours worked.

In our 2012 Annual Report, we 
outlined our strategy for the EPC 
business unit and stated that a major 
element of our strategy is to build 
out our EPC business to maximise 
the opportunities from the large level 
of potential prospects. During 2013, 
we have exceeded our expectations 
in achieving our strategic aims and 
are seeing an improvement in our 
core markets and business winning 
activities, which have also exceeded  
our expectations.
EPC revenues for 2013 were  
down 24% to US$299.6m  
(2012: US$395.1m) with the business 
unit representing 18% of Group 
revenues (2012: 25%). At December 
2013, the backlog for the EPC 
business had increased 30% to 
US$443.7m (2012: US$340.7m).  
The pipeline of prospects for this 
business unit was US$8,416m, an 
increase of 22% on 2012. 
AUSTRALASIA
During 2013, we completed the 
Gorgon Construction Village project 
in Barrow Island. This fixed price 
project, which began in 2009, 
involved the design, engineering, 
procurement, fabrication and 
construction of a high quality village 
to accommodate 4,000 workers 
who are now constructing the three 
LNG trains. Work on the Gorgon 
telecom and electronics project is 
continuing with the client awarding 
us with additional scopes of work 
since commencement of the initial 
project. The telecoms project at the 
Ichthys LNG development in 
Northern Australia will be completed 
in the first half of 2014. The project 
has proceeded very well and builds 
on our experience in the LNG sector, 
which appears very promising in 
other locations of the world. 
MIDDLE EAST
We have identified abundant 
opportunities for our EPC business 
unit in this region. This has been a 
competitive region in the past few 
years but competitive pressures are 
now easing somewhat. Coupled with 
this change, we are now realigning 
our business to focus on EPC, 
increase our competitiveness and 
improve our business-winning. We 
are already seeing the benefits of 
these changes with a number of new 
awards for EPC in the second half of 
2013. Our confidence in EPC and the 
Middle East is growing and we 
anticipate further awards in the 
coming year. 
AFRICA
We are continuing to see further 
progress for our EPC business unit 
in Southern Africa. The strategic 
initiatives we have put in place to 
strengthen and broaden our EPC 
capabilities have shown considerable 
promise. During the year, we 
signed three long-term framework 
agreements with blue-chip 
international companies that 
allow for the provision of services 
as required and on an immediate 
basis, rather than through submitting 
tenders for individual elements as 
they are required. In addition to 
these agreements, we were 
awarded further work with Transnet 
for work on elements of the New 
Multi-Product Pipeline (NMPP) 
Project in South Africa. 
From 1 January 2014, the EPC 
business unit is being renamed 
Engineering and Projects to 
accurately reflect the high value 
added professional services that 
the business unit executes. This 
business unit will incorporate 
EPC and EPCM services, the newly 
acquired Valerus business along 
with Global Engineering and Project 
Management Consultancy services.

EPC – STRATEGY IN ACTION .
BROADENING  
OUR SPECIALIST 
CAPABILITIES
As part of its 2013 and 
Beyond strategy, Kentz has 
focused on strengthening 
our presence across East 
and West Africa and 
further develop our EPC 
capabilities. Continued 
attention on expanding our 
addressable market and 
demonstrating the ability to 
execute our service offering 
across a broader range of 
sectors has become an 
area of focus for the Group. 
At the end of 2012, Kentz 
was awarded the contract 
for the Kalkbult Solar PV 
project to help address 
South Africa’s energy 
shortfall which it completed 
ahead of schedule in 
September 2013. It is the 
first renewable energy 
project awarded in the 
first round of the South 
African Renewable 
Energy Independent Power 
Producer Procurement 
programme to be 
connected to the grid and 
will supply 135mkWh per 
year or enough energy for 
33,000 households.
The scope of the 
project included design, 
fabrication and installation 
of a 75MWp (mega watt 
peak) photovoltaic power 
plant, including the sub-
structures and installation 
of 312,504 free-issued 
photovoltaic modules.  
The contract also includes 
design and execution of  
BRINGING OUR BUSINESS MODEL  
AND STRATEGY TO LIFE
all civil, infrastructure and 
security works around the 
perimeter of the plant.
Particularly pertinent to  
the successful delivery  
of the project was the 
collaboration and buy-in  
of the local municipal 
managers and community 
leaders to the Project 
Labour Agreement and  
the recruitment process, 
given that the bulk of the 
workforce would be 
recruited from local 
communities. Kentz 
established a number  
of local training and 
recruitment partnerships 
that have since provided 
multiple opportunities for 
local participants. 
Candidates who 
demonstrated significant 
potential were offered 
further training at the  
Kentz training facility in 
Johannesburg, where they 
will receive skill certification. 
They will then become part 
of the Kentz team to be 
utilised on other projects. 
In total, 67% of the 
employees were drawn 
from local communities 
and 100% of the project 
workforce was South 
African.

REVIEW OF 2013 
The Group continues to embed risk management 
processes within the day to day operations across the 
areas of operation and to heighten awareness of key risks 
so that appropriate mitigation is implemented. 
The increase in backlog from US$2.6bn at the end of 2012 
to US$3.1bn at the end of 2013 meant a significant number 
of projects were tendered and won during the year. The 
tenders meeting certain criteria were subjected to 
thorough risk review sessions involving corporate, function 
and operational executives (refer also to page 7). 
While other companies report resource constraints the 
Group successfully staffed its projects in all locations and 
also hired senior level talent to enhance its functional and 
operational capability. The Group continued its practice of 
up-skilling its staff to meet future challenges. 
The Group established new operations in Latin America 
and experienced a sustained performance by the 
engineering business RNE which was acquired in 2011.
There were periods of widespread industrial action in a 
small number of locations most notably in South Africa. 
The Group overcame competitive pressures in certain areas 
to successfully win work particularly in the Middle East. 
There were no known ethical breaches and all licences and 
accreditations were successfully renewed. 
OUTLOOK FOR 2014 
In view of the rise of the importance of computer networks 
for the Group, business continuity planning will be an area 
of focus for internal stakeholders during 2014. Given the 
geographies where the Group operates, protecting the 
Group’s reputation remains a significant area for constant 
attention with internal audit and compliance working to 
ensure all employees are aware of and adhering to the 
code of business conduct. New contract opportunities are 
a source of bringing risk onto the business and the RRC will 
continue to ensure those opportunities are aligned with the 
Group’s desired risk profile.
Valerus brings a number of new operating countries in Latin 
America with new languages, working practices, political 
and business conditions. In addition, with manufacturing 
facilities and a large workforce in the United States, this 
may expose the Group to more risk of litigation. The 
Group’s global insurance programme for 2014 was adapted 
to address these risks. Valerus will progressively adopt the 
Kentz Risk Management Procedures, complementing their 
existing practices and procedures. 38

COMPETITION
• The markets in which 
Kentz operates are 
competitive. In some areas, 
relatively new entrants 
have increased pressure on 
tender pricing levels and 
there may be fewer 
opportunities for 
the Group
• Kentz focuses on projects 
where a favourable 
investment decision is 
likely and the Group has a 
competitive advantage in 
terms of regulatory 
approvals, SSH&E track 
record or execution 
strategies 
• The Group has long-term 
strategic relationships with 
many clients and seeks to 
leverage these to win work 
• The Group is constantly 
evaluating its cost base to 
ensure it remains 
competitive
• Kentz continues to win 
work in competitive 
environments especially 
the Middle East where 29% 
of the Group’s backlog is 
located at 31 December 
2013 (14% at the end 
of 2012)
• The Group’s top ten clients 
have remained largely the 
same and continued to be 
dominated by IOCs 
and NOCs
OUTLOOK FOR 2014
• With realignment of the 
business unit structures 
this will support 
efficiencies in middle 
management costs 
• The Valerus acquisition

BUILDING BETTER FUTURES
WHAT IS CR TO KENTZ?
Kentz aims to conduct business 
in a socially responsible, ethical 
and transparent manner, with the 
desire to have a positive effect on 
our stakeholders, our diverse and 
talented workforce, and the 
communities in which we operate. 
We are guided by our Code of 
Business Conduct and maintain a 
strong focus on mitigating risks to 
our operations. 
WHY IS CR IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS?
At Kentz we recognise the value of doing the right thing, 
treating our people the correct way and always delivering 
an uncompromising service to our valued clients. We 
recognise that by addressing the things that are most 
important to our key stakeholders, we will ensure our 
business is sustainable and will provide shareholder value 
for the long term. We believe our approach to CR adds 
sustainable worth, not only to the communities in which 
we operate, but also to our Company and its workforce.
GUIDING PRINCIPLES
SHARED RESPONSIBILITY 
Social, safety and environmental awareness is the 
shared responsibility of all employees and the Board of 
Directors. We aim to develop and implement social and 
business policies which align with our clients and 
everyday activities. 
HONESTY AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
We communicate our policies, objectives and 
performance openly and honestly to our stakeholders; 
investors, clients, employees and suppliers and others 
with an interest in our activities. We encourage an open 
dialogue with these audiences and welcome their input.
CONTINUAL PROGRESS
We are committed to continuous improvement. We will 
take into account the changing environment where we 
operate and adapt to these changes in the development 
and implementation of all new social, safety and 
environmental policies and procedures. We will monitor 
our performance, set objectives for improvement and 
report our progress regularly. 
ETHICAL AND MORAL BUSINESS PRACTICE
We are committed to observing the highest legal 
standards; and moral ethics guide the Group’s business 
activities. We are committed to meet all relevant legislation 
as a minimum and where no legislation exists we will seek 
to develop and implement our own appropriate standards 
based on industry-wide best practice, while striving to be 
leaders in safety performance and employee well-being. 
COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR
In early 2013, Kentz implemented its 2013 and Beyond 
strategic plan. This strategic plan seeks to deliver 
sustainable growth for all our stakeholders through the 
broadening and leveraging of our capabilities across a 
growing operational footprint. In setting ourselves these 
objectives we appreciate the need to engage positively 
with our stakeholders and align their interests and values 
with our own to help grow a sustainable business and 
deliver shared value. 
In 2012, Christian Brown, Chief Executive Officer initiated 
a review of Kentz’s performance in CR. The review process 
engaged many of the Group’s internal stakeholders 
that contribute to Group’s CR focus, including Human 
Resources, Safety, Security, Health and Environment 
(SSH&E), Procurement and regional management 
teams from across the Group.

Kentz’s CR policy focuses on the following four key areas: 
Our People, Our Communities, Our Safety, Health and 
Welfare and Our Environment. By focusing on these 
four areas we will help drive Kentz’s strategic objectives 
and growth.
OUR PEOPLE
As a service-based company, Kentz’s most important 
and prized asset is our people. We respect our employees, 
their skills and the valuable knowledge that they bring 
when delivering our services. We actively encourage their 
development and training and acknowledge the mutual 
value in offering long-term career opportunities. We also 
recognise that by setting high standards, we provide a 
working environment that our people can be proud of and 
share in the responsibility of maintaining a positive work 
environment for future employees. 
We believe in the preservation of human rights and 
recognise both their importance and our obligation to 
protect them. Our employees are bound by a Code of 
Conduct that engenders positive behaviour in the work 
place and encourages each individual to respect their 
safety and the safety of their colleagues.
In 2013, Kentz employed approximately 14,500 people in 
36 countries and the number of nationalities represented 
in our workforce increased from 71 to 78. When recruiting 
for positions within our regions of operation, Kentz will 
look to the local market to identify and source personnel 
with the required skillsets, safety culture and industry 
experience. If there are specific skillsets that cannot be 
filled, we will aim to implement training programmes to 
train the local workforce and increase local employment 
opportunities. As an international company with global 
reach, we will recruit from overseas for more specialised 
roles as needed. An example of the training we provide in 
Africa is detailed further on the next page.
Following the internal stakeholder engagement process, 
a GAP analysis was performed by the CR Committee 
which allowed the Group to identify its strengths and 
weaknesses in each area and develop new CR Policy. 
It was decided that the CR Committee required 
further representation from the Management Executive 
Committee, as well as the Board of Directors. A new  
CR Committee was formed and its first meeting was held 
in February 2014. Kentz’s new CR policy was formalised 
and will be controlled by this Committee, with Brendan 
Lyons, Non-Executive Director as the Committee 
Chairman. The Committee will meet four times a year and 
will provide feedback to the Kentz Board of Directors at 
every scheduled Board meeting. 
The Committee’s remit is to consider any matters relating 
to the social, charitable, community and educational 
activities, expenditures and related publications of the 
Group that it determines to be desirable. In addition, the 
Committee shall examine any other matters referred to it 
by the Board. A further breakdown of the Committee’s 
responsibilities can be seen in the Company’s 2013 
Corporate Responsibility Report.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
INTENTIONS AND OBJECTIVES
A key focus for Kentz in preserving 
successful and sustainable growth is 
our commitment to deliver continuous 
improvements in career advancement 
and increasing leadership capabilities 
across our workforce. We plan to 
achieve this through a number of 
training and development 
programmes, some of which are 
already in place such as KTS (outlined 
in the case study), the Australian-
accredited Certificate IV in Frontline 
Management and the apprenticeship 
programme developed by Kentz and 
Balcatta College of Electrical Training 
in Western Australia. At a Group level, 
Kentz’s in-house Post Graduate 
Certificate and Diploma in 
Management and Leadership at 
Nottingham Trent University 
provides an excellent opportunity 
for employees seeking to advance 
their academic studies.
In 2014, we plan to roll out new 
programmes including a Leading 
Performance Programme, as well as 
new skills-enhancement courses in 
Managing People Effectively and 
Relationship Skills. Kentz has 
commissioned Soma, an 
international behavioural change 
consultancy practice with bases in 
both the UK and USA, to create and 
deliver these programmes. Soma, 
with extensive experience of 
organisational and leadership 
development in the oil and gas 
industry over the last 30 years, 
together with its capability to 
support Kentz across the globe, 
is uniquely placed to assist us.
Through embedding these types of 
initiatives in the organisation, we 
seek to support, train and motivate 
our employees. Kentz is determined 
in becoming a preferred employer 
of choice within the Engineering, 
Procurement and Construction 
market sectors to support the 
Company’s growth strategies.
OUR SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE
The safety, health and welfare of our 
employees takes priority over any 
other business objective. Our 
ultimate aim is to be an industry 
leader in Safety performance and to 
achieve an incident and injury-free 
workplace, where nobody gets hurt 
and everyone goes home safe to 
their families every day. 
In 2013, Kentz achieved a strong 
and progressive safety performance. 
During the year, Kentz completed a 
total of 46.4 million man-hours and 
at 0.14, our full year Total Recordable 
Incident Rate (TRIR) was the lowest 
since 2008; down 26% from 2012’s 
TRIR of 0.19. 
We recognise the importance of 
being proactive in our efforts to 
reduce incidents of unsafe behaviour 
at work. It is important to continually 
look for ways of improving our 
safety performance and encourage 
engagement amongst all staff to help 
us achieve this goal. We reduced the 
number of first aid cases by 14% 
from 317 in 2012, to 273 in 2013, and 
completed 17,000 observations; with 
less than 5% resulting in potentially 
unsafe work practices being 
identified. During 2013, senior 
management completed circa 50 
project safety assessments; where 
the project safety culture on the 
project was assessed against our nine 
habits of highly effective leaders. 
In the later months of the year, 
the Behaviour Based Safety 
(BBS) programme, SOCKS (Safety 
Observation Card System), evolved 
to become the new Behaviour 
Intervention Programme (BIP). 
This new programme focuses on 
23 different high-risk activities on 
our projects, allowing us to identify 
and work on areas of improvement. 
More details on this programme are 
included in the 2013 Corporate 
Responsibility Report.
CASE STUDY
Training and development of 
employees continues to be at the 
forefront in Kentz, with exceptional 
project related training 
programmes established across 
Africa and Australia. In South 
Africa, Kentz Training Solutions 
(Pty) Ltd (KTS), the training and 
development division established 
in 2010 has enhanced the delivery 
of Kentz internal programmes by 
including several new key 
Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) programmes in 
which 125 people participated 
during 2013. KTS is currently 
involved in several training 
initiatives, including KTS Training 
and Assessment Centre and KTS 
Siemens Training Centre. KTS has 
also succeeded in registering as an 
Accredited Training Provider with 
Merseta, the national authority 
responsible for training for 
industry-related scarce skills, such 
as welding and boiler-making. In 
addition, a number of project-
related training activities, based at 
the Medupi Power Project in 
Limpopo and the Tete Training 
Centre in Mozambique, promote 
up-skilling of local communities. 
Over 150 Mozambique nationals 
went through the training courses 
at Tete in 2013. These initiatives 
have served to strengthen Kentz’s 
performance in the region and 
build a strong local workforce.

INTENTIONS AND OBJECTIVES
Kentz’s ultimate goal is to be an 
incident and injury-free workplace. 
We have a target of 10% reduction 
in our TRIR year on year. Monthly 
leadership meetings discuss and 
address trends in our Safety, 
Security, Health and Environment 
(SSH&E) performance, as well as  
the implementation and monitoring 
of our Behavioural Intervention 
Programme on our project sites.  
This systematic and behavioural 
focused approach to improving our 
operational performance is designed 
to embed a safety-first mentality.
Kentz will also focus on the 
promotion of health and well-being 
of all our employees in the coming 
year, and our target is to ensure that 
all employees have access to an 
employee assistance programme. 
Implementation of occupational 
health programmes will also take 
place during 2014 through the 
Group SSH&E team.

CASE STUDY
In 2013, Kentz hosted its fifth 
Annual Safety Conference in 
Johannesburg, South Africa. The 
theme of this Safety Conference 
was World Class in Africa – 
Evaluating Safety Standards. 
Conference delegates, including 
many of our valued partners and 
clients in the region examined the 
safety culture in Africa and other 
parts of the world, and evaluated 
the leading principles that could be 
developed and honed to achieve 
world class safety standards in 
projects in Africa. Kentz constantly 
strives to improve its safety 
standards by investing in the 
welfare and training of its 
workforce and will use the 
conference outputs to improve 
safety initiatives across the Group.
OUR COMMUNITIES
Kentz strives to become an 
active member of the communities 
in which we operate and will support 
a number of charitable, social, 
recreational, well-being and cultural 
initiatives to that end. We will always 
listen to and respect community 
needs and expectations and seek 
a wide range of views on our social 
and environmental policies and 
performance. We will encourage 
our employees to consider the 
needs of others and involve 
themselves in public service in order 
to continually develop sustainable 
communities for all.  46
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
INTENTIONS AND OBJECTIVES
From 2014 onwards, we wish to 
focus our efforts on two annual 
sustainable community projects for 
each of our three largest regions; 
Australasia, Africa and the Middle 
East. The aim of these projects will 
be to provide sustainable benefits to 
the communities in which we 
operate or alternatively locations 
from where we recruit. 
Each of the Regional Managing 
Directors will be responsible for 
identifying and getting these 
projects underway, with support 
from their local teams on the ground. 
The projects chosen in each region 
will be relevant to one of the 
following categories: education, 
medical and community 
development – areas of focus our 
employees identified as important in 
our 2012 CR survey. Through its 
involvement in such community 
projects, Kentz intends to develop 
educational opportunities for local 
people to upskill and support the 
growth of local economies. We 
encourage local teams to find 
valuable local partners, such as 
non-profit organisations, that are 
familiar with the country and needs 
of the communities. We look forward 
to reporting on these initiatives in 
our 2014 CR Report. 
Whilst we are keen to promote larger 
initiatives that bring our various 
regions together in the pursuit of 
these more substantial programmes, 
we encourage our teams on the 
ground to continue to respond to the 
local community needs around them 
and maintain relationships with local 
underprivileged schools and 
community projects. We try to 
maximise the use of local suppliers 
where possible, to promote the 
development of local industry.
Further details of 2013 community 
initiatives from across the Group are 
included in our 2013 CR Report. 
OUR ENVIRONMENT
Environmental management is a key 
concern for Kentz, our employees 
and the industries that we support. 
We will promote responsible 
behaviour across all operations in all 
of our global locations; and regularly 
review our business practices and 
performance to identify how we can 
further improve our level of energy 
efficiency, waste management, and 
carbon emissions. We will identify, 
assess and manage risks to the 
environment and supply sufficient 
time and personnel resource to 
ensure the environment is preserved 
in the successful operation of 
our business.
The Kentz’s Green Office 
Programme (GOP), set up as part 
of our efforts to control our off-site 
environments, monitored paper 
usage in our main offices during 
2013. The GOP was formed in 2012 
and provided the initial platform for 
Kentz to launch its carbon reporting 
and management framework. We 
recognise that through reporting 
and managing our emissions we can 
drive improvements throughout our 
business. This was the first year of 
collecting and monitoring our paper 
usage and in doing so it has enabled 
us to set a reporting baseline. Our 
performance for 2013 is stated in 
the table below:
CASE STUDY
Following the devastation caused 
by Typhoon Haiyan across much of 
the central Philippines in November 
2013, Kentz established the Kentz 
Typhoon Haiyan Relief Fund to 
enable employees around the world 
to contribute to the relief efforts 
and support the affected family 
and friends of Kentz’s 3,500 
Filipino employees. 
The Kentz Typhoon Relief fund 
raised US$300,000, including 
employee donations and Kentz- 
matched funding. Having engaged 
in a comprehensive selection 
process, the CR Committee 
selected international humanitarian 
agency GOAL to invest the 
funds raised. 
Kentz’s donation will be used to 
support a School Rehabilitation 
Programme in the Jaro Municipality 
on Leyte Island in the Philippines. 
The area was heavily damaged by 
the storms and research from the 
Multi-Cluster Needs Assessment 
(MIRA) showed that teachers were 
experiencing difficulties delivering 
quality education in damaged 
classrooms and temporary 
learning spaces. 
The project will involve working 
with the Department of Education 
to rehabilitate at least 39 schools 
that service the local typhoon- 
affected communities, providing 
safe learning environments for 
children. At least 11,200 students 
(5,850 families) and 200 teachers 
will directly benefit in at least 54 
vulnerable communities. As well 
as facilitating education, these 
schools will serve an important 
function as evacuation centres 
by providing shelter to 
vulnerable households.

Kentz has Environmental 
Management Systems in place that 
meet the requirements of ISO 14001. 
There were over 140,000 
environmental observations 
performed on Kentz sites up until 
October 2013, resulting in zero 
occurrences of non-compliance. 
These observations are based on 
internal standards on environmental 
controls implementation outlined in 
Kentz’s Behaviour Based Safety 
(BBS) programme, SOCKS (Safety 
Observation Card System), which 
was launched in 2009. This 
programme evolved to become 
the new Behaviour Intervention 
Programme (BIP) during 2013.
INTENTIONS AND OBJECTIVES
During 2013, Kentz undertook a 
full review of its operations and 
established a carbon reporting 
system in line with the mandatory 
Greenhouse GAS (GHG) Carbon 
Reporting Regulations. Kentz 
commenced measuring our Scope 
One and Scope Two emissions as of 
October 2013 and will commence 
reporting of these in January 2014. 
This will include the direct emissions 
from fuel-combustion and air- 
conditioning units and also 
purchased electricity. In line with the 
GHG reporting requirements, Kentz 
has engaged Société Générale de 
Surveillance (SGS) to conduct a 
verification review of the framework 
through which Kentz is monitoring 
its GHG data collection. This will be 
done in May 2014 and the exercise 
will be repeated annually.
Kentz intends to respond to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 
Climate Change 2014 questionnaire 
in May of this year, which will 
enhance our understanding of 
carbon management and 
shareholders’ reporting expectations.

1 As more fully explained in Note 2 (c) – On 1 January 2013 the Group adopted IFRS 11 “Joint 
Arrangements”. This has resulted in some of our joint arrangements accounting for their share of the 
assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in accordance with their status as joint operations. The 
comparative figures have been restated as appropriate, in Note 35.
INTRODUCTION
On 3 January 2014 we completed 
the acquisition of Valerus Field 
Solutions for a total consideration 
of US$435m in cash, subject to 
working capital adjustment. The 
transaction was financed by a 
US$400m term loan arranged 
through a club of banks and 
supplemented with a portion of our 
own cash. In order to provide ample 
headroom for future working capital 
needs of the business we also 
arranged a US$160m revolving 
credit facility and bank bonding 
facilities amounting to US$500m 
at the same time as the acquisition 
financing details were being 
arranged. These facilities were all 
secured on investment grade terms.
2013 RESULTS OVERVIEW
REVENUE
Sales revenues increased by 6.0%  
in 2013 to US$1,657.5m (2012: 
US$1,563.3) this increase being 
primarily driven by a strong 
performance in the Australasia 
region where revenues increased  
by 60%.
The breakdown of revenue by 
business unit shows our 
Construction business accounted for 
43% of Group revenue (2012: 49%), 
Technical Support Services (TSS) 
39% (2012: 26%) and EPC 18% 
(2012: 25%). Year on year, the growth 
in TSS revenue amounted to 60% 
and is attributable to strong 
performances in Canada, 
Australasia and the Middle East.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Group accounts are prepared in accordance with IFRS.
“WE HAVE ACHIEVED STRONG GROWTH IN 
BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNING PER 
SHARE FOR THE YEAR. BASIC EARNINGS 
PER SHARE FOR THE YEAR BEFORE 
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS INCREASED BY 15.9% 
TO 69.60 US CENTS, (2012: 60.03 US CENTS). 
DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE 
YEAR BEFORE EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 
INCREASED BY 17.3% TO 68.07 US CENTS,

Backlog at 31 December 2013 
included 78% of reimbursable service 
contracts which reduces the risk 
profile of the Group. These contracts 
also carry good potential for future 
natural growth.
 
Sales to the Oil and Gas and 
Petrochemicals markets in 2013 
totalled US$1,383.1m or 83% of Group 
revenues, up US$233.5m or 20.3% 
from US$1,149.6m in 2012. The Mining 
and Metals sector with revenues of 
US$222.2m accounted for 14% of our 
business, (2012: US$294.7m or 
18.9%). Our remaining revenues have 
come from the Power sector (2%) 
and from other sectors (1%). 
GROSS PROFIT
Gross profits of US$220.2m or 13.3% 
of sales were recorded in 2013, an 
increase of US$8.9m or 4.2% on the 
2012 figure of US$211.3m. The overall 
margin is in line with prior years and 
is driven by strong performances in 
Australasia, the Middle East and the 
Americas. 
SG&A EXPENSES
Selling general and administration 
expenses before exceptional items 
reduced by US$1.9m in 2013 to 
US$106.3m in absolute terms (2012: 
US$108.2m). In relative terms the 
2013 figure comes in at 6.4% of sales, 
down from 6.9% in 2012. 
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating profit before finance costs 
and exceptional items for the year 
increased by US$10.5m or 10.0% to 
US$115.0m.
Geographically, the main increase 
occurred in the Australasian region 
where projects in Australia continue 
to perform well. We have also seen 
significant rebound in profitability in 
the Middle East which is a welcome 
development in an area that has 
traditionally been a core area of 
our business. 
SHARE OF JOINT VENTURES PROFIT
As explained in more detail in Note 2 
(c) the Group adopted the reporting 
requirements of IFRS 11 Joint 
Arrangements with effect from 
1 January 2013. As a result our joint 
operations account for their share of 
revenue and expenses within our 
operating profits, and prior periods 
have been restated accordingly. Our 
remaining joint ventures continue to be 
equity accounted and for the current 
period our share of joint venture profits 
increased marginally to US$0.4m 
(2012: US$0.1m) which primarily relates 
to our joint ventures in the Caribbean. 
NET FINANCE INCOME
Net finance income for the year 
amounts to US$2.6m, up US$2.4m 
from the 2012 figure. The increase is 
attributable to additional interest 
income of US$3.0m received on 
claim settlements in the period. 
Deposit interest income amounted 
to US$1.0m during the year.
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Profit before tax (PBT) and 
exceptional items for 2013 was 
US$118.0m or 7.1% of sales. This 
represents an increase of US$13.2m 
or 12.6% on the 2012 figure of 
US$104.8m.
TAXATION
The tax charge for the year is 
US$35.1m, which is an effective tax 
rate of 29.7% (pre exceptional items). 
This compares with an effective rate 
of 24.5% for 2012. This continues the 
trend seen in our interim results and 
reflects the mix of current year 
profits generated across the 
Group’s tax jurisdictions.
NET PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
Profit for the year before exceptional 
items was US$83.0m, up US$3.9m 
or 4.9% on 2012. Net profit before 
exceptional items at 5.0% of revenue 
is in line with the percentage 
reported in 2012.
NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST
The non-controlling interest for the 
year was US$1.0m or 0.1% of sales 
(2012: US$9.4m or 0.6%). This relates 
to a 50% holding in Kentz E&C Pty 
Limited by Thiess Pty Ltd.
EARNINGS PER SHARE 
We have achieved strong growth in 
both Basic and Diluted earnings per 
share on a pre-exceptional basis,

DIVIDEND
The Group reports its financial 
results in US dollars and accordingly 
declares its dividends in US dollars. 
Dividends are paid to shareholders in 
Sterling using an exchange rate 
calculated at the record date. 
The Directors have proposed a final 
dividend based on the full year results 
of 10.9 US$ cents per share. This 
would amount to a full year dividend 
of 17.5 US$ cents representing a 21% 
increase on 2012 (14.5 US$ cents). 
This is in line with the Company’s 
progressive dividend policy, and 
represents a payout of 29% of diluted 
EPS after exceptional items, up from 
25% in the prior year. 
On request, shareholders have the 
option of receiving their dividend in 
their local currency, using a 
competitive rate based on the 
market rate on the date of 
conversion and sent to them by 
currency draft or paid directly into 
their bank account. Please note that 
the record date and the date of 
conversion are not the same and 
those requesting for the dividend to 
be paid in a currency other than 
Sterling may be exposed to foreign 
exchange movements during the 
intervening period.

SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED 
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION 
HIGHLIGHTS
WORKING CAPITAL
Working capital at year end was 
US$293.9m, up US$56.9m or 24.0% 
on 2012 year end (US$237.0m). 
Following a similar pattern to that 
outlined in our interim results this 
increase is due to a combination of:
1. Strong growth achieved in the 
TSS business unit (up 60%) where 
working capital is primarily labour 
related and does not benefit from 
advance payments.
2. Growth in the level of 
reimbursable work in the 
construction business unit (e.g. 
Gorgon MEI) and while welcome 
from a risk reduction perspective 
also means that these contracts 
do not attract advance payments. 
3. Continuing impact of the 
milestone payment terms on the 
Medupi contract which preclude 
invoicing for progress achieved 
until all elements of a particular 
milestone have been completed.
Current assets at year end were 
US$721.8m, up US$66.7m or 10.2% 
on 2012 (US$655.1m). This increase is 
primarily attributable to trade and 
other receivables and cash. Current 
liabilities at year-end were 
US$427.9m, up US$9.8m or 2.3% on 
2012 (US$418.1m) mainly due to an 
increase in short-term borrowings 
and additional corporation tax 
payables.
EQUITY
Shareholders’ equity at year-end was 
US$328.3m, up US$50.4m or 18.2% 
on 2012 (US$277.9m). This reflects 
the growth of 20% in retained 
earnings during the year.
TOTAL ASSETS
Total assets at the end of the year 
were US$785.8m, up 8.4% or 
US$60.9m (2012: US$724.9m), 
primarily as a result of the increase in 
trade and other receivables and cash 
referred to above.

SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED 
STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
HIGHLIGHTS 
CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS
Cash generated from operations for 
the year was US$59.9m, up 19.8% or 
US$9.9m on 2012 levels. This is 
primarily attributable to higher 
profits coupled with outflows 
relating to working capital 
requirements having improved.
CASH FLOW USED IN INVESTING 
ACTIVITIES
Net cash used in investing activities 
amounted to US$1.6m mainly as a 
result of the purchase of plant and 
equipment amounting to US$4.9m, 
offset by interest received of 
US$4.0m. The corresponding figure 
from 2012 was a net usage of 
US$2.4m. 
CASH FLOW USED IN FINANCING 
ACTIVITIES
Net cash used in financing 
activities for the year was US$13.0m, 
mainly attributable to dividend 
payments in 2013 amounting to 
US$18.3m. The 2012 equivalent 
was cash used of US$37.8m, with 
the higher 2012 amount being 
primarily due to dividends paid to 
non-controlling interests. 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents 
amounted to US$242.8m at year-end, 
up US$13.0m or 5.7% on the 2012 
figure of US$229.8m. Net cash, 
consisting of gross cash (US$246.5m) 
less borrowings (US$17.3m) increased 
by US$6.5m or 2.9% to US$229.2m 
during the period. This increase is 
primarily due to a higher level of 
advance payments received from 
clients which stood at US$39.6m at 
period end up US$27.0m or by 214% 
in the period (2012: US$12.6m) and 
partly offset by additional working 
capital requirements on major 
projects including the labour 
related element of the increased 
level of TSS projects.

Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
INTRODUCTION FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND SENIOR 
INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
As a Jersey incorporated company with a premium listing 
on the London Stock Exchange, Kentz is required to 
report in adherence with the UK Corporate Governance 
code (the Code). The Board considers that applying best 
practice in corporate governance is integral to developing, 
maximising and maintaining the success of the Group and 
to achieving its long-term goals. It is therefore committed 
to the highest standards of corporate governance and to 
instilling in the Group the related principles on which it 
believes business should be based.
The Group strives to ensure that where practical, it 
adheres to the Code and regularly reviews its governance 
policies and procedures. 
The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills’ 
new governance framework for directors’ remuneration 
became binding on UK-registered companies from 
1 October 2013. Though a Jersey-registered company, 
Kentz will substantially follow the requirements of the 
regulations and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
adheres to the required format. There will be a binding 
shareholder vote on the Remuneration Policy.
The Board is committed to a culture that attracts 
and retains talented people to deliver outstanding 
performance and further enhance the success of the 
Group. In that culture, diversity across a range of criteria 
is valued, primarily in relation to skills, knowledge and 
experience and also in other criteria such as gender 
and ethnicity. The Board will continue to review the 
recommendations made by the Davies Report, 
particularly in light of succession and development.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE 
The Group is substantially compliant with the Code, 
except that the Chairman is non-independent because 
he is a significant shareholder in the Group. Nevertheless, 
his extensive knowledge and experience of the Company 
and his effective leadership of the Board are deemed 
important to the Group. 
The Chairman’s designated responsibilities do not 
include discussing governance and strategy with major 
shareholders – non-compliance with E.1.1. of the Code. This 
has been delegated to the Senior Independent Director 
(SID). Due to the Chairman’s non-independence, the 
Group feels it is more appropriate for the SID to meet with 
shareholders. That said, the Chairman is available to meet 
with shareholders at their request.
The Code is issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
and is available for review on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website: https://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/

Directors also have unrestricted access to members of Group senior management and a right to obtain independent

DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES 
There is a clear and formally documented division of responsibility between the roles of the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Senior Independent Director to ensure an appropriate balance of responsibility and accountability.
It is the Chairman’s responsibility to ensure the effective functioning of the Board, including the provision of accurate, 
timely and clear information in relation to the Group and its business. He chairs the Board meetings, ensures the 
agendas are appropriate and is responsible for facilitating that all Directors actively contribute to the determination  
of the Group’s strategy. The Chairman is also responsible for encouraging debate and constructive criticism, speaking 
and acting for the Board and representing the Board to shareholders. The Board is satisfied that he makes sufficient 
time available to serve the Group effectively.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day to day management of the Group and implementation of  
Group strategy, developing proposals for Board approval, and ensuring that a regular dialogue with shareholders  
is maintained.
The Senior Independent Director (SID) is responsible for providing support to the Chairman and acting as an 
intermediary between Directors when necessary. In addition, the SID is responsible for convening a meeting with

normal channels. 58

MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Articles of Association include provisions for dealing 
with Directors’ conflicts of interests under which Directors 
are required to notify the Company Secretary of such 
events as they arise so that they can be considered by the 
Board. A Director may not vote on or be counted in the 
quorum to vote on any contract, arrangement, transaction 
or proposal in which he is interested except those 
specifically permitted in article 61.3 of the Articles 
of Association.
Non-Executive Directors are also required to avoid any 
engagements with or instructions from other persons that 
might result in the creation of a conflict of interest. In the 
event such a situation has arisen, or is about to arise, the 
Non-Executive Director is required to notify the Board. If 
the Board decides that a conflict of interest has arisen, or 
may arise, the Non-Executive Director must immediately 
cease such activity or resign from the Board.
Directors are required to disclose any conflicts of 
interests at all Board and Committee meetings that may 
exist or appear to exist.
COMPANY SECRETARY

Ireland was appointed as the Company Secretary. BDO 
Ireland had previously been engaged as company 
secretarial advisors and David will now fulfil all the duties 
provided by BDO whilst retaining his position as a 
Partner with the firm. 
A Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and

outlining the dates of close periods is issued to Directors 
and employees by the investor relations team prior to each 
period’s commencement.

MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES
• Regularly review the structure, size and composition  
of the Board
• Succession planning for Directors and other senior 
executives
• Identify and nominate for the approval of the Board, 
candidates to fill Board vacancies as and when 
they arise
• Before any appointment is made by the Board, 
evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge, experience 
and diversity on the Board, and, in light of this 
evaluation prepare a description of the role and 
capabilities required for a particular appointment
• Ensure that on appointment to the Board, Non-Executive 
Directors receive a formal letter of appointment setting 
out clearly what is expected of them 
• Review the results of the Board performance 
evaluation process that relate to the composition of 
the Board
• Review annually the time required from Non-Executive 
Directors
• Recommend suitable candidates for the role of Senior 
Independent Director
• Make recommendations for Membership of the Board 
Committees
• Make recommendations for the reappointment of any 
Non-Executive Director at the conclusion of their 
specified term of office
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD
In 2013, the Committee considered the composition of 
the Board and recommends that no further appointments 
are required at this time. However, the Committee 
recommends that the Board should establish a pool 
of candidates for consideration for possible future 
appointment. This process is currently ongoing. 
DIVERSITY
The Board recognises the benefits of having diversity 
across all areas of the Group and believes that this adds 
to Kentz’s continued success and advantage. 
The Committee has sought to address the 
recommendations made by Lord Davies and following a 
comprehensive recruitment process, we are pleased to 
welcome Meg Lassarat to the Group who will succeed Ed 
Power upon his retirement as CFO.
The Board does not think it is appropriate or realistic to 
commit to achieving a given percentage of women on 
our Board by a certain date. Such a commitment would 
have implications for the continuing tenure and 
contribution of our existing Directors and could be 
prejudicial to the business. 
BOARD CHANGES
At the Annual General Meeting in May 2014, Ed Power, 
Chief Financial Officer will not seek re-election and will 
retire as Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer 
having reached his normal retirement date, from 29 May 
2014. Ed Power will be succeeded as Chief Financial 
Officer by Meg Lassarat.

RE-ELECTION
Under the Articles of Association, Directors of the Board 
are to submit for re-election every three years. Following 
a review of this position the Board have opted to comply 
with the Code in this matter and to offer themselves for 
re-election annually. At our Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) in May 2014, all Board members except Ed Power 
will retire, and being eligible, will offer themselves for 
re-election. Ed Power will not be seeking re-election and 
will retire at the AGM as Executive Director and Chief 
Financial Officer, having reached his normal retirement 
date, from 29 May 2014. 
INDEPENDENCE
The Board considers the independence of each of the 
Non-Executive Directors upon appointment and on an 
annual basis or at any other time when circumstances 
change. The Board is satisfied that its composition will 
ensure that no individual, or group of individuals, will 
dominate the decision-making process.
Following a review of the Board composition, the 
Company, in line with provisions B.1.1 of the Code, 
regards all of the current Non-Executive Directors to 
be independent within the meaning of “Independent” 
as defined in the Code. The Board considers that 
David Beldotti, Hans Kraus, Brendan Lyons and David 
MacFarlane are independent in character and judgement 
and free from relationships or circumstances that affect 
their judgement. In judging the independence of these 
individuals, the Board has taken account of the following:
• Independent Directors are not and have never been 
employees of the Group
• Independent Directors do not receive any 
remuneration from the Group other than Director fees, 
nor do they participate in the Company’s share option 
scheme, long-term incentive plan or the Company’s 
pension scheme
• Independent Directors do not have any close family 
ties with any of the Company’s advisors, Directors or 
senior employees
• Independent Directors do not have any shareholdings 
in the Company other than a nominal amount of shares
• Independent Directors do not have any links with other 
Directors through involvement in other companies
Although David Beldotti has been a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company since February 2003, he 
continues to meet all the above criteria to be considered 
independent. The Board considers his extensive experience 
and knowledge of the Company and industry to be 
invaluable to the Company’s success. The Company does 
not consider his longevity as a Director to be a determining 
factor in determining his independence.
The Board undertakes regular reviews to ensure that  
its composition is balanced and that its Directors have 
relevant industry and financial experience.
DEVELOPMENT
The Board considers it important that they keep 
abreast of changes to the regulatory framework, 
corporate governance code and best practice. Regular 
updates are provided to the Board at their quarterly 
meetings. In addition to the updates, in May 2013, the 
Board undertook a training programme from the Institute 
of Directors to provide an update on the role of the 
Company Director and the Board. This one day 
programme covered the following topics:
• Corporate Governance: update on changes in the 
Code and best practice and a self-assessment of the 
governance within Kentz 
• Corporate Legal and Regulatory Environment: UK 
listing regime, relationships with shareholders, 
Directors’ authority
• Board structure, operations and practice: purpose of 
the Board, meeting procedures, performance and 
evaluation, succession planning
• Director’s role: duties, distinction between executive 
and non-executive, conflicts of interest, market abuse
BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In 2013, each of the Directors completed a detailed 
questionnaire evaluating the performance of the 
Chairman, Board and Board Committees. Preparation of 
the questionnaire and collation of results was performed 
internally but independent of the Board. The results of 
this process was presented to the Board and discussed 
at the Board meeting in August 2013.
During 2014, the Board will undergo an external evaluation.

MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee shall carry out the following duties on 
behalf of the Board: 
• Monitor and provide oversight over risk projects and 
all risk related policies, risk management procedures 
and activities relating to projects and operations
• Review and approve all proposals of higher level 
projects prior to submission, and ensure that they go 
through a full assessment and risk evaluation. All risks 
are to be tabulated and either priced or excluded from 
the proposals
• Review at each meeting the schedule of corporate 
tender approvals and the schedule of all higher 
risk projects
• Review project risk management procedures of the 
Company and report to the Board on the results of 
their review. The Committee will make appropriate 
recommendations to the Board on all project risk 
management issues
• The Committee shall recommend to the Board the 
overall project risk management strategy of the 
Company and oversee the implementation and 
effective operation of that strategy, its policies 
and procedures
• The Committee shall satisfy itself that the key project 
risks of the Company are managed cost effectively 
and to an acceptable level, determine the priorities of 
project risk management activity and bring to the 
attention of the Board, the critical risks and 
recommendations 
During 2013, the Committee met three times during 
which they reviewed all highest risk projects on a 
quarterly basis. On each occasion, the Committee also 
reviewed the Company’s Enterprise Risk Register. This 
summarises and categorises the significant non-project 
risks facing the Company, the controls in place against 
each and any further actions planned. It was noted by the 
Committee that the overall financial risk to the 
Company’s balance sheet from higher level projects, is 
further reducing from prior financial years. 
In addition, the Committee also regularly reviews the 
Group’s risk management procedures and noted that 
current procedures were adequate for the operations of 
the business.
In addition to these meetings, the Committee also held 
conference calls during the year where members of the 
development group and business units presented 
specific project tenders which were deemed to attract a 
higher degree of risk. The Committee evaluated the level 
of risk involved in those project tenders and it approved 
the risk mitigation measures to be adopted in the tender 
submission and during execution of the projects.
The Committee also considered and approved the 
entering into joint venture/consortium relationships for 
specific projects and also recommended for signature to 
the Board those contracts that exceeded US$100m.

Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
I am pleased to introduce the Audit Committee report 
for 2013 and highlight our activities during the year. The 
overall role of the Audit Committee is to monitor the 
integrity of the reported financial performance of the 
Group, including its preliminary results announcement, 
Annual Report and Interim Report and to review the 
appropriateness of related accounting policies, material 
assumptions and significant judgements adopted in 
their preparation. 
A new key responsibility of the Committee is advising 
the Board on whether it believes the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
During 2013, the main activities of the Committee 
comprised the following:
• Review of the 2012 full-year and 2013 half-year 
financial statements
• Review of 2012 full-year and 2013 half-year results 
announcements made to the London Stock Exchange
• Approval of Company’s interim management 
statements
• Review of interim and final dividends for 
recommendation by the Board
• Continuous assessment of the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal control procedures

Governance code and the Company’s compliance 
against the Code
• Review of the additional disclosures required for the 
2013 Annual Report
• Appointment of PwC to perform due diligence 
of Valerus
At the request of the Board, the Committee considered 
whether the 2013 Annual Report was fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether it provided the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. The 
Committee was satisfied that, taken as a whole, the 
Annual Report was fair, balanced and understandable.
The Audit Committee met three times during the year at 
appropriate times in the reporting and audit cycle and 
otherwise as required. During some of those meetings, 
other members of the Board and key management were 
invited to attend meetings when appropriate and the 
Group’s external auditor is invited to attend meetings of 
the Audit Committee on a regular basis.

Group’s internal financial controls
• Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal audit function
• Making recommendations to the Board on the

ANNUAL REPORT REVIEW PROCESS
In reviewing the Annual Report, the Audit Committee’s 
focus was on ensuring the description of the business, and 
the discussion of the business and financial performance, 
agreed with our own understanding; and was consistent 
with information presented through the year, with 
appropriate weight given to good and bad news.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Directors are responsible for establishing, 
maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control systems. These systems are 
designed to manage, but not necessarily eliminate, the 
risks to the Group. They provide reasonable but not 
complete assurance against material loss or 
misstatement, including that from fraud.
The internal control systems are reviewed by the Board on 
a regular basis. Throughout the year, senior management 
provide the Board with related reports to assist them with 
this review.
The Group has a clear management structure with 
defined lines of responsibility and clear delegation of 
authority. A key element of the overall control function is 
directed by the Management Executive Committee, 
comprising the key senior executives of the Company.
The Management Executive Committee met seven times 
in 2013 and its main focus and responsibilities were:
• Overseeing the Safety Leadership Charter
• Developing, proposing and implementing Group 
strategy as directed by the Board
• Carrying out formalised risk reviews on selected 
projects throughout the Group
• Reviewing Group financial results, annual budgets and 
forecasts on a regular basis
• Ensuring appropriate guidance is given to analysts
• Planning news/project announcements
• Reviewing Group backlog position across the Group
The Chief Executive Officer reports at each Board 
meeting on the Group operational environment and 
activities of the Management Executive Committee.
INTERNAL AUDIT
Internal Audit and compliance monitoring work is carried 
out by the Group Internal Audit Manager and Group 
Compliance Officer, supported by independent specialist 
consultants as required. The Group Internal Audit Manager 
reports to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
works closely with the Chief Financial Officer to ensure 
direct and transparent communication around all internal 
audit activity. 
During 2013, the Internal Audit Manager attended all 
Audit Committee meetings to provide the Committee 
with updates on the work of the Internal Audit function 
and their key findings. 
The Audit Committee reviews the activities of the Internal 
Audit function, questioning their review findings and 
highlighting any areas of concern they may have. 
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ISSUES
The Audit Committee assesses whether: 
• suitable accounting policies have been adopted 
• management have made appropriate estimates and 
judgements
• applicable accounting standards have been followed 
The Committee reviews accounting papers prepared by 
management which provide details on the main financial 
reporting judgements.
The Audit Committee reviews quarterly finance and 
internal audit reports in addition to the reports by 
external auditors prior to the issue of the half and full year 
financial results. 
The primary areas of financial reporting judgement  
and disclosure which were considered by the Audit 
Committee in relation to the 2013 financial statements 
and how they were addressed are set out below:
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT ACCOUNTING
The percentage of completion method adopted by the 
Group requires management to make certain judgements 
regarding the recoverability of unapproved variation 
orders and claims and to estimate the cost to completion 
beyond the reporting date. 
In general, revenue recognition and contract accounting 
on certain key contracts, is the main area of focus for 
the Audit Committee, when reviewing the Group’s 
financial reporting.
Specifically, with regards to the Medupi project in South 
Africa there have been delays in civil works executed by 
others and by widespread industrial unrest. In addition, 
disputes have arisen in relation to changes introduced by 
the Project Labour Agreement and interpretation of 
certain aspects of the technical specification.  64
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
Extension of time and other contractual claims were 
prepared in relation to the above matters and were 
progressively submitted to the client. Where appropriate 
these claims were compiled with support from legal, 
technical and forensic planning resources. These claims 
are currently at various stages of adjudication, arbitration, 
negotiation or further review. 
While some of the claims are settled and paid, as of 
31 December 2013, a material amount of value had not 
been agreed with the client and accordingly the Group’s 
management team have exercised their judgement on 
the amount of the claims to be recognised in contract 
revenue assessing the probability that the claim will be 
accepted. The approach taken to this assessment is 
consistent with the Group’s profit recognition policy.  
The Committee has reviewed the claims recognised  
and concur with management’s assessment thereof.
The Committee has reviewed the internal revenue and 
profit recognition policies and are satisfied that adequate 
controls exist to ensure fair disclosure. It also reviewed 
the work carried by the risk review committee that 
reviews all major and high risk projects including every 
quarter to ensure unapproved variations, claims and 
costs to completion that have been recognised are 
reasonable and achievable. 
BEE ACCOUNTING
Accounting for the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) 
Initiative in South Africa: From 2 April 2013, Kentz entered 
into a shareholders’ agreement with Medu Holdings (Pty) 
Limited (Medu) as the new BEE partner. An accounting 
consequence of the BEE transaction is that an income 
statement charge is required to be recognised in 
accordance with IFRS 2: Share Based Payment 
representing the difference between the fair value of the 
BEE shareholding and the consideration received from 
Medu. Kentz engaged professional advisors to perform 
an IFRS 2 valuation as at 31 December 2012 for this 
purpose and an income statement charge of US$2.3m 
has been recognised in the 2013 results.
The Committee constructively challenged assumptions 
used to support the fair value of the BEE shareholding 
and considered input received from the external auditors. 
The Committee is satisfied that the approach followed 
and key conclusions are appropriate.
PENSION DISCLOSURES AND KEY ASSUMPTIONS
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme. 
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation in respect 
of this scheme is performed by independent actuaries.
 
The Committee recognises that the present value of 
the pension obligations is dependent on a number of 
factors determined on an actuarial basis using a number 
of financial assumptions. The key assumptions in this 
calculation are the discount rate, salary inflation and 
mortality assumptions. Any changes in these assumptions 
will impact on the carrying amount of the pension 
obligation. The Committee assessed the estimated impact 
on the defined benefit plan valuation resulting from 
changes to these key assumptions.
In the audit plan presented to the Committee by the 
external auditor, this was noted as a risk area. We discussed 
the assumptions used in the pension plan valuations with 
the external auditor.
Following discussions with management and the external 
auditor the Committee is satisfied that the accounting 
treatment adopted and disclosures in the notes to the 
financial statements in relation to the defined benefit 
pension scheme operated by the Group are appropriate.
 
Further detail on the defined benefit pension scheme is 
given in note 27 to the financial statements.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The Audit Committee has put in place a policy relating 
to the provision of non-audit services by the Group’s 
external auditors. The award of non-audit services is 
subject to the Group’s standard procurement procedures 
relating to the use of consultants. 
The policy outlines:
• The circumstances in which the Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO) may engage the external auditors to provide 
non-audit services without the prior approval of the 
Audit Committee
• The circumstances in which the CFO must obtain prior 
approval from the Audit Committee to engage the 
external auditors to provide non-audit services
• The services that are prohibited from being performed 
by the external auditors 
The Audit Committee decided to change the policy on 
engagement of external auditors when conducting audits 
on businesses to be acquired or sold and due diligence 
of potential acquisitions whereby these appointments 
should be reserved as a matter for the Audit Committee, 
rather than the Chief Financial Officer.  Strategic

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXTERNAL AUDIT PROCESS
At the meeting held in May 2013, the Committee 
reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit process. 
This review consisted of:
• Completion of a survey by the finance managers of 
each subsidiary within the Group to determine their 
assessment of the audit process
• An assessment performed by Group finance of the 
audit process and their overall view of the external 
auditors and the audit process
• Completion of a survey by the Audit Committee 
• A meeting between the Audit Committee and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in the absence of 
management
Following this review and discussion of its results, the 
Audit Committee agreed to recommend to the Board the 
reappointment of the external auditors.
ROTATION OF AUDITORS
While the Group does not consider it necessary to have a 
formal requirement for rotation of external auditors, it has 
taken guidance from the Code which states that all FTSE 
350 Companies should put the external audit contract 
out to tender at least every ten years. The Committee has 
introduced a policy under which every three years it will 
consider the appropriateness of putting the external 
audit out to tender and will inform the shareholders of 
their decision.
The Group also has a policy on the rotation of audit 
partners. This policy requires the lead partner to 
change after a maximum period of five years and all 
other partners including the review partner to rotate after 
a maximum period of seven years.
UK BRIBERY ACT 2010
The new UK Bribery Act came into force in July 2011. No 
Kentz employee may take part in or condone any bribery 
or other corruption. The use of improper payments to 
gain advantage is never acceptable. All Kentz employees 
must act with integrity at all times, comply with the 
bribery and corruption laws of the country in which they 
are operating and not induce or facilitate someone else 
to break such laws. They must not make or receive 
improper payments either directly or indirectly through 
third parties.
During 2013, as part of Kentz’s adherence to the UK 
Bribery Act, 1,090 employees throughout the Group 
completed an on-line training programme along with a 
competency test which covered Trust and reputation; 
Laws and offences; and Policies and procedures. 
CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT
The Group continues to maintain and build on our 
already well-established high standards of business 
conduct and ethics and implemented a Code of Business 
Conduct in 2011 which formalised all of the important 
behaviours expected of Group employees.
The Code of Business Conduct sets out to ensure 
that at every level of the organisation, at all times, all 
employees conduct through their own actions, their 
dealings internally and with third parties with the highest 
standards of honesty, integrity and fairness and foster 
an environment based on such standards, as well as 
complying with all related legislation within the countries 
in which they operate. The Group has its own internal 
procedures for monitoring compliance set out in its Code 
of Business Conduct, but also relies on its employees and 
external bodies “speaking up” where they become aware 
of actual or potential breaches of it. Speaking up relates to 
the disclosure of information by an employee or external 
body if they have a genuine concern about malpractice 
anywhere in the Group, such as instances of contravention 
of internal policies and legal and ethical standards, 
including activities or inactivities that put at risk the health 
and safety of Group employees or others, breaches of any 
environmental or regulatory requirements, bribery and 
corruption, false accounting, fraud and failure to comply 
with a legal obligation or a deliberate concealment of 
information relating to any of the above.
During 2013, a review of the Kentz speak-up policy was 
conducted and a comparison to best practice and peer 
companies was made. The only weakness identified was 
that Kentz does not have a dedicated reporting hotline.
However, it was noted that most peer companies also did 
not have such a hotline and that Kentz had adequate 
communication channels appropriate for the speak-up 
policy. It was agreed that the speak-up policy is currently 
sufficient for the Group. 
The Code of Business Conduct can be found on the 
Kentz website www.kentz.com. 66
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
REMUNERATION REPORT
OVERVIEW OF EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES
We have based Kentz’s executive remuneration policy on 
the principle that it should encourage, reinforce and reward 
the delivery of sustainable shareholder value. We believe 
that the application of the principle has helped to drive our 
exceptional performance.
In determining the Company’s remuneration policy, 
the Remuneration Committee takes into account the 
external competitive environment, the Company’s short 
and medium-term strategic objectives, shareholder 
expectations and best practice. We are conscious that 
Kentz operates in a very competitive talent market in which 
recruiting and retaining people in key leadership positions, 
particularly in the US, is challenging. However, we believe 
that we continue to be successful in hiring and retaining 
the people who will continue to execute our strategy and 
to drive growth that meets shareholder expectations.  
Executive Directors’ compensation comprises base salary 
and benefits, a short-term cash incentive based on annual 
performance, and a long-term incentive comprising equity 
awards, vesting after a three year period. The Committee 
seeks to ensure that there should be an appropriate 
balance between fixed pay and performance-related pay 
and that both should be configured to realise the aim of 
driving long-term shareholder value.
PERFORMANCE DURING 2013
The Company’s performance in 2013, outlined elsewhere 
in this Annual Report, was excellent. In financial terms, 
revenue, profit*, earnings* and backlog all increased 
substantially. The share price increased by over 60% 
during the year and the proposed dividend is 21% higher 
than that paid for 2012. 
The Company’s safety record, already good, improved 
further and a major strategic objective was realised with 
the acquisition of Valerus on 3 January 2014. 
Short-term incentive (STI) payments under the 
Company’s remuneration policy are based on 
performance under these headings and the detailed 
payments are shown in the Report section.
No long-term incentive plan (LTIP) awards vested during 
the year.
CHANGING APPROACH TO DISCLOSURE AND VOTING
The regulatory landscape in the UK has evolved and we 
have increased disclosure in our Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. Although the new UK disclosure regime does not 
bind Jersey-incorporated companies, Kentz’s policy is to 
align ourselves with best practice as described in 
guidelines issued by UK institutional investors and to 
follow substantially the provisions on disclosure contained 
in The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports)(Amendment) Regulations 2013.

Dear Shareholders,
This is our first report prepared 
under the new reporting 
regulations. We have arranged it in 
three parts: Chairman’s statement, 
the Director’s Remuneration Policy, 
which is subject to shareholder 
approval, and our Annual Report 
on Remuneration.

As already mentioned, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report is in three separate sections: this annual statement 
by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, a 
policy section and an annual report on remuneration. 
Shareholders will be given the opportunity to vote on the 
policy and on its implementation by way of ordinary 
resolutions at the 2014 AGM.
KEY REMUNERATION CHANGES FOR 2014
While our past performance is outstanding, we continue 
to look to the future. One of the greatest challenges to 
our growing, and now substantially larger, organisation is 
attracting executives to manage and grow the business; 
and the retention of our current executives and employees. 
Accordingly, we will continue our retention and market 
benchmarking exercises to ensure that Kentz is offering 
remuneration packages to Executive Directors and senior 
management that are at an appropriate level to attract, 
retain and motivate staff. The changes we plan include 
deepening and broadening long-term incentive 
participation throughout the Group.
The Committee reviewed executive remuneration policy 
and determined upon the following changes effective for 
the 2014 financial year:
• To align Kentz further with UK best practice, the 
annual long-term incentive awards granted to 
Executive Directors will be 100% performance-based. 
Contingent share awards, which constituted 50% of 
the award in 2013, will no longer be awarded to 
Executive Directors, other than in recruitment 
situations where the Remuneration Committee 
considers it appropriate and necessary to do so.
• A clawback arrangement has been put in place  
for the first time for an element of the short-term 
incentive bonus.
• Long-term incentive (LTI) measures were reviewed 
with Towers Watson. It was concluded that the 
measures of Return on Equity (RoE) and Earnings  
Per Share (EPS) were still relevant and appropriate  
for 2014 to drive shareholder value, and will not  
be modified.
• The Remuneration Committee will continue to review 
the executive remuneration policy during 2014 and 
continue to move to a position where overall packages 
and levels of disclosure are aligned with those required 
of UK-listed and registered companies.
• A benchmark study led to a rebalancing of the CEO 
package (38% base salary increase in 2013) to reflect 
both the US and UK market norms. Executive 
Directors received an annual cost of living base pay 
adjustment (3% CEO and 3.5% CFO) for 2014, 
consistent with our Company’s pay practice.
The Remuneration Committee considers it essential to 
ensure that our Executive Director pay arrangements are 
fully aligned with our ambitions for the Group which are 
sustainable growth and the maximisation of shareholder 
value. As the Company’s business grows in size and 
complexity, we need to ensure that Executive Director 
and senior staff remuneration levels remain competitive 
and appropriate to the Company.
We have a clear commitment to governance and 
shareholder engagement so that our Executive Director 
pay is in line with the Company’s needs, reflects the views 
of our shareholders and meets the requirements of good 
corporate governance. We offered consultations on 
remuneration matters to our larger shareholders during 
the year. Together with the Senior Independent Director, 
I met those shareholders who took up our offer and, 
hopefully, this report also reflects our discussions with 
them. We look forward to a continuing dialogue with our 
shareholders on the remuneration of our Directors and 
welcome your continued support.
Yours sincerely,
Brendan Lyons

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The table below sets out Kentz’s proposed remuneration policy for Directors. The description that follows sets out the 
policy that is subject to shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM. It is intended that, if approved, the policy will take 
effect from that date.
POLICY TABLE ON REMUNERATION PAYMENTS
Purpose Operation Maximum opportunity Performance Conditions
EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS
Base salary • To ensure that Kentz can 
attract and retain the very 
best talent.
• Base salary levels reflect 
the complexity and 
responsibilities of the role.
• Normally reviewed by the 
Remuneration Committee 
annually on 1 January.
• Paid in cash.
• Base salary increases to 
Executive Directors are 
generally within the 
guidelines for the wider 
employee population in 
the Company’s most 
significant locations 
globally. However, as the 
Committee also considers 
the role and value of the 
individual as well as market 
competitiveness, there 
could be instances where it 
is appropriate to award an 
increase to an Executive 
Director which was above 
the guidelines for the 
wider population. In such a 
case, the rationale would 
be fully explained.
• Base packages reflect 
the Remuneration 
Committee’s assessment 
of the appropriate level of 
base salary for each 
executive position.
• The Committee takes 
broad account of 
competitive pay levels in 
the industry, as well as an 
individual’s performance, 
level of responsibility, 
criticality and value to 
the business.
• Base salaries for Executive 
Directors are positioned 
around the market median 
of similar-sized UK and US 
peer group companies on 
a weighted basis.
Other benefits • To ensure that Kentz can 
attract and retain the very 
best talent.
• Aligned with market 
standard, role and 
geographical location. 
• The Company’s policy is to 
provide Executive 
Directors with private 
medical insurance, life 
insurance and a company 
car allowance. 
• Executive Directors may 
be entitled to a housing 
allowance, depending on 
their geographical 
location. 
• The Committee retains 
discretion to pay additional 
benefits in exceptional 
situations, for example if 
there is a significant 
change in the individual’s 
circumstances, if there is 
an increase in the cost of 
an existing benefit which is 
out of the Company’s 
control or if there is a 
change in one of the 
benefit providers.
• None.
Pension • To ensure that Kentz can 
attract and retain the very 
best talent.
• Aligned with market 
standard, role and 
geographical location.
• Executive Directors are 
eligible to participate in the 
Company pension scheme 
and the Company makes a 
contribution based on the 
scheme rules. (CFO equal 
to 10% of base salary and 
CEO 7% of base salary).
• None.

Purpose Operation Maximum opportunity Performance Conditions
Annual bonus • The purpose of the 
short-term incentive plan is 
to:
–   P r o v i d e s i g n i fi c a n t 
incentive compensation 
opportunities to certain 
senior managers.
–   To reward participants 
based on the 
performance of Kentz 
measured against certain 
targets.
–  Align participants’ 
interests with the 
financial performance, 
safety performance and 
strategic plans of the 
Company.
–  Recruit and retain a 
motivated and 
committed “Core Group” 
of employees in 
management positions 
who can materially 
influence the success  
of Kentz.
• The annual bonus is paid in 
cash following the 
approval of the full year 
results.
• For any bonus to be paid, a 
minimum level of Company 
financial performance 
must be achieved.
• Annual bonus payouts are 
subject to a minimum 
pay-out threshold of 80% 
of Group Budgeted Profit 
Before Tax (PBT) – i.e. if 
actual Group PBT is less 
than 80% of budgeted 
Group PBT then no bonus 
pay-out will occur. If actual 
Group PBT is equal to or 
greater than 80% of 
budgeted PBT the profit 
performance metric will be 
calculated by dividing the 
actual PBT by the 
budgeted PBT but subject 
also to the Company’s 
overall maximum pay-out 
limit. The total Group 
bonus pool, including the 
cost of all incentive awards 
to all Directors and 
employees may not 
exceed 20% of Group PBT. 
• These criteria will be set by 
reference to the 
Company’s financial 
budget and prior year 
actual financial results. 
• The target range will be set 
to ensure that stretch 
bonuses are paid only for 
significantly exceeding 
market expectations. The 
Remuneration Committee 
considers that the setting 
and attainment of these 
targets is important to the 
achievement of the 
Company’s longer-term 
strategic goals.
• The CEO and CFO’s 
Annual Incentives will be 
based on execution of 
strategy, financial 
measures, safety 
objectives and personal 
objectives. Financial 
metrics include key 
performance indicators 
such as PBT, order intake 
and cash flow. 
• Actual performance 
targets and measures (to 
the extent not already 
disclosed) will be disclosed 
after the relevant 
performance period has 
ended, provided that they 
are not considered to be 
commercially sensitive.
• Claw-back for element  
of STI, dependent on 
specified conditions  
being met.
Long-term 
incentive (LTI) 
plan
• Long-term incentives to 
help build and deliver 
shareholder value.
• Provide retention incentive 
for Executive Directors.
• Executive Directors are 
eligible to receive annual 
allocations of performance 
share awards.
• Generally, three year 
vesting period.
• Executive Directors and 
senior managers are 
eligible to receive an award 
with a face value capped 
at 200% of base salary on 
an annual basis.
• From 2014, LTI awards will 
be subject to two 
performance measures. 
• 50% of the initial face value 
of the award will be linked 
to the satisfaction of an 
EPS test. 
• The other 50% of will be 
linked to the satisfaction of 
internal return on equity 
goals. 
• Actual performance 
targets and measures (to 
the extent not already 
disclosed) will be disclosed 
after the relevant 
performance period has 
ended provided that they 
are not considered to be 
commercially sensitive. 
• Under both measures, no 
vesting will occur for 
performance below the 
stated threshold.
• Materially inaccurate 
reporting or statements 
are regarded as a 
misconduct event and 
would result in all unvested 
long-term incentive awards 
lapsing immediately. 70

Purpose Operation Maximum opportunity Performance Conditions
Employee 
Share Option 
Scheme
• Kentz operates an 
equity-settled share-based 
remuneration scheme for 
senior management.
• No awards have been 
made to Executive 
Directors under this 
scheme in 2012 or 2013.
• Three year vesting period.
• Dormant plan. • Share options granted in 
previous years have been 
subject to an EPS 
performance condition.
Recruitment 
and 
promotion 
arrangements
• To allow Kentz to recruit 
and promote high-calibre 
executives.
• To enable the recruitment 
of the right candidate at 
the right time to execute 
the Company’s strategy by 
compensating for loss of 
awards from previous 
employer.
• Salary set at a level that 
reflects the complexity 
and responsibilities of the 
role and takes into account 
personal attributes and 
market forces.
• For external appointments 
the Remuneration 
Committee may offer 
additional cash/share-
based elements where 
they consider it is in the 
best interests of the 
Company (and therefore 
shareholders). Such 
payments would generally 
take account of 
remuneration relinquished 
when leaving the former 
employer may generally 
reflect the nature, time 
horizons and performance 
requirements attaching to 
that remuneration. Full 
details on any such 
payments would be 
announced to shareholders 
on appointment for any 
persons discharging 
managerial responsibilities.
• For appointment of an 
internal candidate to a 
Board position, any 
variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the 
prior role may be allowed 
to pay out according to its 
terms, adjusted as relevant 
to take account of 
appointment. In addition, 
any ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to 
appointment may continue 
in place, to the extent they 
are inconsistent with the 
policy outlined above, 
provided that they are put 
to shareholders for 
approval at the earliest 
opportunity.
• Maximum value 
determined by reference 
to the policy in relation to 
each element of pay 
outlined in normal 
remuneration policy.
• In truly unforeseen and 
exceptional circumstances, 
the Remuneration 
Committee retains the 
discretion to make one-off 
payments which might not 
otherwise be covered in 
the normal remuneration.
• Maximum total of 
incentives in a given year 
may not exceed five times 
base salary.
• Performance and 
employment conditions to 
be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee 
at time of award.
Retention 
arrangements
• To allow Kentz to retain 
high calibre executives.
• The Remuneration 
Committee may make 
one-off awards to 
Executive Directors in 
exceptional circumstances, 
e.g., in the instance of an 
acute retention risk, but 
only when in the best 
interests of the Company 
and shareholders. Any 
awards would be subject 
to continued employment/ 
performance conditions, as 
appropriate.
• The size of the award is not 
pre-determined.
• Performance and 
employment conditions to 
be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee 
at time of award.

NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE
WHY PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE CHOSEN AND HOW TARGETS ARE SET
Executive Directors will be incentivised according to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
The overall short-term incentive range for pay-out (Threshold to Stretch) reflects the level of stretch built into the 
annual budget approved by the Board of Directors. Threshold level metrics are aligned with market expectations and 
Kentz’s incentive policy.
ANNUAL BONUS
The performance targets are typically set to the most relevant metrics to deliver shareholder value for the year ahead, 
taking account of Company strategy, industry cycle and peer groups. The performance measures used for the annual 
bonus plan have been selected by the Committee to support the performance against plan and aligned to the 
strategic direction of the Company.
Each year the Remuneration Committee will establish the financial performance criteria for the forthcoming year. 
The metrics and weightings used to calculate the bonuses for 2013 are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
below. Some changes will be applied to the performance measures and weightings for 2014. However, they will not 
differ markedly from those used for 2013. The performance of Executive Directors against targets and the metrics and 
weightings used to measure their performance will be published in the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 72
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
Performance vesting targets are set based on a sliding scale that takes account of relevant commercial factors. Only 
modest rewards are available for delivering threshold performance levels with maximum rewards requiring substantial 
out-performance of our challenging plans.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE
Earnings per share (EPS) and Return on Equity (RoE) have been selected by the Committee for the following purposes: 
EPS is commonly understood by investors as rewarding management for sustained performance improvement; RoE will 
reflect performance against internal goals rather than a relative test against a peer group and will be based on a balance 
of investor expectations and execution of the business plan.

CHANGE OF CONTROL AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT PROVISIONS IN LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AND SERVICE CONTRACTS
The rules of the LTIP provide that if any person obtains control of the Company, all outstanding unvested LTIP awards 
will vest immediately to the extent that performance conditions are satisfied and pro-rated to the extent that the 
vesting period for each outstanding award has been completed at that time – unless the Remuneration Committee 
otherwise determines. The rules of the LTIP also provide that, on termination of employment, all outstanding unvested 
LTIP awards normally lapse immediately (other than in certain “good leaver” circumstances, where the Remuneration 
Committee may waive pro-rating for performance and time).
The Remuneration Committee notes that certain historic practices (implemented in the service agreements of nine 
US-based senior individuals, including the CEO) fall outside its discretionary powers, under the rules of the LTIP. These 
practices provide that in the event of a change of control, all LTIP awards held by the individual will vest in full. The 
CEO’s service agreement also provides that his LTIP awards vest in full (subject to satisfaction of performance 
conditions, where applicable) if his employment is terminated by Kentz. 
These historic practices were considered to be necessary by the Remuneration Committee on recruitment of US-based 
executives who were entitled to similar terms under their former US employment contracts. During negotiations, it was 
established that removal of these terms would have precluded the recruitment of these US-based executives. 
No amendments are planned to be made to the rules of the LTIP or the relevant service agreements. However, future 
service agreements for new recruits will not provide for full vesting on change of control.
POLICY ON PAYMENT TO DIRECTORS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE (INCLUDING CHANGE OF CONTROL)
The Remuneration Committee’s approach to exit payments is to take account of the relevant circumstances (including 
the reason for termination), individual performance and the terms of the relevant remuneration documents (such as 
service contracts and incentive plan rules).
LOSS OF OFFICE
Element Contractual position/policy Details
Salary and pension Executive Directors (CEO & CFO) are generally entitled to up to 12 
and 6 months’ salary, pension contributions and holiday 
entitlement respectively. 
However, in specified scenarios as set out in the Director’s service 
contract (e.g. insolvency, prohibition by law from being a director, 
serious misconduct or breach of obligations), no payments are 
due.
Payable in phased instalments or as a 
lump sum.
Non-cash benefits will continue to be 
provided during the notice period.
Annual bonus Executive Directors forfeit all rights to participate in the annual 
bonus plan and to receive any bonus relating to prior service if 
their employment ends (or they are under notice of termination of 
employment) before the bonus payment is made, other than in 
“good leaver” circumstances when bonus is paid to the extent 
determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
The following reasons are “good leaver” 
circumstances for the purposes of the 
annual bonus:
• injury, disability, or ill-health
• retirement
• sale of business
• death; or
• redundancy
Awards granted under 
the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan 
If an Executive Director’s employment ends, outstanding unvested 
awards normally lapse. If the Executive Director is a “good leaver”, 
outstanding awards will vest immediately or, where the awards are 
subject to performance conditions, at the end of the performance 
period. Unless, the Remuneration Committee decides otherwise, 
awards will vest to the extent that:
(i) Any performance conditions are satisfied; and/or
(ii)  The vesting period for each outstanding award has been 
completed at the time when employment ceases.
On change of control, vesting is subject to satisfaction of 
performance conditions and time pro-rating and the Remuneration 
Committee may decide that awards will vest to a greater extent.
The following reasons are “good leaver” 
circumstances for the purposes of the 
LTIP:
• death;
• redundancy;
• ill-health, injury or disability;
• retirement;
• sale of business; or
• any other reason as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee
One-off awards (for 
example linked to 
buy-outs or recruitment)
On a change of control, LTIP awards vest subject to satisfaction of 
performance conditions and time pro rating. The Remuneration 
Committee may waive or vary the performance conditions and/or 
may dis-apply the time pro-rating.
None.
Fees and benefits for the 
Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors
No compensation is payable in the event of early termination. None. 74
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
CONSIDERATIONS OF CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP IN DEVELOPING POLICY
The Remuneration Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Company 
employees when determining Executive Directors’ remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases. 
The Remuneration Committee will also obtain information on the remuneration paid for comparable roles at other 
peer group companies to provide a point of reference for determining remuneration policy.
Kentz has a short-term incentive scheme for management to:
• Provide significant incentive compensation opportunities to certain key managers. 
• Reward Participants based on the performance of Kentz measured against certain targets.
• Align Participants’ interests with the financial performance, safety performance and strategic plans of the Company.
• Recruit and retain in management positions a motivated and committed “Core Group” of employees who can 
materially influence the success of Kentz.
Kentz offers discretionary long-term incentive plans to senior managers who are in positions to impact materially the 
success of the Company. Participation engages Senior Management in the long-term business goals; thereby aligning 
the interests of shareholders, Executive Directors and senior management.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Neither of the Executive Directors serves as a Non-Executive Director of any other quoted companies.
POLICY FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, but their terms of service are set out in a letter of 
appointment. This stipulates, inter alia, that a Non-Executive Director may resign at any time, or have their services 
terminated either by the Company giving notice, or by shareholders refusing to re-elect them. Appointment may be 
terminated by each party giving one month’s notice in writing. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate 
in any of the Company’s share incentive arrangements and are also not eligible to participate in the Company  
pension scheme.
None of the Non-Executive Directors is entitled to receive compensation for loss of office at any time.
Under the Articles of Association, Directors of the Board are to submit for re-election every three years. Following a 
review of this position the Board have opted to comply with the Code in this matter and to offer themselves for 
re-election annually.

that it is able to provide independent and impartial advice. Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Group (which oversees the voluntary code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in 
the United Kingdom) and the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice provided on executive remuneration 
is objective and independent and that no conflict of interest arises as a result of other services. Simmons & Simmons LLP, 
an international law firm, also advises in respect of the operation of the Group’s share plans. The Committee also received 
advice and input from management. No executives were involved in discussions relating to their own remuneration.

VARIABLE ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION
ANNUAL BONUS PAY-OUTS IN RESPECT OF 2013 PERFORMANCE
The Remuneration Committee established and agreed with the Executive Directors the parameters for performance-
based awards for 2013. The metrics encompassed Strategy, Safety, Sustainability and Profit. 
The maximum bonus opportunity available to the CEO in 2013 was US$1,500,000 (120% of target bonus). The 
Remuneration Committee determined that, based on the achievements of targets, the CEO achieved targets that 
merited payment of 116.54% of the target bonus (US$1,456,750). 
In addition, the Remuneration Committee awarded the CEO a one-off bonus of US$500,000 following the 
announcement of the successful completion of the Class I transaction in acquiring Valerus Field Solutions. The 
purposes of this payment include recognition of exceptional performance in executing the strategic acquisition; the 
step-increase in the size of the Company; and motivation to ensure the acquisition is successful. The bonus is subject 
to full claw back if the financial performance of the Valerus business in 2014 does not meet a minimum EBITDA 
threshold and to proportional claw back if the EBITDA is above that minimum, but below a targeted amount. 
 
The target bonus opportunity for the CFO was set at a target level of €500,000 and could range up to 130% of that 
figure. Based on the CFO’s achievements, the Remuneration Committee has determined that the CFO achieved 
targets that merited payment of 119.21% of the target bonus.
The detailed metrics used in calculating the bonuses are set out below.

LTIP AWARDS VESTING IN 2013
No LTIP awards were due to vest in 2013.
For wider reference, the share option awards granted in 2009 to Hugh O’Donnell and Ed Power vested on the 1 July 
2012. The share price at vesting was Stg£3.800 and the exercise price was Stg£1.545. The performance period was set 
from 1 July 2009 to 1 July 2012. Overall, 100% of the shares vested.
LTIP AWARDS GRANTED IN 2013
The Remuneration Committee decided to increase the performance-related element of equity awards for Executive 
Directors in 2013 so that 50% of awards were conditional on the satisfaction of performance conditions, compared to 
30% in 2012. A second performance measure, Return on Equity (RoE), was introduced in 2013 alongside the earnings 
per share (EPS) measure. The Committee also reviewed and amended the basis upon which the EPS test is operated 
for awards made in 2013 as described in the table below.
On 16 January 2013, 50% of the 2012 share awards were granted to the Executive Directors pursuant to the Company’s 
LTIP. This award constituted the contingent element of the total share award to Executive Directors. The share awards 
have been granted on a conditional basis and no shareholder rights will be conferred upon the grantee until the 
awards have vested. In order to satisfy the vesting conditions, the continued employment of the Executive Directors 
over the three year vesting period is required. 
The remaining 50% of the share awards were granted pursuant to the Company’s LTIP in the form of performance 
shares to the Executive Directors in April 2013.

LTIP AWARDS FOR 2014
LTIP performance awards are not linked to annual budget performance but at the level set by the Remuneration 
Committee consistent with the strategic plan. Award levels for Executive Directors are in line with market data and 
calibrated to deliver the operating plan.
Awards are determined as a percentage of base salary, with the 2014 award being 115% of base salary for the CEO and 
100% of base salary for the CFO. 100% of the LTIP awards in respect of the 2013 performance year will be granted in 
the form of performance share awards to the Executive Directors in April 2014. 
Vesting of 50% of the initial face value of the award will be linked to the satisfaction of the revised EPS test. 25% of this 
portion of the award will vest if the average compound EPS growth over three years is equivalent to the median 
growth in a basket of ten international peers. Full vesting will occur for performance equal to, or in excess of the upper 
quartile with performance between these points vesting on a straight line basis.
Vesting of 50% of the initial face value of the award will be linked to the satisfaction of internal return on equity goals. 
25% of this portion of the award will vest for three year average return on equity of 25% rising to full vesting for 
average return on equity of 30%. Straight line vesting will occur between these points.
Under both measures no vesting will occur for performance below the stated threshold.
Materially inaccurate reporting of financial statements are regarded as a misconduct event and would result in all 
unvested long-term incentive awards lapsing immediately.

LOSS OF OFFICE PAYMENTS
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS
No payments (including payments for loss of office) were made to former directors in respect of their former positions 
as Directors.

2012 under which he is employed to provide exclusive advisory services to the Group. On 18 January 2012, the 
Remuneration Committee approved that Hugh O’Donnell’s LTIP awards outstanding at that date would continue to 
vest while the strategic advisory agreement remains in effect.
Datuk Hassan Abas was appointed as Chairman of Kentz South Africa Pty Ltd on 01 July 2012. He continues to act in

notified of the following disclosable interests of 3% or 
more of its issued share capital.
Note: all interests disclosed to the Group in accordance with DTR5 that have 
occurred since 28 February 2014 can be found on the website.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
In accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules of the United Kingdom’s Financial Services 
Authority, the Directors are required to give a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. 
These are addressed in the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties outlined on pages 38 to 41.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors confirm that it is appropriate to apply 
the going concern concept in preparing the Financial 
Statements of the Group. In forming this view, the 
Directors have reviewed the Group’s budgets and 
projections, and have satisfied themselves that the 
Group is in a sound financial position.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
During the year, the UK Government introduced a 
requirement that UK listed companies should report their 
global levels of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in their 
annual report and accounts. 
The mandatory requirement is for disclosure of Scope 
One and Two only (direct emissions, e.g. heating, cooling, 
transport fuel and indirect emissions, e.g. from purchased 
electricity) and only to the extent that such emissions are 
the responsibility of the Company.
Kentz has not in the past collected the data necessary to 
meet these GHG emissions reporting requirements and 
therefore is not able to comply with these new reporting 
requirements at 31 December 2013.
We aim to satisfy the requirements of all local legislation 
and during 2013 engaged with a number of external 
advisors in order to establish a global reporting GHG 
framework. We have been successful in this and have 
finalised our Scope One and Two reporting boundaries, 
as well as an intensity ratio as per the new UK legislation. 
Data collection commenced in September of 2013 during 
which we set a baseline measurement. We shall make a 
full disclosure of our GHG data in our 2014 Annual Report 
and Accounts.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Jersey company law requires the Directors to prepare the 
Financial Statements for each financial year which give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In 
preparing those financial statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them on a consistent basis.
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent.
• State whether applicable accounting standards have 
been followed, subject to any material differences 
disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements. 
• Prepare the Financial Statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is not appropriate to presume 
that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the 
above requirements in preparing the financial 
statements. The Directors have prepared the Group 
Financial Statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The Directors are also required by the Listing Rules 
issued by the London Stock Exchange, to prepare a 
Report of the Directors and reports relating to Directors’ 
remuneration and corporate governance. In accordance 
with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United 
Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority (the Transparency 
Regulations), the Directors are required to include a 
management report containing a fair review of the 
business and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper books 
of accounting records which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group 
and to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
relevant legislation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Group’s website. Legislation in Jersey 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 86

REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OUR OPINION
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s 
profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs); and
• have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in 
the remainder of this report.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED
The Group financial statements, which are prepared by 
Kentz Corporation Limited, comprise:
• the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 
31 December 2013;
• the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income for the year then 
ended;
• the Consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then 
ended; and
• the notes to the consolidated financial statements, 
which include a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting 
framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual 
Report rather than in the notes to the financial 
statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial 
statements and are identified as audited.
WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & 
Ireland)). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited Group financial 
statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF  
KENTZ CORPORATION LIMITED
OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
MATERIALITY
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped 
us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and on the financial statements as 
a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
to be US$5.5 million. This has been calculated using a 
benchmark of Group profit before taxation and 
exceptional items. We consider that this benchmark is the 
most appropriate measure of recurring Group 
performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would 
report to them misstatements identified during our audit 
above US$0.3 million as well as misstatements below 
that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
The Group structure comprises five distinct regions 
namely, Middle East, Far East, Africa, Australasia and 
Americas. The Group financial statements are a 
consolidation of 50 reporting units, comprising the 
Group’s operating businesses and centralised functions.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be performed 
at the reporting units by us, as the Group engagement 
team, or component auditors from other PwC network 
firms operating under our instruction. Where the work was 
performed by component auditors, we determined the 
level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work 
at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained 
as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole.
Our Group audit scope focused on 12 reporting entities 
with significant operations based in Middle East, Far East, 
Africa, Australasia, Americas and Europe, all of which 
were subject to an audit of their complete financial 
information. In aggregate these operations accounted for 
approximately 93% of Group Revenue and approximately 
90% of Group Profit Before Taxation and Exceptional 
Items. This together with the additional procedures 
performed at the Group level, gave us the evidence we 
needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements 
as a whole.
AREAS OF PARTICULAR AUDIT FOCUS
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors made 
a number of subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that 
are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused our work 
in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we 
considered necessary to provide a reasonable basis for  Strategic 
Report
Corporate 
Governance
Financial 
Statements
87
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both.
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete 
list of all risks or areas of focus identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. 
Their report on those matters that they considered to be significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set 
out on pages 63 and 64.
AREA OF FOCUS
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE AREA 
OF FOCUS
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT 
ACCOUNTING
The timing of the recognition of revenue in respect 
of construction contracts is calculated using the 
percentage of completion method. This requires the 
estimation of costs yet to be incurred in the final 
completion of contracts, the assessment of probability 
that unapproved variation orders and claims will be 
approved and the estimation of the amount of revenue 
that will be received therefrom.
The Group provides for future losses on construction 
contracts when it is considered probable that the 
contract costs are likely to exceed revenues in future 
years. The estimation of these future losses involves a 
number of complex judgements in respect of contract 
performance including the assessment of potential 
liquidated damages and the estimation of costs 
to completion.
We focused on this area because it involves significant 
judgements by the Directors including in particular, the 
assessment of the likely settlement by the relevant 
customer of unapproved variation orders and claims 
in respect of the Medupi contract.
In addition, ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk 
of fraud in revenue recognition because the pressure 
management may feel to achieve the planned results.
We identified key projects for testing based on size, 
complexity, risk, profit contribution, cash position and 
balance sheet exposure.
We assessed and tested the monitoring controls that 
the Group perform including regular reviews performed 
by the Management Executive Committee and Risk 
Review Committee.
We performed an assessment of the historical level of 
accuracy and prudence in end of life forecasting and 
challenged management’s current assumptions in 
respect of contract end of life assessments.
We challenged management’s assumptions over the 
likelihood of settlement of unapproved contract 
variations and claims in particular in respect of the 
Medupi contract by considering the probability that the 
customer will accept the claims and variations that have 
been recognised by reference to correspondence in 
relation to specific claims and relevant settlement history.
We challenged management’s assumptions in respect 
of total estimated revenues and costs for loss making 
contracts by reviewing historical performance to date 
of these contracts and assessing the current status of 
negotiations with relevant customers.
We tested the timing of revenue recognition in 
accordance with the percentage of completion method. 
We have also tested revenue and contract accounting 
journal entries focusing on unusual or irregular items.
BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT CHARGE
During the year, there was a change in respect of the 
Group’s Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) partner 
in the South African operations to comply with local 
requirements. Kentz entered into an agreement whereby 
a new BEE partner subscribed for 30% of the issued 
share capital of Kentz (Pty) Limited for a nominal 
subscription price.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment, the 
Group has recorded a non-recurring charge of US$2.3m in 
the year representing the difference between the fair value 
of the BEE shareholding and the consideration received.
We focused on this area because of the level of 
judgement required in estimating the fair value of the 
BEE shareholding used in the calculation of the charge.
We have considered the accounting requirements 
of IFRS 2 and the report prepared by the Group’s 
advisors in respect of the estimated fair value of the BEE 
shareholding which were based on estimated cash flows 
for Kentz (Pty) Limited.
We challenged management’s key assumptions for future 
projected cash flows and growth rates in the forecasts by 
considering Kentz (Pty) Limited’s historic growth rates 
and its achievement of past strategic objectives. 88
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
AREA OF FOCUS
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE AREA 
OF FOCUS
PENSION LIABILITIES
The magnitude of the deficits on the Group’s defined 
benefit pension schemes included on the balance sheet 
is dependent on a number of key assumptions such as 
the discount rate at year end and mortality rates. A 
modest change in such assumptions can result in a 
material change in the value of the overall deficit.
We challenged the reasonableness of the actuarial 
assumptions used by management, by holding dialogue 
with our in-house actuaries and comparing the 
assumptions to third party benchmark data.
RISK OF MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF INTERNAL CONTROLS
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this. We assessed the Group’s anti-fraud programmes and 
controls and interviewed senior management, the 
Group’s Risk Officer and the Head of the Group’s Internal 
Audit function.
For each full scope audit reporting unit an analysis of 
manual journals was obtained which was assessed for 
completeness. We tested certain of these manual journal 
entries, including consolidation journals. We also 
assessed the significant accounting estimates and 
judgements relevant to the financial statements for 
evidence of bias by the Directors that may represent a 
risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
GOING CONCERN
As noted in the Directors’ statement, set out on pages 84 to 85, in relation to going concern, the Directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s financial statements using the going concern basis of 
accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and 
that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part 
of our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements;
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement in the Annual Report with respect to internal control 
and risk management systems and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as if that Act had applied to the Group.
OTHER MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
ADEQUACY OF INFORMATION AND EXPLANATIONS RECEIVED
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). We have nothing to 
report having performed our review.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. CORPORATE INFORMATION
Kentz Corporation Limited (the Company) is a limited 
liability company registered in Jersey (registered number 
58549) under the Companies (Jersey) law 1991 and is the 
Parent Company for the Kentz Group. Kentz Corporation 
Limited is listed on the London Stock Exchange 
(symbol: KENZ) and is a member of the FTSE 250. 
The Group’s principal activity is the provision of 
engineering and construction services and technical 
support services, principally in the oil services sector.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Kentz 
Corporation Limited for the year ended 31 December 
2013 were authorised for issue in accordance with a 
resolution of the Directors on 21 March 2014.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) and its interpretations adopted by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
(b) BASIS OF PREPARATION
Items included in the financial statements of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (the functional currency). The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in US$ (rounded to 
the nearest thousand), which is the Company’s functional 
currency and the Group’s presentation currency. Foreign 
operations are consolidated in accordance with the 
policies set out in note (f) (iii) below. 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical 
cost basis except that financial instruments held for 
trading are recorded at their fair value. 
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors 
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making the 
judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is 
revised if the revision affects only that period or in the 
period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of 
IFRS that have a significant effect on the Financial 
Statements and estimates with a significant risk of material 
adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 3. 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied 
consistently to all periods presented in these 
Consolidated Financial Statements and in preparing an 
opening IFRS Statement of financial position at 1 January 
2004 for the purposes of the transition to IFRS. 
The accounting policies have been applied consistently 
by Group entities.
GOING CONCERN
After making enquiries the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements.
(c) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
(i) SUBSIDIARIES
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) 
over which the Group has control. The Group controls an 
entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the 
date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
(ii) ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING POLICY
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
results of business combinations using the acquisition 
method. The results of acquired operations are included 
in the Consolidated income statement from the date on 
which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from 
the date control ceases.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a 
subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the 
liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree 
and the equity interests issued by the Group. The 
consideration transferred includes the fair value of any 
asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at 
the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition by 
acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-
controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised 
amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, 
the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is 
re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any 
gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are 
recognised in profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the 
Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is 
recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or 
loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. 
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not 
re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted 
for within equity. 96
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount 
of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the 
acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest 
in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of 
consideration transferred, non-controlling interest 
recognised and previously held interest measured is less 
than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary 
acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference 
is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances, income and 
expenses on transactions between Group companies are 
eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from inter-
company transactions that are recognised in assets are 
also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have 
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency 
with the policies adopted by the Group.
When the Group ceases to have control any retained 
interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the 
date when control is lost, with the change in carrying 
amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the 
initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently 
accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint 
venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in 
respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had 
directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may 
mean that amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(iii) JOINT ARRANGEMENTS 
Under IAS 31 “Interests in Joint Ventures”, the Group’s 
interest in its joint arrangements were classified as joint 
ventures and these were equity accounted in the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements. The Group has applied 
IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” to all joint arrangements as 
of 1 January 2012. 
Joint Arrangements: A joint arrangement is an 
arrangement of which two or more parties have joint 
control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing 
of control such that decisions about the relevant activities 
of the arrangement (those that significantly affect the 
Companies’ returns) require the unanimous consent of 
the parties sharing control. Under IFRS 11 investments in 
joint arrangements are classified as either joint 
operations or joint ventures depending on the 
contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
• Joint Ventures (JVs): A JV is a joint arrangement in 
which the parties that share joint control have rights to 
the net assets of the arrangement. JVs are accounted 
for using the equity accounting method. Under the 
equity method of accounting, interests in joint 
ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted 
thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the 
post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in 
other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share 
of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its 
interests in the joint ventures (which includes any 
long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the 
Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the 
Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of 
the joint ventures.  
 
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group 
and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of 
the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred. Under this method of accounting the 
investment is recorded initially at cost to the Group, 
including any goodwill on acquisition. In subsequent 
periods the carrying amount of the investment is 
adjusted to reflect the Group’s share of the joint 
ventures’ retained post acquisition profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income. 
• Joint Operations (JOs): A JO is a joint arrangement in 
which the parties that share joint control have rights to 
the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to 
the arrangement. This includes situations where the 
parties benefit from the joint activity through a share 
of the output, rather than by receiving a share of the 
results of trading. In relation to its interest in a JO the 
Group recognises: its assets, including its share of any 
assets held jointly; its liabilities, including its share of 
any liabilities incurred jointly; its revenue from the sale 
of its share of the output arising from the JO; its share 
of the revenue from the sale of the output by the JO; 
and its expenses, including its share of any expenses 
incurred jointly. These are incorporated into the 
Group’s financial statements under the 
appropriate headings. 
 
Following the adoption of IFRS 11, certain of the 
Group’s joint arrangements meet the definition of joint 
operations with effect from 1 January 2012. The Group 
combines its share of the joint operations individual 
income and expenses, assets and liabilities on a 
line-by-line basis with similar items in the Group’s 
financial statements. The change in accounting policy 
has been applied as from 1 January 2012. The effects 
of the change in accounting policies on the financial 
position, comprehensive income and the cash flows of 
the Group at 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 are 
shown in note 35. The change in accounting policy has 
had no impact on earnings per share. 
 
(iv) TRANSACTIONS ELIMINATED ON CONSOLIDATION
Intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains and losses 
or income and expenses arising from the intra-Group 
transactions are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Unrealised gains arising from 
transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities 
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way 
as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.

(d) NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP 
The following standards and amendments are adopted 
by the Group for the first time for the financial year 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013: 
• IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 
(Amendment) regarding other comprehensive income 
• IAS 19 Employee Benefits (revised) 
• IFRS 7 Disclosures – Offsetting financial assets and 
financial liabilities 
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 28 Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures 
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
• IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
• Annual Improvements 2011 
Except where noted below the standards and 
amendments above did not have a significant impact on 
the results or financial position of the Group during the 
year ended 31 December 2013. 
Amendments to IAS 1, “Financial statement presentation” 
regarding other comprehensive income. The main change 
resulting from these amendments is a requirement for 
entities to Group items presented in “other comprehensive 
income” (OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially 
reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification 
adjustments). The revised standard, which has been 
adopted by the Group with effect from 1 January 2013, 
affects presentation only and does not impact the Group’s 
financial position or performance.
IAS 19 (revised) “Employee Benefits” amends the 
accounting for employment benefits. The standard 
replaces the interest cost on the defined benefit obligation 
and the expected return on plan assets with a net interest 
cost which is calculated based on the net defined benefit 
liability and the discount rate, measured at the beginning of 
the year. The Group has adopted the revised standard from 
1 January 2013 and has not applied the standard 
retrospectively as the amendments had an immaterial 
impact on the Group’s prior year financial information.
IFRS 11, “Joint arrangements” focuses on the rights and 
obligations of the parties to the arrangement rather than 
its legal form. Under IAS 31 “Interests in Joint Ventures”, 
the Group’s interests in its joint arrangements were 
classified as joint ventures and these were equity 
accounted in the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements. IFRS 11 now distinguishes between joint 
ventures and joint operations. Joint operations arise 
where the investors have rights to the assets and 
obligations for the liabilities of an arrangement. A joint 
operator accounts for its share of the assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses. Joint ventures arise where the 
investors have rights to the net assets of the arrangement; 
joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method. 
Proportional consolidation of joint arrangements is no 
longer permitted. Following the adoption of IFRS 11, 
certain of the Group’s joint arrangements meet the 
definition of joint operations and have been classified as 
joint operations. The Group has adopted the new 
standard with effect from 1 January 2013 and the new 
standard has also been applied retrospectively. 
See note 35 for the impact of the adoption on the prior 
year financial information. 
IFRS 12 “Disclosure of interests in other entities” 
requires information in relation to the classification of 
joint arrangements.
The Group holds interests in a number of joint 
arrangements, comprising both joint operations and 
joint ventures. 
• Joint Operations 
The Group holds 33.3% of the interest in Thiess Decmil 
Kentz and holds 35% of the interest in CB&I Kentz. The 
Group and other parties to the agreements have a 
direct share in all of the assets employed by the 
arrangements and are liable for their share of the 
liabilities incurred through the terms of the contractual 
arrangements. These arrangements are therefore 
classified as joint operations of the Group. 
• Joint Ventures 
The Group has entered into a number of arrangements 
which have been classified as joint ventures. The 
judgements surrounding such classification of 
arrangements are outlined below. Other facts and 
circumstances have also been considered to determine 
the classification of these arrangements. 
 
The joint ventures of the Group are outlined in note 32. 
In each of these ventures, the contractual 
arrangements provide the investors with collective 
control over the entities, and significant decisions 
around relevant activities require the unanimous 
consent of all invested parties. Additionally, investors 
have rights to the net assets of the entities above, 
rather than rights to the assets and obligations to the 
liabilities of the companies. These arrangements are 
therefore classified as joint ventures of the Group.
(e) NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT 
YET ADOPTED 
 
A number of new standards, interpretations and 
amendments, which are effective for periods beginning 
after 1 January 2014 and which have not been adopted 
early are set out below. These are expected to have an 
immaterial effect on the Group’s future financial statements.

(f) FOREIGN CURRENCY
(i) FUNCTIONAL PRESENTATION CURRENCY
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the respective entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated 
Financial Statements are presented in US Dollars, which is the Group’s presentation currency and the Company’s 
functional currency.
(ii) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated to US$ at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at the Statement of financial position date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical costs 
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to US$ at foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
(iii) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, 
are translated to US$ at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. The results and cash flows of foreign 
operations are translated to US$ at average exchange rates for the year. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
re-translation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
(iv) NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS
Adjustments arising on translation of the results of foreign operations at average rate, and on re-statement of the 
opening net assets at closing rates, are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, 
accumulated currency translation differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the 
overall gain or loss on disposal; the cumulative currency translation differences arising prior to 1 January 2004 (the 
translation date to IFRS) have been set to zero for ascertaining the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation 
subsequent to that date. Translation differences arising after 1 January 2004 are presented as a separate component 
of equity in the foreign currency translation reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position.
(g) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
(i) OWNED ASSETS
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation (see below) 
and impairment losses (see accounting policy n). 
Certain items of property, plant and equipment which had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, 
the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed costs, being the revalued amount at the date of 
that revaluation.
(ii) DEPRECIATION
Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of 
an item of property, plant and equipment at the following rates:
Buildings 10%
Plant and fixtures 10%–33%
Motor vehicles 20%–33%
The residual value, if not insignificant, is re-assessed annually.

(h) LEASES
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and 
rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are 
classified as operating leases. Payments made under 
operating leases (net of any incentives received from the 
lessor) are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. 
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the 
Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases 
are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower 
of the fair value of the leased property and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and 
finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, 
net of finance charges, are included in non-current trade 
and other payables. The interest element of the finance 
cost is charged to the income statement over the lease 
period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each 
period. The property, plant and equipment acquired 
under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of 
the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
(i) GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
(i) GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an 
acquisition of a subsidiary or joint venture, over the 
Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised at the date 
of acquisition. 
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented 
separately in the consolidated statement of financial 
position. Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but 
instead is tested annually for impairment, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the goodwill 
may be impaired and carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses previously 
recognised cannot be reversed (see accounting policy n).
(ii) OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses (see accounting policy n). Intangible 
assets are amortised over their useful economic lives of 
three years.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands 
is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as 
an expense as incurred.
(j) TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value 
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established 
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due according to the original 
terms of the receivables. If collectability appears unlikely 
compared with the original term of the receivable, the 
Group will determine the appropriate provision based on 
the available evidence at that time. Significant financial 
difficulty of the trade receivable, probability that the trade 
receivable will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, 
and default or delinquency in payments are considered 
indicators that the receivable is impaired.
(k) FINANCIAL ASSETS
All financial assets are initially measured at fair value, 
including transaction costs, except for those financial 
assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss 
which are initially measured at fair value, excluding 
transaction costs. Where the effect on fair value at initial 
recognition of any extended payment terms is not 
material, no adjustments were made.
Subsequent measurement for financial assets is set 
out below.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables (excluding Value Added 
Taxation, prepayments and operating lease receivables), 
loans and cash and cash equivalents that have fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method 
less any impairment loss. Interest income is recognised in 
profit or loss by applying the effective interest rate, 
except for short-term trade receivables where the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The accounting policy for bank and cash balances is dealt 
with under cash and cash equivalents set out below.
DE-RECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group de-recognises a financial asset only when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or 
it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
(l) FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
All financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, 
including transaction costs, except for those financial 
liabilities classified as at fair value through profit or loss, 
which are initially measured at fair value, excluding 
transaction costs. 
Subsequent measurement for financial liabilities is set 
out below.
OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE 
THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, with 
interest expense recognised on an effective interest 
basis, except for short-term payables where the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating 
the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective 
interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 100
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liabilities or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
DE-RECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
The Group de-recognises financial liabilities when, and 
only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or expired. On de-recognition, the difference 
between the carrying amount of the financial liability, 
including related unamortised costs, and settlement 
amount paid are included in profit or loss.
(m) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and 
call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on 
demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management are included as a component of cash and 
cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of 
Cash Flows. Bank overdrafts are included in interest 
bearing loans and borrowings in the Consolidated 
statement of financial position.
(n) IMPAIRMENT
(i) NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than 
work in progress and deferred tax assets (see accounting 
policy u(ii)), are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated.
For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at 
each reporting date. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-
generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating 
units (group of units) and then, to reduce the carrying 
amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) 
on a pro rata basis. 
(ii) FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there 
is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of 
financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities 
classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged 
decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is 
considered an indicator that the securities are impaired. 
If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial 
assets, the cumulative loss is measured as the difference 
between the acquisition cost and the current fair value. 
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement 
on equity instruments are not reversed through the 
income statement.
(o) DIVIDENDS
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the Group’s 
Financial Statements in the period in which they are 
declared by the Company.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by 
the shareholders at the AGM.
(p) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
(i) PENSION OBLIGATIONS 
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which 
the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. 
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay 
further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient 
assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to 
employee service in the current and prior periods. A 
defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a 
defined contribution plan. 
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of 
pension benefit that an employee will receive on 
retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors 
such as age, years of service and compensation. 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of 
defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting 
period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit 
obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries 
using the projected unit credit method. The present value 
of the defined benefit obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using 
interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be 
paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the 
terms of the related pension obligation. 
Remeasurements arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or 
credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the 
period in which they arise. 
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income. 
A full actuarial valuation is carried out every three years. 
The last actuarial valuation was carried out on 1 May 2013.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays 
contributions to publicly or privately administered 
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual 
or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit 
expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are 
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund 
or a reduction in the future payments is available. 
(ii) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-
based compensation plans, under which the entity 
receives services from employees as consideration for 
equity instruments of the Group. The fair value of the 
employee services received in exchange for the grant of 
the equity instruments is recognised as an expense. The 
total amount to be expensed is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the equity instruments granted:

• including any market performance conditions (for 
example, an entity’s share price);
• excluding the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions (for example, 
profitability, sales growth targets and remaining an 
employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
• including the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
Non-market performance and service conditions are 
included in assumptions about the number of equity 
instruments that are expected to vest. The total expense 
is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period 
over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to 
be satisfied.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its 
estimates of the number of equity instruments that are 
expected to vest based on the non-market vesting 
conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to 
original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with 
a corresponding adjustment to equity.
(q) TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair 
value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method.
(r) BORROWINGS
Borrowings are recognised initially at proceeds received, 
net of transaction costs. Subsequent measurement is at 
amortised cost. Finance charges including any premiums 
payable on settlement are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement over the period of the borrowings 
using the effective rate of interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the 
Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of 
the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
(s) REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT ACCOUNTING
(i) CONSTRUCTION AND EPC CONTRACTS
Contract revenue is recognised under the percentage of 
completion method. When the outcome of the contract 
can be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised by 
reference to the proportion that accumulated cost of 
sales up to the year end bear to the estimated total costs 
of the contract. When the contract is at an early stage 
and its outcome cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is 
recognised to the extent of costs incurred up to the 
year-end which are considered recoverable.
Revenue related to variation orders is recognised when it 
is probable that the customer will approve the variation 
and the amount of revenue arising from the variation can 
be reliably measured.
A claim is recognised as contract revenue when settled 
or when negotiations have reached an advanced stage 
such that it is probable that the customer will accept the 
claim and the amount that it is probable will be accepted 
by the customer can be measured reliably. 
Losses on contracts are assessed on an individual 
contract basis. When it is probable that total contract 
costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected 
loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
On the balance sheet, the Group reports the net contract 
position for each contract as either an asset or a liability. 
A contract represents an asset where costs incurred plus 
recognised profits (less recognised losses) exceed 
progress billings, a contract represents a liability where 
the opposite is the case.
(ii) TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES
Revenue for reimbursable contracts are recognised in 
the accounting period in which the services are rendered 
based on the agreed contract schedule of rates, by 
reference to stage of completion of the specific 
transaction and assessed on the basis of the actual 
service provided as a proportion of the total services 
to be provided. 
(t) NET FINANCING COSTS
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on 
borrowings, calculated using the effective interest rate 
method, interest receivable on funds invested and 
dividend income.
Interest income is recognised in the Consolidated 
income statement as it accrues, using the effective 
interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the 
Income Statement on the date the entity’s right to 
receive payments is established which, in the case of 
quoted securities, is usually the ex-dividend date. The 
interest expense component of finance lease payments 
is recognised in the Consolidated income statement 
using the effective interest rate method.
(u) INCOME TAX
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises 
current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognised in equity. 
(i) CURRENT TAX
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable 
income for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantially enacted at the Statement of financial 
position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in 
respect of previous years.
(ii) DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and for the amounts used for 
taxation purposes. The following temporary differences 
are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax 
purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that 
affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, differences 
relating to investment in subsidiaries where the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on 
the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 102
Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax 
assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution 
of dividends are recognised at the same time as the 
liability to pay the related dividend. 
(v) SHARE CAPITAL
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified 
as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the 
definition of a financial liability or financial asset.
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as 
equity instruments.
(w) TREASURY SHARES
Consideration paid for the purchase of treasury shares is 
recognised directly in equity. The cost of treasury shares 
held is presented as a separate reserve (the treasury 
share reserve).
(x) SEGMENT REPORTING
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
chief operating decision-maker. The Chief Operating 
Decision-Maker, who is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the Group 
Management Executive Committee.
(y) EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 
The Group has adopted an income statement 
format which seeks to highlight significant items within 
Group results for the year. The Group believe that this 
presentation provides additional analysis as it highlights 
one-off items. Such items include, where significant, 
acquisition costs. Judgement is used by the Group in 
assessing the particular items, which, by virtue of their 
scale and nature, are disclosed in the Group income 
statement and related notes as exceptional items.
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Management makes estimates and judgements, including 
assumptions concerning the future. Estimates and 
judgements are continually evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable in the circumstances.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates 
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT ACCOUNTING
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion 
method in accounting for its contract revenue. Use of the 
percentage-of-completion method requires management 
to estimate the stage of completion of a contract to date 
as a proportion of the total contract work to be performed 
in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 
2(s). As a result, Kentz Group management is required to 
estimate the total cost to completion of all outstanding 
jobs at each period end. Estimating costs to complete 
on such contracts requires the Group to make estimates 
of future costs to be incurred, based on work to be 
performed beyond the reporting date. This estimate will 
impact revenues, cost of sales, work in progress, billings in 
excess of costs and estimated earnings and accrued 
contract expenses.
Where it is probable that total contract costs will exceed 
total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as 
an expense immediately. Estimating these future losses 
involves a number of assumptions about the achievement 
of contract performance targets and the likely levels of 
future cost escalation over time.
Revenue related to variation orders is recognised when it 
is probable that the customer will approve the variation 
and the amount of revenue arising from the variation can 
be reliably measured.
A claim is recognised as contract revenue when settled 
or when negotiations have reached an advanced stage 
such that it is probable that the customer will accept the 
claim and the amount that it is probable will be accepted 
by the customer can be measured reliably. 
Accordingly, the recognition of revenue relating to claims 
and variation orders requires an element of judgement 
and estimation.
PENSION BENEFITS
The present value of the pension obligations depends on 
a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial 
basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions 
used in determining the net cost (income) for pensions 
include the discount rate. Any changes in these 
assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension 
obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, 
the Group considers the interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in 
which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to 
maturity approximating the terms of the related pension 
liability. Other key assumptions for pension obligations 
are based in part on current market conditions. 
Additional information is disclosed in note 27.
4. SEGMENTAL REPORTING
Management has determined the operating segments 
based on the information reviewed by the Group 
Management Executive Committee.
In accordance with IFRS 8 – “Operating Segments”, the 
Group has five operating segments, being five distinct 
regions as follows: 
• Middle East 
• Far East 
• Africa 
• Australasia 
• Americas 
These segments align with the Group’s internal financial 
reporting system and the way in which the Chief 
Operating Decision-Maker assesses performance and 
allocates the Group’s resources. The management team

responsible for each segment is directly accountable for the performance of that segment to the Group Management 
Executive Committee which acts as the Chief Operating Decision-Maker for the Group. Each segment is reviewed in its 
totality by the Chief Operating Decision-Maker. The Group Management Executive Committee assesses the trading 
performance of operating segments based on a measure of earnings before interest and tax (operating profit). 
Segment revenues and profit include Kentz’s share of revenue and profit from equity accounted joint ventures. 
Segment assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on 
a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly interest bearing loans, borrowings and expenses and corporate 
assets and expenses. Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment 
assets that are expected to be used for more than one period. 
The segment results for the year ended 31 December 2013 are as follows:

segments. Another customer contributed US$225.8 million (13.6% of the Group’s total revenue) and is included in 
Australasia and Middle East segments. Revenue of US$168.4 million (10.2% of the Group’s total revenue) relates to the 
third customer and this is included in the Americas segment.

(a)  From 2 April 2013, Kentz entered into a shareholders’ agreement with Medu Holdings (Pty) Limited (Medu) as the new Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) 
partner in our South African operations to comply with local requirements. An accounting consequence of the BEE transaction is that an income statement 
charge of US$2.3 million has been recognised in accordance with IFRS 2: “Share-Based Payment” representing the difference between the fair value of the BEE 
shareholding and the consideration received from Medu. The fair value of the BEE shareholding was estimated by using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

24. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The principal objective of the Group’s treasury policy is to ensure that there are sufficient resources to finance the 
business. The cash resources of the Group are retained in a combination of central and local bank accounts. These 
accounts comprise current, call and short-term deposits with banks approved by the Board. Financial instruments held 
by the Group principally comprise financing facilities, cash and other items including receivables and payables, all of 
which arise directly from its operations.
The risks arising from these financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and 
credit risk. The Board reviews, agrees and monitors policies for managing each of these risks; these are summarised 
below. These policies have remained unchanged during the period under review. 
(A) LIQUIDITY RISK
Group cash resources held at banks are monitored regularly by senior management (locally and at Group level). It is 
the Group’s policy to retain sufficient funds in current and call accounts to meet short-term needs. Surplus funds are 
retained on short-term interest-bearing deposits. The Group also maintains overdraft facilities in certain entities.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity 
groupings based on the remaining period from the reporting date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts 
disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

(B) INTEREST RATE RISK
The financial assets of the Group comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. The trade and 
other receivables are non-interest-bearing. The cash and cash equivalents earn interest at floating rates based on 
individual bank market rates for the relevant currencies and durations. 
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to bank loans and amounts payable 
under asset finance leases.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

the reporting date is demonstrated below:

2012

+1% movement in rates – loans and asset finance leases (174) (130)
+1% movement in rates – Cash & Cash Equivalents 2,463 2,298
(C) FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Financial Statements are prepared in US Dollars, rounded to the nearest thousand which represents the functional 
currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk 
on sales, purchases, borrowings and net investments in subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than 
US Dollars. The principal currencies giving rise to this risk are Australian Dollar, South African Rand, United Arab 
Emirates Dirham, Saudi Riyal, Qatari Riyal, Kuwaiti Dinar, Euro, Russian Rouble, Canadian Dollar, Trinidad/Tobago 
Dollar, Botswana Pula, Mozambique Metical, Madagascar Ariary, Dominican Republic Peso and Colombian Peso.
Exchange rate risk is managed at the subsidiary levels by ensuring that, as far as possible, income and expenses are 
denominated in the appropriate functional currency. Certain subsidiaries enter into forward exchange contracts to 
hedge the exchange risk of trading and intercompany balances in line with Board-approved policy. Those contracts 
outstanding at the relevant period ends are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges and are 
entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures, which are short-term in nature with average 
duration of three months as at 31 December 2013.
The Group does not trade in any derivative financial instruments.
EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of profit before tax to selected movements in subsidiary foreign 
exchange rates (with all other variables held constant). The impact on profit before tax is based on a reasonably 
possible change in US Dollar exchange rates with respect to different floating exchange rate reporting currencies. The 
impact on total equity is calculated by changing the exchange rates used in measuring the closing balance sheet values.

A 10% rate depreciation in these currencies versus US dollar
Impact on profit before tax (4,523) (3,239)
Impact on total equity (1,803) (1,239)
 
(D) CREDIT RISK
Credit risk is managed on a subsidiary basis in line with procedures established and approved by the Group Board. 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and 
financial institutions as well as credit exposure to customers including outstanding receivables and work in progress. 
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with investment grade credit ratings are 
accepted. Exceptions to this policy are permitted subject to specific Board approval for relationship banks that do not 
have an independent credit rating or require collateral support to achieve an acceptable credit rating.
The Group’s credit risk management policy in relation to trade receivables and work in progress involves periodically 
assessing the financial reliability of customers taking into account their financial position past experience and other 
factors. Credit risk is considered as part of the tender review process and the Group seeks to negotiate reasonable 
payment terms to mitigate such exposures. At the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit 
risk. The maximum Group credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
(E) FAIR VALUES
Forward exchange contracts open at the reporting period ends are marked to market to fair value the contracts.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had foreign exchange contracts outstanding with notional contract values of 
US$144.1 million (2012: US$76.9 million) and net unrealised gains of US$2.1 million (US$0.5 million).
The estimated fair values of the remaining financial instruments of the Group approximate to their book values as at the 
relevant period ends. The following criteria have been used to assess the fair values of the Group’s financial instruments.
• Receivables, cash and cash equivalents and payables are based on their book values due to their short maturity period.
• Loans are based on their book values which represents the Directors’ opinion of their fair values.

The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amounts.
As the Group’s financing facilities bear interest at floating rates, which represent prevailing market rate, the Directors 
consider the carrying amount of these borrowings approximates their fair value. 
The Directors estimate the fair value of the amounts due to/from related companies approximates to the carrying value.
(F) CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in 
order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, to maintain an optimal capital structure 
to reduce the cost of capital, and to have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to develop the business. 
Total capital is calculated based on equity as shown in the Statement of financial position, which amounted to 
US$330.6 million (2012: US$280.2 million). So as to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the 
amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, or issue new shares.
25. DEFERRED TAX ASSET/LIABILITIES
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using tax rates applicable in the 
various jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The movement on the deferred tax account is as shown below:
Year ended 31 December
In thousands of USD 2013 2012
Opening balance (4,457) (841)
Credit to the income statement (5,184) (3,264)
Foreign exchange adjustment 901 2
Other 316 (354)
Net deferred tax asset at the end of the year (8,424) (4,457)
Deferred taxation is reflected in the Statement of financial position as:
Deferred tax asset (9,240) (5,211)
Deferred tax liability 816 754
Net asset (8,424) (4,457)
The analysis of the net deferred tax asset by temporary difference is set out in the table below:
As at 31 December 2013
Accelerated tax 
depreciation Tax losses
Trade 
& other 
receivables Accruals Total
Deferred Tax Asset (2,998) (1,249) (2,732) (1,445) (8,424)
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax 
benefit through future taxable profits is probable. At as 31 December 2013, various subsidiaries recognised deferred 
tax assets on tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences totalling US$1.249 million since it was 
foreseeable that tax loss carry-forwards could be offset against future taxable profits. On the basis of the approved 
business plans of these subsidiaries, the Group considers it probable that the tax loss carry-forwards and temporary 
differences can be offset against future taxable profits.
DEFERRED TAX ASSETS NOT PROVIDED
Year ended 31 December
In thousands of USD
2013
 
Restated
2012
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items:
Unutilised tax losses 58,701 50,685
Tax effect 13,509 11,792
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable 
profit will be generated in the subsidiaries where they arise against which the Group can utilise the benefits.
Deferred income tax liabilities of US$8.3 million have not been recognised for the withholding taxes and other taxes 
that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries. The Group is in a position to control the 
timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.

27. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The following pension schemes operate in the Group.
(A) IRISH ADMINISTERED DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEME
The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan in Ireland for certain of its General and Professional Staff. On 
31 December 2010, this defined benefit pension scheme was closed for future service accrual. The plan is a final 
pensionable salary plan, which provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for 
life. The level of benefits payable depends on the members’ length of service and their salary in the final years leading 
up to retirement or for active members at 31 December 2010 in the three years preceding that date. Members’ 
retirement pensions increase at the rate of 3% per annum compound. The defined benefit pension plan is administered 
by independent trustees and is managed externally by independent investment managers.

KENTZ CORPORATION LIMITED SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Company operates an equity-settled share-based remuneration scheme for Executive Directors and certain senior

The share options outstanding at the year-end have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.35 years 
(2012: 7.17 years). Of the total number of options outstanding at the end of the year, the number of shares that had 
vested and were exercisable at the end of the year was 2,379,000 (2012: 3,831,000). 
The weighted average share price at the dates of exercise for share options exercised during the year was Stg£4.55.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
In 2011, the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced to provide senior executives with shares in lieu of cash 
bonus. Under this scheme, the award was a mixture of contingent awards (50%) and performance awards (50%) with 
a three-year vesting period for Executive Directors and contingent awards (70%) and performance awards (30%) with 
a three-year vesting period for all other senior executives. For the contingent awards the only vesting condition is that 
the individual remains an employee of the Group. 
For performance awards granted prior to March 2013 to vest in full, Kentz’s average basic earnings per share (EPS) 
growth must not be less than the average basic EPS growth for the same period for a peer group of designated 
industry competitors. If the Kentz actual basic EPS growth is more than 90% but less than 100% of the industry 
competitors’ performance, a pro-rated award value will be made. No vesting of performance awards will be made if 
Kentz’s basic EPS growth is less than 90% of the industry competitors’ average EPS growth. 
For performance awards granted after March 2013, a maximum of 50% of the performance awards will vest where an 
EPS growth target is achieved. If the Kentz compound annual growth rate for the three year performance period is more 
than 25% but less than 100% of the industry competitor’s performance, a pro-rated award value will be made. No vesting 
of performance awards will be made if Kentz’s basic EPS growth is less than 90% of the industry competitors’ average 
EPS growth. A maximum of 50% of the performance awards will vest where return on equity (RoE) target is achieved. If 
the Kentz average RoE for the three-year performance period is more than 25%, a pro-rated award value for RoE 
(between 25% and 30%) will be made. No vesting of performance awards will be made if Kentz’s RoE is less than 25%.
For the purpose of making awards under its employee share schemes, the Company acquires its own shares which are 
held by the Kentz Employee Benefit Trust. All these shares have been classified in the Statement of financial position 
as treasury shares within equity.

US$435.0 million subject to working capital adjustments on 3 January 2014.

Details of net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows:
In thousands of USD
Total consideration 435,000
Anticipated working capital adjustment (27,200)
Estimated consideration 407,800
The assets and liabilities arising from the acquisition, provisionally determined, are as follows:
In thousands of USD Fair Value
Property, plant and equipment 18,080
Working capital 13,767
Other liabilities (5,312)
Deferred tax liability (2,444)
Intangibles assets and Goodwill 383,709
407,800
The fair values of the acquired net assets of Valerus FS have been determined provisionally and are subject to change, 
as the Group has yet to finalise the fair value of all the net identifiable assets acquired due to the timing of the 
completion of the acquisition.  
The fair value of trade and other receivables is US$101.5 million and includes trade receivables with a fair value of 
US$98.0 million. The gross contractual amount for trade receivables due is US$98.3 million, of which US$0.3 million is 
expected to be uncollectible.
The acquisition is consistent with Kentz’s strategy of establishing itself as a recognised market leader in providing highly 
skilled process engineering, EPCM and EPC services for small and medium sized oil and gas processing facilities worldwide.
The above Goodwill is attributable to the following principal benefits and synergies: 
• expanded offering through the addition of 665 employees including 198 personnel with demonstrable experience in 
gas handling and processing;
• diversified and expanded operational footprint with Valerus FS strongly positioned in the US onshore oil and gas 
market, including shale gas, a new market for Kentz;
• increased exposure to Latin American markets with Valerus FS’ established presence in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia 
and Venezuela;
• an increased ability to leverage and enhance existing EPC capabilities and differentiators in onshore oil and gas 
processing facilities;
• the potential to offer integrated solutions for clients and bid on contracts, where previously the Group would not 
have been able to due to the specific range of capabilities required;
• an increased focus on mid-sized modular projects expected in gas plants and EPF;
• increased opportunities for Kentz by providing services to the outsourced portion of Valerus FS’ projects.
The acquisitions cost of US$6.0m (note 6) have been charged to administrative expenses in the Consolidated income 
statement for the year ended 31 December 2013.
(C) BORROWINGS
On 3 January 2014, the Group drew down US$400.0 million under its US$560.0 million loan facilities agreement entered 
into on 9 December 2013 to finance the acquisition of Valerus FS with the balance of the consideration satisfied in cash.

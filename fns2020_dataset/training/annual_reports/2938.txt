Chairman’s Statement
*Underlying profit and underlying earnings per share, which
are defined on page 60, are used to report our financial
performance in 2005 on a comparable basis to that of 2004.
I am pleased to report that in 2005 Carillion achieved all its key
financial targets and made substantial strategic progress to deliver
further profitable growth, both organically and through the
acquisition of mechanical and electrical engineering maintenance
company, PME. 
In December 2005, we announced the terms of a recommended
cash and shares offer for the acquisition of Mowlem plc. This
acquisition, which received the overwhelming support of Carillion
and Mowlem shareholders, was completed in February 2006 and, 
in line with our strategy, represents a step change in Carillion’s
transformation. 
In this report, Carillion has presented for the first time its full-year
financial results under International Financial Reporting Standards. In
2005, revenue increased by 15 per cent to £2,284 million, including
joint ventures, (2004: £1,985 million), despite the impact of
transferring to Network Rail maintenance contracts that generated
£150 million of revenue in 2004. Underlying* profit before tax also
increased by 15 per cent to £55.5 million (2004: £48.1 million).
Operating cash flow remained strong and at 31 December 2005 
net cash amounted to £90.8 million (2004: £128.8 million).
The intake of new orders in 2005 was particularly strong and by 
the year end the value of the Group’s order book and framework
contracts had increased by 40 per cent to £7 billion (2004: £5 billion).
The integration of PME, which we acquired in March 2005, has
been completed successfully. This has significantly strengthened our
building management and support services capability and enhanced
our earnings in 2005.
Three non-executive directors, Sir Neville Simms, our previous
chairman, Andrew Parrish and Roger Dickens, retired from the Board
in 2005. I should like to record the Board’s thanks and recognition
for their contributions to the development and success of Carillion
and in particular to record the Board’s deep sadness at the death 
of Roger Dickens early in 2006. During 2005, we were pleased 
to welcome to the Board two new non-executive directors. The
appointment of Vanda Murray OBE in June, which I reported to
shareholders in my Interim Report, was followed by the appointment
in November of David Maloney, who brings to the Board
considerable experience in a number of service industry sectors. 
With a record order book and strong presence in our key 
growth markets, the outlook was already positive for Carillion to
deliver sustainable growth. However, the acquisition of Mowlem 
will accelerate growth substantially and create significant value 
for shareholders. It brings together two companies of a similar 
size with an excellent strategic fit, complementary skills and 
market strengths, to create one of the largest support services 
and construction companies in the UK and with substantial
international businesses. Combining the two companies will
generate opportunities for cost savings and strengthen Carillion’s
ability to compete successfully in its chosen markets. As a result, we
expect the acquisition of Mowlem to enhance earnings materially in
2007, the first full year of operation following the acquisition. 
The strong platform that has enabled us to acquire Mowlem and
move forward into 2006 with considerable confidence is due to 
the leadership of Carillion’s senior management team and the
commitment and professionalism of all its people. On behalf of 
the Board I should like to offer our thanks to everyone in Carillion
for the contributions they have made to our success. 
In view of the financial performance in 2005 and enhanced
prospects for future growth, the Board is recommending a final
ordinary dividend for 2005 of 5.2 pence per share, making the total
full year dividend 8 pence per share, an increase of some 7 per cent
on the total dividend paid in respect of 2004 (7.5 pence per share).
The final ordinary dividend for 2005 will be paid on 23 June 2006 
to shareholders on the register at close of business on 28 April 2006.

In 2005, Carillion made a major
breakthrough in the UK Defence
market. With our joint venture
partners we won two support 
services contracts for Defence Estates,
together worth around £1.2 billion
over a period of up to 10 years. 
These contracts involve maintaining
and upgrading Ministry of Defence
family accommodation comprising
some 45,000 properties in England
and Wales and the maintenance,
refurbishment and replacement of
around 8,500 other buildings and
infrastructure in central England 
and Wales.
We also made good progress in 
the fast-growing education sector
winning new contracts worth over
£300 million. These included a 
Public Private Partnership (PPP) 
project to build nine new schools 
in Renfrewshire, with a construction
value of around £100 million and 
in which we will invest approximately 
£4 million of equity, and a £100
million contract to provide design 
and construction services for six new
schools in Leeds. A Carillion joint
venture was also appointed preferred
bidder for a PPP project in Ayrshire 
to provide six new schools with a
construction value of over £70 million
and in which we expect to invest
some £3 million of equity.
A balanced and
more resilient
business Carillon is one of the leaders in Public
Private Partnership (PPP) projects and
Health is one our key growth sectors.
In December 2005, we secured 
our ninth PPP hospital contract,
the Queen Alexandra hospital,
Portsmouth, which is expected to
generate around £1.1 billion of
revenue for Carillion over the 33-year
concession contract. This includes
approximately £250 million of
construction, over £500 million of
maintenance and support services 
and around £350 million of revenue
relating to our £12 million equity
investment in this project. 
In 2005, a Carillion joint venture 
was appointed preferred bidder 
by Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire
Primary Care Trust to provide two
new Independent Sector Treatment
Centres, involving some £48 million 
of construction and £119 million of
clinical and non-clinical services over 
a five-year period.

Chief Executive’s Review Section 04
Operating and Financial Review
Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005
09
In our 2004 annual report, I said that 2005 marked the beginning
of a new phase of growth for Carillion. Having completed our
programme of major disposals and built a well-balanced, customer-
focused business, delivering good quality earnings backed by strong
operating cash flows, we were ready to accelerate the development
and growth of our business. That growth will continue to be driven
by implementing our consistent and effective strategy through
customer-focused businesses, supported by a culture based on
“living” our core values in everything we do. 
Strategic development 
Over the past few years we have been seeking acquisitions to fill
capability gaps in order to improve the scope and quality of our
integrated services solutions and also to deliver a step change in 
the development of our business. We apply the same criteria to 
all potential acquisitions, namely that they must be consistent 
with our strategy for delivering sustainable, profitable growth 
and deliver financial returns equivalent to those we expect from
other investments.
Acquisition of PME
The acquisition of PME, one of the largest privately owned
mechanical and electrical (M&E) engineering maintenance
businesses in the UK, for approximately £47 million (including a 
£10 million payment to the PME pension fund) in March 2005 filled
an important capability gap. M&E maintenance accounts for up to
40 per cent of a typical building management and support services 
contract. Having an in-house M&E maintenance capability has
therefore considerably strengthened our integrated service offering
for both new and existing customers. PME is performing well as an
integral part of our business, with cost synergies now expected to
reach approximately £3 million by the end of 2006, exceeding the
£2 million originally identified.
Acquisition of Mowlem plc
Carillion announced its cash and shares offer for the acquisition 
of Mowlem in December 2005. It was recommended by the
Mowlem Board and received the overwhelming support of 
Carillion and Mowlem shareholders. The acquisition valued
Mowlem’s share capital at £313 million and was completed
successfully on 23 February 2006. 65.8 million new Carillion 
shares were issued on 23 February 2006 as a result of the
acquisition.
Mowlem is an outstanding strategic fit, particularly in support
services and private finance, and we are confident that it will deliver
a step change in the development of our business and materially
enhance our earnings in 2007, the first full year after acquisition. 
The addition of Mowlem’s complementary skills and market
strengths in support services makes Carillion one of the largest
support services businesses in the UK and significantly enhances 
our ability to provide customers with high quality, integrated
solutions in our key market sectors.

The addition of Mowlem’s portfolio of Public Private Partnership
(PPP) projects to Carillion’s own substantial portfolio will create 
a very large and valuable portfolio of equity investments. 
Mowlem also has a large pipeline of new PPP projects for which 
it is the preferred bidder or shortlisted, with the potential to add
considerable further value to our investment portfolio. Furthermore,
the acquisition of Mowlem will increase the number of specialist
people we have with private finance skills, which has been the 
main constraint to our growth in this market.
Mowlem’s considerable strengths in construction services will 
add to the breadth and scale of our own construction capabilities.
Going forward, Mowlem’s approach to construction will be subject
to the same selectivity criteria that we have consistently applied 
to our own construction activities. Furthermore, our rigorous and
proven risk management policies and processes will underpin 
every aspect of the enlarged group’s operations. 
On 18 January 2006, Carillion announced that it had agreed to sell
two Mowlem businesses, Charter, the US construction management
company and Edgar Allen, the UK rail track products manufacturer
to Balfour Beatty plc for a total consideration of approximately 
£20.5 million, subject to due diligence by Balfour Beatty. Completion
of these sales is expected in the second quarter of 2006. 
In early March 2006, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) visited two
Mowlem offices. We have fully co-operated with the OFT and will
continue to do so as appropriate.
The integration of Carillion and Mowlem is being led by a 
dedicated team comprising senior people from both companies 
to ensure we achieve the synergy benefits we have identified and
create a business that will deliver accelerated growth, materially
enhanced earnings and strong cash generation. We expect to
deliver cost savings at a running rate of £10 million per annum 
by the end of 2006, rising to £15 million per annum by the end 
of 2007. The one-off cost of delivering these savings is expected 
to be £10 million in 2006.
Our business model for the enlarged group will continue to be
based on delivering our existing strategy through market focused
business units, each equipped with the skills and resources
necessary to provide customers with solutions tailored to meet 
their specific needs.
Business performance 
Total revenue in 2005 increased by 15 per cent to £2,284 million
(2004: £1,985 million), including revenue from joint ventures of
£259 million (2004: £126 million).

*Underlying profit and underlying earnings per
share, which are defined on page 60, are
used to report our financial performance in
2005 on a comparable basis to that of 2004.
Underlying* profit before tax also increased by 15 per cent to £55.5
million (2004: £48.1 million), with underlying earnings per share of
20.4 pence (2004: 18.6 pence). Underlying earnings per share grew
by 10 per cent, after the Group’s effective tax rate returned to a
more normal level of 27 per cent, having reduced temporarily in
2004 to 21 per cent, due to a number of one-off tax settlements. 
Our relentless focus on cash management has again resulted 
in a strong cash flow from operations of £84 million. Average
weekly net cash was £37 million, net of finance lease liabilities 
of £31 million. At 31 December 2005 Carillion had net cash 
of £90.8 million, net of finance leases of £37.7 million (2004:
£128.8 million net of finance leases of £24.2 million), having
invested approximately £47 million in the acquisition of PME. 
Delivering improved results in 2005 was a particularly significant
achievement, given the impact of transferring to Network Rail
during 2004 profitable maintenance contracts that contributed
around £150 million of revenue in 2004.
We continue to report our financial results in three segments –
Support Services, Construction Services and Investments – in which
we group together activities of a similar type and risk profile to
make it easier for the Market to value our earnings on a consistent
basis. Our performance in each of these segments is summarised
below and a more detailed explanation follows later in this review.
In Support Services, revenue (including joint ventures) increased 
by over seven per cent to £989 million, with the effect of losing
£150 million of rail maintenance revenue more than offset by the
acquisition of PME and organic growth. An increase in operating
profit of two per cent, to £40.6 million, lagged growth in revenue,
reflecting the loss of rail maintenance contracts, which had higher
than average margins in this segment. 
In Construction Services, revenue (including joint ventures) increased
by 22 per cent to £1,230 million, driven mainly by growth in our
International Regions, particularly the Middle East and Canada, UK
Building and our Developments business. Operating profit in this
segment increased by 35 per cent to £16.9 million. 
Investments contributed revenue of £65.4 million. Operating profit
increased by 36 per cent to £8.3 million, due to an improved
performance across our portfolio of equity investments in PPP
projects and reductions in bid costs and overheads. As explained
later in this review, we are also creating long-term value by
investing in these projects and the Directors’ current valuation of
our portfolio is £89 million, based on discounting at 10 per cent 
the cash flows that will be generated by these investments over 
the next thirty years or more. 
Total operating profit from our three financial reporting segments
was £65.8 million, including joint ventures. After corporate centre
costs of £10.4 million, net financing income of £5.1 million and tax
on joint venture profits of £5.0 million, underlying profit before tax
was £55.5 million. Non-operating items, amortisation of intangible
assets and goodwill impairment amounted to £3.6 million, leaving
profit before tax of £51.9 million. Profit after tax was £40.8 million
and basic earnings per share were 18.7 pence.
2005 was an outstanding year for new orders, which increased 
the value of the Group’s order book and framework contracts 
at the year-end by some 40 per cent to around £7 billion 
(2004: £5 billion). Despite converting a high proportion of 
potential new orders into contracts in 2005, we also maintained 
a healthy pipeline of probable orders, worth up to £1.6 billion at
the year-end (2004: £2.2 billion). 
Our strategy for growth continues to be reflected in our order book,
with Support Services and PPP concession contracts accounting 
for some 84 per cent of order book value (2004: 78 per cent). The
longer-term nature of these contracts also significantly improves the
visibility of future revenues, with around 74 per cent of our order
book expected to generate revenues in 2007 and beyond. At the
same time, through our selective approach, we have continued 
to improve the quality of our construction order book and focused
on long-term relationships with key customers. For example, in 
2005 our UK building business generated around 84 per cent 
(2004: 80 per cent) of its revenue from 20 key customers.
Risk management
The rigorous policies and processes we have established to 
identify, mitigate and manage risk are a cornerstone of our
business. Our Group Head of Risk is responsible for advising 
on all risk issues, including our policies and processes and their
application to all our business activities. 
We address strategic risks and risks specific to individual businesses
and contracts, including social, environmental and ethical risks. 
Our risk management processes apply to every aspect of our
business, from choosing the markets in which we operate to 
the contracts we bid for and the selection of our suppliers and 
sub-contractors. They apply to every stage of a contract from
inception to completion, in order to deliver the cash-backed profit
we expect and a service that meets or exceeds the expectations of
our customers.

Order book 2004-2005
Our order book at 31 December 2005,
increased by 40% to £7.0bn. The more significant areas of risk, where our failure to perform 
well or changes to macro economic or market specific environments
that would adversely affect our business, are summarised below:
Integration of Mowlem. The efficient and professional
integration of Carillion and Mowlem is essential to the success 
of this acquisition and to the delivery of cost synergies,
sustainable, profitable growth and materially enhanced earnings;
Attracting, developing and retaining excellent people. The
success of our business depends primarily on the quality of 
our people;
Management of major contracts. Completing contracts on 
time and to the required standards, avoids financial penalties 
and damage to our brand and reputation; 
Closing out existing contracts. Settling completed contracts 
and collecting the cash we are owed is essential to reducing 
debt and delivering the earnings growth we expect;
Pension scheme management. The cost to Carillion of funding its
pension schemes depends on the macro-economic environment,
equity market stability and regulatory requirements;
Government investment and outsourcing. With a substantial
proportion of our business and future growth dependent on
planned investment and outsourcing of services, it is important
to maintain an effective presence in a number of growth sectors
to support the resilience of our business; 
A more detailed description of our risk management structure 
can be found in our Corporate Governance Report on page 33.
Our people
Our people are the key source of competitive advantage and it
is through their efforts each day that we meet or exceed our
customers’ expectations.
The success of our business and the value of the Carillion 
brand depend primarily upon the performance of our people. 
We therefore remain totally committed to attracting, developing
and retaining excellent people by becoming an employer of choice
and have a wide range of measures in place to make this a reality
across all our businesses.
Above all we strive to communicate well with all our people and 
to listen to and act upon what they tell us. We do this through 
a structured approach to communication, including individual
performance and development reviews, monthly Team Talks and
regular surveys through which everyone can share their views
openly and frankly, in line with our core value of ‘Openness’. 
These surveys culminate annually in “The Great Debate” in which
around 1,400 people from across the Group took part in 2005.

This enables us to monitor and measure our progress on a wide
range of issues, including how well we engage with our people to
recognise and value the contributions they make to our business, 
to help them develop and fulfil their potential.
Specifically in response to feedback from the Great Debate, 
in 2005 we redoubled our efforts to improve the way we
communicate, beginning with around 250 of our senior managers
attending workshops designed to demonstrate the “Power of
Engagement”. By the end of 2005 around 2,000 managers and
supervisors had attended these workshops. Good two-way
communication must be the hallmark of our business leaders 
and the benefits of this are increasingly evident in the satisfaction
and performance of our people.
Health and Safety
Carillion has an absolute commitment to ensuring that all our
people can work safely at all times, wherever they are. This
commitment extends to those who work with us and those who
could be affected by our activities, including members of the public.
This requires the continual vigilance and commitment of everyone
involved in our activities to ensure that safe working practices are
always used. This is supported by rigorous reviews, inspections,
training and education, all of which are actively promoted and led
by the Board.
At the end of 2004, we launched a radical new initiative, Target
Zero, aimed at eliminating reportable accidents by 2010. This is an
ambitious target, but we are determined to create a culture of zero
tolerance to accidents, not only within Carillion, but also within 
our stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and partners.
Tragically, five people were killed while working on projects under
Carillion’s management control during 2005. These accidents
reinforce our commitment to make Target Zero a reality and its
benefits are already evident. Our Accident Frequency Rate (AFR),
reduced by 35 per cent in 2005 to 0.24 (2004: 0.37). The number
of RIDDOR accidents (Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous
Occurrences Regulations 1995) for the Group reduced by 27 per
cent in 2005 to 255 (2004:348). We say more about Health and
Safety in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of this report
on page 26. More detailed information can also be found in our
2005 Sustainability Report, which has been published on our
website at www.carillionplc.com/sustainability.
Sustainability
We believe that our commitment to responsible business practices
that create positive impacts on the environment and on the
communities in which we operate, is not only good for our own
people and for society in general, but also makes good business
sense. It is fundamental to delivering sustainable, profitable growth.
Our commitment to becoming a more sustainable company began
over ten years ago. Today, we are one of the recognised leaders in
developing and adopting socially responsible business practices and
for demonstrating that these practices can have measurable
business benefits. We benchmark our performance in a number 
of ways, including participating in Business in the Community’s
Corporate Responsibility Index, an independent annual survey of
sustainability performance. Since its inception in 2003, Carillion 
has each year been ranked first in its sector and in the top quartile
of all companies participating in the Index.
Our strategy model, which helps us to map and quantify the 
links between our business objectives and our impacts on the
environment and society, continues to form the basis for our
sustainability programme by identifying the areas where we need 
to improve our performance. 
You can read more about this programme and the benefits it 
delivers for our business in the Corporate Social Responsibility
section of this report on page 26. More detailed information can
also be found in our 2005 Sustainability Report, which has been

Strategic objectives 
In order to build on our success in 2005, we have set the 
following strategic objectives for 2006:
Attract, develop and retain excellent people, by becoming 
an employer of choice;
Successfully integrate Carillion and Mowlem;
Achieve cost synergies at a minimum running rate of 
£10 million per annum by the end of 2006, and be on course 
to achieve a minimum running rate of £15 million per annum 
by the end of 2007;
Reduce net debt to circa £200 million by the end of 2006 and 
be on course to reduce it to below £100 million by the end of
2007;
Be on track to deliver materially enhanced earnings for the

Carillion Business Services comprises our UK building, facilities
management (FM) and other Support Services activities.
These activities generated approximately £1.2 billion of revenue
(including joint ventures) in 2005 (2004: £769 million), a 
56 per cent increase on 2004, driven mainly by a strong
performance in UK building and the acquisition of PME.
Business Services had a very successful year, more than doubling 
the value of its order book at the year-end to £2 billion 
(2004: £821 million), as a result of winning a number of significant
new orders and the acquisition of PME, which contributed some
£180 million to our year-end order book. In the Defence sector, 
we made a major breakthrough by winning, with our joint venture
partners, two support services contracts for Defence Estates,
together worth around £1.2 billion over a period of up to 10 years.
In addition, Carillion’s joint venture, Monteray, won a three-year
extension to its contract with BT to provide integrated facilities
management services, worth some £350 million. 
In UK building, we won substantial new orders in our chosen
sectors, worth some £1.1 billion. We were particularly successful 
in the education sector: we reached financial close on a PPP project
to build nine new schools in Renfrewshire, with a construction value 
of £100 million and in which we expect to invest approximately 
£4 million of equity; we secured a £100 million contract to provide
design and construction services for six new schools in Leeds; and 
a Carillion joint venture was appointed preferred bidder for a PPP
project to build six new schools in South Ayrshire. We expect to
invest around £3 million of equity in the latter project, which will

Markets and Outlook
Business Services
In 2005, CarillionEnterprise, a joint
venture in which Carillion has a 50%
interest, was awarded the Regional
Prime Central contract by Defence
Estates. This contract involves the
maintenance and refurbishment of
around 8,500 buildings and other
infrastructure for the Ministry of
Defence, stretching from the Scottish
boarder south through the North of
England to the Humber, Midlands and
all of Wales. RAF valley, Anglesey, one
of the UK’s busiest military airfields, is
pictured opposite.
The provision of these services, 
which include planned and reactive
maintenance of buildings and other
facilities, is expected to generate over
£500 million of revenue for the joint
venture over the life of the contract,
initially 7 years, but extendable to
10 years. 
In addition to providing a wide range
of support services under the Regional
Prime Central contract, Carillion also
expects to carry out construction 
work to provide new buildings and
infrastructure with a potential value 
of up to £200 million over the life of
the contract. Section 04

also add over £73 million to our construction order book when 
it reaches financial close in 2006.
In addition, our UK building business was awarded a £230 million
contract to provide three new printing plants for News International
and a £118 million contract for the British Nuclear Group to construct
a store for materials arising from decommissioning at Sellafield. 
In 2005, our building business generated some 84 per cent of its
revenue from 20 customers, reflecting our focus on long-term key
customers. With around 80 per cent of our UK building order book
for 2006 already secure, we expect a similarly high percentage of
revenue to come from our top 20 customers in 2006. 
Business Services entered 2006 in a strong position to deliver
further growth, particularly from integrated solutions for public
sector customers in the Defence, Education and Health markets, as
well as from the retail, offices and mixed use developments sectors
of the commercial building market. Notable new opportunities 
in 2006 include reaching financial close on two major PPP projects
for which Mowlem is the preferred bidder – the £7 billion Allenby
Connaught project to provide Army accommodation in the South 
of England and a £1.1 billion project to provide a new Permanent
Joint Headquarters for the Ministry of Defence – for which the
concession periods are 35 years and 25 years, respectively. We 
also expect new opportunities in the growing nuclear market,
following the creation of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.
Carillion has considerable experience as a supplier of construction
and support services in this market and Mowlem also has useful
skills and experience, which complement those of Carillion.
With the acquisition of Mowlem enhancing the strong positions 
we already hold in our existing UK building and support services
markets, and creating a strong presence in other markets, such as
Defence and UK regional building, the outlook for Business Services 
is positive.

Markets and Outlook
Health
In the health market, we provide a range of construction and
facilities management services, including integrated solutions
focused primarily on PPP hospitals and Independent Sector
Treatment Centres (ISTC).
These activities generated £146 million of revenue (including 
joint ventures) in 2005 (2004: £119 million), with the increased
contributions from both construction and support services. 
Carillion Health made good progress in 2005, winning new orders
that nearly doubled the value of its order book to £1.1 billion 
at the year end (2004: £592 million), including two particularly
notable successes. In December 2005, we reached financial close 
on the Queen Alexandra hospital PPP project in Portsmouth, worth
approximately £1.1 billion to Carillion over the 33-year concession
period, of which some £470 million is included in our Health order
Public Private Partnership (PPP)
hospitals, like The Great Western in
Swindon, shown here, are examples 
of how Carillion can provide fully
integrated solutions, including 
private finance, design, construction,
maintenance and facilities
management services throughout 
the lives of these hospitals. 
Carillion is a joint venture partner 
and equity holder in The Hospital
Company, which has the 27-year
concession contract with the Swindon
and Marlborough NHS Trust, under
which it has overall responsibility for
the construction and maintenance of
the hospital and for the provision of
non-clinical services.
We have invested some £6 million 
of equity in this project. This
investment is one of a portfolio 
of 29 investments in PPP projects,
including nine hospitals, that is 
creating substantial value for Carillion.
At The Great Western hospital,
Carillion is providing a wide range of
non-clinical services including building
and grounds maintenance, catering,
cleaning, portering, reception and
helpdesk. The provision of these
services is expected to generate over
£200 million of revenue for Carillion
over the 27-year concession contract.
Carillion designed and built The Great
Western hospital at a capital cost of
some £100 million. The contract for
this 490-bed acute hospital was
completed on time and to budget 
in 2002. A major benefit of PPP
procurement is that it encourages
innovation. At The Great Western,
Carillion used its sector leading
knowledge and skills in sustainable
development to create one of the 
UK’s most sustainable buildings.

book. In addition, Carillion will invest some £12 million of equity 
in this project, on which we expect to make financial returns in line
with our normal PPP investment criteria. A Carillion joint venture
was also appointed the preferred bidder by the Bedfordshire and
Hertfordshire Primary Care Trust for new ISTC facilities, involving
some £48 million of construction and services worth around 
£119 million over a five-year period.
The outlook for our Health business continues to be positive,
particularly in our two key market sectors of PPP acute hospitals
and ISTCs. The UK Government has reaffirmed its commitment to 
a substantial programme of PPP hospitals, worth between £7 billion
and £9 billion. Carillion Health is currently shortlisted for one 
new PPP hospital and will be bidding for further hospitals in this
programme as they come to market. The Government is also
committed to a second wave of ISTCs, including 24 surgical 
centres, plus eight regional contracts and one national 
contract for diagnostic services, with a combined value of 
some £3 billion over the next five years. 
We expect to bid for a number of these new centres and 
contracts in 2006. 
Carillion’s strong presence and successful track record will be
further enhanced by the acquisition of Mowlem, which has 
six Local Improvement Finance Trust (LIFT) contracts. The 
acquisition of Mowlem will also increase the number of people 
we have with specialist private finance skills and therefore our
capacity to bid for PPP hospitals and ISTCs. Consequently, the
outlook for our Health business also remains positive.
01 The Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth, 
our ninth PPP hospital, is a 1 ,200 bed hospital that
will replace three existing acute treatment centres 
when it fully opens in July 2010.

Markets and Outlook
Transport
Carillion Transport is focused on the provision and maintenance 
of rail and road infrastructure. These activities contributed some
£580 million of revenue (including joint ventures) to the Group in
2005 (2004: £713 million), with the reduction on 2004 due to the
effect of transferring to Network Rail maintenance contracts that
generated around £150 million of revenue in 2004.
At 31 December 2005, the value of our Transport order book 
and framework contracts was £817 million (December 2004: 
£888 million). The reduction in order book reflects the expected
trend in the UK rail infrastructure market, particularly for major
projects, as we indicated in our 2005 interim results announcement.
Nevertheless, during 2005 a joint venture, in which Carillion has a
50 per cent interest, was awarded a £110 million contract for rail
electrification on the West Coast Mainline and orders for smaller
regional rail projects and track renewals have remained at a
satisfactory level.
The Public Private Partnership (PPP)
project for the A249 improvement,
pictured opposite, is another example
of how Carillion can use its wide range
of skills and resources to provide a fully
integrated solution, including private
finance, design, construction, and
maintenance.
Carillion is a joint venture partner 
and equity holder in Sheppey Route
Limited, which has a 30-year
concession contract with the 
Highways Agency, under which it has
overall responsibility for the design,
construction and maintenance of 
the project. We have a commitment 
to invest some £3 million of equity in
this project.
Carillion is already maintaining part 
of the A249 project route and will
maintain all 17 km of the route 
when construction work is completed
in June 2006. This will include
inspections, routine maintenance and
repairs. These services are expected to
generate £18 million of revenue for
Carillion over the life of the concession.
Carillion is also responsible for the
design and construction of the A249
project at a capital cost of some £82
million. This involves building 5.6 km 
of new road, including the 1.3 km
Swale Crossing, connecting the Isle of
Sheppey with North Kent. The project
also involves extensive archaeological
and ecological protection and
improvement measures.

While the outlook in the UK rail market is expected to remain
challenging, planned investment by Network Rail is still substantial 
at approximately £11 billion over the period 2006 to 2008. The
acquisition of Mowlem will increase Carillion’s already strong presence
in this market, where we remain focused on increasing our market
share and on reducing costs to protect margins. After a slower than
expected start to the outsourcing of rail infrastructure work in
Scandinavia, we are now making progress in this market. We expect
this to continue in 2006, as the market is forecast to double in size
over the next two years to around £600 million per annum.
In highways maintenance, we expect to maintain our 10 per cent
share of the £1 billion per annum Highways Agency market and 
to target opportunities for further growth in the Local Authority
market, worth around £750 million per annum. 
In road construction, the £122 million Early Contractor Involvement
(ECI) project to upgrade the A74 between Carlisle and Guardsmill
to motorway standard is expected to move into the construction
phase during the second quarter of 2006. The acquisition of
Mowlem, which has been particularly successful in winning six 
ECI road contracts to date with a total value of over £350 million,
will significantly strengthen our presence in this market. 
Overall, the outlook in Transport remains stable.
01 Carillion is making good progress with the first
private finance project on the the UK rail network to
extend and upgrade Marylebone Station and sections 
of track and signalling to improve the speed and
frequency of passenger services for Chiltern Railways.

Markets and Outlook
International Regions
Our international regional businesses in the Middle East, Canada
and the Caribbean are focused on selected construction markets
and on their growing support services and PPP activities. These
businesses contributed £299 million of revenue to the Group in
2005 (2004: £349 million). The reduction in revenue was due to the
sale in November 2004 of our contracting business in France, which
contributed some £160 million of revenue in that year. However,
this reduction was offset by substantial growth in our remaining
international regions, notably in the Middle East and Canada.
2005 was another successful year for new orders. The value of 
our international order book increased by over 11 per cent to 
£1.23 billion at 31 December 2005 (2004: £1.1 billion) and more
than treble its value at December 2003. Notable successes in 2005
included construction orders for Dubai Festival City worth around
£150 million and new highways maintenance contracts in Ontario,
Canada worth £130 million. This was followed early in 2006 by our
Carillion is providing two of the 
first Public Private Partnership (PPP)
hospitals in Canada – the New
Brampton hospital (part of the 
William Osler Health Centre) pictured
right, a 608 bed acute care hospital
near Toronto, and the Royal Ottawa
hospital, a 188 bed psychiatric hospital.
Carillion is a joint venture partner 
and equity holder in The Healthcare
Infrastructure Company of Canada Inc.,
which has the concession contracts
with the William Osler Health Centre
and the Royal Ottawa Health Care
Group. Under these concessions, the
joint venture has overall responsibility
for the construction and maintenance
of the hospitals and the provision of
non-clinical services. We are committed
to invest some £5.4 million of equity in
these projects.
When the New Brampton and Ottawa
hospitals open, Carillion will provide a
wide range of non-clinical services for
these hospitals, including catering,
laundry, housekeeping, portering,
security, waste management and
building maintenance. 
Provision of these services is expected
to generate some £500 million of
revenue for Carillion over the 25-year
concession contract for the New
Brampton hospital, and around £75
million over the 21-year concession
contract for the Royal Ottawa hospital.
Construction of both the New
Brampton and Royal Ottawa hospitals
is being carried out in joint venture
with a local partner. At the New
Brampton hospital, we are providing
diagnostic, treatment and in-patient
facilities at a capital cost of some 
£225 million, with construction due 
for completion in July 2007. At the
Royal Ottawa, we are providing
psychiatric in-patient facilities at a
capital cost of around £63 million 
that are due for completion in
December 2006.

appointment as preferred bidder for a further highway maintenance
contract in Canada worth £137 million, which will extend our
operations to Alberta.
With a strong order book, our international regional businesses 
are already on track to deliver further growth in 2006. They also
remain well positioned in good growth markets, especially in
Canada and the Middle East. In Canada, where construction of 
our two PPP hospitals – the William Osler in Toronto and the Royal
Ottawa – is progressing well, we expect to bid for further PPP
hospitals as the next wave of projects comes to market in 2006.
Our highways maintenance business in Canada will also be
targeting further contracts in Alberta and in British Columbia as
these Provinces progressively outsource highways maintenance
work to the private sector. 
In the Middle East, growth in construction activity is forecast to
continue, with much of this being generated by the Dubai Festival
City development for which our joint venture business is well
positioned. In addition, we shall be targeting opportunities in other
countries in the region, such as Abu Dhabi, where construction
activity is also forecast to grow. 
The acquisition of Mowlem brings new international businesses 
to the Group in Australia and South East Asia. The sale of 
Charter, Mowlem’s US construction business, to Balfour Beatty 
was announced on 18 January 2006 and we expect this to be
completed in the second quarter of 2006, subject to due diligence
by Balfour Beatty.

Accounting policies
These are the Group’s first annual consolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The Group’s IFRS accounting policies have been applied in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year to 
31 December 2005, the comparative information for the year 
to 31 December 2004 and the preparation of an opening IFRS
balance sheet at 1 January 2004 (the date of transition from UK
GAAP to IFRS).
Profit allocation
On construction contracts profit is recognised broadly in proportion
to revenue after taking into account the remaining risks and
uncertainties. In addition, on major construction contracts we 
take no profit on the first 20 per cent of revenue and this profit 
is deferred until contracts are completed. This method, which 
better reflects the risk profile of our construction activities, 
reduced reported profit in Construction Services by £5.4 million 
in 2005 (2004: £3.3 million). The total deferal of £8.7 million is
carried forward at 31 December 2005. 
Interest and cash
The Group net interest credit of £4.0 million (2004: £4.1 million)
reflects an average net cash position of £37 million, net of average
finance leases of £31 million.
Net cash at 31 December 2005 was £90.8 million after finance 
lease liabilities of £37.7 million (31 December 2004: net cash 
£128.8 million, after finance leases of £24.2 million). Strong cash
generation of £84 million from operations and dividends of £8 million
received from jointly controlled businesses continue to demonstrate
our focus on cash management and the resilience of our business. 
Capital expenditure of £38 million included £13 million of investment
in our previously announced project to outsource business processes
in Human Resources and Finance, which is progressing well and on
schedule for completion in 2006.
Dividend payments in 2005 were £16 million and corporate tax
paid was £19 million.
Jointly controlled businesses
An important part of our strategy for Public Private Partnership 
(PPP) and large construction projects is the development of jointly
controlled businesses that enable us to structure the resource 
and risk profiles of these activities to generate reliable returns. 
Our share of these businesses generated £259 million of turnover
and £20.3 million of operating profit during 2005. The interest 
credit of £1.1 million relating to joint ventures is £4.5 million 
ahead of 2004 and reflects the effects of selling our equity interest
in the M40 project in June 2004 and of reclassifying our joint
venture interest in the Nottingham Express Transit project as a 
trade investment.
Growth in construction joint ventures, notably that responsible 
for our Dubai Festival City projects, and in profit from PPP projects,
resulted in profit before tax of £21.4 million (2004: £9.6 million)
and profit after tax of £16.4 million (2004: £7.4 million).
Taxation
The Group’s effective rate of tax on underlying profit returned 
to a more normal level of 27 per cent in 2005, having reduced to 
21 per cent in 2004 due to a number of one-off tax settlements in
2004 relating to prior years. We have £65 million of corporate tax
losses in the UK, none of which are recognised as a deferred tax
asset, that are potentially available to reduce future tax liabilities. 
Amortisation of intangible assets 
Amortisation of intangible assets relating to business acquisitions
was £2.5 million, which relates to the £6.2 million of intangible
assets arising from the acquisition of PME.
Non-operating items 
The Group’s share of results of jointly controlled entities includes 
an exceptional loss of £0.8 million relating to the disposal of the
remainder of our joint venture plant hire business (2004: profit of
£1.7 million, which included a related tax credit of £0.2million).
Pensions
The Group’s ongoing pensions charge in 2005, calculated on the
basis of IAS19, was £21.3 million (2004: £27.0 million). The
reduction on 2004 mainly reflects a reduction in number of active
scheme members. The Group’s pension schemes had a net deficit 
of £47.5 million at 31 December 2005 (2004: £59.7 million) and we
propose to discuss with the trustees proposals to reduce this deficit.

the performance of PME has met our expectations, contributing 
£3.5 million towards Group operating profit on revenue of 
£148.7 million.
Following the acquisition of Mowlem plc on 23 February 2006 
for a total consideration of approximately £341 million, comprising
£117 million in cash and 65.8 million new ordinary Carillion shares,
we are in the process of evaluating the fair value of net assets
acquired. This process is progressing satisfactorily.

In this segment we report the equity returns on our investments 
in Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects.
At 31 December 2005, we had 19 financially closed projects 
in our portfolio, having added two new projects during the 
year – Renfrewshire schools and Queen Alexandra hospital,
Portsmouth – in which we will invest a total of approximately 
£16 million of equity. 
Our portfolio of equity investments continues to generate
significant value for the Group. The increase in operating profit
reflects an improved performance across our portfolio, together
with a reduction in overheads and bid costs. This improvement 
more than offset the effect on operating profit of selling our
investment in the M40 motorway project in 2004. Due to this 
sale, the interest charge relating to joint ventures also reduced,
resulting in a substantial increase in profit from operations.
Equity investments in PPP projects are typically valued by
discounting the cash flows they will generate over the lives of
concession contracts. Based on discounting cash flows at 10 per
cent and 8 per cent, our portfolio of investments in financially
closed projects had valuations at December 2005 of £89 million
and £115 million, respectively. These valuations have increased
(2004: £83 million and £103 million) as a result of reaching
financial close on the Renfrewshire schools and Queen Alexandra
hospital projects. The value we are creating through our PPP equity
portfolio will continue to increase, because we are committed to
invest a further £31 million of equity in our financially closed
projects, in addition to the £29 million already invested. Beyond
this, we have a good pipeline of new projects, including two for
which we are the preferred bidder, in which we expect to invest
around £7 million of equity, and five for which we are shortlisted,
with a potential equity requirement of up to £33 million. 
The acquisition of Mowlem also adds substantial value to our PPP
portfolio. Mowlem has 10 financially closed PPP projects in which 
it has either already invested, or commitments to invest, some 
£51 million. It also has three projects for which it is the preferred
bidder, in which it expects to invest around £77 million of equity
and is shortlisted for two projects with a potential equity
requirement of up to £29 million.

Operating profit increased by 35 per cent and the operating margin
rose from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent. This was achieved despite
the effect of introducing, in the second half of 2004, a new
method by which we recognise profit on major construction
contracts. Previously, profit was recognised broadly in proportion to
revenue after taking account of risks and uncertainties. In addition,
we now take no profit on the first 20 per cent of revenue and this
profit is deferred until contracts are completed. The effect of this in
2005 has been to reduce reported operating profit by £5.4 million
(2004: £3.3 million). Total deferred profit relating to this change at
31 December 2005 was £8.7 million, which we expect to begin
releasing to profit in 2007 as contracts reach completion.

Network Rail.
In this segment we report the results of our activities in rail
infrastructure, roads maintenance, facilities management and 
other support services.
Revenue in Support Services increased by nearly 8 per cent, as 
the acquisition of PME and organic growth more than offset a
reduction in revenue from our rail infrastructure activities. The 
latter was largely due to transferring to Network Rail maintenance
contracts that generated around £150 million in 2004. Organic
growth was driven primarily by road maintenance in Canada and
the UK. Growth in Canada has been particularly strong following
our success in winning contracts in Ontario, where we have
established a market leading position. Since the year-end, we 
have built on that success by winning a further contract that will
extend our operations to Alberta.
Operating profit increased by £0.9 million (excluding the
£7.2 million one-off increase in profit in 2004, relating to the
transfer of rail maintenance to Network Rail) and the operating
margin reduced from 4.3 per cent to 4.1 per cent, reflecting the
loss of rail maintenance contracts, which had higher than average
margins in this segment. 
PME performed in line with our expectations, contributing 
£149 million of revenue and £3.5 million of operating profit in 
the year, following its acquisition in March 2005. 
New bank facility
In connection with the acquisition of Mowlem plc a new committed
bank facility totalling £490 million has been arranged. Of this
amount, £190 million is repayable at the end of five years, 
£250 million is repayable over five years and £50 million is 
available for 364 days with a six month term-out option.  Section 04
Operating and Financial Review

Treasury policy and risk management
The Group has a centralised Treasury function whose primary role
is to manage funding, liquidity and financial risks. In addition,
Treasury sources and administers contract bond and guarantee
facilities for the Group. Treasury is not a profit centre and does not
enter into speculative transactions. The Board sets policies within
which Treasury operates that ensure the most effective financing 
of the Group’s operations and limit exposure to financial risk.
The areas of significant financial risk facing the Group relate to
funding and liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rates.
Funding and liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to avoid carrying significant net debt over the
long term. Carillion plc’s principal borrowing facility is a syndicated
loan facility led by The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and short term
overdraft and money market facilities are provided by a group of
relationship banks. Finance and operating leases are also employed
to fund longer-term assets. The quantum of committed borrowing
facilities available to the Group is regularly reviewed and is designed
to satisfy the requirements of the Group’s business plan.
Currency risk
The Group hedges all significant currency transaction exposures
using foreign exchange risk management techniques. In order to
protect the Group’s balance sheet from the impact of exchange 
rate volatility, foreign currency net assets are hedged using
matching currency loans, where these assets exceed the 
equivalent of £10 million. Profits arising within overseas subsidiaries
are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution. 
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and
hedged accordingly.
Interest rate risk
Borrowing facilities are designed primarily to finance the acquisition
of Mowlem plc and short-term working capital requirements and
are at floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR. The Group has not
entered into interest rate derivatives to fix or hedge interest rate 
risk and none are outstanding. Certain longer-term assets have
been financed using fixed rate leases.
Carillion has equity in a number of PPP joint venture Special
Purpose Companies (SPC). SPCs obtain funding for these projects 
in the form of long-term bank loans or corporate bonds without
recourse to the joint venture partners and secured on the assets 
of the SPC. A number of SPCs have entered into interest rate
derivatives as means of hedging interest rate risk. These derivatives
are interest rate swaps that fix the rate of interest payable and an
interest rate cap and collar that limits the maximum and minimum
interest rates payable.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that, after making enquiries, they have a
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Chris Girling
Finance Director
8 March 2006
On the UK rail network we carry out a
wide range of projects to upgrade and
renew the infrastructure, including track,
signalling, electricification and stations. For more than 10 years we have set the pace in our sector when it
comes to applying the principles of sustainable development. We
have consistently demonstrated that sustainable and responsible
business practices help us to deliver our business objectives. 
Our ability to have a positive effect on the environment and on the
communities in which we work is a key differentiator for Carillion,
helping us to win orders, minimise our Social, Environmental and
Ethical Risks, control costs and deliver better services to customers.
The following summary of the progress we have made towards
becoming a more sustainable business is supported by a more
detailed account in our 2005 Sustainability Report, which has been
published on our website at www.carillionplc.com/sustainability.
In 2005, we continued to base our sustainability programme and
objectives on the strategy model we first published in 2001. This
model helps us understand how the delivery of our business
objectives is supported by improving the effects we have on the
environment and the communities in which we operate. Our 2005
sustainability objectives were based on nine specific and measurable
Group targets against which our average, externally verified, score
was 91 per cent. We have also continued to benchmark our
performance through participating in Business in the Community’s
Corporate Social Responsibility Index: in the 2005 Index, Carillion
was ranked first in its sector and in the top quartile of all
participating companies, positions we have held since the inception
of this Index in 2003.
A new challenge
In March 2005, the UK Government set a new challenge for
business when it published its Sustainable Development Strategy,
Securing the Future. This strategy identifies four priority areas for
sustainable development:
Sustainable communities;
Natural resource protection and environmental enhancement;
Climate change and energy; and
Sustainable consumption and production.
To strengthen our leadership in sustainable development we have
realigned our own sustainability strategy and programme for 2006
with the Government’s new strategy. To do this we consulted
widely, both externally and internally, engaging all our people in 
the task, because becoming a more sustainable business ultimately
depends on their understanding and commitment. 
As a result, we have identified the business behaviours and 
activities that have most impact on the four priority areas of
Securing the Future, as illustrated in the “Sun” diagram above. 
Our sustainability strategy model has been redefined to relate these
behaviours and impacts to the Group’s business objectives and 
we have also identified new ways of measuring the benefits of
becoming a more sustainable business. In 2005, we also developed
a “Tool Kit” specifically to help our marketing and work-winning
teams demonstrate to customers the benefits of choosing
sustainable solutions that meet their business needs. 
Managing Sustainability 
Our commitment to sustainability continues to be driven by our
Board, which is advised by a Sustainability Committee. Following
the retirement in 2005 of Sir Neville Simms, this committee is now
chaired by our chief executive, John McDonough and a number 
of managing directors of our business units have joined the
committee to strengthen its links with the Group’s operational
activities. The committee also continues to benefit from expert
guidance and advice provided by two external advisors – Jonathon
Porritt, Chair of the UK Government’s Sustainable Development
Commission, and David Cowans, Chief Executive of Places for
People Group, a major social housing association.

Health and Safety
Target Zero is the high-profile campaign we launched in October
2004 with the aim of reducing reportable injuries to zero by 2010. 
Target Zero takes a structured approach to managing Health and
Safety and to creating a safety focused culture. To do this we
introduced a Health and Safety management model that enables 
us to develop plans to improve and measure our performance. 
This model, which is based on British Standard 8800 (Occupational
health and safety management systems – Guide), has the four main
principles or elements to which we aspire, namely:
Awareness – all our people and stakeholders should have an
awareness and understanding of Health and Safety hazards and
risks that affect our business;
Competence – all our people and stakeholders should have the
competence to undertake their work with minimum risks to
Health and Safety;
Compliance – our work activities must comply with legislation,
and our people are empowered to take action to minimise
Health and Safety risks;
Excellence – Carillion will become recognised for excellence in
the way it manages Health and Safety.
Within each element of the model, we have identified a number 
of specific actions and targets. Having adopted the model within
Carillion, we are now rolling it out to our supply chain, with
suppliers having to demonstrate that they are achieving the
standards we require.
The results of Target Zero have been significant. In 2005, we
achieved our lowest ever Accident Frequency Rate of 0.24, which
represents the number of injuries per 100,000 hours worked, as
reported under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous
Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR), a 35 per cent reduction
on 2004.
In 2005, we reported 255 injuries under RIDDOR, 162 involving
Carillion employees and 93 involving subcontractors and others, 
an overall reduction of 27 per cent on 2004. Tragically there were
five fatal injuries, including one Carillion employee and four
employees of sub-contractors, and 62 other major injuries, involving
34 Carillion employees and 28 employees of sub-contractors. We
therefore have some way to go to eradicate reportable injuries, but
we are determined to do so and our commitment to Target Zero
remains absolute. 
Environment
Our partnership with The Wildlife Trusts is now in its fifth year. 
The Carillion Natural Habitats Fund continues to go from strength
to strength. In 2005, we worked on five new projects with Trusts
local to Carillion’s business activities. For example, we are working
with The Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country to
produce an atlas of reptiles and amphibians in the area. To date, 
we have contributed £125,000 to the Wildlife Trusts, sponsoring 
26 projects and providing opportunities for our people to work 
with a number of different Trusts.
Managing and reducing waste is an important aspect of
environmental protection and we are working hard to minimise 
the waste we generate and send to landfill. On projects such as 
the new John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, we are now re-using 
or recycling over 90 per cent of construction waste. 
We have developed a biodiversity framework along with simple
guidance for everyone working in locations where they need to
consider plants, natural habitats and the behaviours of animals. 
For example, a highways maintenance team is working with local
wildlife groups to encourage biodiversity along the M40 motorway,
which Carillion maintains between its junction with theM25 and
Warwick. This includes supporting and monitoring the kestrel
population, an initiative featured on the BBC programme British
Isles: A Natural History. 
Carbon emissions are a significant measure of environmental
performance. We have continued to reduce CO
2
emissions from
Carillion buildings and CO
2
emissions per vehicle in our company
car fleet, through awareness, energy management and Group-wide
transport and car policies. 
Communities
Carillion continues to be a member of Business in the Community’s
(BitC) PerCent Club of companies that contribute over one per cent
of their profits in cash or in kind to community activities. The new
community engagement strategy we introduced in 2004 continues
to provides practical guidance to our people on how we can be a
force for good in the locations where we work. From on-site job
centres and training, to involvement with local schools like St
John’s, in Caterham, Surrey, where we built an agility trail and quiet
area in the school grounds. In another initiative, we supported the
Lollipop Appeal at Darent Valley hospital, Carillion’s first PPP
hospital that opened in 2000, by arranging a five-a-side football
competition to raise funds for a children’s High Dependency Unit. 
In Wales, a team from Carillion Roads worked in partnership with
the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) and Ferndale School
to trial the first pilot GCSE Construction course.
As one of the UK’s leading providers of training for support services
and construction skills, Carillion makes a major contribution to the
development of individuals and communities. In 2005, around 3000
people attended courses at our 16 UK training centres and some
800 apprentices qualified with NVQs.
Further afield, in response to the Tsunami disaster on Boxing Day
2004, Carillion became a corporate sponsor of the charity RedR,
which sources, trains and places people with the professional skills
and resources required by the main aid agencies to provide disaster
relief and recovery. In addition to donating cash, our support
included seconding one of our own water engineers to Oxfam 
to work in Sri Lanka for six months immediately after the 
Tsunami struck. 
The year also saw our third successful Sustainability Week, which
was arranged to coincide with World Environmental Day in June.
Over 150 events took place across the Group, demonstrating 
that corporate social responsibility and a culture of sustainability 
are embedded more firmly than ever at the heart of our
organisation. Success in creating a successful and sustainable
business depends primarily on the quality and commitment of our
people. In 2005, 518 Carillion employees won Values awards in 
recognition of their efforts in “going the extra mile” to exceed 
the expectations of our customes. They showed that by living 
our values we can make a real, tangible difference to the quality 
of the services we provide and to the performance of our business.  1 3

General principles
The Board is firmly committed to high standards of corporate
governance. During the year to 31 December 2005, the Company
complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (July 2003), as detailed below and
in the Remuneration Report. 
Ethics and Business Integrity Policy
Carillion has a clear and unequivocal approach to business integrity
and ethics which underlies the Group’s values of openness,
collaboration, mutual dependency, professional delivery, focus on
sustainable, profitable growth and innovation. The policy requires
Carillion to conduct its business to the highest ethical standards.
It applies to all employees and the way Carillion delivers this policy 
is and will be reflected in the way the Group competes for business,
through the quality and value of its work and through the reliability
and reputation of its employees.
The policy is:
• business integrity: we do not give or accept bribes. We do not 
sanction or accept any illegal payments, allowances, or gifts-in-
kind. We will investigate fully all alleged breaches. We will dismiss 
any employee who has breached this policy;
• mutual respect: we do what we say we will do. We treat our 
people fairly and with respect at all times, avoiding discrimination 
and bullying. We provide a safe and healthy working environment,
and respect sustainable principles in all our dealings;
• trust: we engender trust within our work groups and companies, 
respecting diverse traditions and cultures. We respect the trust 
placed in us by others, not least when we are asked to take 
responsibility for aspects of their business or resources. We 
maintain and demand high professional standards and demand 
honesty and openness. We avoid conflicts of interest wherever 
possible, and we proactively declare any unavoidable conflicts 
for open scrutiny and resolution;
• legality: we respect the rule of law in all our dealings. We 
clearly communicate procedures for disciplining those who do 
not comply with the law or our standards and policies. We
maintain a system for confidential reporting of breaches of 
our standards and policies; and
• human rights: we support the belief that human rights are
universal and adhere to the principles of human rights in our
operations. We support the United Nations Universal 
Declaration on Human Rights.
Our policy is carried into our business through a series of detailed
procedures. They allow us to carry into practice our reputation for
conducting business to the highest ethical standard which is
essential to our relationships with customers, business partners,
employees, shareholders and the public. 
The Ethics and Business Integrity Policy and its implementation is
reviewed annually by the Board.
Directors
The Board
The Company is led by a Board comprising three Executive and 
four Non-Executive Directors. Throughout 2005, the Chairman 
and the Non-Executive Directors comprised more than half of the
Board and this continues to be the case. The Chairman and each 
of the Non-Executive Directors is considered to be independent of
management. They each have wide areas of experience and have 
no business or other relationship that could materially interfere 
with their independent judgement. David Garman is the Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director.
In accordance with the Combined Code, the Executive Directors’
service contracts are terminable by one year’s notice. 
A detailed internal evaluation of the Board’s corporate governance
procedures and compliance was again conducted in 2005 by the
Chairman in conjunction with the Company Secretary. The internal
evaluation took into account the views of each of the Directors on 
(i) the role of Directors, (ii) the performance of the Board, the
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, (iii) Board Committees,
(iv) leadership and culture, (v) Corporate Governance (vi) Directors’
remuneration, (vii) relations with shareholders and (viii) Board
accountability and audit. The Board at its meeting in October 2005
reviewed the results of the internal evaluation and, where required,
issues were acted upon in order to further enhance the effectiveness
of the Board’s procedures and working practices. 
This is the fourth year that this process has taken place and will be
repeated annually as the Board considers it satisfactory. In addition,
reviews of the performance of each of the Directors has taken place. 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief
Executive has been agreed by the Board and encompasses the
following parameters:
• the primary job of the Chairman of a public company is to provide
continuity, experience and governance while the Chief Executive 
provides leadership, energy, imagination and the driving force;
• the Chairman is viewed by investors as the ultimate steward of the
business and the guardian of the interests of the shareholders. 
Nonetheless, it is essential that the outline of their respective roles 
encourages the Chairman and Chief Executive to work well 
together to provide effective and complementary stewardship;
• the Chairman must:
– take overall responsibility for the composition and capability of
the Board;
– consult regularly with the Chief Executive and be available on a 
flexible basis for providing advice, counsel and support to the
Chief Executive;
• the Chief Executive must: 
– manage the Executive Directors and the Group’s day to 
day activities;
– prepare and present to the Board strategic options for growth 
in shareholder value;
– set the operating plans and budgets required to deliver the
agreed strategy;
– ensure that the Group has in place appropriate risk 
management and control mechanisms. Corporate Governance Report continued

The Board usually has a programme of seven meetings during the
year and also meets on an ad hoc basis as required. A formal
schedule of matters reserved to the Board for consideration and
decision is maintained. These matters include:
• statutory matters such as the approval of final and interim 
financial statements and the recommendation of dividends;
• appointments to and removals from the Board and the terms 
of reference and membership of Board committees;
• approval of Group strategy and annual budgets;
• approval of authority levels, financial and treasury policies;
• authorisation for any acquisition or disposal;
• review of the internal control arrangements and risk 
management strategies; and
• review of corporate governance arrangements.
All Directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is
responsible to the Board for ensuring that agreed procedures and
applicable rules and regulations are observed. The Board approves
the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary. 
Any Director may, in furtherance of his duties, take independent
professional advice when necessary, at the expense of the Company.
No such advice was sought during the year.
The Board is provided with regular and timely information on the
financial performance of businesses within the Group, and of the
Group as a whole, together with reports on trading matters,
markets, sustainability and other relevant issues.
Board Committees
The principal Board committees are the Remuneration Committee,
the Audit Committee and the Nominations Committee. The
Company Secretary acts as secretary to each of these committees.
The terms of reference of each of the Board committees are
available on the Carillion website at www.carillionplc.com or on
request from the Company Secretary.
The membership of each of the principal committees is as follows:

Other Board matters
Policy on external appointments
Recognising that external appointments can broaden their
knowledge and so be of benefit to the Company, Executive Directors
are permitted, at the discretion of the Board, to accept a limited
number of such appointments and retain the fees received for such
appointments. John McDonough was a Non-Executive Director of
Exel plc until he retired from the Board on 13 December 2005
following that company’s takeover. Chris Girling is a Non-Executive
Director of Elementis plc.
Nomination and remuneration of Directors
The appointment of a Director is a matter for resolution by the
Board as a whole, taking advice from the Nominations Committee.
For the Board appointments made in 2005, the Nominations
Committee used the services of executive recruitment consultants,
Odgers Ray & Berndtson. Details of potential candidates were
provided by Odgers Ray & Berndtson and initially reviewed by a 
sub-committee of the Nominations Committee. Meetings with
selected candidates were then held with Directors. Subsequently, 
the Nominations Committee met to recommend appointments
which were then approved by the Board.
In the case of Non-Executive Directors, initial appointments are for
three years; reappointment is subject to review and is not automatic. 
The fees of Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board 
as a whole, taking into account the commitment required and
participation in the work of committees and other advisory services
in relation to the business of the Group. In advising the Board on
such fees, it is the policy of the Executive Directors to seek
independent external advice concerning the appropriateness of 
the amounts by comparison with general practice. The level of 
fees currently payable to the Non-Executive Directors is based on
independent external advice.
The remuneration of the Directors is dealt with in the Remuneration
Report on pages 35 to 41.
Retirement of Directors by rotation
All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at 
least every three years. The Director retiring and seeking re-election
at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 10 May 2006 is 
Roger Robinson.
Additionally, new Directors are subject to election by shareholders at
the first opportunity following their appointment. Accordingly,
Vanda Murray and David Maloney will seek election at the 2006
Annual General Meeting.
The service contracts of the Executive Directors and the terms and
conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are
available for inspection at the registered office of the Company
during normal business hours on any weekday (bank holidays
excepted) and at the Annual General Meeting.
Induction and development of Directors
Directors are provided with a comprehensive information pack on
joining the Company and are advised of their legal and other duties
and obligations as a Director of a listed company. In addition, all
new Directors receive induction on their appointment covering such
matters as the operation and activities of the Group, the role of
the Board, the Company’s corporate governance procedures and
social, environmental and ethical (SEE) matters. Directors are also
briefed by the Company’s external advisors, where appropriate, on
changes to legislation or regulation or market practice as well as
receiving briefings from business groups throughout the year.
At least once a year, the Board visits an operational site and in
October 2005 the Directors visited the Group’s operations in
Canada. Directors are also encouraged to visit other operations
and staff. 
The regular updating of Directors’ skills and knowledge is
encouraged and a procedure has been established whereby the
Company Secretary is notified by Directors of their requirements
in this respect.
Relations with shareholders
In addition to communicating with shareholders generally from time
to time, the Executive Directors and the Director of Group Corporate
Communications meet regularly with representatives of major
shareholders in order to foster the mutual understanding of
objectives. The details of these meetings are reported to the Board.
The Chairman is available for meetings with representatives of major
shareholders as required.
Private and institutional shareholders are encouraged to attend the
Company’s Annual General Meeting.
The Company complies fully with the provisions of the Combined
Code in respect of the notice, content of agenda and conduct of its
Annual General Meetings. The Chairmen of the Remuneration and
Audit Committees will be present at the Annual General Meeting on
10 May 2006 to respond to shareholders’ questions.

Vanda Murray is a Director of Ultraframe plc. Vanda was appointed
to the Audit Committee in July 2005.
Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board.
The Audit Committee has in attendance at meetings, by invitation of
the Committee, Executive Directors, representatives of the external
auditor, (KPMG Audit Plc), the Group Head of Risk and the Head of
Internal Audit. It is also able to invite others as it requires from time
to time. The Committee also meets privately with both the external
and internal auditors.
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include: 
• the review of the annual and interim financial statements;
• consideration of the impact of changes to accounting regulations 
and the financial and accounting policies of the Carillion Group; 
• compliance with statutory and other external requirements;
• reviewing the role of the internal audit function and the results of 
its audit work and the response of management; 
• reviewing the scope and results of the external audit and its cost-
effectiveness;
• ensuring that the internal and external audit functions are 
complementary;
• monitoring the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditor and ensuring that the services provided (including non-
audit services) provide a proper balance between objectivity and 
value for money;
• recommending to the Board the external auditor to be proposed 
to shareholders for appointment.
The Committee is authorised by the Board to (i) seek any
information necessary to fulfil its duties (ii) call any member of staff
to be questioned at a meeting of the Committee as and when
required and (iii) obtain external professional advice, at the
Company’s expense, which might be necessary for the fulfilment 
of its duties. 
The members of the Committee receive fees as Non-Executive
Directors which also reflect their membership of the Audit
Committee and other Board committees. See page 36 for details.
Main activities of the Audit Committee in the year to 
31 December 2005
Financial statements
The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management and
the external auditors the annual and interim statements. In this
context, the Committee also reviews the written reports of KPMG 
on issues arising from the annual audit and the review of the 
interim results.
Internal controls
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of internal
control. This responsibility includes clearly determining the control
environment and reviewing annually the effectiveness of the internal
control system. However, such a system can provide only reasonable
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance for Directors Internal
Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, the Board
confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating
and managing the significant risks (both financial and non-financial
and including Corporate Social Responsibility risks) faced by the
Group (including joint ventures and overseas businesses). The
process has been in place for the year under review and up to the
date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts and is regularly
reviewed by the Board. 
Assurance over the design and operation of internal controls across
the Group is provided through a mix of techniques:
• Internal Audit carries out audits to assess the adequacy and 
effectiveness of internal controls over the key risks faced by the 
business and reports its findings to management, the Executive 
Directors and the Audit Committee. The Audit Plan is presented 
to and approved by the Audit Committee annually;
• recommendations to improve the system of control are made by 
Internal Audit. The implementation of these recommendations is 
followed up and reported on quarterly;
• Internal Audit independently reviews the risk identification 
procedures and control processes implemented by management; 
• a process of Control Risk Self-Assessment is used in the Group 
where Directors and senior managers are required to detail and 
certify controls in operation to ensure the control environment in 
their business areas is appropriate. They also confirm annually, in 
writing, that risk management processes and appropriate controls 
are in place and are operating effectively; and
• Internal Audit advises on aspects of the design and application of 
internal controls in key business projects and on policy and 
procedure changes.
Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Audit Committee reviews the assurance procedures and ensures
that the level of confidence required by the Board is obtained. It also
ensures the financial reporting process is credible and reliable. 
The Audit Committee presents its findings to the Board regularly 
and the Head of Internal Audit has direct access to the Audit
Committee members. 
An internal appraisal of Internal Audit was carried out during 2004
to ensure that it continued to meet the needs of its stakeholders 
and fulfill its governance role. This exercise involved extensive
consultation across the Carillion Group. As a result, minor
amendments to the resourcing and processes of Internal Audit were
implemented in 2005.
Risk Management
The Group Head of Risk is responsible for advising on strategic risk
issues across the Group, and for oversight of risk training. The Group
Head of Risk is also responsible for carrying out an independent
appraisal of all projects before submission to the Major Projects
Committee (see page 34). This appraisal ensures that the
differentiating factors of the Group’s offer have been properly
identified so maximising the opportunities available; it also involves
ensuring that all inherent and residual risks associated with the
project have been properly identified and considered. Corporate Governance Report continued
Section 06
Accountability
Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005
34
In addition, the Risk Forum, a committee of risk professionals from
each of the business groups, meets on a quarterly basis to assess the
strategic risks facing the Carillion Group. The conclusions of the Risk
Forum are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Major Projects Committee, a committee of the Board, acts 
as the sanctioning body for major commitments and transactions
including capital expenditure, major contracts and company and
business acquisitions and disposals. This committee has delegated
authority up to specified levels, beyond which Board approval 
is required.
Practical guidance for all staff is maintained in Group policy and
procedure documents regarding the authorisation levels for
commitments, contract selectivity and bidding, the provision of
guarantees, management accounting as well as reporting and
resolution of suspected fraudulent activities. Wherever possible, the
Board operates a policy of prosecuting individuals found to have
defrauded the Company or its subsidiaries. Learning points for
management are identified and action plans implemented to
minimise the recurrence of fraud. 
Employees are encouraged to raise genuine concerns about
malpractice at the earliest possible stage and a confidential
‘whistleblowing’ hotline provided by an independent third party 
is available.
Management is responsible for the identification and evaluation of
significant risks applicable to its areas of business together with the
design, operation and monitoring of suitable internal controls. These
risks are assessed on a continual basis and may be associated with a
variety of internal or external sources, including control breakdowns,
disruption in information systems, competition, corporate social
responsibility, natural catastrophe and regulatory requirements.
Management is also responsible for timely and accurate reporting of
business performance and for ensuring compliance with the policies
set by the Board in its areas of business. Regular performance review
meetings are held where management reports to the Executive
Directors on business performance, risk and internal control matters.
The results of these meetings are presented to the Board.
The Executive Directors report to the Board on material changes in
the business and the external environment that affect significant
risks. The Finance Director provides the Board with regular financial
information, which includes key performance indicators and a
summary of risk. Where areas for improvement are identified, the
Board considers the recommendations made both by the Executive
Directors and by the Audit Committee.
This report is reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.
Audit independence
The Audit Committee and Board place great emphasis on the
objectivity of the Group’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, in their reporting
to shareholders.
The KPMG audit director and manager are present at Audit
Committee meetings to ensure full communication of matters
relating to the audit.
The overall performance of the auditor is reviewed annually by the
Audit Committee, taking into account the views of management,
and feedback is provided to senior members of KPMG unrelated to
the audit. This activity also forms part of KPMG’s own system of
quality control. The Audit Committee also has discussions with the
auditor, without management being present, on the adequacy of
controls and on any judgmental areas. These discussions have
proved satisfactory to date.
The scope of the forthcoming year’s audit is discussed in advance 
by the Audit Committee. Audit fees are reviewed by the Audit
Committee after discussions between the businesses and the local
KPMG offices and are then referred to the Board for approval.
Rotation of audit director’s responsibilities within KPMG is required
by their profession’s ethical standards. The current audit director
responsible for the Carillion engagement is in his first year of signing
the report following appointment at the 2005 Annual General
Meeting. There is also rotation of key members within the 
audit team. 
Assignments awarded to KPMG and its associates have been and are
subject to controls by management that have been agreed by the
Audit Committee so that audit independence is not compromised. 
In summary, the procedures are:
• audit related services: as auditor this is the main area of work 
of KPMG and its associates. If any additional accounting support 
is required then this is considered competitively;
• tax consulting: in cases where they are best suited, Carillion uses 
KPMG and its associates but the Group also uses other tax 
consultancies. Significant pieces of tax work are evaluated 
competitively;
• general and systems consulting: all significant consulting projects 
are subject to competitive tender.
Other than audit, the Group Finance Director is required to give 
prior approval of work carried out by KPMG and its associates 
in excess of a predetermined threshold; part of this review is to
determine that other potential providers of the services have been
adequately considered.
These controls provide the Audit Committee with adequate
confidence in the independence of KPMG in their reporting on 
the audit of the Group.
Health and safety
A review of the Group’s progress on health and safety,
environmental and social performance is contained in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility section on pages 26 to 27.

Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005

This report has been prepared in accordance with the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (July 2003). 
The Board is responsible for determining policy for remuneration 
of the Directors of Carillion plc and key members of the senior
management team. The Remuneration Committee consists
exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors, namely David
Garman (Chairman), David Maloney and Vanda Murray and is
responsible for formulating policy and recommending to the Board
the remuneration of the Executive Directors. The Board determines
the fees of the Non-Executive Directors based on independent
external advice.
The Remuneration Committee is assisted in remuneration decisions
by Susan Morton, Group HR Director and by John McDonough,
Group Chief Executive. The Group Chief Executive is consulted on
the remuneration of his direct reports and other senior executives.
No Executive Director or employee is present when his or her
remuneration is being discussed.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee uses Deloitte & Touche
LLP to provide salary survey and benchmarking information.
Deloitte & Touche LLP which was appointed in 2005 has no other
connections with the Company.
Remuneration policy 
It is the policy of the Company to ensure that remuneration and
other benefits attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors and
senior managers of the required calibre to achieve the Board’s
objectives, including that of achieving growth in shareholder value.
Remuneration and other benefits are determined with regard to
competitive market practice and, where considered appropriate, are
supported by external independent surveys. The main elements of
remuneration of the Executive Directors are basic salary and pension
benefits, together with an annual bonus and share based incentives
linked to financial performance to ensure that the interests of the
Executive Directors are aligned to those of shareholders. The
Company intends to continue this approach to the structure of
remuneration for the foreseeable future. 
The Group’s remuneration policy is also based upon Carillion’s
strategic objectives, which specifically include achieving high
standards in respect of sustainability, which encompasses Carillion’s
health and safety, environmental and social performance.
Service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are terminable by
one year’s notice from the Company. On termination of their
employment, Executive Directors of the Company have no additional
entitlement to compensation for loss of their office as Directors. 
The service contracts contain provision for early termination. 
In determining compensation for early termination of a service
contract, the Remuneration Committee will consider the specific
circumstances together with the Company’s commitments under the
individual’s contract (including future bonuses). 
Notice
Name Commencement Period Term
John McDonough 1 January 2001 12 months Rolling

Roger Robinson 29 July 1999 12 months Rolling
Non-Executive Directors are not employed under contracts of service,
but are generally appointed for fixed terms of three years renewable
for further terms of one to three years if both parties agree. David
Garman, David Maloney, Vanda Murray and Philip Rogerson are in
their initial three year terms.
Basic salary and other benefits
The basic salaries and other benefits of the Executive Directors 
are set by the Remuneration Committee and are determined taking
into account individual performance and information provided by
independent sources on the rate of salary for similar posts in
comparable companies. The aim is to reward Directors fairly 
and competitively.
Other benefits typically include a company car, private healthcare
and salary supplements (or contributions to a funded unapproved
retirement benefit scheme (FURBS)) in place of approved pension
provision for salary over the annual earnings cap.
Annual performance bonus and deferred bonus plan
Annual bonuses are reviewed each year by the Remuneration
Committee, which sets performance targets geared to key 
financial indicators and individual performance objectives. In 
2005, the Executive Directors had the potential to earn annual
bonuses up to a maximum of 75% of their basic salary for
outstanding performance. The bonus arrangement for 2005 
set a financial performance target based on earnings per share 
and individual, detailed and confidential personal performance
objectives that support the strategic objectives of the Company. 
The maximum bonus opportunity of 75% comprises an annual 
cash payment limited to 30% of salary with a deferred bonus of
shares of the Company with a value of up to 45% of salary vesting
after two years. The number of shares allocated is determined by 
the price prevailing at the date the bonus is confirmed and the
amount by which the bonus earned exceeds 30% of basic salary at
the end of the bonus year in question. The shares are released on
the condition that the recipient makes funds available to the
Company at the point of transfer to allow the Company to meet its
tax and National Insurance obligations on the value of the shares
transferred. The potential bonus available in 2006 will be 100% of
basic salary comprised of a cash payment of up to 30% of basic
salary with a deferred bonus of shares in the Company up to the
value of 70% of salary vesting after two years. Remuneration Report continued

Elementis plc.
Executive pensions
Until April 2003, it was the Company’s policy to offer membership 
of the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme to Executive Directors and other
senior employees. This scheme was operational from 1 October
1999. The scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, defined
benefit scheme to which members contribute 7% of pensionable
earnings. The main features are:
• pension payable at the normal retirement age of 60 (save in cases 
of ill health or early retirement);
• pension accrual rate for Executive Directors of 1/30th of final 
pensionable salary for each year of service targeting a pension 
(at normal retirement age) of two thirds of final pensionable salary 
(subject to twenty years’ service after which employee 
contributions cease);
• increases to pensions in payment (in excess of the State 
Guaranteed Minimum Pension) in line with price indexation up to 
5% per annum for service to 5 April 2006 and 2.5% per annum 
for service after that date;
• life assurance of four times pensionable salary;
• pensions payable in the event of ill health; and
• on death (in service or after retirement), spouse’s and/or 
dependent’s pension at two thirds of member’s prospective 
pension.
Maximum pension benefits of two thirds of pensionable salary are
offset by any pension benefits accruing from earlier pension
arrangements.
The Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme was closed to new entrants with
effect from 1 April 2003. Pension provision for senior managers and
Executives is now through their existing Carillion scheme (for current
employees) or the Carillion Pension Plan (for new employees and
existing employees who opted for membership). The Carillion
Pension Plan is a defined contribution pension arrangement that
provides members with pensions at retirement based on the
accumulated value of their notional pension account within the plan.
The current Executive Directors are subject to the Inland Revenue
earnings cap and their pensionable salary is limited accordingly. They
are provided with additional benefits by way of individual FURBS or 
a salary supplement equal to the contribution the Group would have
made to a FURBS and with unapproved life cover of four times salary
over the earnings cap. In all cases, any contributions made to these
arrangements in respect of the year are disclosed separately on page
36. As these additional arrangements are limited to the balance of
basic salary in excess of the earnings cap, bonus paid to Executive
Directors does not count towards pension benefits. The Company
does not contribute to any pension arrangements for Non-Executive
Directors. The Company has agreed with the Trustees of the Carillion
pension schemes that it will continue to operate an earnings cap
after April 2006 when the external cap is removed. The Carillion cap
will commence at the level of £110,000 for the tax year 2006/07
and rise in line with the published increases in the Life Time
Allowance up until 2010 in line with the table below.
Year Cap
2006–07 £110,000
2007–08 £117,400
2008–09 £121,100
2009–10 £128,500
2010–11 £132,200
All the Executive Directors will be subject to this cap on salary
pensioned through the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme but they will be
provided with a salary supplement on the same basis as currently or
equal to the funding currently made to FURBS. FURBS funding will
cease in March 2006. 
The following additional changes have been made to the provisions
of the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme:
• in respect of benefits arising from service after 6 April 2006, 
increases to pensions in payment (in excess of the State 
Guaranteed Minimum Pension) will be in line with price indexation 
up to 2.5% per annum;
• life assurance of four times basic salary will be made through the 
scheme (subject to the Life Time Allowance);
• the twenty year limit on contributory service is removed and 
replaced with an overall benefit limit of two thirds of pensionable 
salary (subject to the Carillion cap).
These changes closely replicate the current position while using the
available efficiencies regarding life assurance and reducing the
Company’s liabilities in respect of pension increases.  Remuneration Report continued

Share incentive schemes
The Company now operates three share incentive schemes to
motivate employees and to encourage them to invest in the future
success of the Group. The Executive Share Option Scheme
(Approved and Unapproved) and the Long Term Incentive Plan have
challenging performance criteria which apply similarly to all
participants. In addition, a Sharesave Scheme operates to give UK
employees the opportunity to have a financial stake in the Company.
Executive Share Option Scheme 
Share options have been granted to the Executive Directors and
certain senior managers under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
The options were granted at an exercise price equal to the average
market price of the Company’s shares on the three business days
immediately preceding the date of grant.
Options under the Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option
Scheme 1999 (which carries certain tax advantages for UK
employees) and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 are
exercisable normally between three and ten years after the date 
of grant, subject to the achievement of the performance condition.
For options granted between October 1999 and October 2002, 
the performance condition requires that the earnings per share 
of Carillion over a rolling three year period must increase by a
percentage that is not less than the increase in the UK Retail Prices
Index over the same period, expressed as a percentage, plus four
percentage points per annum. This performance condition was
selected in order to provide an incentive which aligns the interests 
of executives with those of shareholders in growing the Company’s
earnings per share. However, as this performance condition no
longer complied with best practice, at the 2003 Annual General
Meeting, shareholders resolved that future options granted under
both schemes become exercisable in accordance with the 
following table:
Average compound annual earnings
per share growth (before exceptional Percentage of option
items) in excess of RPI over the three that becomes
year period following grant exercisable
Less than 4% 0%
4% 30%
Above 4% and below 10% 30% to 100% (straight-line basis)
10% or more 100%
To the extent that this performance condition is not met in full 
at the end of the three year period following grant, there is the
opportunity for no more than one re-test of performance (from 
a fixed base) at the end of the following year. 
The first grants of options using this new performance condition
were made on 1 July 2003 and subsequently on 31 March 2004 
and 15 March 2005.
The aggregate value of options granted to an employee under the
Executive Share Option Scheme cannot normally exceed their basic
salary in any year without the prior approval of the Remuneration
Committee.
At 31 December 2005, Executive Share Options were outstanding
over 3,391,236 shares (2004: 3,653,138 shares) at exercise prices
ranging from 125.2 pence to 242.75 pence.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan have been
made to the Executive Directors and key members of senior
management, in recognition of the contribution that these
individuals can make to the Group’s success.
There is no subscription price for the shares, the award of which is
conditional on the Company’s performance during a three-year
period in delivering Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against a
comparator group of companies in the Construction and Building
Materials and Support Services sectors or, in respect of the awards
made in 2005, the FTSE 250 index.
The companies comprising the comparator group for Long Term
Incentive Plan awards made in January 2002 were Amec plc, WS
Atkins plc, Balfour Beatty plc, Interserve plc, Jarvis plc, Kier Group
plc, Alfred McAlpine plc, Mowlem plc and Taylor Woodrow plc.
(Amey plc was in the comparator group but was removed as it
delisted from the London Stock Exchange in June 2003).
Carillion subsequently came second in this comparator group at the
end of the three year performance period for these 2002 awards
with the result that 85% of the awards vested and a total of
172,913 shares transferred to two participants in March 2005.

Following review in 2003, the Remuneration Committee 
considered that with a comparator group of ten companies, the
removal of one company (through takeover or otherwise) would
have a proportionately greater impact on the extent of the vesting
of awards than if the comparator group was larger. Consequently,
shareholders at the 2003 AGM approved that future awards
granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan would be subject to
Carillion’s TSR performance against an expanded group of 12
companies as follows:

delisted. Mowlem plc was also delisted in February 2006.)
To date awards with this performance condition have been made
on 1 July 2003 and 31 March 2004. 
Awards equivalent to 100% of annual salary were also made to
Executive Directors on 15 March 2005: the Remuneration
Committee resolved that these 2005 awards will have a 
performance condition based on Carillion’s TSR performance 
against the FTSE 250. 
The performance conditions were chosen in order to align the
interests of Directors and senior managers with those of
shareholders in growing total shareholder return against
comparator companies and sectors.
At 31 December 2005, Long Term Incentive Plan awards were
outstanding over a total of 2,221,874 shares (2004: 1,431,327
shares).
Conditional awards made to Executive Directors under the Long
Term Incentive Plan are set out in the table of share incentives 
on page 40. The awards represent the maximum number of 
shares that could be awarded to Executive Directors under the
performance periods commencing on 1 July 2003, 1 January 2004
and 1 January 2005. The monetary value of the conditional awards
attributed to each Director was based on their annual basic salary 
at the date of award and the number of shares was calculated
using the share prices of 162.1 pence, 143 pence and 225 pence,
the average share prices over the six weeks immediately before 
the commencement of the respective performance periods.
Following a review of the share incentives currently offered by the
Company, the Remuneration Committee has recommended the
implementation of a new long term incentive plan, the Carillion plc
2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, for senior executives. Shareholder
approval of this new long term incentive plan will be sought at the
Annual General Meeting on 10 May 2006.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Performance Graph
The following graph shows the TSR of Carillion plc compared with
the TSR of the FTSE 350 Index for the period from 1 January 2001 
to 31 December 2005. 
Total Shareholder Return 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2005
The FTSE 350 was chosen as the comparator group in order to
illustrate the Company’s TSR performance against a broad equity
market index of the UK’s leading companies.
The Sharesave Scheme
The Company operates a Sharesave Scheme which provides a
savings and investment opportunity for employees in the UK. The
options may normally be exercised on completion of a three or five
year savings contract, at a price equivalent to not less than 80% of
the market value of the shares at the time of grant. Options were
granted in November 1999 over 6,140,194 shares and in October
2002 over 3,995,803 shares. 
The five year options granted in November 1999 became
exercisable for a six month period commencing 1 January 2005 at
an option price 109.1 pence. A total of 983,369 shares were issued
following maturity.
The three year options granted in October 2002 became exercisable
for a six month period commencing 1 January 2006 at an option
price of 126.6 pence. To date, the market price of Carillion shares
has not been less than 299 pence during this latter period 
of exercise.
At 31 December 2005, options over 1,895,908 ordinary shares of 
50 pence each were outstanding under the Sharesave Scheme
(2004: 3,481,966 ordinary shares of 50 pence each), exercisable 
up to June 2006 at an exercise price of 126.6 pence.
The Carillion share option and share incentive schemes comply with
the share dilution guidelines. Remuneration Report continued

The auditor is required to report on the information contained in the
above table.
*The option over 254,532 shares at an option price of 210.7 pence
granted to John McDonough in March 2002 under the Executive
Share Option Scheme was made later in the year than had been
specified at the time of his appointment which resulted in an
increased option price of 67.3 pence. Therefore, in order to ensure
that he will be in no worse nor better a position as a result of the
delay in the grant, a maximum cash adjustment of 67.3 pence per
share (less tax) will be made when and if the option is exercised.
There have been no changes to the interests of Executive Directors 
in share incentives and options in the period 1 January to 8 March
2006. The performance conditions for the options shown in the
table are as detailed in this Remuneration Report in the summaries
of the relevant schemes.

31 December 2005. 
Principal activities and business review
Carillion is a leading company delivering integrated solutions for
infrastructure, buildings and services and operating throughout the
UK and in a number of overseas regional markets.
A review of the Group’s businesses, financial performance and 
future developments is contained in the Chairman’s Statement 
and Operating and Financial Review.
Analyses of revenue, results and net assets by business segment 
and geographical location are given in Note 2 on page 55.

final dividend of 5.2 pence per ordinary share (2004: 4.825 pence)
on 23 June 2006 to shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 28 April 2006. The payment of these 2005 interim and

A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) will also be offered.

The interests of the Directors and their families in the share capital of
the Company are shown in the Remuneration Report on page 41.
Employees
Information relating to employee numbers and remuneration is given
in Note 7 on page 58.
Employees are key to achieving Carillion’s business strategy and the
Group is committed to improving their skills through training and
development and nurturing a culture in which employees feel valued
for their contribution and are motivated to achieve their full
potential. 
Carillion’s core values of openness, collaboration, mutual
dependency, innovation, professional delivery and sustainable
profitable growth have been developed to emphasise the changing
working practices required to succeed in an environment where
partnership and integrated solutions are becoming the norm. 
It is Carillion’s aim to foster a working environment in which all
employees are treated with courtesy, dignity and respect. Carillion
continually strives to eliminate all bias and unlawful discrimination 
in relation to job applicants, employees, business partners and
members of the public. Employees who become disabled are,
wherever possible, retrained or provided with equipment so that
they can continue their employment. 
The objectives of Carillion’s Equal Opportunity and Diversity 
Policy are:
• to have a workforce that represents and responds to the diversity 
of customers and today’s society;
• improved safety and quality provided by a balanced and 
productive workforce;
• better public image and market position, leading to improved links
with the community in which Carillion works;
• adherence to legal requirements;
• lower staff turnover, absenteeism and sickness levels leading to 
cost savings;
• to provide a fair working environment in which discrimination will 
not be tolerated;
• to create a working environment free from discrimination, 
harassment, victimisation and bullying;
• to work towards finding ways for under represented groups to 
fully realise their potential within Carillion and to take reasonable 
steps to help such groups; 
• to ensure that all employees are aware of the Group Equal 
Opportunities and Diversity Policy and to provide any necessary 
ongoing training to enable them to meet their responsibilities 
under it; and
• Carillion also recognises the merit of developing a workforce that 
incorporates the many diverse skills and backgrounds available 
from within the total population and accordingly, will strive to 
become an organisation that will recognise, value and understand 
diversity and provide its employees with genuine opportunities to 
improve and reach their full potential.
Carillion places great importance on open and regular
communication with employees through both formal and informal
processes. As part of this commitment, a Group newspaper,
‘Spectrum’, is produced on a regular basis for all employees. 
The views of employees on matters affecting their interests are also
sought through ‘The Great Debate’. This is a major exercise which
was undertaken by the Group in 2003, 2004 and 2005 to capture
the feelings and views of as wide a range of employees as possible.
These views are then taken into account in the development of 
work related initiatives as part of Carillion’s strategy to become an
employer of choice. In 2005, around 1,400 employees attended 
‘The Great Debate’ sessions. Report of the Directors continued
Section 06
Accountability
Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005
43
Carillion stages ‘The Great Debate’ as part of the ongoing quest for
cultural change and to produce step changes which:
• raise understanding of what drives motivation, morale, 
engagement and performance;
• allows employees to take ownership and be empowered to build 
and implement solutions; and
• demonstrates Carillion’s desire to change attitudes and behaviours 
based on listening to the views of its employees.
Additionally, ‘Team Talk’ which is held monthly provides Carillion
employees with a face to face communication with their line
managers and facilitates two-way communication, discussion and
feedback. It focuses on local issues and key corporate messages 
and information. 
One to one meetings between individual employees and their line
managers are also held to discuss performance and progress.
Employees can also exchange best practice information on a
Knowledge Management Forum on the Group intranet.
Carillion seeks to involve all employees in its leading edge
programmes to integrate safety into everything it does and to
improve its environmental performance, including the understanding
and application of the principles of sustainability. Further information
on Health and Safety, the Environment and Community is given in
the Corporate Social Responsibility report on pages 26 and 27.
Carillion also involves, engages and consults with employees through
‘People Forums’ across the Group which give employees the
opportunity to express their views on business issues. Specifically, 
the objectives of the ‘People Forums’ are:
• to improve employee information and consultation;
• to help employees feel more involved and valued;
• to support the continued education and development of 
employees;
• improve business performance by enabling employees to be 
better aware of the business climate in which they operate; and
• to help employees to be responsive to and better prepared 
for change.
Substantial share interests
At 8 March 2006, the Company had received formal notification of
the following substantial interests in the ordinary share capital of 
the Company:
Number of shares held Percentage

Limited, its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies 42,177,184 15.03%
Fidelity International Ltd and 
its direct and indirect subsidiaries 13,869,292 4.94%
Policy for payment of suppliers
It is the policy of the Group that each business agrees terms and
conditions for transactions with its suppliers and for payment to be
made on these terms providing the suppliers meet their obligations
to the businesses’ satisfaction. The Group as a whole therefore does
not apply a general recognised code with regard to the payment of
all suppliers. The Company does not have any trade creditors.
The number of days credit outstanding for the Group averaged 62
days at 31 December 2005 (63 days at 31 December 2004).
Charitable and political contributions
Payments for charitable purposes made by the Group during the
year ended 31 December 2005 amounted to £84,000 (2004:
£76,000). The primary beneficiaries of these charitable donations
were The Wildlife Trust, Business in the Community, the British 
Heart Foundation and CRASH, the construction and property
industry charity for the homeless.
The Carillion Group also contributes more than one per cent of
profits per annum in cash or in-kind (staff time on community
projects) to community activities and is a member of the Business 
in the Community PerCent Club.
The Company and its subsidiaries made no political donations during
the period under review.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 12 noon on Wednesday
10 May 2006 at Austin Court, 80 Cambridge Street, Birmingham 
B1 2NP . The notice of the Annual General Meeting accompanies this
annual report and accounts.
Amongst the business to be transacted is a proposal to renew

for the purchase of 21,451,268 of its own shares.

Accountability
Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and
the Group and Parent Company financial statements, in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.  
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law
the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and have elected to
prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with
UK Accounting Standards.  
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in
relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant
part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view
are references to their achieving a fair presentation.  
The Parent Company financial statements are required by law to 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Parent
Company. In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company
financial statements, the Directors are required to:  
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;  
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;  
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent
Company financial statements; and  
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities.  
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement 
that comply with that law and those regulations.  
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Carillion plc

We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial
statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of Carillion plc for the year
ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the Consolidated Income
Statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets,
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes.
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.  
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors  
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the EU, and for preparing the Parent Company financial
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance
with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities on page 44.  
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and whether, in addition, the Group financial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not
consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.  
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are 
not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures 
or its risk and control procedures.  
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.  
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of
the presentation of information in the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.  
Opinion  
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, of the state 
of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of its profit 
for the year then ended;  
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation;  
• the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31
December 2005; and  
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

1 Significant accounting policies
Carillion plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom (UK). The consolidated financial statements of the Company for
the year ended 31 December 2005 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interest
in jointly controlled entities. 
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance on 8 March 2006.
(a) Statement of compliance
The Group’s financial statements as approved by the Directors have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) adopted for use in the EU. The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with
UK GAAP. These are presented on pages 85 to 91.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group
was published on 30 June 2005 and is available on the Group’s website at www.carillionplc.com. These consolidated financial statements
include reconciliations of total equity and profit or loss for the comparative period reported under UK GAAP (previous GAAP) to those
reported under IFRS (see note 35).
(b) Basis of preparation
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the
Group’s financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and
liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments classified as available-for-sale.  
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has adopted IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation’ and IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments:
recognition and measurement’ prospectively from 1 January 2005. Consequently, comparative information for 2004 has been prepared in
accordance with UK GAAP . A reconciliation of total equity at 1 January 2005 following the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 is given in 
note 35.
As permitted by the standard, the Group has opted to adopt the requirements of IAS 19 (revised 2004) ‘Employee benefits’ early rather than
from its effective date of 1 January 2006.
In March 2005, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued draft guidance on accounting for service
concession arrangements (drafts D12 to D14). IFRIC are currently considering the comments received on this draft guidance, with the final
guidance expected to be issued in late 2006. Until the final guidance is issued and endorsed by the EU and in the absence of specific
guidance within IFRS, the Group has, from 1 January 2005, recognised the FRS 5 ‘Reporting the substance of transactions’ finance debtors
relating to concession arrangements held by PPP jointly controlled entities at amortised cost as defined by IAS 39. FRS 5 fixed assets relating
to concession arrangements are accounted for in accordance with IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’. The effect of adopting this policy
is to maintain the accounting within PPP jointly controlled entities in line with existing UK GAAP (with the exception of the treatment of
interest rate derivatives under IAS 39), whilst ensuring that the accounting treatment complies with existing IFRS. 
Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the Company drawn
up to 31 December 2005. Control exists when the Group has direct or indirect power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date
that control transfers to the Group until the date that control ceases. The purchase method is used to account for the acquisition 
of subsidiaries. 
(b) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control with 
third parties. 
The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method the Group’s share 
of the profits less losses of jointly controlled entities is included in the consolidated income statement and its interest in their net assets is
included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet. Where the share of losses exceeds the interest in the entity the carrying amount 
is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued. Interest in the entity is the carrying amount of the investment together
with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the net investment in the entity.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled operation, that company accounts for the assets it controls, the liabilities and
expenses it incurs and its share of the income. Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial statements on the same basis.

Other non-current asset investments
Other non-current asset investments are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and are recognised at fair value. Changes in fair value
in the year are recognised directly in the statement of recognised income and expense. Dividend income from investments is recognised
when the right to receive payment is established.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004 represents the difference between the fair value of the purchase
consideration and the fair value of the identifiable net assets and contingencies of an acquired entity. Consideration includes the attributable
costs of the acquisition. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which
represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP. This is in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1.
Positive goodwill is recognised as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet and is subject to annual impairment review. Goodwill arising 
on the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised separately as an intangible asset in the consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill arising on the
acquisition of jointly controlled entities is included within the carrying value of the investment. Negative goodwill is recognised in the income
statement immediately.
Under previous UK GAAP , goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998 was written off to reserves. In accordance with the
transitional provisions of IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’, this treatment has continued to be applied for those years. Any goodwill previously
written off to reserves remains in reserves.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is based on the useful
economic lives of the assets concerned, which are principally as follows:
Computer software and licences Straight line over 3-5 years
Customer contracts and lists (PMG) Reducing balance over 6 years
Impairment
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Assets
subject to depreciation and amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement based on the amount by which the carrying amount
exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Construction contracts
When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the
degree of completion of each contract, as measured by the proportion of total costs at the balance sheet date to the estimated total cost 
of the contract. 
Insurance claims and incentive payments arising from construction contracts are included where they have been agreed with the client.
Variations and other claims are included where there is reasonable certainty that the amount will be settled. When the outcome of a
construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is
probable those costs will be recoverable.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately. Contract costs
are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
Where costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings, the balance is shown as due from customers 
on construction contracts within trade and other receivables. Where progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits less
recognised losses, the balance is shown as due to customers on construction contracts within trade and other payables.
Pre-contract costs 
Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until the Group is appointed preferred bidder. Provided the contract is expected to generate
sufficient net cash inflows to enable recovery and the award of the contract is probable, pre-contract costs incurred post the appointment 
as preferred bidder are included in amounts owed by customers on construction contracts. Where pre-contract bid costs are reimbursed at
financial close, the proceeds are initially applied against the asset included in amounts owed by customers on construction contracts. 
Any excess recoveries are carried forward as deferred income and released to profit over the period of the contract. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding value added tax, for services supplied to external customers. It also
includes the Group’s proportion of work carried out under jointly controlled operations during the year. Revenue from service contracts is
recognised by reference to the stage of completion, as measured by reference to services performed to date as a percentage of total services to 
be performed. Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on construction contracts.
Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is based on historical or deemed cost, less the estimated residual values, and the estimated economic lives of the assets
concerned. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible assets are depreciated in equal annual installments over the period of their
estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows:
Freehold buildings 40-50 years
Leasehold buildings and improvements Period of lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles 3-10 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or the expected useful life of the asset.
Leasing
Operating lease rental charges are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease.
Assets held under finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of fair value at the date of acquisition or present
value of the minimum lease payments. The capital element of outstanding finance leases is included in financial liabilities. The finance charge
element of rentals is charged to the income statement at a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Inventories
Inventories comprise raw materials and land for development and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated
using the weighted average method.
Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Foreign currencies
In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling and recorded using the exchange rate
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the income statement.
On consolidation, the balance sheets of overseas entities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet
date. Income statements and cash flows of overseas entities are translated into sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates
at the date of the transaction. Gains or losses arising from the consolidation of overseas entities are recognised in the translation reserve. 
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 exchange differences that arose prior to 1 January 2004 are presented within the
opening retained earnings reserve at that date. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Employee benefits 
(a) Retirement benefit obligations
For defined contribution pension schemes operated by the Group, amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. The charge to the income statement reflects the current service cost of such obligations. The expected return on plan assets
and the interest cost on scheme liabilities are included within financial income and expenses in the income statement.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the excess of the present value of scheme liabilities over the fair
value of scheme assets. Differences between the actual and expected returns on assets and experience gains and losses arising on scheme
liabilities during the year, together with differences arising from changes in assumptions, are recognised in the statement of recognised
income and expense in the year. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 January
2004 are presented within the opening retained earnings reserve at that date.
The Group’s contributions to the schemes are paid in accordance with the rules of the schemes and the recommendation of the actuary. 
(b) Other post-retirement benefit obligations
Certain Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to its employees. The expected costs of providing these benefits are
accrued over the period of employment and are calculated by independent actuaries based on the present value of the expected liability.
(c) Share-based payments
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’ has been applied to share options granted after 7 November
2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005. Members of the Group’s senior management team are entitled to participate in the Executive
Share Option Scheme (ESOS) and the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). In addition, UK employees are able to participate in the 
Sharesave scheme.
The fair values of the ESOS and Sharesave schemes at the date of grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The fair value
of the LTIP scheme is estimated using a bespoke model that factors in the probabilities of achieving Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
performance conditions. For all schemes the fair value determined at grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period,
based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the Group constructs qualifying assets. All other borrowing costs are written off to the income
statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs incurred within the Group’s jointly controlled entities relating to the construction of assets in PPP projects are capitalised
until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
Share capital
The ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental issue costs.
Consideration paid for shares in the Company held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust are deducted from the retained
earnings reserve. Where such shares subsequently vest in the employees under the terms of the Group’s share option schemes or are sold,
any consideration received is included in the retained earnings reserve.
Provisions
A provision is recognised on the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and
where it is probable that an outflow will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has an approved restructuring plan that has either commenced or been
announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The principal financial
assets and liabilities of the Group are as follows:
(a) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and then are stated at amortised cost. Section 07
Financial Statements
Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005
54
1 Significant accounting policies continued
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at nominal value. For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts 
are also included as they are an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
(c) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and then are stated at amortised cost.
(d) Bank and other borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are recognised initially at fair value. All borrowings are subsequently stated at
amortised cost with the difference between initial net proceeds and redemption value recognised in the income statement over the period 
to redemption.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured in future periods
at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting change in fair value is dependent on whether the derivative is designated as a
hedging instrument.
A number of the Group’s PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
The effective part of the change in fair value of these derivatives is recognised directly in equity. Any ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the 
hedged items will affect profit or loss. The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay 
to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date.
The Group also enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures. 
In cases where these derivative instruments are significant, hedge accounting is applied as described above. Where hedge accounting is 
not applied movements in fair value are recognised in the income statement. Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance 
sheet date.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 Segment reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s business segments, which are the primary basis of segment reporting. 
The business segment reporting format reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting structure.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. Segment trading results include items directly attributable to a segment 
as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Business segments
The Group is comprised of the following main business segments:
• Construction Services: UK building, development and civil engineering activities and international regional construction services.
• Support Services: Rail infrastructure, roads maintenance, facilities management and other support services.
• Investments: Equity returns on investments in Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects.

Due to a change in the nature of contractual arrangements in 2005 with Network Rail, a number of items of rail plant have become
redundant. Consequently, an impairment provision of £1.0m, included within administrative expenses, has been made to write down these
items to their estimated recoverable amount.

Goodwill of £34.5m and customer contracts and lists of £6.2m arose in 2005 on the acquisition of Planned Maintenance Group Limited
(PMG) as disclosed in note 30. Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of PMG because a large number of customer contracts and
relationships do not meet the criteria for separate recognition or could not be reliably measured.
The net book value of computer software and licences includes £1.6m of costs associated with the development of new computer systems
for the Group’s human resources and finance functions. Depreciation of these costs over a period of five years will commence when the
computer systems are brought into operational use during 2006.

Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily
to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The overall aim of the Group’s financial risk management policies is to
minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Group’s treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of
Directors. Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.

Foreign currency risk
The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. In order to protect the Group’s
balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets of overseas operations that
exceed £10m equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, at least 50% of the net asset value. Net investment hedging is achieved through
borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies. Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the
hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution. Such distributions are then treated as
currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
The Group has small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures that are hedged using forward contracts as described above.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest bearing debt is predominantly foreign currency denominated borrowings for hedging net assets of overseas operations
and sterling borrowings to finance short-term working capital requirements. Such borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked
to LIBOR. No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Group’s subsidiaries. However, a number of the Group’s PPP jointly
controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient cash is available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry
significant net debt over the medium term. The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks 
in the form of syndicated and bi-lateral loans and short-term overdraft facilities. The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available 
to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging. Policies and
procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history. Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging
transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counter parties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counter party exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counter party are within predetermined limits.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments
2005
Assets Liabilities
£m £m
Forward foreign currency contracts – 0.3
In addition to the above, a number of the Group’s PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of
hedging interest rate risk. Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP jointly controlled entities are
without recourse to the Group. At 31 December 2005, the Group’s share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP
jointly controlled entities amounted to £45.1m, of which £15.5m (and the related deferred tax asset of £4.7m) has been recognised directly
in equity.
Effective interest rates
The Group’s interest bearing borrowings were subject to effective interest rates at the balance sheet date as follows:
Range (%)
Bank overdrafts 3.48 to 6.00
Bank loans 3.81 to 5.13

Group revenue would have been £2,054.1m and profit before tax would have been £52.4m for the year ended 31 December 2005.

31 Retirement benefit obligations
Carillion operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as disclosed below:
Carillion Staff and ‘B’ Pension Schemes
Both schemes are defined benefit schemes and are closed to new entrants. Existing members continue to accrue benefits for future service.
Actuarial valuations of the above schemes were undertaken by the Trustees’ independent actuaries as at 31 December 2002 using the
projected unit method. The market value of the schemes’ assets at that date were £316.7m and £80.9m respectively, which represented
approximately 81% and 90% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries. The
contributions paid during the year were £11.7m (2004: £13.5m) in respect of the Carillion Staff Pension Scheme and £1.4m (2004: £1.6m) 
in respect of the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme. 
The contribution rates include an allowance for funding the past service deficits identified at the 2002 valuation date over the remaining
average working life of the active scheme members. The contribution rates will be reviewed following the results of the valuations being
carried out at 31 December 2005. The Group expects to pay contribution rates of 20% in respect of the staff scheme and 50% in respect 
of the ‘B’ scheme of pensionable salaries respectively in 2006.
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the funding plan.

Carillion Public Sector Pension Scheme
The scheme is a defined benefit scheme. The scheme remains open to eligible employees transferring from the public sector as part of the
commercial obligations under PFI, PPP and Best Value contracts with public sector employers.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the Trustees’ independent actuaries as at 31 December 2004 using the attained 
age method. The market value of the schemes’ assets at that date was £74.9m, which represented approximately 82% of the benefits 
that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries. The contributions paid during the year were 
£3.9m (2004: £1.8m).
Following the transfer of the Metropolitan Police Authority contract in 2004, the bulk transfer of members to the incoming service provider
was completed during 2005.
The contribution rates agreed include an allowance for funding the past service deficit by the end of December 2015. An immediate
payment of £2.2m was made in December 2005 in respect of the period 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2006. The Group expects 
to pay 23.2% of pensionable salaries in 2006. Additional payments of £2.3m per annum will commence from 1 January 2007 to 
31 December 2015.
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the funding plan.
The PME Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme
Planned Maintenance Group Limited, whose principal trading subsidiary is Planned Maintenance Engineering Limited (PME), was acquired in
March 2005. The PME Staff Pension Scheme is a defined benefit pension scheme and is closed to new entrants. Existing members continue
to accrue benefits for future service.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the Trustees’ independent actuaries as at 31 August 2004 using the attained age
method. The market value of the scheme’s assets at that date was £27.4m, which represented approximately 73% of the benefits that had
accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries. 
As part of the purchase agreement a lump sum payment of £10.0m was paid to the scheme in the post acquisition period. The contributions
paid during the period since acquisition were £1.2m. The Group expects to pay 16.5% of pensionable salaries in 2006.
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the funding plan.
Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS)
Employees of GTRM and Centrac, and former employees of British Rail transferred to these businesses, have pension provision via Shared
Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme. Both the GTRM and Centrac Sections are closed to new entrants. 
Shared cost arrangements are such that the employer and members share the cost of future service liabilities on a 60/40 split respectively
and any surplus or deficit emerging over time is dealt with on a similar basis. The contributions paid by the employer during the year were
£4.5m (2004: £4.5m) for GTRM and £0.2m (2004: £0.6m) for Centrac.
Independent actuaries appointed by the Railways Pension Trustee Company Limited carried out a formal valuation of the Railways Pension
Scheme at 31 December 2004 using the projected unit method for GTRM and the attained age method for Centrac. 
The market values of the scheme assets of the GTRM Section and Centrac Section at 31 December 2004 were £195.4m and £27.4m
respectively, which represented 93.6% and 102% of benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after taking account of future
increases in salaries, contributions payable and reserves. The contribution rates agreed for the GTRM Section include an allowance for
funding the past service deficit by the end of June 2015.
Following the transfer of rail maintenance contracts to Network Rail in 2004, the bulk transfer of members from the GTRM section of the
RPS to the Network Rail section of the RPS was completed during 2005.
The Group expects to pay 16.02% of pensionable salaries in respect of the GTRM Section until 30 June 2006 and 22.08% of pensionable
salaries until the end of 2006. The Group expects to pay 11.25% of pensionable salaries in respect of the Centrac Section until 15 June
2006, 16.62% of pensionable salaries until 30 June 2006 and 16.56% until the end of 2006.

Other UK and overseas schemes
The Group operates three UK defined contribution schemes, the Carillion Pension Plan, the PME Defined Contribution Plan and the Carillion
Retirement Plan (closed to new entrants since 2001). In addition, the Group operates a Stakeholder Plan (‘Stakeholder Plus’).
The Carillion Pension Plan commenced on 1 April 2003. The majority of new employees are eligible to join this plan. Employees contribute 
a minimum of 5% and the employer a minimum of 7% of basic salaries. Up to 3% of any additional voluntary contributions paid by
employees is matched by the employer resulting in a maximum employer contribution of 10% of basic salary. Death in service lump sum
benefits are provided in addition. Contributions during the year were £1.4m (2004: £0.7m).
Employees of Carillion Services and Carillion Health who are not eligible for the Carillion Pension Plan are invited to participate in the
Carillion Stakeholder Plus managed by Merrill Lynch Pensions Limited. Employees contribute 5% and the employer 6.5% of basic salary.
Death in service lump sum benefits are provided in addition. Contributions during the year were £0.5m (2004: £0.5m). 
The PME Defined Contribution Plan commenced in April 1999. All new PME employees are offered membership of the plan. Employees
contribute 4% of basic pay and the Group pays 5% of basic pay (inclusive of a 1% allowance for insurance premiums and audit fees).
Contributions during the period since acquisition were £1.0m.
Contributions to the Carillion Retirement Plan during the year were £0.1m (2004: £nil).
Stakeholder pensions are also provided by B&CE Insurance and Scottish Widows where required by Working Rule Agreements.
Carillion Construction Limited is an admitted body in the Surrey Pension Fund and the Warwickshire Pension Fund. Carillion Services Limited
is an admitted body in the Hertfordshire Pension Fund. All sections were granted a fully funded past service position and employer
contributions are paid in accordance with the actuary’s recommendations. The contributions and investment returns are estimated to be
sufficient to maintain the fully funded past service position at 31 December 2005. Contributions during the year, which have been accounted
for on a defined contribution basis, were £0.4m (2004: £0.3m).
The Carillion Group operates a defined benefit scheme for employees of Carillion Canada Inc managed locally and supplemental
arrangements in respect of certain executives, the Senior Executive Retirement Plan and a healthcare plan, the Post Retirement Benefit Plan.
The Group also operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for employees of Carillion Rail Sverige AB again managed locally.
Contributions during the year were £nil (2004: £nil) in respect of the Carillion Canada Inc defined benefit scheme, £0.1m (2004: £0.1m) in
respect of other post retirement benefits for senior Canadian employees, and £0.9m (2004: £0.6m) in respect of the Swedish and Norwegian
defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
IAS 19 disclosures
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were:
2005 2004
UK Canada UK Canada
Rate of increase in salaries 4.05% 3.25% 4.00% 3.25%
Rate of increase in pensions 2.80% 2.25% 2.75% 2.25%
Inflation rate 2.80% 2.25% 2.75% 2.25%
Discount rate 4.75% 5.00% 5.30% 6.00%
The market values of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change
before they are realised. The present values of the schemes’ liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA
corporate bonds. The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved. 
For all schemes the mortality basis is in line with the basis used by the respective Trustee at the last valuation. As the Trustees review their
assumptions according to the valuation cycle the Group will seek independent advice on any appropriate changes.

The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long term interest rates, the yield on gilts or Treasury stock
and the Actuary’s recommendation on the allowance for the potential long term extra return from investing in equities. No credit has been
taken for the potential extra yield above gilts or Treasury stock for investment in corporate debt when determining the projected pension
cost charged to the income statement.
Carillion Canada Inc operates an unfunded healthcare scheme for retired employees. For the purposes of the actuarial valuation of the
scheme the immediate medical cost trend is 9% per annum falling to 5% per annum by 2010. An increase of 1% in the medical cost trend
would increase the scheme liabilities by £0.6m and the total service cost by £0.04m. A decrease of 1% in the medical cost trend would
reduce liabilities by £0.5m and total service cost by £0.03m.
Carillion has adopted immediate recognition of any actuarial gains or losses through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense as
permitted under IAS 19.
The IAS 19 position for the schemes is as follows:

65.8m Carillion shares and cash of £117m.
33 Accounting estimates and judgements
Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting policies
and estimates and their application.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below:
Construction contracts
In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation 
to final out turn on each contract. Management continually review estimated final out turn on contracts and make adjustments 
where necessary.
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit 
to which the goodwill is attached. Note 12 provides details of the carrying value of goodwill.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations
In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made. The 
key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group:
• Expected return on plan assets
• Inflation rate
• Mortality
• Discount rate
• Salary and pension increases
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 31.
34 Principal subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and jointly controlled operations
A list of significant investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and jointly controlled operations, including the name, country of
incorporation and proportion of ownership interest is given on page 94.
35 Explanation of transition to IFRS
These are the Group’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements, including 
comparative information for the year to 31 December 2004 and the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 
(the Group’s date of transition).
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet and comparative information for the year to 31 December 2004, the Group has 
adjusted amounts previously reported in financial statements prepared in accordance with previous GAAP. In addition, following 
the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the Group has adjusted previously restated total equity at 1 January 2005.

Employee benefits
IAS 19 replaces SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for pension costs’ and is broadly similar to the requirements of FRS 17 ‘Retirement benefits’. 
Disclosure of the potential impact of FRS 17 has been included in the Group’s annual report and accounts since 2001. As permitted by IAS
19, the Group has opted to recognise immediately and in full the actuarial gains and losses arising in each accounting period in the
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. This treatment is similar to the requirements of FRS 17.
Under IAS 19 the surplus or deficit relating to defined benefit schemes are recognised on the balance sheet of the Group. Although the
methodology for determining the income statement charge is similar to SSAP 24, the actuarial assumptions are different. In particular, IAS 19
requires the discount rate used in the evaluation of scheme liabilities to be based on market yields on high quality corporate bonds 
at the balance sheet date. In contrast, SSAP 24 required the use of long-term investment return rate to discount liabilities. The difference in
approach to the discount rate used can lead to a more volatile income statement charge under IAS 19 compared to SSAP 24.

Business combinations
IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ covers the accounting for acquisitions, which is dealt with under UK GAAP by FRS 6 ‘Acquisitions and
mergers’, FRS 7 ‘Fair values in acquisition accounting’, and FRS 10 ‘Goodwill and intangible assets’.
IFRS 3 strictly prohibits the use of merger accounting that in certain circumstances can be applied under UK GAAP . Although goodwill 
arising on business combinations is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet under both IFRS and UK GAAP , IFRS 3 prohibits the
amortisation of goodwill. Instead, IFRS 3 requires goodwill to be subject to annual impairment reviews. In addition, goodwill previously
written off to reserves under UK GAAP remains in reserves under IFRS and is not recycled through the income statement on disposal of 
the business to which it relates.
The adjustment in the table above relates primarily to goodwill previously written off to reserves on the original acquisitions of Crown 
House Engineering and Carillion BTP, which were both disposed of in 2004. The impairment of goodwill under IFRS relates to UK 
Highways Services Limited reflecting the reduction in future cash flows as we move nearer to the end of it’s maintenance contract in 2007.
Share-based payments
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’ replaces UITF 17 ‘Employee share schemes’ under UK GAAP .
IFRS 2 requires the fair value cost of providing employee share option schemes to be charged to the income statement, and in respect 
of equity settled share-based payments, recognised directly in equity. This differs to the UITF 17 approach under which the charge to 
the income statement is based on the intrinsic value of the share options. The scope of IFRS 2 is wider than UITF 17 as it relates to all 
share-based payments. Consequently, Save as You Earn (SAYE) schemes are within the scope of IFRS 2, whereas under UITF 17 they are 
specifically exempt.
Deferred tax
IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ is the IFRS equivalent of FRS 16 ‘Current tax’ and FRS 19 ‘Deferred taxation’ under UK GAAP .
There is no change to the basis of calculating current income tax as a result of adopting IAS 12. However, the basis of calculating deferred
tax changes from an income statement approach under FRS 19 to a balance sheet approach under IAS 12. The balance sheet approach
compares the tax value with the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Of the additional requirements of IAS 12,
the most significant is the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas entities, where
their distribution cannot be controlled or planned by the Group.
Proposed dividends
IAS 10 (revised 2003) ‘Events after the balance sheet date’ is the FRS equivalent of SSAP 17 ‘Accounting for post balance sheet events’ 
in the UK. Both standards are similar except in respect of the accounting treatment of dividends.
Under IAS 10, dividends declared and approved by shareholders after the balance sheet date are not permitted to be recognised as a 
liability at the balance sheet date. This differs from the UK GAAP treatment of proposed dividends, which are accrued for the in the financial
period to which they relate. The adjustment to equity at 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2004 reflects the reversal of the proposed
dividend accrued in the 2004 and 2003 financial statements respectively.
Financial instruments
The accounting for, and presentation of, financial instruments is dealt with under IFRS by IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: disclosure and
presentation’ and IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition and measurement’. Under UK GAAP there is no comprehensive standard which
addresses the accounting for financial instruments. In the UK, FRS 13 ‘Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures’ requires
certain disclosures to be made.
IAS 39 requires the fair value of derivative financial instruments to be included on balance sheet, whereas under UK GAAP they are not
recognised. The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions. However, a number of the Group’s PPP jointly controlled
entities enter into interest rate swap derivatives. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39 and the Group’s
share of the movements in fair value are recognised directly in the hedging reserve within equity provided the hedge is effective.
In addition, other non-current asset investments are classified as available-for-sale assets in accordance with IAS 39. These investments 
are held on the balance sheet at fair value, with movements in fair value between reporting periods recognised in the fair value reserve
within equity. Section 07

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
1 Principal accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the
Company’s financial statements, except in respect of the matters noted below.  
Changes in accounting policies
During the year the Company adopted FRS 17 ‘Retirement benefits’, FRS 20 ‘Share-based payments’, FRS 21 ‘Events after the balance 
sheet date’, FRS 25 ‘Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation’, FRS 26 ‘Financial instruments: measurement’ and FRS 28
‘Corresponding amounts’. The adoption of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have 
been restated accordingly.
The effect of the change in accounting policy on adoption of FRS 21 was to recognise the final proposed dividend for the year ended 31
December 2004 of £10.1m in the current year. The final proposed dividend for the current year of £14.6m will be recognised in the
following year as it has yet to be approved.
The effect of the adoption of FRS 26 is to include on balance sheet the fair value of forward foreign currency contacts that previously were
not required to be recognised. As permitted by FRS 26, the Company has adopted its requirements prospectively from 1 January 2005. 
The effect of the adoption of FRS 26 on net assets is nil at 1 January 2005 and a reduction of £0.2m at 31 December 2005. 
The adoption of FRS 17, FRS 20, FRS 25 and FRS 28 has had no effect on net assets in either the current or preceding year.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting
standards and law.
Taxation
Deferred tax assets or liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and
their recognition in the tax computation that have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Liabilities are calculated on a non-discounted full provision basis. Assets are calculated on the same basis, but are recognised only to the
extent that is it probable that they will be recovered.
Fixed asset investments
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost, less provision for 
any impairment.
Leasing
The Company enters into finance lease arrangements on behalf of subsidiary companies. As permitted by SSAP 21 ‘Accounting for leases
and hire purchase contracts’, the assets relating to the finance leases are included in the financial statements of the subsidiaries concerned.
The capital element of outstanding finance leases is included within borrowings. The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the
profit and loss account at a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Own shares
Company shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) trust are presented within the profit and loss account reserve until such
time as the interest in the shares is transferred unconditionally to the employees. Costs of administering the trust are charged to the profit
and loss account as incurred.
The ESOP trust is regarded as a quasi subsidiary under FRS 5 ‘Reporting the substance of transactions’ and its assets, liabilities and results are
consolidated into the financial statements of the Company.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling and recorded using the contracted exchange rate. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the relevant balance sheet date
and the gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement
A cash flow statement has not been presented as permitted by FRS 1 (revised) ‘Cash flow statements’. Section 07

1 Principal accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 ‘Share-based payments’ has been applied to share options granted after 7 November
2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005. Members of the Company’s senior management team are entitled to participate in the
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) and the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). In addition, UK employees are able to participate in the
Sharesave scheme. The fair values of the ESOS and sharesave schemes at the date of grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing
model. The fair value of the LTIP scheme is estimated using a bespoke model that factors in the probabilities of achieving Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) performance conditions. For all schemes the fair value determined at grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the
vesting period based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Financial instruments
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities are cash at bank and in hand and borrowings. Cash at bank and in hand is carrried 
in the balance sheet at nominal value. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. In addition, the
Company enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures. Forward
contracts are measured initially at fair value, with changes in fair value during the year recognised in the profit and loss account. Fair values
are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtnesss of subsidiary companies, the Company considers
these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a
contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Retirement benefit obligations
Pension costs are recognised in the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17. Employees of the Company
participate in the Carillion ‘Staff’ and ‘B’ schemes which provide pensions on a defined benefit basis. The assets and liabilities of these
schemes relating to the Company cannot be readily ascertained on a reasonable and consistent basis as the schemes are operated for the
benefit of the Carillion Group as a whole. Consequently, the Company accounts for these schemes as if they were defined contribution
schemes. Details of the Group’s pension schemes are disclosed in note 31 of the consolidated financial statements.
2 Profit for the year
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the
year. Carillion plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2005 of £49.3m (2004: £62.8m).
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £30,000 (2004: £27,000).

11 Pension arrangements
As the Staff and ‘B’ defined benefit schemes are run for the Carillion Group as a whole the Company is unable to identify its share of the
schemes’ assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. Hence, as permitted by FRS 17, the schemes are accounted for by the
Company separately as if the schemes were defined contribution schemes. Details of the Group’s pension schemes are disclosed in note 31
to the consolidated financial statements.
12 Share-based payments
The Company has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to purchase shares

Shareholder Information
Dividends 
Dividends are normally paid twice a year. The proposed final dividend 
in respect of the year to 31 December 2005 will be payable on 
23 June 2006 to those shareholders on the register on 28 April 2006. 
A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) will also be offered.
For those shareholders who prefer not to participate in the DRIP ,
arrangements can be made to pay your dividends automatically into
your bank or building society account. This service has a number 
of benefits:
• there is no chance of the dividend cheque going missing in the post;
• the dividend payment is received more quickly, as the cash is paid
directly into your account on the payment date without the need to
wait for the cheque to clear; and
• you will be helping Carillion to improve its efficiency by reducing
printing and cheque clearing costs.
If you wish to register for this service please call Lloyds TSB Registrars
on the number detailed below to request a dividend mandate form.

Share dealing service 
Carillion now offers its UK shareholders, Shareview Dealing, a
telephone and internet share sale service operated by Lloyds TSB
Registrars. For telephone sales call 0870 850 0852 between 8.30am
and 4.30pm, Monday to Friday, and for internet sales log on to
www.shareview.co.uk/dealing. You will need your shareholder
reference number as shown on your share certificate.
Multiple accounts on the shareholder register
If you have received two or more sets of the documents concerning 
the Annual General Meeting this means that there is more than one
account in your name on the shareholder register, perhaps because
either your name or your address appear on each account in a slightly
different way. For security reasons, the Registrars will not amalgamate
the accounts without your written consent, so if you would like any
multiple accounts combined into one account, please write to Lloyds
TSB Registrars at the address given above.
Shareview (electronic communications)
www.shareview.co.uk is a service offered by Lloyds TSB Registrars that
enables you to check your holdings in many UK companies and helps
you to organise your investments electronically. You can register for this
portfolio service which is easy to use, secure and free as long as you
have access to the internet by logging on to www.shareview.co.uk 
and following a simple registration process.
Electronic proxy appointments
For the AGM to be held on 10 May 2006, you may, if you wish,
register the appointment of a proxy electronically by logging on to 
the website www.sharevote.co.uk 
You will need your voting reference numbers (the three 8-digit
numbers shown on your form of proxy). Alternatively, if you have
registered for a Shareview portfolio, log on to your portfolio at
www.shareview.co.uk and click on ‘Company Meetings’.
Please note that any electronic communication that is found to 
contain a computer virus will not be accepted.
ShareGift
ShareGift is a charity share donation scheme for shareholders,
administered by the Orr Mackintosh Foundation. It is especially 
for those who may wish to dispose of a small parcel of shares 
whose value makes it uneconomic to sell on a commission basis.
Further information can be obtained at www.sharegift.org or from
Lloyds TSB Registrars. Section 08

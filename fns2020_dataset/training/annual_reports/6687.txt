+ Excludes data from our aviation services division.The conversion factors used are in accordance with ‘Guidelines to DEFRA’s Greenhouse Gas Conversion Factors for Company Reporting’ June 2008. We’re on track: Group leadership
The Group adopts a flat decentralised
management structure. The devolved
nature of the Group ensures
accountability for operating
performance lies with each operating
company, while the flat structure
means that the Executive Directors
stay very close to the Group’s
operating businesses.
The Group Chief Executive and Group
Finance Director meet with each of
our twelve operating companies once
a month to review and discuss their
operating and financial performance.
In addition to providing strategic
direction, financial expertise and
governance, the Group shares best
practice and co-ordinates IT,
procurement, property, pensions,
energy, engineering and communication
activities.The total number of
employees at the Group level remains
fewer than 50 out of a total of over
27,100.
An example of a Group initiative to
secure financial benefits of scale is the
drive to improve the procurement
process and reduce the number of
suppliers.This has resulted in savings of
around £7 million in 2009 and should
continue to show benefits in
subsequent years.
T oday’s key issues
Our UK focus and devolved structure
differentiates us from the other major public
transport groups. Our operations are located in
high density commuter markets, predominantly in
the South East of England, where there is strong
demand for public transport.
We believe that public transport is best provided locally.
All of our bus and rail companies are locally branded and
form an integral part of the communities they serve. Our
customers typically make simple journeys over fairly short
distances. Many of those passengers are daily commuters
who recognise the local brands they use.
We empower our local managers to deliver services to their
own markets in the way they best see fit.This local focus
and understanding of culture means that we are able to
provide high quality services and can respond quickly to
passenger needs.
We believe that our devolved organisation is the most
effective way to run our Group.This flat structure enables
us to monitor closely the performance of each operating
company while giving local managers the autonomy they
need to run their businesses.
Focusing on local markets
In today's challenging marketplace there are a number of key issues which we continue to
focus on to keep the Group on track to meet our targets and deliver value to our shareholders.
Our devolved structure gives us the ability to understand our markets and respond quickly to take
full advantage of opportunities and issues as they arise. As a Group, we are committed to being
a responsible operator and to ensuring a sustainable future for our business and our industry.
This year, tackling climate change has been a key area of focus, not only reducing our impact
on the environment but also generating substantial cost savings across the Group.
2 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Business Review
As an example of our community focus,
Brighton & Hove’s buses feature local
passengers who are proud to use their
services. Brighton & Hove bus patronage has
grown by around 5% per year since 1993
contributing to a 3% reduction in city centre
traffic in the last three years. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges
facing the world today. Reducing our environmental
impact is an integral part of our Group strategy.
It helps to ensure we are a responsible operator
as well as realising significant cost efficiencies.
We have implemented a number of key energy efficiency
projects across the Group this year which we estimate will
reduce annual operating costs by approximately £5 million
and CO
2
emissions by around 30,000 tonnes.
In addition, our progress will help mitigate the financial
implications of the Carbon Reduction Commitment
obligations which come into effect in April 2010.*
The Government has set legally binding carbon targets, to
reduce UK greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050.
Transport now contributes a quarter of UK carbon
emissions, with cars accounting for more than half of this. In
contrast, buses and trains contribute less than 5%. More
people on our services mean fewer car journeys on the
road, reducing congestion and pollution.
We therefore have two key responsibilities: to deliver
high quality services that provide attractive alternatives to
car travel; and at the same time to provide those services
in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner.
* The Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) is a proposed mandatory cap and trade
scheme that will apply to large non-energy intensive UK organisations in the public
and private sectors. It will apply to the Group’s site energy consumption.

Gold Award
For the third year in a row Go-Ahead
achieved a gold rating in Business in
the Community’s (BITC) 2009
Corporate Responsibility Index –
the highest rating amongst
comparable participating public
transport operators.
In recognition of our commitment
to operating responsibly, we have
become the first UK public
transport company to be officially
certified with the CarbonTrust
Standard after taking action on
climate change.
The CarbonTrust Standard
is the UK's only independent
certification recognising
achievements in action on climate
change by leading organisations
in industry, commerce and the
public sector. It is also the world’s
first carbon award scheme that
requires an organisation to
measure, manage and reduce its
carbon footprint and actually
make real reductions year-on-
year.
“We congratulate Go-Ahead in
achieving the CarbonTrust
Standard and challenge other
organisations to follow their
example and prove that they
too are taking tangible steps
to fight climate change.”
Tom Delay,
CEO, CarbonTrust

Reduction Strategy for Transport – July 2009.
‘Other’ includes LPG emissions; road vehicle engines; aircraft support vehicles.
We operate the UK’s first high speed
domestic rail service between Kent and
London. High speed rail is at the heart
of the Government’s plans to reduce the
UK's carbon emissions. 4 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Business Review
Chairman’s statement
The effects of the economic downturn
during the past twelve months have
demanded exceptional effort to stay on
track.We have achieved that and have
delivered a good set of results as a
consequence.
Our long standing strategy is to
deliver high quality passenger transport
services in dense, urban markets, primarily
through bus and rail.This has provided us with
a core of strong and sustainable positions in
regulated and deregulated bus markets, which
have been resilient in the current economic
environment.The bus operations are
complemented by our significant UK rail
presence which consists of a 65% share in
three strategically selected, commuter focused
rail franchises.These are tightly managed to
deliver shareholder value and we are delighted
to have retained the Southern franchise for
another five years from September 2009.
Business performance highlights
Overall, revenue increased by £147.0m,
or 6.7%, to £2,346.1m (2008: £2,199.1m)
primarily due to a full year of London Midland
and Gatwick Express rail revenue. Operating
profit* was slightly ahead of our expectations
at £123.6m, albeit £21.3m or 14.7% below last
year’s particularly strong result (2008:
£144.9m).Adjusted earnings per share (before
amortisation and exceptional items) were
152.3p (2008: 174.8p) and basic earnings per
share were 14.7p (2008: 128.8p). Profit for the
year,after tax and exceptional items, was
£18.3m (2008: £76.8m).
Dividends
Following the Group’s good performance,
the Board is proposing a final dividend of
55.5p per share (2008: 55.5p) to maintain
the total dividend for the year at 81p (2008:
81p).The final dividend is payable on 20
November 2009 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business
on 6 November 2009.
The Board of Directors
and Governance
Christopher Collins retired from the Board
as a Non-Executive Director on 23
October 2008.As I said last year, we will
miss Christopher’s significant contribution
to the Group.Andrew Allner joined the
Board as a Non-Executive Director and
Chairman of the Audit Committee on 24
October 2008. Rupert Pennant-Rea was
appointed as the Senior Independent
Director on 23 October 2008.
On track
“We believe we
are well placed for
the year ahead,
although we
continue to assume
economic
conditions in
the UK will
remain difficult
over the next
twelve months.” Sir Patrick Brown, Chairman The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 5
Information in this Annual Report
The Group has always been committed
to open and transparent reporting.
We recognise the importance of
enhancing our disclosure in these
challenging economic times so that
our shareholders are able to better
understand our business. In this year’s
Annual Report we have provided more
information on the Group’s markets,
strategy, performance against financial and
non-financial Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) and risks.We have also provided
more detail about corporate governance
and the Group’s devolved nature and
local focus.
Corporate Responsibility
As a public transport operator, corporate
responsibility is integral to the way we run
our business.The safety and security of
our passengers, our people and the
general public is an absolute priority for
the Group.We have included employee,
bus and rail safety KPIs throughout this
report.Although we operate through a
devolved structure, we recognise the
importance of sharing best practice.This
year we strengthened the Group’s health
& safety forums to enhance the transfer
of knowledge and expertise across the
Group.
We remain committed to improving the
energy efficiency of our operations. Not
only does this have important
environmental benefits but it helps to
reduce operating costs. Key Group wide
energy saving initiatives are highlighted
throughout this report which we estimate
will reduce annual operating costs by
around £5m and CO
2
emissions by
30,000 tonnes. One of our primary
environmental responsibility measures is
CO
2
emissions per passenger journey
(ppj) for bus and rail. Overall, this has
increased slightly from last year as a result
of the full year contribution from London
Midland, a predominantly diesel, and
therefore more carbon intensive,
franchise. Excluding London Midland, the
underlying measure has reduced by 2%.
Employees
The number of employees in the Group
averaged 27,177 for the financial year,
below last year’s 27,627 due to the various
restructuring programmes across the
Group. I would like to thank all of our
employees for their dedication and hard
work through these challenging economic
conditions, ensuring that we remain a
strong and successful Group.
Outlook
We have not changed our overall view on
the outlook since our trading update in
June 2009.We believe we are well placed
for the year ahead, although we continue
to assume economic conditions in the UK
will remain difficult over the next twelve
months.
Our bus operations have proven to
be robust and we expect demand for
these services to remain strong.
Our rail operations should deliver a good
level of profitability in the year ahead, albeit
below the level achieved to June 2009. Our

Directors’ Report: Business Review
Group Chief Executive’s review
We are pleased with this year’s
performance, which has been
delivered through our experienced
and focused management style and
devolved structure.
Overview of operating performance
Overall operating performance was
slightly ahead of our expectations, with
operating profit* of £123.6m underpinned
by record results from our bus operations
and good results from rail after a
particularly strong year to June 2008.
Strong cash management resulted in
a reduction in net debt to £91.0m
(2008: £197.8m).T otal capital
investment was in line with depreciation
to maintain our high quality asset base.
We remain highly disciplined in our
assessment of potential acquisitions
and franchise bids.We were delighted
to retain our Southern rail franchise
which we believe we secured on the
basis of current and prudent economic
assumptions and deliverable initiatives.
We did not complete any acquisitions
during the year but, as recently
announced, we have agreed to acquire
EastThames Buses fromTransport for
London (TfL) for £5m and Arriva’s
Horsham bus operations for £5m. Both
are due to complete in the second
quarter of the new financial year.
We remain financially robust, with
a strong balance sheet and secure
financing and propose to maintain our
full year dividend to shareholders at
81p per share (2008: 81p per share).
Divisional performance overview
Bus
Our bus division performed slightly
ahead of our expectations for the year,
reporting record results despite
adverse movements in fuel, pension and
accident claims costs.We increased
revenue in all six of our bus companies;
a result which endorses the economic
resilience of these operations. Our
devolved structure provided high levels
of service quality, customer focus and
strong local cost control.This was
supplemented by Group purchasing
power and de-risked through
comprehensive fuel hedging. Capital
investment above depreciation ensured
we continued to benefit from well
maintained freehold depot locations
and from one of the youngest bus
fleets in the sector.
Experienced
“Our strategy
is straightforward
and we remain
confident in the
underlying strengths
of the Group. ”
Keith Ludeman, Group Chief Executive The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 7
Rail
Our rail operations performed well, in
line with our expectations.
Each UK rail franchise is different and
we believe our three franchises are
relatively robust given their focus on
high density, urban commuter markets.
Revenue continued to grow in all three
operations, albeit, as expected, at a
slower rate in the second half and
overall service quality remained strong.
We are making good progress with
cost control initiatives, particularly in
Southeastern and also in London
Midland where we have recently
appointed a new managing director to
lead the changes in that franchise.
Looking forward, we are well advanced
with preparations for the new Southern
franchise commencing in September
2009 and the UK’s first domestic high
speed rail service in Southeastern from
December 2009.
Aviation services
Aviation services delivered a
performance in line with our
expectations.This was despite difficult
trading conditions in ground handling
and cargo and the previously reported
loss of contracts in Meteor parking.We
recognised an exceptional non-cash
impairment charge of £38.4m in the
first half to reduce the carrying value of
our ground handling and cargo
operations to approximately £20m.We
will continue with the necessary
restructuring in this division to protect
against near term deterioration in
operating results and to strengthen our
medium term position.
Market environment
Public transport remains crucial to the
development of the UK and is strongly
supported by the main political parties.
We believe that it is likely to generate
long term growth if supported by
operators with strong local stakeholder
relationships providing high quality
services and innovation.
In the short term, we need to deal with
the current phase of the economic
cycle. Demand for our bus operations
has proven to be resilient. In rail, we
believe that the underlying passenger
revenue growth (before new services
and other initiatives) will broadly follow
the economic cycle.We expect the
market conditions for our aviation
services division to remain challenging
in the near term.
Our strategy
Our strategy remains to provide high
quality passenger transport in the UK.
The underlying elements of this strategy
are to:
•Run our companies in a socially and
environmentally responsible manner
•Provide high quality, locally focused
passenger transport services
•Prioritise high density, urban markets
in the UK
•Maintain strong financial discipline to
deliver shareholder value
These elements have a number of
performance indicators, both financial
and non financial, which are routinely
measured for improvement trends
and comparison between
operating companies.
In the near term, our priority is to
deliver value from our existing portfolio
of operations.
Key risks to our performance include a
major accident or incident, or an
unexpected reduction in demand for
our services.We operate a strong
governance structure and control
environment to mitigate these and
other risks as far as possible.
In summary
We are pleased with this year’s
performance. Our strategy is
straightforward and we remain
confident in the underlying strengths of
the Group. Going forward, we will
maintain our financial discipline and
prioritise the delivery of value from our
existing portfolio of operations.

Directors’ Report: Business Review
Group Chief Executive’s review continued
tenders for each bus route and private
operators enter a competitive bidding
process for the right to operate them.
The contracts are usually five years in
duration with a two year extension if
TfL performance targets are met. Route
contracts are awarded on a cost per
mile basis.This means that bus
operators are not subject to any
revenue risk.
TfL contracts are price index adjusted,
designed to offset inflationary increases
in costs. Broadly speaking, operators’
profits are therefore not impacted
by inflation changes.
Having a good network of bus depots
is important for London operators.
Go-Ahead has 15 strategically located
London depots, with around 85% of
our capacity owned as freehold.
Quality Incentive Contracts
Companies are awarded bonuses for
achievingTfL performance targets in
areas such as punctuality, cleanliness and
customer service.These bonuses are
called Quality Incentive Contracts
(QICs). Our London bus operations
rank consistently high in theTfL
performance league tables, resulting in
bonus payments fromTfL. In 2009
quality incentive bonuses totalled
£14.2m (2008: £13.7m).
Our Markets
This section focuses on the UK bus and
rail markets, where over 90% of the
Group’s revenue is generated.
Long term growth in public transport
We firmly believe in the fundamental
strengths of UK public transport.All
major political parties support and
recognise the importance of public
transport for the UK’s present and
future needs. Not only do we anticipate
a long term increase in the demand for
public transport as the population
grows, we also recognise that growth
in an efficient public transport system
is a necessity for the UK Government
to meet its ambitious climate
change obligations.
UK Bus
Bus travel is the most frequently used
mode of public transport. It accounts
for two-thirds of all public transport
journeys and 95% of local bus journeys
involve a single bus ride.
The UK bus market is split into
two models: the regulated London
market and the deregulated market
outside London.
Go-Ahead operates in the UK bus
market through six business units:
Go-Ahead London, Go North East,
Go South Coast, Metrobus, Brighton
& Hove and Oxford Bus Company.
Go-Ahead London and most of
Metrobus’ operations are regulated
byTransport for London (TfL).
London regulated market
The London bus market is different
from the rest of the UK. Figure 1 shows
the London bus market share.With the
recent agreement to acquire East
Thames Buses, Go-Ahead will become
the largest operator in the capital with
a market share of around 21%.
TfL is responsible for the provision of
bus services in the capital. Operating
under a regulated system,TfL issues
“A well-functioning
public transport
system is crucial to
the UK: it plays a
key role in building a
strong economy and
is an essential
means of creating a
fair society. Public
transport also has a
central part to play
in helping to reduce
carbon emissions.
Put simply, by
encouraging the
travelling public out
of their cars and
onto the lower
carbon alternatives
of public transport,
congestion can be
reduced and
emissions can
be cut.”

London passenger growth and
the impact of the current climate
Figure 2 shows that after a period of
relatively flat growth, from the mid
1990s bus use in London has increased
significantly. Indeed, the network
underwent considerable expansion in
the run up to the introduction of the
congestion zone in 2003.
Demand for bus travel in the capital
remains strong and the market is
regarded as being relatively resilient to
the current economic climate. Bus use
in the UK is at its highest in London
with around 2 billion passenger
journeys a year .This is due to many
localised factors such as:
• Congestion zone charging for private
car use
• Limited and expensive car parking
facilities
• High proportion of bus lanes (almost
300km)
• Significant percentage of the
population without car ownership
• Bus is typically the cheapest method
of public transport in the capital
Deregulated passenger growth and
the impact of the current climate
Figure 2 shows that local bus volumes
significantly declined in the 1970s as car
ownership widened and investment in
public transport reduced.The
deregulation and privatisation of the
bus industry took place in 1986. From
the mid 1990s the rate of decline has
slowed significantly and volumes have
increased in recent years as investment
by operators and the Government has
increased service quality.
Within the overall deregulated market
it is important to note that there are
considerable local and regional
variations. Go-Ahead’s strategy is to
focus our operations in dense urban
markets which can support a
comprehensive network of bus routes,
offering good value and ease of use for
both commuter and leisure travel.We
believe that important factors for
operating successfully include providing
high quality and punctual services and
having strong local relationships with
customers and local authorities.
The deregulated market is generally
perceived to be resilient to economic
downturns. Bus can often be the
cheapest way to travel and offers a low-
cost alternative to other modes in a
more difficult economic environment.
Bus Concessionary Fares Scheme
In April 2008, the Bus Concessionary
Fares Scheme was extended so that
anyone aged 60 or over, or who is
registered disabled, is entitled to free
travel on any off-peak local bus service
in any part of England.The Government
has invested £1.2bn in the scheme,
resulting in around 11 million people
being eligible for free travel. Operators
are reimbursed a percentage of the full
fare by local authorities for each
journey taken.
Overall, we believe that the scheme is a
positive step for the industry as it
increases bus use. However, the
implementation of the scheme is
complicated and has given rise to a
small number of disputes with some
local authorities. Concessionary fare
passengers have continued to grow
beyond April 2009, the first anniversary
of the scheme, as ‘free’ travel has
further increased in attractiveness as a
result of the economic downturn.
Concessionary passengers now
represent just over 30% of Go-Ahead’s
bus passengers and just over 20% of
bus revenue.
Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance Financial Statements Directors’ Report: Business Review
Our markets
Bus operating cost base
Ongoing cost control is an important
part of running a good bus operation.
As the pie chart on page 22 shows,
labour cost accounts for around 60% of
total costs. Fuel accounts for around
11%. Typically, bus operators have some
flexibility within their cost base and in
economic downturns may be able to
match service levels to demand.
UK Rail
Go-Ahead
Our rail operation, Govia, is owned 65%
by Go-Ahead and 35% by Keolis, a
French-based operator of passenger
transport services which is majority
owned by the French national railway
SNCF.Through Govia, Go-Ahead
operates three rail franchises –
Southeastern, Southern and London
Midland – making us the UK’s busiest
rail operator, carrying almost 30% of rail
passengers.There are currently 19 rail
franchises in the UK. Figure 3 shows UK
rail market share by revenue.
Our strategy is to operate urban
intensive commuter franchises centred
around London.Around 45% of all
commuter rail journeys into London
are made on our franchises.
Figure 4 shows that across Britain
commuting is the most common reason
for taking the train.
Rail franchising system
The franchise model was introduced
with the privatisation of the rail industry
in 1996. Each franchise agreement
tenders specific rail operations on a
contract basis and typically lasts for
around eight years.The Department for
Transport (DfT) submits an Invitation
toTender (ITT) to interested bidders
which outlines the detailed
commitments the franchise must deliver,

Group Chief Executive’s review continued
94% of target, the government provides
support of 80% of the shortfall below
94%. Revenue support is designed to
provide significant mitigation for
revenue shortfalls in the later part of
the franchise.There is a symmetrical
system for revenue share if revenue
exceeds the original target revenue
specified in the contract.
Passenger growth & the impact
of the current climate
Figure 6 shows that, since the rail
industry was privatised, the market has
experienced an unprecedented level of
growth. Indeed, for the first time since
the second world war over 1 billion
train journeys were made in the UK in
2003-04, rising to 1.27 billion in 2008-09.
Since 1996 the rail industry has been
through a period of unprecedented
investment byTOCs and the UK
Government, resulting in an improved
quality of service. Punctuality levels have
reached new highs and according to the
National Passenger Survey published in
June 2009, 81% of passengers are
satisfied with their rail experience.
Levels of growth in passenger numbers
and revenue have slowed recently as a
result of rising unemployment, less
discretionary rail travel and more cost-
conscious consumers trading down.At
the same time this has been mitigated
in part by more people choosing to
travel by rail, rather than incurring the
costs of private motoring.
Broadly speaking, the subsidy and
premium profile takes into account
indexation soTOCs’ profits are not
impacted by inflation changes.The
bidding process usually takes around
a year and typically costs around £3-4
million per franchise.
TOCs are required to take the revenue
risk for any franchise contract, subject
to revenue share and support
mechanisms outlined below. IfTOCs
forfeit their franchise agreements for
any reason the Government may seek
to enforce penalties.This may include a
cross default provision of other franchises
operated by the parent group.
Over the past four years, Govia has
achieved the greatest success rate in
UK rail bidding, winning three franchises
out of four bids. Most recently, it was
announced in June 2009 that Govia had
retained the Southern franchise.
Revenue share & support mechanism
A franchise agreement typically includes
a revenue share and support
mechanism. Figure 5 shows the DfT
model which applies to our franchises.
The revenue share mechanism begins at
the start of the franchise and the
revenue support mechanism typically
starts at the beginning of the fifth year.
If revenue falls to between 94% and
98% of the original target revenue
specified in the contract, the
government provides additional subsidy
equal to 50% of the shortfall between
these thresholds. If revenue is below
such as timetabling and capacity.The
ITT also outlines the formula to be
used for annual regulated (peak time)
fare increases, which is typically the
preceeding year’s July RPI +1%.
Once the DfT has issued the ITT, train
operating companies (TOCs) enter a
competitive bidding process for the
right to operate the franchise.TOCs
assume how much revenue growth
they can generate through passenger
demand and growth.This is driven by a
combination of economic conditions
and ‘self help’ measures such as revenue
protection and marketing. Based on
these revenue and cost assumptions
and required returns, the bidder
specifies the premium profile they will
pay to the DfT or the subsidy profile
they require from the DfT to make
running the franchise a viable business.
It is important to note that
the rail industry is not a single
homogeneous entity as each
franchise has distinct
characteristics. Significant
variables include the type
of franchise (eg. Intercity;
commuter), the age and
length of the franchise and the
revenue bid assumptions and
subsidy / premium profiles.

Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance Financial Statements Directors’ Report: Business Review
Our markets
Rail franchises have a relatively high
proportion of fixed costs which means
that profits are sensitive to a fall in
revenue. However,TOCs have taken
action to help mitigate the impact of
the economic climate by reducing costs,
where possible, and implementing
revenue enhancing initiatives, such as
promoting cheaper off-peak fares and
greater revenue protection. In addition,
the revenue support mechanism may
helpTOCs who are eligible to receive it.
Modal shift
While mostly anecdotal, evidence
suggests that passengers are increasingly
making the switch from private car to
public transport. It is believed that high
fuel prices last year acted as a stimulus
for people to use bus and rail services.
Many passengers have continued to
use public transport as they found it
had improved significantly from
previous experiences.
In addition, the population is increasingly
seeking ‘greener’ and healthier lifestyles.
Instead of taking the car, people may
choose to cycle to the train station or
walk to the bus stop.An online survey
undertaken by our Brighton & Hove
bus company showed that 48% of
respondents had made the switch from
car to bus for some of their journeys.
The focus on reducing carbon
emissions, combined with the
frustration of driving on congested road
networks, is improving people’s
attitudes towards public transport.
Aviation Services
The aviation services division accounts
for less than 10% of the Group’s
revenue. Go-Ahead operates in the
aviation services market through
ground handling (primarily aviance UK)
and cargo handling (primarily Plane
Handling).We have operations at 15
UK airports, with a particularly strong
presence at Heathrow where we are
the largest independent handler
accounting for 28% of all aircraft
turnarounds. Our car parking operation,
Meteor, also falls within the aviation
services division.
Aviation Services and the impact
of the current climate
It has been widely reported that the
airline industry has experienced
challenging market conditions. Figure 7
shows the impact the economic climate
has had on passenger volumes and in
particular cargo.A combination of high
oil prices in 2007/08 and deteriorating
economic conditions resulting in fewer
passengers has impacted airline
profitability.Air cargo volumes have
been significantly hit as final demand has
fallen and inventory ‘destocking’ has
taken place. However, Figure 7 also
shows that there are signs the markets
may now be stabilising.
Go-Ahead has taken robust
management action to restructure the
business.This has helped, in part, to
mitigate the impact of the challenging
economic environment.
Long term growth
The UK remains one of the largest
aviation markets in the world.Around
240 million passengers a year travel
through UK airports and Heathrow is
one of the world’s busiest.Whilst there
are challenges for the aviation industry
in the short term, the long term growth
prospects are positive, driven by a rising
population, globalisation and economic
growth. In addition, international air
freight forms a vital component of
global supply chains as prosperity grows,
trade is liberalised and the demand for
just-in-time delivery increases.

responsible manner
3.
To prioritise our operations
in high density urban
markets in the UK
2.
To provide high quality,

Our strategy
In order to measure progress against our strategy the Board uses a number of Key Performance Indicators based around operating
responsibly and providing a high quality service.These are underpinned by strong financial indicators to ensure we deliver shareholder
value. KPIs are outlined on pages 13 and 14.
The effective delivery of our strategy is dependent on the Group successfully managing our risks and opportunities.A full assessment
of how we internally manage risks and our key risk factors are outlined on page 20.
Managing progress
Managing key risks
Why it’s important Priorities KPIs Risks
As a public transport operator,
corporate responsibility is integral
to the way we run our business.
Ensuring the safety and security of
our passengers and employees is an
absolute priority for us and our
performance on such issues is linked
to senior managers’ and the Board’s
remuneration.We are also
committed to reducing the
environmental impacts of our
operations and strongly believe that
a sustainable public transport
network is key to the future of the
UK.We believe acting responsibly
directly contributes to the success
of our business. In addition, reducing
our energy consumption helps to
reduce costs.
We are unique among the other
major public transport groups as we
operate exclusively in the UK.We
focus our operations in high density
commuter markets, predominantly in
the South East of England, where
there is a strong demand for public
transport.We are recognised as
having significant expertise in the UK
bus and rail market.This is welcomed
by our shareholders and will remain
our primary focus. However, we will
consider investment in overseas
operations if we believe that it will
add value for our shareholders.
We believe that providing a high
quality service encourages passenger
growth and offers an attractive
alternative to the private car.We
understand that punctuality, reliability
and value for money are the most
important factors for passengers
when choosing to travel by public
transport.We believe our devolved
structure and local focus helps to
generate passenger growth as our
local managers are able to respond
quickly to community needs.This flat
structure enables us to closely
manage the performance of each
operating company while giving local
managers the autonomy they need
to run their local businesses. Our aim
is to combine the value of this local
identity culture with the financial
benefits of Group scale and transfer
of best practice.

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
RIDDOR accidents per 100 employees
The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) is a statutory
requirement for all companies and relates to a work place incident which results in loss of work for over three
days or a legally reportable incident to the Health & Safety Executive. Monitoring this KPI helps us to measure
against our commitment to provide a safe working environment for our employees. Our aim is to reduce the
number of accidents each year.We were pleased to report no employee fatalities this financial year. Group
data is broken down by bus, rail and aviation services on pages 24, 34 and 37 respectively.
Bus accidents* per million miles
The Board monitors the number of bus accidents which result in a notification to a claims handler. Monitoring
this KPI helps us to measure against our commitment to provide a safe and positive travel experience for our
passengers and helps us to manage accident claim costs. Our aim is to reduce the number of accidents each
year.
SPADs per million miles
Across the rail industry train operating companies are legally required to report Signals Passed at Danger
(SPADs). Although every SPAD is treated as a serious incident, most SPADs occur at low speed where
braking distance has been misjudged and the train is stopped by automatic warning systems and therefore the
likelihood of an accident is very low. Monitoring SPADs helps us to measure against our commitment to
provide a safe passenger service. Our aim each year is to reduce the number of SPADs and the risk of any
incident when a SPAD does occur.

Punctuality KPIs
Rail punctuality
The punctuality of our rail operations is measured on the basis of the Department forTransport’s Public
Performance Measure (PPM) moving annual average.This is the percentage of trains that arrive at their final
destination within 5 minutes of their scheduled arrival time having called at all scheduled stations.This time
frame is an industry standard definition of what constitutes being 'on-time'. We are committed to providing
reliable services and our aim is to improve punctuality each year. The PPM industry average is 90.6%**.

Financial KPIs
Operating profit growth
This helps us to measure the underlying performance of our operating companies. It is measured before
amortisation and exceptional items to provide more comparable year on year information.We aim to
increase operating profit* (excluding acquisitions or disposals) and adjusted earnings per share* year on year.
Strong cash management
We manage payment and receipts closely to convert operating profit (before amortisation & exceptional
items) into operating cash. Our aim is to match cashflow generated from operations to operating profit* plus
depreciation (EBITDA).
Capital investment
We invest in capital to both maintain and enhance our operations. Our aim is for capital investment to match
depreciation through the cycle, except if additional spend will add shareholder value.
Value adding acquisitions
We continue to assess acquisition opportunities primarily in the UK, but these will only be pursued if we
believe they will add value for our shareholders.We made no acquisitions in the financial year. Our aim is for
post tax operating profit* from transactions to exceed our post tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%.

dividend cover (adjusted earnings per share* divided by dividend per share) to assess how much of our
profits we can pay out as a dividend. Our aim is for dividend cover to average 2x adjusted earnings per
share* through the cycle.
Strong capital structure
We are committed to preserving a strong capital structure. Our aim is to maintain adjusted net debt /
EBITDA at between 1.5x and 2.5x through the cycle.

London bus punctuality
The reliability of our London bus operations is measured on the basis ofTransport for London’s (TfL) excess
waiting time.This is the time in minutes passengers have to wait for a bus above the average scheduled
waiting time.Therefore, the lower the excess waiting time the better. We are committed to providing
punctual services and our aim is to maintain our low excess waiting time performance.The industry average
is 1.09 minutes.
Deregulated bus punctuality
The punctuality of our deregulated bus operations is measured as a percentage of buses that arrive at their
stop one minute early to five minutes late.Therefore the higher the percentage the better.This time frame is
an industry standard definition of what constitutes being 'on-time'. We are committed to providing reliable
services and our aim is to improve punctuality each year.The industry average is 74%*.

Pensions
Operating profit* included the net cost
of the Group’s defined benefit pension
plans of £36.1m (2008: £24.9m).The
increase of £11.2m comprised an
additional £8.5m in rail, of which
£2.6m was due to a full year of London
Midland, and £2.7m was non-rail costs
(primarily bus). Company cash
contributions to the schemes were
£2.8m higher than the net cost in the
income statement, totalling £38.9m
(2008: £41.7m, inclusive of a £7.5m
additional contribution).
The total net pension deficit after tax
was £60.1m (2008: £42.8m), consisting
of a total pre-tax liability of £83.5m
(2008: £59.4m) less a deferred tax
asset of £23.4m (2008: £16.6m).
The net deficit before taxation on the
non-rail defined benefit schemes was
£76.0m (2008: £59.4m), consisting of
estimated liabilities of £428.7m
(2008: £436.2m) less assets of £352.7m
(2008: £376.8m).
The net deficit before taxation on the
rail schemes was £7.5m (2008: £nil).
The nature of these schemes means
that we only recognise the share of
deficit (or surplus) expected to be
funded (or received) over the franchise
period.
Goodwill and intangible amortisation
The charge for the period of £12.4m
(2008: £11.6m) represents the non-
cash cost of amortising goodwill,
intangibles including assets associated
with pension accounting for the rail
franchises and computer costs. The
increase against the prior period reflects
a full year of ownership of
the London Midland franchise.
The past year has seen unprecedented
turmoil in the financial markets,
highlighting the importance of financial
discipline and strong cash management.
Operating profit
Operating profit* for the year was
£123.6m, 14.7% below last year (2008:
£144.9m) primarily due to a particularly
strong prior year in our rail division.
Adjusted earnings per share* followed
a similar trend, down 12.9% to 152.3p
per share (2008: 174.8p). Basic earnings
per share were 14.7p per share (2008:
128.8p per share) as a result of
significant exceptional items.
Cash conversion
Cash conversion was excellent, with
cashflow generated from operations
of £233.4m (2008: £192.5m) compared
to operating profit before depreciation,
amortisation and exceptional items
(EBITDA) of £173.3m (2008:
£194.0m). Most of this improvement
came from favourable working capital
movements in our rail division which
are expected to reverse next year.
Balance sheet
Our balance sheet and financing remains
strong. Adjusted net debt to EBITDA
was 1.57x at June 2009 (June 2008:
1.65x) and remains well within our target
range of 1.5x-2.5x through the cycle. Our
funding is secured to November 2012
through a five year syndicated loan facility
and at June 2009 we had headroom
within this facility of £101.0m.
Operating profit before
depreciation, amortisation and
exceptional items (EBITDA)
EBITDA was £173.3m (2008: £194.0m),
consisting of operating profit* of
£123.6m (2008: £144.9m) and
depreciation of £49.7m (2008: £49.1m).

Minority interest
The minority interest in the income
statement of £12.0m (2008: £20.8m)
arises from our 65% holding in
Govia Limited (which owns our rail
operations) and therefore represents
35% of the profit after taxation of the
rail division.
Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted profit attributable to
members* was £65.4m (2008:
£76.0m). This consisted of a profit
attributable to members of £6.3m
(2008: profit £56.0m) adjusted to add
back members’ share of post tax
amortisation of £6.9m (2008: £6.4m),
and members’ share of exceptional
items of £52.2m (2008: £13.6m).
The weighted average number of
shares reduced to 42.9 million (2008:
43.5 million) due to the repurchase of
shares during last year. The closing
number of shares in issue, net of
treasury shares, was 42.9 million (2008:
42.8 million).
Adjusted earnings per share* decreased
by 12.9% or 22.5p per share to 152.3p

Summary income statement
* Before amortisation and exceptional items
Net finance costs
The net finance costs for the period
reduced to £11.5m (2008: £13.8m)
due to a reduction in average levels of
net debt and lower interest rates
towards the end of the period. The
average net interest rate was 5.0%
(2008: 6.4%) for the period and the
proportion of gross debt held under
fixed interest agreements at 27 June
2009 was 47.2% (2008: 30.2%).
Exceptional items
Exceptional items were significant in
the year, totalling £57.7m before
taxation, of which £49.8m was
recognised in the first half. Most of the
items were non-cash, with cash items
totalling £10.1m. The largest item was a
first half, non-cash impairment charge of
£38.4m reflecting the challenging
conditions in aviation services. This
reduced the carrying value of the ground
handling and cargo operations within the
aviation services division to
approximately £20m at December 2008
and remains appropriate at the year end.
Non-cash exceptional items also
included £6.9m relating to the fair value
of part of the current year bus fuel
hedge (designated as ineffective under
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement’), £0.8m
in respect of accelerated depreciation
on articulated buses in London with a
further exceptional charge of around
£3m expected in relation to this issue
over the next two years, and £1.5m of
provision for onerous contracts in our
Meteor parking operations.
Exceptional cash costs totalled £10.1m,
consisting of restructuring and
reorganisation costs of £5.4m in
aviation services and £4.7m in rail.
Taxation
The net taxation charge in the income
statement of £23.7m (2008: £26.3m)
included underlying tax on ordinary
activities of £26.6m (2008: £29.1m),
equivalent to an effective rate of 26.7%
(2008: 24.4%).The increase in effective
rate compared to the decrease in UK
statutory rate for the period of 28.0%
(2008: 29.5%) reflects the reduced
availability of cost effective, tax
efficient asset finance arrangements
in the period.
The charge also included an
exceptional, non-cash tax charge of
£8.6m (following the UK Government’s
abolition of industrial buildings
allowances announced in July 2008) and
a tax benefit of £11.5m (2008: £2.8m)
resulting from the exceptional costs. Dividends
The Board is proposing a total dividend
for the year of 81.0p per share,
unchanged from last year and including
a proposed final payment of 55.5p
payable on 20 November 2009 to
shareholders on the register at the
close of business on 6 November 2009.
The is equivalent to a total payment of
£34.7m, based on 42.9 million shares.
Dividends paid in the period represents
the payment of last year’s final dividend
of 55.5p (2008: 55.5p) and the interim
dividend in respect of this year of 25.5p
per share (2008: 25.5p).
Dividend cover for the year was
1.9x adjusted earnings per share*
(2008: 2.2x).
Cashflow
Cash generated from operations before
taxation was £233.4m, an increase of
£40.9m against the same period last
year (2008: £192.5m). Favourable
working capital movements of £72.4m,
most of which are expected to reverse
next year and which primarily related to
the phasing of debtor and creditor
payments in rail, offset other cash
outflows of £12.3m which included
exceptional cash costs of £10.1m.
Tax paid of £11.4m (2008: £18.1m)
was primarily the current portion of the
tax charge of £23.7m, of which £8.6m
was a non-cash charge relating to the
abolition of industrial buildings
allowances, less a refund of £5.2m in
respect of prior years. Net interest paid
of £11.9m (2008: £14.0m) is in line
with the charge in the income
statement for the period of £11.5m
(2008: £13.8m). Capital expenditure,
net of sale proceeds, was similar to last
year at £56.2m (2008: £54.7m),
equivalent to 113% of depreciation
(2008: 111%).
Dividends paid to parent company
shareholders amounted to £34.8m
(2008: £31.4m) and dividends to
minority interests were £12.3m (2008:
£16.7m). During the period the
company has repurchased 13,615
shares at a cost of £0.2m (2008:
3,571,000 shares at a cost of £87.3m)
and 50,000 shares were issued (2008:
523,000 shares) on exercise of share
options for proceeds of £0.6m
(2008: £6.4m).

Balance sheet
Net debt reduced in the year by
£106.8m (2008: increase £53.3m) to
£91.0m (2008: £197.8m).
Net debt consisted of amounts drawn
down against the £340.0m five year
syndicated loan facility of £239.0m
(2008: £262.0m); other bank loans of
£36.0m (2008: £52.8m); hire purchase
and lease agreements of £18.1m
(2008:£34.3m) and overdrafts of £5.0m
(2008: £5.8m), partly offset by cash and
short term deposits of £207.1m
(2008:£157.1m) which included
restricted cash in rail of £181.3m (2008:
£122.9m).
Most of the increase in restricted cash
reflects the working capital movements
in rail which are expected to reverse
next year. Adjusted net debt, consisting
of net debt excluding restricted cash,
was £272.3m (2008: £320.7m),
equivalent to 1.57x EBITDA (2008:
1.65x), well within our target range of
1.5x to 2.5x through the cycle.
In addition, amounts provided to the
DfT for rail bank guaranteed
performance bonds were £131.7m
(2008: £96.5m) and season ticket
bonds of £110.2m (2008: £97.9m).
The Group had net liabilities of £9.5m,
primarily due to the low level of capital
employed within the rail operations.
The reduction of £77.0m compared to
net assets of £67.5m at 28 June 2008
consisted of profit for the period of
£18.3m plus proceeds of shares issued
of £0.6m and share based payment
credits of £0.5m, less: losses on financial
instruments of £29.9m net of tax; an
increase in pension scheme liabilities of
£19.4m net of tax and dividends paid of
£47.1m.
Distributable reserves in the parent
company used to pay dividends were
£443.3m (2008: £446.0m) which is
equivalent to 12.8 times the current full
year proposed dividend of £34.7m.
Financial outlook
We expect our financial position over
the next twelve months to remain
strong. The favourable working capital
movements in rail are expected to
reverse in the year, increasing net debt
but reducing restricted cash by a similar
amount. Capital investment is expected
to increase by around £20m compared
to 2009, reflecting the investment in the
new Southern franchise. We have
recently secured additional three year
loan facilities of £30m to refinance
payments of medium term debt made
last year which will preserve funding
headroom under our five year
syndicated facility.
Overall, we will maintain our strong
financial discipline to deliver
shareholder value.

Risk management
The effective management of risk
is essential to the delivery of the
Group’s objectives, protection of
its reputation and achievement of
sustainable shareholder value.
Go-Ahead’s devolved management
structure supports our robust risk
management and internal control
framework, as detailed in the
Corporate Governance report on
pages 44 to 62.
The diagram below illustrates the key
roles and responsibilities for each of the
respective functions within our risk
management framework. Ultimate
accountability for risk management lies
with the Board, supported by the work
of the Audit Committee to which the
Board has delegated responsibility for
reviewing the effectiveness of the
Group’s risk management and internal
control systems. With clear leadership
from the Board and Audit Committee,
the Executive Directors play an integral
role in helping the operating companies
identify, assess and monitor their
respective risks and controls. Through
monthly meetings with the senior
management of each operating
company, the Executive Directors
encourage open communication on
risk matters within a clearly defined
infrastructure and reporting process.
Ownership of risk identification and
mitigation lies with the senior
management in operating companies
where it is an integral part of day-to-
day local company operations.

The below table summarises our assessment of the key risks and uncertainties that could impact the Group’s performance. These risks
are monitored on an ongoing basis through the Group’s risk management processes, together with the effectiveness of mitigation through
the internal control environment. Material residual risk is assessed by the Board and accepted if appropriate as an integral part of the risk
and reward of the business, or deemed unacceptable and therefore either reduced, transferred to third parties or avoided by no longer
pursuing the relevant activity. The matters described are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all possible risks and uncertainties.

The performance of our bus
operations was slightly ahead of our
expectations, delivering a record
operating profit* for the year.
Revenue increased by 4.8%, or £27.0m,
to £584.7m (2008: £557.7m, including
£7.2m for Go West Midlands sold in
February 2008), equivalent to an
increase of 6.2% excluding Go West
Midlands. Revenue increased in all six
operating companies.
Operating profit* was £66.6m,
marginally ahead of last year (2008:
£66.2m, including a loss of £3.9m for
Go West Midlands).Operating profit*
margin was 11.4%, 0.5 ppts below last
year (2008: 11.9%).As expected, this
year’s operating profit* included
additional costs for fuel, pensions and
accident claims as well as the year on
year benefit from the sale of the loss
making Go West Midlands business in
February 2008.
Our underlying fuel costs, before
delivery and duty, were around £10m
higher than the same period last year.
We consume around 110 million litres
of fuel each year and hedged all of our
fuel requirements for the 2009 financial
year at 43 pence per litre (ppl)
compared with an average price of
34ppl in 2008.
The 2009 financial year also included an
additional £2.6m of pension costs and
an additional £5.3m charged for
accident claim costs compared with last
year, despite a reduction in the number
of incidents compared to 2008.The
increases in claim costs primarily relate
to our London and North East
operations and we continue to manage
these claims closely.
Ongoing cost control remained a
priority across our bus operations.
Labour accounts for around two thirds
of our cost base and is closely
controlled through local wage
negotiations and ongoing productivity
improvements. In addition, we estimate
we have saved around £2.5m
compared to last year through better
procurement, fuel consumption and site
energy consumption.

T otal depreciation for the division was
£31.5m (2008: £30.9m) and capital
expenditure was £44.9m (2008:
£36.3m). Capital expenditure included
£34.0m on new buses to upgrade
vehicles operating on a number of our
key revenue generating routes and to
maintain the average age of our
deregulated fleet as one of the
youngest in the sector.
Our regulated bus operations in
London continued to perform well.
Revenue increased by 6.1% in the
period, consisting of an increase in
contracted mileage of 1.8%, an average
increase in contract prices of
approximately 4% and an increase in
quality incentive bonuses to £14.2m
(2008: £13.7m).We continue to
perform well in theTfL quality league
tables and operated in excess of 99.6%
of our target mileage before traffic
congestion losses.
Revenue trends were as expected.The
second half growth rate of 3.8%
compared to a first half of 8.5% was
due to a 2.5% reduction in mileage
resulting from a net loss of contracts in
the second half. Much of this has been
subsequently recovered for the new
financial year. Around 85% of our
depot capacity in London is owned as
freehold which provides a strong base
for contract renewals.
During 2009,TfL commenced the
decommissioning of articulated “bendy”
buses as contracts are renewed.This is
expected to reduce residual values and
so we will provide for accelerated
depreciation of around £4m over the
next three years as an exceptional cost,
of which £0.8m has been recognised in
2009.
Bus
A convenient way to travel
As urban areas become more congested buses
are increasingly seen as a quick and convenient
way to travel. Investment in modern and high
quality fleets by operating companies, combined
with investment by local authorities in dedicated
bus routes, has resulted in cleaner, safer, more
frequent and punctual services.

Revenue growth continued in our
deregulated bus operations through a
combination of fare increases and
growing passenger numbers.
Like for like revenue (excluding Go
West Midlands) was up 6.4% and
increased in each of our deregulated
businesses. The number of passenger
journeys was 2.9% above the same
period last year, with around two thirds
of the increase due to concessionary
passengers. Non concessionary
passenger numbers increased by 1.2%
for the full year.
Revenue growth trends remain robust,
with second half growth of 6.2%,
broadly similar to first half growth of
6.6%. Passenger numbers in the second
half increased by 2.1% compared to a
first half rise of 3.6%. The latter reflects
the timing of the national concessionary
scheme which started on 1 April 2008.
The rate of increase in non
concessionary passenger numbers
accelerated from 0.8% in the first half
to 1.6% in the second half.
Value for money
Our devolved structure gives local bus companies
the autonomy to tailor products to their local
markets. In light of the current economic climate,
Go North East has focused heavily on marketing
value for money fares.  The bus market is relatively
resilient to economic downturns as bus can often be
the cheapest mode of tranpsort.

Deregulated We recognise the environmental and
business benefits of improving our fuel
efficiency. During this financial year we
fitted all of our 3,500 buses with ‘black
box’ technology which monitors engine
behaviour. The technology includes an ‘in-
cab’ prompt which notifies the driver
when they are not driving in a fuel efficient
way. Data collected from the black box is
monitored and analysed back in the office.
Results have been encouraging with fuel
efficiency improving by around 5%.
In addition to improving fuel efficiency
the technology, which promotes
smoother driving, can be used to reduce
accidents and data collected can also
play a key part in helping to mitigate
contentious accident claims. Improving
passenger comfort and meeting the
higher standards of Quality Incentive
Contracts (QICs) for our London
operators are also major benefits of
the technology. 
Our bus drivers are a key element to
making the programme a success. All
drivers have been through a ‘Safe &
Fuel Efficient Driving’ programme which
includes both theoretical and practical
training. T o help motivate employees,
operating companies run competitions
and schemes to reward drivers who
drive safely and efficiently.
We’re doing our part 
to cut emissions 
We’re on track

Hybrid technology
In addition to improving our fuel efficiency, we are
committed to trialling new technologies. Go-Ahead
London is already an active participant in on-going trials
of the latest hybrid buses, working in partnership with
Transport for London to keep abreast of developing
technology in this area. 
Tomas Koroknai, one of Go-Ahead London’s top performing fuel efﬁcient drivers receives his ‘Go-Green’ certiﬁcate from 
Keith Ludeman, Group Chief Executive.
Estimated annual savings: 
• £2.5 million cost saving 
• 14,500 CO
2 
tonnes. Equivalent 
to annual emissions from 
2,600 households.
Aim:  To improve fuel efficiency
by around 5%
Capital expenditure: £3 million 
(Avg life of technology up to 10 years)
The ‘RIBAS’ in cab prompt alerts drivers when
they are not driving fuel efficiently. 
We have made a significant investment in the latest 'black box' technology which
monitors engine behaviour and alerts the driver though an in-cab prompt when
they are not driving efficiently.

Hedging Policy & Prices
Our bus fuel hedging programme uses fuel swaps to fix the price of our diesel fuel in advance. Our aim is to be fully hedged for the next financial
year three months before the start of that year, at which point we aim to have also fixed at least 50% of the following year and at least 25% of the
year after that.This hedging profile is then maintained on a quarterly basis.
Bus fuel accounts for 11% of the cost base and we consume around 110 million litres of fuel each year.
FinancialYear Underlying cost of fuel*
2007/08 33.7p (50% hedged at 29p)
2008/09 Fully hedged at 43 pence per litre
2009/10 Fully hedged at 47 pence per litre
2010/11 Fully hedged at 41 pence per litre
*Before delivery, duty and duty rebate through the bus services grant.
We expect the underlying performance of
our bus operations to remain robust for the
next financial year.
Revenue growth in both our regulated and
deregulated operations is expected to
continue, albeit at a slower rate than the last
two years. In deregulated, this is primarily
because we are past the first anniversary of
the national concessionary scheme
(introduced on 1 April 2008) and are in a
lower inflation environment.
In London, we continue to assume that
forthcoming contract renewals will be more
competitive than when originally negotiated
Outlook
Making bus travel easier
In partnership with local authorities, many
of our deregulated bus routes offer ‘real time
text service’. Bus stops display a unique seven
letter code and when passengers text that
number they receive details of the next few
real time bus departures back within seconds.
In addition, many of our bus companies
have pages on facebook and twitter
where passengers can keep up to date
with the latest service information and
special promotions.
in 2002- 2004 and that quality incentive
targets will become increasingly
challenging.
Cost control across the division will
remain a priority.This includes ongoing
wage negotiations and productivity
improvements to maintain competitive
labour costs (which account for
approximately two thirds of our cost
base).We have fully hedged our fuel
costs for the financial year to June 2010
at 47 ppl and at 41 ppl for the following
financial year to June 2011 and are
confident we can recover the additional
cost of around £4m for the new financial
year.We are targeting further progress
with energy savings, fuel consumption
and procurement initiatives and are not
assuming any significant change in
pensions or accident claim costs
compared to the last financial year.
Overall, we expect performance next
year to be a little below the record level
achieved this year.The following year (to
June 2011) is expected to benefit from a
lower cost of fuel and contribution from
two acquisitions, namely EastThames
Buses fromTfL for £5m and Arriva’s
Horsham bus operations for £5m, both
of which are expected to complete in
the second quarter of the new financial
year. Rail
Our 65% owned rail operation is the busiest in the UK, responsible for
nearly 30% of UK passenger rail journeys through its three rail franchises:

Operating review continued
The results from our rail division were
in line with our expectations, following
a particularly strong performance last
year.
Revenue trends were in line with our
expectations, broadly following macro-
economic indicators such as Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and
employment levels. Revenue increased
by 12.6% or £173.6m, to £1,552.0m
(2008: £1,378.4m), primarily due to the
addition of the London Midland and
Gatwick Express operations and
continued growth in like for like
passenger revenue in Southern and
Southeastern.
Operating profit* fell by 20.3% or
£15.7m, to £61.5m (2008: £77.2m).The
reduction in operating profit* is partly
attributable to around £7m of
favourable settlements last year (which
were not repeated this year) and to
higher costs this year for the Southern
franchise bid of £3.5m (2008: £0.3m)
and £2m for industrial relations issues in
London Midland.
T otal depreciation for the rail division
was £13.0m (2008: £11.3m) and £0.7m
of the increase related to London
Midland. Capital expenditure was
£12.2m (2008 £9.3m), of which £8.1m
(2008 £1.9m) was in London Midland
and included investment in gating and
car parks to enhance revenue.

The Southern franchise provides
frequent train services connecting
central London to south London, the
South Coast and East and West Sussex,
including express services to Croydon,
Gatwick and Brighton. 
Performance Overview
Our Southern franchise performed well,
delivering an integrated Gatwick
Express service from 22 June 2008,
significant timetable changes from
December 2008, including new services
on the Brighton Main Line, and
operational support to the Thameslink
programme, whilst maintaining high
levels of operational and financial
performance. 
Our operational performance in
Southern remained strong despite
adverse weather in February, with a
record public performance measure
(PPM) showing that 90.7% (2008:
90.0%) of our trains arrived on time.
Initial teething difficulties with rolling
stock on the Brighton Main Line, which
have now been resolved, resulted in a
small reduction in our Spring national
passenger survey customer satisfaction
rating to 80% (2008: 81%).
T otal revenue in Southern consisted of
passenger revenue of £487.2m (2008:
£393.0m), other income of £32.5m
(2008: £29.8m) and net subsidy
receipts of £82.7m (2008: £134.3m). 
The increase in passenger revenue
consisted of £63.0m from Gatwick
Express and like for like growth in
passenger revenue (excluding Gatwick
Express) of 7.9%. Like for like passenger
numbers increased by 4.4% compared
to last year. As previously reported,
growth rates slowed in the second half
of the year, with like for like passenger
revenue growth of 6.0% compared to
11.1% in the first half. Like for like
passenger numbers increased by 2.2%
in the second half compared to 6.7% in
the first half.
As expected, Gatwick Express
experienced a reduction in passenger
numbers as a result of the fall in air
traffic at Gatwick airport. Overall, the
Gatwick operations are estimated to
have contributed a small operating
profit* for the year. 
Like for like operating profit* for
Southern was slightly below last year,
with cost reduction and profit share
offsetting the reduction in subsidy and
the slowing in the rate of revenue
growth. Approximately £21.1m of the
reduction in subsidy related to the
change in the Network Rail access
charge regime from 1 April 2009, with an
equal and opposite change in the rail
access charges. Other cost reduction
measures included energy savings
through regenerative braking and the
benefits of Group procurement. The
profit share arrangements in the current
franchise provide the DfT with 60% of
any profit increases or decreases.
Making rail travel easier
We are committed to making it easier for
passengers to travel on our services. Southern has
launched an online booking system where
passengers can quickly and easily buy their tickets
and can save a significant amount by buying
advance tickets online.

Awarded 
We were delighted to have been
awarded the Southern franchise 
for a second term.
See page 33 for details of the new franchise. We’re leading the way 
in high speed travel 
In December 2009 we will launch the
full timetable for the UK's first high
speed domestic rail service on High
Speed 1 (Channel T unnel Rail Link). 
The Hitachi built trains will run at
speeds of up to 140 mph and will
dramatically reduce current journey
times between Kent and London.
Based on detailed modelling, we expect
the service to open up new markets
among people currently commuting by
car to London and the Docklands.
Regulated fares for the service are
capped by the DfT at 20 – 30% higher
than current mainline fares.
At the end of June 2009, we began
running limited high speed ‘preview’
services. We are proud of the fact that
the project is ahead of schedule and
wanted passengers to be able to try
the service early. The preview service
also allows us to test the service and to
learn what passengers need and want.
Cutting journey times from Ashford to
London by 45 minutes to 37 minutes,

Performance Overview
Our Southeastern franchise has enjoyed
a good year, delivering significant
timetable changes from December
2008 and providing operational support
to the Thameslink programme as well
as preparing for the new timetable in
December 2009 which will include the
UK’s first domestic high speed rail
service.
Our operational performance in
Southeastern remained strong despite
adverse weather in February. Our
punctuality (PPM) was 90.8% (2008:
91.1%) and the franchise achieved a
customer satisfaction rating of 76% in
the Spring national passenger survey
(2008: 79%).
T otal revenue in Southeastern consisted
of passenger revenue of £473.6m
(2008: £449.1m), other income of
£18.7m (2008: £19.1m) and net subsidy
receipts of £85.5m (2008: £113.4m). 
The increase in full year passenger
revenue was 5.5%, consisting of a first
half increase of 8.9% and a second half
increase of 3.8%. Passenger numbers
increased by 1.0% compared to last
2009 revenue: £577.8m

The Southeastern franchise provides
frequent train services connecting Central
London to south east London, Kent and
parts of East Sussex. In December 2009 it
will introduce the full timetable for the
UK’s first high speed domestic service
between Kent and London. Preview
services began in June 2009.

year, with a first half increase of 4.3%
and a second half reduction of 1.7%
which was slightly better than the 2%
reduction we anticipated. The trends in
this franchise reflect the relatively large
percentage of London commuters and
hence the sensitivity to central London
employment. The difference between
passenger revenue and passenger
numbers reflects the RPI + 3% fare
regime in this franchise which continues
to 2010 and then reverts to RPI+1%
from 2011.
Approximately £21.2m of the reduction
in subsidy related to the change in the
Network Rail access charge regime
from 1 April 2009. 
Operating profit* was below the
exceptionally strong result for last year
but broadly in line with the franchise
bid. This was partly achieved through a
significant cost savings programme
which Southeastern started in the first
half of the year, including a reduction of
up to 300 positions which incurred an
exceptional charge of £1.9m,
procurement savings and other
efficiency savings which in total are
estimated to have saved nearly £10m
compared to last year.

London Midland operates through the
heart of England, connecting London,
the West Midlands and the North West.
Go-Ahead was awarded the London
Midland franchise in November 2007.
The franchise is formed from parts of
the former Silverlink County and
Central Trains businesses.
Performance Overview
The second half performance of our
London Midland franchise was mixed,
with good levels of revenue growth
offset by a number of operational issues
with the new December 2008
timetable and industrial relations
disputes which added around £2m of
costs in the period. Despite these issues,
we achieved a PPM of 86.7% (2008:
88.6%) and a customer satisfaction
Sustainable integration
We are committed to providing a sustainable and
integrated transport network. London Midland offers
reduced price parking for low emission vehicles and
free parking for electric vehicles. We are looking at
extending this across our other franchises. Across the
Southern network we have doubled the amount of
secure cycle spaces and as part of the new
Southern franchise, we will be providing 1,500 extra
cycle spaces.

A safe and secure way to travel
We are committed to ensuring the safety of our
passengers. We have made excellent progress in
reducing the level of crime on our rail networks.
Southeastern has seen a 25% drop in reported
crime over the past four years and the level of crime
across the Southern network is now at half the rate
it was in 2003. In addition, as part of the new
Southern franchise we have committed to providing
live 24 hour CCTV monitoring across all of our
stations. London Midland has achieved secure
station accreditation at 51 of its stations covering
76% of passengers travelling on the network. 
Rail
One of our live CCTV monitoring centres.
The overall outlook for rail for the
financial year to June 2010 remains in
line with our previously reported
expectations. We believe our three
franchises are relatively robust given
their focus on high density, urban
commuter markets.  However, we
continue to assume that underlying
demand (before new services and
initiatives) will slow in line with the
recent half year trends.
Changes to regulated fares will be
based on the July 2009 RPI of -1.4%
compared to our previous assumption
of -3%. This means regulated fares in
January 2010 are expected to reduce
by 0.4% in Southern and London
Midland and increase by 1.6% in
Southeastern.
In combination, we are not expecting
underlying passenger revenue growth
(before new services and other
initiatives) to be significant to June 2010.
Southern
In Southern, our existing franchise
operates until 20 September 2009.
During this period, we expect to maintain
earnings at similar levels to the equivalent
period last year - in part due to the profit
share regime which allocates 60% of any
incremental profit or loss to the DfT until
the end of the franchise. The new
franchise aims to improve the underlying
revenue trends by 4-5% to June 2010
through initiatives which were not
financially viable under the profit share
regime. We are well progressed with
mobilisation for the new franchise and
with preparation for these initiatives,
which include improvements to
Outlook
timetable, revenue protection and train
and station investment.
Southeastern
In the first half for Southeastern, we
expect benefits from our restructuring
programme to offset broadly the
adverse trends in passenger revenue
growth. Results for the second half will
largely depend on the success of the
new timetable and high speed rail
services from 13 December 2009. T o
date, the public reaction to the preview
of the high speed service has been
excellent. The high speed fares will
average 20-30% above the current
fares. This increase is generally perceived
to be reasonable by passengers given
the significant reduction in journey
times. Whilst difficult to predict, at this
stage we are targetting a mid single digit
percentage increase in overall passenger
revenue growth for the year as a result
of the new timetable and services, with
revenue support from the DfT available
from 1 April 2010 if the revenue
growth is below this level.
London Midland
In London Midland, our new
management team will aim to offset the
impact of lower revenue growth
through operational improvements,
restructuring programmes and further
investment in revenue enhancement
projects including gating and car
parking.
Overall
Our rail operations should deliver a
good level of profitability in the year
ahead, albeit below the level achieved
to June 2009.
We were delighted to have been
awarded the Southern franchise for 
a second term.

Reducing train electricity consumption
Over half of the Group’s carbon emissions result from rail traction electricity. It was
therefore a significant achievement when in 2008 Southern and Southeastern became
the first rail operators to introduce regenerative braking on the third rail system*. This
saves energy by capturing electricity through braking and returning it to the rail network.
In addition coasting boards and eco-driver training will help further reduce energy
consumption across our rail operations.
* The third rail or conductor rail is the electrical system by which some trains draw their power. This system is
mainly found in the South of England.

Revenue by operating activity
2009 Aviation Services highlights
The results from the aviation services
division were in line with our
expectations despite the difficult
trading conditions. 
Revenue fell 20.4% or £53.6m to
£209.4m (2008: £263.0m) and the
operating profit* decreased by £6.0m
to an operating loss of £4.5m (2008:
profit £1.5m).  The operating margin*
fell 2.7% from an operating profit
margin of 0.6% to a negative margin of
2.1%.
T otal depreciation for the division was
£5.2m (2008: £6.9m) and capital
expenditure was £2.5m (2008: £9.9m).
Ground handling and cargo
Our ground handling and cargo
operations achieved revenue of
£166.5m (2008: £195.9m) and an
operating loss* of £5.2m (2008: loss
£0.7m). The second half loss of £2.7m
was similar to the loss in the first half of
£2.5m and was achieved through cost
reduction plans to offset accelerating
revenue reduction.
Revenue in ground handling decreased
by 15.1% for the full year, consisting of a
first half reduction of 12.9% and a
second half reduction of 17.3%,
reflecting a similar trend in the number
of aircraft turnarounds. Around 40% of
the full year reduction was due to the
closure of our operations in Gatwick at
the end of August 2008 and, to a lesser
extent, the closure of Leeds Bradford

towards the end of the year.The
underlying reduction in aircraft
turnarounds reflects the broader
economic impact on the aviation sector,
leading to reduced flight schedules and
additional cancellations which reduces
our revenue given we are primarily paid
on a per turnaround basis.
Revenue reduction in our cargo
operations was particularly significant in
the second half, with a decrease of
20.5% following a first half reduction of
9.8% to give a full year decrease of
14.9% compared to last year.This was
driven by reduced levels of world trade
which resulted in a reduction in our
cargo volumes of 19.0% for the year.
Throughout this period, we have
managed to maintain high levels of
service quality whilst achieving
significant reductions in our cost base.
Around two thirds of our cost base is
labour, and we have continued with our
restructuring programme, incurring
£5.4m (2008: £8.0m) of exceptional
costs, which typically pay back through
reduced operating costs within twelve
months. In addition, in the second half
of the year we renewed theVirgin
ground handling and cargo contracts for
a further five years.
We also recognised a non-cash
exceptional impairment charge of
£38.4m in the first half, reflecting the
difficult trading conditions, to reduce
the carrying value of these operations
to around £20m.
Meteor
Our Meteor parking and security
operations reported revenue of
£42.9m, 36.1% or £24.2m below last
year (2008: £67.1m) and an operating
profit* of £0.7m (2008: £2.2m).The
reduction in revenue reflects the expiry
of our BAA parking contract at
Stansted in September 2008. Operating
profit* was down by £1.5m to £0.7m,
consisting of a profit of £0.8m in the
first half and a second half loss of
£0.1m.The second half included start
up costs of £0.5m incurred from
January to May relating to new parking
arrangements at a number of airport
hotels.
We have also recognised an
exceptional provision of £1.5m for
three parking contracts which we
consider to be onerous in the current
economic climate.
Outlook
Whilst there are some signs that activity
levels in ground handling and cargo
have stabilised, we will continue with
our restructuring plans to protect
against near term deterioration in
operating results and strengthen our
position for the medium term.
As previously reported, in Meteor
parking our BAA contract at Heathrow
expires in September 2009.We have
made a number of changes to our cost
base and expect the operating results
from Meteor next year to be similar to
those achieved to June 2009.
Meteor is one of the UK’s
largest independent parking
companies. It has an
established presence at many
UK airports and manages car
parks across our rail network.

Corporate responsibility
Our responsibilities
Through engagement with stakeholders
we have identified seven key areas
of responsibility:
1. Safety & Security
2. Improving our environmental
performance.
3. Reliability, convenience, punctuality
4. Accessibility for all
5. Affordability
6. Community relationships
7. Role as an employer
Our performance against all of these issues
can be found in our corporate responsibility
web report and accompanying summary
document. We are in the process of
standardising and enhancing our responsibility
targets across the Group and look forward
to reporting on these next year.
This section focuses on how we manage
our safety and environmental performance
and highlights key achievements this year.
Robust management
The safety and security of our passengers,
our people and the general public is an
absolute priority for the Group.The Board
also places a significant emphasis on
improving energy efficiency as this has
important environmental benefits and helps
to reduce operating costs.We do not have
separate Board level committees for
corporate responsibility and health & safety
as we believe it is fundamental for the
Board as a whole to be involved in these
areas, which are integral to our business.
We believe that effective management
can only be achieved through robust
measurement. Internal safety and energy
targets for each of our twelve operating
companies are set at the beginning of each
financial year. Performance against safety
Responsible
CarbonTrust Standard
We became the ﬁrst UK transport
operator to be awarded the CarbonTrust
Standard in recognition of our work to
reduce carbon emissions.
Improved efﬁciency
Across our bus operations we have
made signiﬁcant investments in engine
monitoring technology and training
schemes.This has resulted in fuel efﬁciency
improvements of around 5%.
Renewable sources
Around 75% of our site electricity is
generated from renewable sources
including hydro-power, wind-power and
biomass fuels.
Energy saving
The introduction of regenerative braking
on the third rail system has resulted in
around a 5% reduction in traction
electricity usage on the Southern network.
16% site energy reduction
We achieved a 16% reduction in site
energy* as a result of the commitment of
our employees and new energy efﬁcient
lighting systems.
Energy Forums
Five Group energy forums were held this
year where operating companies share
best and emerging practice on reducing
carbon emissions.
Gold Rating
For the third year in a row Go-Ahead
achieved a gold rating in Business in the
Community’s (BITC) Responsibility Index –
the highest rating amongst comparable
participating public transport operators.
2009 Highlights
Corporate responsibility has always
been at the heart of Go-Ahead.We were
the first in our sector to publish our
environmental data and this year we
will be publishing the Group’s corporate
responsibility data in a new upgraded web
report which gives stakeholders easier
access to more in-depth information.
Last year we were the first in our sector to
produce an Economic Impact Report which
measures the significant contribution we
make to the towns and cities we operate in.
Publishing our responsibility data
Operating our companies in a socially
and environmentally responsible
manner is a key part of the Group’s
strategy and is deeply embedded
across our organisation at all levels.
Benchmarking our performance
We continue to participate in the
Business in the Community (BITC)
Corporate Responsibility Index.These
voluntary indices help us to compare
performance against other leading UK
businesses, including many FTSE 100
companies. For the third year in a row
we were awarded a gold rating by
BITC, the highest rating amongst
comparable participating public
transport operators. In achieving this
level, Go-Ahead has demonstrated
that it improves responsibility
throughout its operations by providing
a systematic approach to managing,
measuring and reporting on business
impacts in society and on the
environment.
In December 2008 we became the first
public transport company to be officially
certified with the CarbonTrust Standard.
The CarbonTrust Standard is the UK's

Electricity consumption (kwh)
New lights installed
Reducing our site energy
In June 2009 we replaced traditional high bay lights at our
bus and rail depots and multi storey car parks with new
intelligent energy saving lights.The traditional lights accounted
for a signiﬁcant proportion of the carbon dioxide emissions
caused by our site energy use and were very expensive to
run.The new lights have sensors so that they turn on and off
according to movement and if it is a sunny day they can
adjust themselves to be less bright.This means that the
system only provides light when it is needed. Initial results
have been very encouraging and at some depots electricity
usage has reduced by around 50%.
Capital expenditure: £2.4 million
(average life of technology: up to 10 years)
Aim: to reduce Group site electricity
consumption by around 10%
Estimated annual savings:
• £1 million cost saving
• 4,300 C0
2
tonnes. Equivalent to annual
emissions from 780 households.

Corporate responsibility continued
Sharing best practice
The Board is ultimately responsible for
the Group’s corporate responsibility.
However, as we operate though a
devolved structure, each operating
company manages their own safety
and energy programmes and
performance is reported to the Board
through the Executive Directors.
Operating companies have safety and
energy committees which are each
led by a senior manager specifically
responsible for the company’s
performance (see the chart below for
our internal responsibility structure).
Companies often run internal
competitions and specific safety
and environmental days in order
to encourage staff participation and
to ensure these issues maintain
a high profile.
Although the Group is decentralised,
we recognise the importance of sharing
best practice.The Group regularly holds
health & safety and energy forums
where companies share best practice
and help develop Group wide
standards and policies. In addition,
each operating company works closely

Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance
Our devolved structure
Because of our devolved management
structure, local management throughout
the Group are empowered to operate
our companies as autonomous business
units, whilst working together to share
experience and expertise around the
Group.We believe that this structure, as
illustrated on page 45, enables the
Group to be managed in a particularly
effective way. For example, many
aspects of the Group’s day-to-day
operations report through operating
company senior management directly
into the Board through the Group
Chief Executive and the Group
Finance Director:
• The Executive Directors sit on the
board of each operating company
and meet formally with local senior
management each month.As each
operating company is a separate legal
entity, and because of the autonomous
nature of the business units, minutes
of each meeting are recorded.
• The Executive Directors hold regular
meetings with the Managing Directors
of all of the operating companies (the
‘Chief Executive Group’) to facilitate
the sharing of experience and best
practice across operations.
• The Executive Directors meet on a
monthly basis with the senior
managers who are responsible for the
key centralised Group functions (the
‘ExecutiveTeam Group’) which
include company secretarial, finance,
pensions, properties and services,
procurement and technology.
In addition, there are a number of Group
forums that are held on a regular basis
and which consider finance, engineering,
health and safety, and energy matters.
These key forums, which report directly
“It is our belief that
good governance will
facilitate efficient,
effective and
entrepreneurial
management that can
deliver shareholder
value.”
The Board is committed to
maintaining the highest standards of
corporate governance.The Combined
Code of Corporate Governance
states that good corporate governance
should contribute to better company
performance by helping a board
discharge its duties in the best interests
of the shareholders.This section of
the report describes how Go-Ahead
achieves this, including statements of
how the Company complies with the
Combined Code of Corporate
Governance.
The composition and effectiveness
of Go-Ahead’s Board is a key element
in achieving the Group’s long term
corporate performance.We believe
that our Board, which comprises five
members, enables us to operate
effectively, with the appropriate balance
of skills and experience.The relatively
small size of our Board is appropriate in
the context of our devolved
management structure and does not
compromise the needs of the business.
Importantly, the Board is able to
operate cost effectively for
its shareholders.
While the Board delegates some
of its responsibilities to the Audit,
Remuneration and Nomination
Committees, it still retains full Board
responsibility for a number of key
areas such as health and safety,
corporate social responsibility and risk
management.The Board feels that it is
fundamental that the Board as a whole
is involved in decision making in these
areas and this ‘hands-on’ approach has
served the business well over previous
years.
Governance The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 45
to the Executive Directors, enable
representatives from all operating
companies to share best and emerging
practice, to seek synergies and cost
savings, to improve quality and to achieve
economies of scale wherever possible.
Key changes this year
The Board of Go-Ahead reviews the
way the Group is managed each year
against best practice corporate
governance. Following such a review
during the year, we were pleased to
announce two important changes,
which we believe demonstrate our
commitment to good corporate
governance and further improves our
compliance with the Combined Code:
Senior Independent Director
The Board was pleased to announce the
appointment of Rupert Pennant-Rea
(who was appointed as a Non-Executive
Director of the Board in October 2002)
as Senior Independent Director in
October 2008.This represents a change
to the previous constitution, and historic
non-compliance with the Combined
Code, where no Senior Independent
Director was appointed.While the
Executive Directors aim to ensure
effective communication with
shareholders and investors, if contact
through these channels has failed to
resolve any concerns, or such contact
is not appropriate, shareholders and
investors can contact the Senior
Independent Director.
Chairman of the Audit Committee
In conjunction with the appointment
of Andrew Allner as a Non-Executive
Director in October 2008, the Board
were also pleased to announce
Andrew’s appointment to the position
of Chairman of the Audit Committee.
This represents a change to the
previous constitution, and historic non-
compliance with the Combined Code,
where the Chairman of the Company
was also the Chairman of the Audit
Committee.While the Board still
considers the attendance of the
Company Chairman at Audit
Committee meetings to be important
in order to ensure that all members of
the Board are equally aware of any
issues and the detail behind them, such
attendance is now by invitation only.
While there are still two provisions of
the Combined Code where we do not
comply, in relation to the constitution
of the Audit and Remuneration
Committees, the Board has again
considered these areas diligently during
the year and is of the view that there
are sound business reasons for
continued non-compliance at the
current time (see page 46).
We are pleased to be able to
demonstrate the Board’s commitment
to good practices of corporate
governance through constant re-
evaluation of the Board, its structure
and performance, augmented by the
more formal annual performance
evaluation process we have in place
(see page 49). It is our belief that
good governance will facilitate
efficient, effective and entrepreneurial
management that can deliver
shareholder value over the longer
term, and I believe the Go-Ahead
Board is successful in its endeavours
in this regard.

Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance continued
C.3.1 -The Audit Committee should be made
up of at least three independent Non-
Executive Directors
The Audit Committee currently comprises
the two Non-Executive Directors.At the
start of the financial year, the Committee
comprised the Non-Executive Chairman
and both Non-Executive Directors,
however, following the appointment of
Andrew Allner as Chairman of the Audit
Committee in October 2008, the
Chairman of the Company now only
attends meetings at the invitation
of the Committee.
The Board is of the opinion that the Audit
Committee’s composition enables the
Board to comply with the applicable main
principle of the Combined Code in that it
has formal and transparent arrangements
for considering how the financial reporting
and internal control principles are applied
and for maintaining an appropriate
relationship with the Company’s auditors
(see Audit Committee report on page 51).
Summary of compliance
We have explained above the two
provisions of the Combined Code with
which we do not comply.The Board, having
considered these areas diligently during the
year, is of the view that its composition, and
that of its Committees, are appropriate for
the application of good principles of
corporate governance within the business
and relevant for the size and complexity of
the Group.The Board encourages all
shareholders to put their views to the
Company and enter into dialogue if they
require any further information on the
Company’s position as outlined.This can be
done by contacting the Group Company
Secretary at the Company’s Registered
Office.
A copy of the Combined Code published
in June 2008 is available on the Financial
Reporting Council’s website (www.frc.org.
uk/corporate/combinedcode/cfm).
Compliance with the
Combined Code
The Board confirms that the Company
has been in full compliance throughout
the financial year with the main principles
of the Combined Code published in June
2008 (the ‘Combined Code’).The
Company has also complied with all of
the provisions set out in Section 1 of the
Combined Code, with the following
exceptions:
A.3.3 - One of the independent Non-
Executive Directors should be appointed as
the Senior Independent Director
Following the appointment of Rupert
Pennant-Rea as Senior Independent
Director in October 2008, Go-Ahead is
now fully compliant with this provision.
B.2.1 -The Remuneration Committee should
be made up of at least three independent
Non-Executive Directors and the Company
Chairman should not chair the Committee
The Board has reviewed the terms
of reference of the Remuneration
Committee during the year, including its
constitution and chairmanship, and
continues to believe that, due to the small
size of the Board, it is appropriate for the
Committee to comprise of the Non-
Executive Chairman and the two
Non-Executive Directors.The Board is also
of the view that the Chairman of the Board,
who was considered independent on
appointment, remains the most
appropriate person to chair the
Remuneration Committee.This
constitution has been in place throughout
the financial year, although Christopher
Collins resigned from the Committee in
October 2008 and was replaced by
Andrew Allner (independent Non-
Executive Director).
It is the Board’s view that the
Remuneration Committee’s composition
enables the Board to comply with the
applicable main principle of the Combined
Code in that it has a formal and
transparent procedure for developing
policy on executive remuneration and for
fixing the remuneration packages for
individual Directors (see the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 53 to 58).
In addition to this, no Director is involved
in deciding his own remuneration, also a
requirement of the Combined Code.
Board organisation
and structure
The Board and its role
The Board is made up of the Non-
Executive Chairman, two Non-Executive
Directors (one of whom is the Senior
Independent Director) and two Executive
Directors (the Group Chief Executive and
the Group Finance Director).The
Directors biographies can be found on
page 42.All the Directors were members
of the Board throughout the financial year,
with the exception of Andrew Allner who
was appointed with effect from 24
October 2008 to replace Christopher
Collins who retired following the Annual
General Meeting on 23 October 2008.
The Board holds a minimum of seven
scheduled meetings a year, with the Group
Company Secretary in attendance.
Additional meetings are held as and when
required.The Board has delegated specific
responsibilities to the Audit, Remuneration
and Nomination Committees, each of
which has terms of reference which detail
their authority and duties.The Board has a
formal schedule of matters reserved to it
for decision (see page 47).
The Board also maintains a Board
Procedures Manual, prepared in response
to the Combined Code.This includes
formal procedures for the working of the
Board and its Committees, delegated
authorities, the timely provision of
appropriate information and the duties and
responsibilities of Directors’, including
standards of conduct and compliance.
In addition to Board and Committee
meeting attendance, the Non-Executive
Directors are encouraged to update their
skills, knowledge and familiarity with the
Company in order to competently carry
out their responsibility to Go-Ahead’s
shareholders. During the year, the
Chairman of the Board visited each
operating company, in addition to attending
most meetings of the Chief Executive
Group.Andrew Allner’s induction to the
Board also included site visits to each
operating company and meetings with key
advisors (see page 49). Both the Chairman
and the Non-Executive Directors attend
the Group’s annual Senior Management
Conference each year, enabling them to
review and discuss the Group’s strategy
with senior managers from across the
Group.
Responsibility for the operation of Group
companies, implementing Group strategy in
accordance with the strategy agreed by the
Board and achievement of objectives is
delegated to the Group Chief Executive
and Group Finance Director.The Executive
Directors meet regularly with the senior
management and staff in the Group’s
operating companies, both formally via the
monthly board meetings, and less formally
on a regular basis. Schedule of matters reserved
for the Board
1 Approval of the Group’s strategy,
objectives, values and overall
governance framework.

before the next scheduled Board meeting.
The Chairman and Non-Executive
Directors periodically meet without the
Executive Directors being present.
The agenda for each Board meeting is set by
the Chairman, in consultation with the
Group Chief Executive. Detailed briefing
papers in relation to the business to be
conducted at each meeting are circulated to
the Board at least one week before each
meeting and individual Board members have

the Group Company Secretary should they
wish to receive additional information on any
of the items on the agenda.
In accordance with the changes to the
Company’s Articles of Association
approved at the 2008 Annual General
Meeting, the Board has established robust
procedures for ensuring that their powers
to authorise conflicts are operated
effectively and that the procedures are
followed.As such, all Board meetings
commence with an opportunity for all
Directors to declare any potential conflicts
of interest.
Board meetings are structured to allow
open discussion. Key senior managers and
advisors attend relevant parts of Board
meetings as required to ensure that the
Board is properly informed about the
current issues facing the business. Minutes
of all meetings are circulated promptly
afterwards.

Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance continued
Non-Executive Directors
The role of the Non-Executive Directors is
to challenge constructively, help develop
proposals on strategy, scrutinise the
performance of management in meeting
agreed goals and objectives and monitor the
reporting of performance.The Non-
Executive Directors must satisfy themselves
on the integrity of financial information and
that financial controls and systems of risk
management are robust and defensible. They
are responsible for ensuring appropriate
remuneration and succession planning
arrangements are in place in relation to the
Executive Directors.
Board balance and independence
The Board considers that an appropriate
balance between the Executive and Non-
Executive Directors is necessary to
promote shareholders interests and to
govern the business effectively. Excluding
the Chairman, half of the Board are Non-
Executive Directors, who bring objectivity
to the Boardroom as they are not involved
in the day to day running of the Company.
The Chairman of the Board is also a Non-
Executive role.The balance of Non-
Executive and Executive Directors is
shown in Figure 1.
The Chairman was considered
independent on his appointment and the
Board considers both of the Non-
Executive Directors,Andrew Allner and
Rupert Pennant-Rea, to be robustly
independent in character and judgement.
The Board believes that there is sufficient
weight of Non-Executives to be able to
effectively counterbalance the executive
element.The Board also regularly assesses
the other commitments of its Non-
Executive Directors and is satisfied that
there are no conflicts of duties and that the
Non-Executives have sufficient time to fulfil
their responsibilities to shareholders.
Division of responsibilities
The offices of the Chairman and Group
Chief Executive are held separately.The
Company Chairman is Sir Patrick Brown
and the Group Chief Executive is Keith
Ludeman.There is a clear division of
responsibility between the Chairman and
the Group Chief Executive, with the
division of key responsibilities, as agreed by
the Board, shown below:
Chairman:
• leadership of the Board, ensuring its
effectiveness in all aspects of its role and
setting its agenda, taking into account the
issues relevant to the Group and the
concerns of all Board members;
• ensuring a regular evaluation of the
performance of the Board and its
Committees;
• facilitating the effective contribution of
Non-Executive Directors; and
• encouraging active engagement by all
members of the Board and constructive
relations between the Executive and
Non-Executive Directors;
Chief Executive:
• running the day to day business of the
Group, within the authorities delegated
by the Board;
• leading the development of the Group’s
strategy, including identifying and
assessing opportunities;
• ensuring the execution of policies and
strategy as set by the Board as a whole;
• ensuring effective communication with
shareholders and investors;
• day to day leadership of the executive
and senior management team; and
• ensuring that the Chairman is kept
updated in a timely manner of issues,
events and developments.
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director, Rupert
Pennant-Rea, is an important point of
contact for shareholders in the event that
they have concerns which have not been
resolved through the normal channels of
Group Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director or Chairman or for which such
contact is inappropriate.The Senior
Independent Director also leads a meeting
of the Non-Executive Directors at least
once a year, without the Chairman present,
where the Chairman’s performance is
evaluated.
It is important that the Board ensures
planned and progressive refreshing of the
Board and the balance of experience of
the Non-Executive Directors, in terms of
their length of tenure, is shown in Figure 2.
Company Secretary
The Group Company Secretary is Carolyn
Sephton, who was appointed in July 2006.
Her biography can be found on page 42.
She is Secretary to the Board and all of its
Committees.The Group Company
Secretary reports to the Company
Chairman in her role as Secretary to the
Board and its Committees. For all other
company secretariat matters, including the
management of the Group’s non-rail
pension arrangements, the Group
Company Secretary reports to the Group
Finance Director.
The Group Company Secretary is
responsible to the Board for ensuring that
Board procedures are complied with,
including ensuring effective communication
flows within the Board and its Committees,
as well as the provision of accurate, timely
and clear information to the Board ahead
of Board meetings. She is also responsible
for ensuring that the Board is regularly
updated on matters of corporate
governance, legislative changes and
regulatory regimes affecting the Group.The
appointment and removal of the Company
Secretary is a matter for the Board as a
whole.
All Directors have access to the advice and
services of the Group Company Secretary
and may also take independent
professional advice, at the Group’s
expense, if they believe it necessary for the
proper discharge of their duties as
Directors.

Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Re-election of Directors
At the 2009 Annual General Meeting, in
addition to Andrew Allner standing for
election by the shareholders for the first
time following his appointment to the
Board, Sir Patrick Brown and Rupert
Pennant-Rea will be standing for re-
election.
Sir Patrick Brown joined the Board in 1999
as a Non-Executive Director, becoming
Non-Executive Chairman in 2002. He has
now served on the Board for more than
nine years and therefore, in accordance
with the Combined Code, submits himself
for annual re-election.The Board recognise
his industry-wide experience and long-
standing contribution to the Board.
Furthermore, Sir Patrick’s performance
evaluation reaffirms his continued
effectiveness in his leadership of the Board,
Remuneration and Nomination
Committees and the Board unanimously
believe that he should be re-elected for a
further year.
Rupert Pennant-Rea became a Non-
Executive Director of the Board in 2002 and
was appointed Senior Independent Director
in 2008. He was last re-elected by the
shareholders at the 2006 Annual General
Meeting, and therefore, in accordance with
the Combined Code, submits himself for re-
election. Following the Board’s formal
performance evaluation, as well as
assessment against independence criteria
and potential conflicts of interest, the
Chairman can confirm that Rupert’s
performance continues to be effective and
he demonstrates commitment to the role.
He is well known to investors and financial
professionals and available to shareholders in
his role as Senior Independent Director as
required.The Board, therefore, recommends
unanimously his re-election for a
further term.
Performance evaluation
The Board has adopted a procedure for
the evaluation of the performance of the
Board, its Committees, individual Directors
and the Group Company Secretary, as
shown in Figure 3.
This evaluation, which is led by the
Chairman, is carried out by an external
consultant on an annual basis.The Non-
Executive Directors, led by the Senior
Independent Director, were responsible for
the performance evaluation of the
Chairman, taking into account the views of
the Executive Directors. No significant
issues were raised during this year’s
evaluation.
Relations with shareholders
The Group recognises the importance of
regular communication with all of its
shareholders.The reporting calendar is
dominated by the publication of the annual
and half year results each year and the
interim management and trading
statements where the Board provides
shareholders with a clear and balanced
understanding of the Group’s operational
performance, its financial results and
prospects.
The Executive Directors meet with the
Group’s major shareholders (both
institutional investors and private
shareholders with significant holdings) after
the announcement of annual and half year
results and at other times as appropriate,
including site visits and management
presentations such as that which recently
took place with regard to the retention of
the Southern franchise. In addition to the
meetings with Executive Directors,
institutional shareholders are offered the
opportunity of meetings with the Non-
Executive Directors.Where appropriate,
for example in the event that the Board
proposes to make significant changes to
Directors’ remuneration arrangements,
there will also be consultation with major
shareholders.The institutional shareholders
have further opportunities to make their
views known through follow up interviews
by the Company’s brokers which are then
documented and circulated to the Board.
The Executive Directors also provide
feedback to the Board following
presentations to investors.
The principal communication with private
shareholders is through the Annual Report
and the Annual General Meeting, which is
attended by all Directors.All shareholders
are invited to the Annual General Meeting
Board effectiveness
Appointments to the Board
During the 2007/08 financial year, on the
announcement of Christopher Collins’
intention to retire following the 2008
Annual General Meeting, the Nomination
Committee commenced a selection
process for the appointment of a
replacement Non-Executive Director.An
external search agency was appointed to
assist in the identification of suitable
candidates.After interviewing a number of
potential candidates the Committee
unanimously proposed, and the Board
unanimously accepted, the appointment of
Andrew Allner with effect from 24
October 2008.
Andrew is a Chartered Accountant with
significant Executive and Non-Executive
experience. Following his appointment to
the Board, he was also appointed as
Chairman of the Audit Committee, due to
his extensive recent financial experience.
He is also a member of the Nomination
and Remuneration Committees.
A full, formal and tailored induction was
arranged for Andrew prior to him joining
the Board.This included a full briefing of his
responsibilities and obligations under law,
regulation and corporate governance
guidelines.Andrew visited each operating
company, where he met with local senior
management, as well as meeting with the
Group Chief Executive and key Group
personnel. Specialist support was provided
from the Group Finance Director and the
internal and external auditors on particular
areas in relation to the Audit Committee.
As is the case for all Go-Ahead’s Non-
Executive Directors,Andrew has not been
appointed for a specified term. However, in
accordance with the Combined Code, he
will stand for election by the shareholders at
the 2009 Annual General Meeting and for
re-election at intervals of no more than
three years thereafter. Since joining the
Board,Andrew has demonstrated his
commitment, making a well qualified and
effective contribution.As such, the Board
recommends unanimously to shareholders
that they elect Andrew Allner as a Non-
Executive Director at the 2009 Annual
General Meeting.

Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance continued
the work of the Audit Committee which
has delegated responsibility from the Board
for reviewing the effectiveness of the
Company’s risk management and internal
control systems.
During the year, the Group continued to
strengthen its ongoing processes for risk
management across the Group, with a
number of improvements to the overall
risk management strategy, infrastructure
and process to ensure that the Group’s risk
management framework is embedded
throughout the business and is part of
performance reporting.
In particular, and as part of the annual
Turnbull review, there has been a move
away from a prescriptive mechanism based
around each operating company evaluating
risks against criteria provided in detailed
questionnaires, to one that focuses on the
evaluation of key risks to each operating
company’s own objectives and the
efficiency of controls in place. Reported
risks are then further assessed for
materiality in the context of the whole
Group and considered by the Audit
Committee and Board, in addition to being
used to develop part of the internal audit
plan for the year ahead.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing
the Group are discussed on pages 19 and
20.
The key features of the internal control
systems, which have been established to
safeguard both the shareholders’
investment and the assets of the Group,
are described as follows:
Strategy
The Board has developed an
understanding of its risk appetite which
enables strong leadership, strategic
objective setting, decision-making and
control. Business planning encompasses a
structured risk assessment with major
acquisitions, investments, projects and
partnerships all entered into with a
recognition of an appropriate risk-reward
balance.
Group structure
With clear leadership from the Board and
Audit Committee, the Executive Directors
are actively involved in establishing and
communicating the risk strategy and policy
of the Group.The Group’s decentralised
organisation structure, with defined limits
of responsibility and authority, enables the
Executive Directors to play an active role
in helping the businesses to assess risk and
encourages open communication on risk
which provides an opportunity for
shareholders to develop their understanding
of the Company and ask questions on the
matters put to the meeting (as detailed in
the Notice of Meeting sent to registered
shareholders in advance of the meeting).
There is also the opportunity to meet
informally with the Directors before and
after the meeting.The Board encourages all
shareholders to attend the Annual General
Meeting.
Ordinary business which is raised for
consideration at the Annual General
Meeting each year is:
• to receive the financial statements for the
year, together with the Directors’ and
Auditors’ Reports;
• to approve the final dividend;
• to elect and re-elect members of the
Board;
• to approve the Directors’ Remuneration
Report;
• to re-appoint the Company’s Auditor; and
• to give the Directors the authority to
determine the Auditors’ remuneration.
Other matters included on the agenda for
the Annual General Meeting vary from
year to year in accordance with the
requirements of the Company.
The Company maintains a comprehensive
website that provides, among other things,
access to the annual and half year reports,
copies of the presentations used at road
shows and regulatory news items, as well
as share price and general shareholder
information.
The Group’s Company Secretariat, based at
the Company’s Registered Office in
Newcastle, responds to a wide range of
enquiries from shareholders that are
received via a variety of media, including the
email communication system available on the
Company’s website.
Internal control and risk management
The Group has established an ongoing
process of identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks facing the
Group.This has been in place during the
financial year ended 27 June 2009 and up
to the date of the approval of this report.
The Board as a whole takes responsibility
for the disclosures on the effectiveness of
the Group’s internal control processes and
confirms that it has established the
procedures necessary to comply with the
Turnbull Report.The Board is supported by
matters. Risk management is an integral
part of day-to-day operations where there
exists clear ownership of risk identification
and mitigation at local level. Because of the
organisational structure, risk management
information can also be shared across the
Group as well as reported upwards.
Reporting
In accordance with the Group’s Policy &
Procedures Manual, defined and
comprehensive reporting obligations
placed on operating companies are
supported by monthly operating company
board meetings with the Executive
Directors. Key management processes,
including planning, project appraisal and
performance management, ensure that the
impact of key risks are addressed. Controls
and mitigations are regularly monitored.
Risk management process
The risk management process is clearly
defined and includes top-down risk
assessment at Group level and bottom-up
risk assessments at operating company
level.A bespoke risk categorisation model
exists which is used across the Group to
ensure that risks are identified and
reported on a consistent basis and a
process is in place to aggregate key risks
on a Group-wide basis. Ongoing risk
identification, mitigation and reduction
plans will be reported at each main Board
meeting, in addition to quarterly reporting
to the Audit Committee.
Group internal audit
The internal audit function has been
outsourced to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The internal audit function provides
assurance over the effectiveness of key
controls as identified as part of the risk
assessment process.
In addition to meetings with local
management, the internal auditors report
on a monthly basis to the Executive
Directors, and also to the Audit
Committee on a regular basis.
The Directors acknowledge their
responsibility for establishing and maintaining
the Group’s system of internal control and
for ensuring its effectiveness.As with any
system of internal controls, the policies and
processes in place throughout the Group are
designed to manage rather than eliminate the
risk of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic
objectives, and can only provide reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss.

(DTR 7.2.6)
Disclosures required under DTR 7.2.6
can be found on pages 59 and 60.
Committees of the
Board
The Board has established a number of
Committees to deal with specific
aspects of the Group’s affairs.The
responsibilities of each Committee are
determined by its terms of reference
which are available on the Company’s
website or upon request from the
Group Company Secretary.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Audit
Committee are outlined in summary
below:
• reviewing the effectiveness of the
Group’s financial reporting, internal
control policies and procedures for
the identification, assessment and
reporting of risk;
• monitoring the role and effectiveness
of the internal auditors, including
approving their appointment;
• considering and making
recommendations to the Board on
the appointment of the external
auditors;
• reviewing the relationship with the
external auditors, including their
terms of engagement, fees,
independence, expertise, resources
and qualifications;
• monitoring the integrity of the
Group’s financial statements; and
• reviewing significant financial reporting
issues and judgements.
The Company’s whistleblowing
procedures, which are reviewed on an
annual basis, allow employees to raise
concerns confidentially and for the
independent investigation of such matters.
The Committee is responsible for
overseeing any necessary follow up action.
Under the Combined Code at least
one member of the Committee should
have recent and relevant financial
experience.As a chartered accountant,
and previously the Group Finance
Director of another listed company
between 2004 and 2007,Andrew
Allner fully satisfies this requirement.
Activities
During the year, the Committee
provided a forum for reporting by the
Group’s external and internal auditors,
including health and safety auditors.The
Committee also received and reviewed
reports from management relating to
the annual and half year profit figures
and statements, monitored the controls
in force and reviewed the key
judgemental areas at the half year and
year end to ensure the integrity of the
financial information reported to
shareholders.Additionally, the
Committee considered the risk
management processes and controls, as
outlined on page 50.
The Committee advises the Board on
the appointment of the external
auditors and, during the year,
considered their remuneration both for
audit and non-audit work. In order to
ensure auditor objectivity and
independence, the provision of certain
non-audit services (including accounting
and tax services if the fees exceed a
level set by the Audit Committee) are
subject to approval by the Audit
Committee.The Audit Committee has
specified that the external audit firm
may not provide certain categories
of non-audit services to the Group
as detailed in the Committee’s terms
of reference.
The Audit Committee keeps under
review the cost effectiveness and the
independence and objectivity of the
external and internal auditors. During
the financial year, the audit fees of the
external auditor were £0.7m and their
fees for non-audit work were £0.4m. In
comparison, non-audit fees paid to
other audit firms during the financial
year were £2.6m.
During the year, the Committee carried
out a tender for the provision of
internal audit services to the Group.
Following a review of a number of
potential providers, which included
interviews and presentations, the
Committee proposed and the Board
agreed with the recommendation to
appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers as
the Group’s new provider for internal
audit services.This appointment was
effective from 28 June 2009.The
Committee will monitor and review
their delivery and effectiveness on an
ongoing basis.
During the year the Committee met
four times and, as part of the annual
Board evaluation, also undertook a
specific evaluation of its effectiveness.
At least once a year, the Non-Executive
Directors meet with the external
auditors, without the Executive
Directors being present. 52 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Responsibilities
The majority of members of the
Nomination Committee are Non-
Executive Directors.The responsibilities
of the Committee are outlined in
summary below:
• reviewing regularly the structure, size
and composition of the Board and
making recommendations to the
Board regarding any desired changes;
• evaluating the balance of skills,
knowledge and experience on
the Board;
• identifying and nominating for the
Board’s approval suitable candidates
to fill vacancies for Board
appointments;
• planning for the orderly succession of
new Directors to the Board; and
• recommending to the Board the
membership and chairmanship of the
Audit and Remuneration
Committees.
Activities
The Nomination Committee meets as
needed to deal with necessary
assignments and is responsible for
leading the process of identifying
candidates for Board appointment and
making recommendations to the Board
in accordance with the needs of the
Company and best practice in corporate
governance from time to time.
As reported in the 2008 Annual
Report, the Committee, in consultation
with an external search consultancy,
met to discuss the appointment of a
Non-Executive Director following
Christopher Collin’s stated intention to
retire from the Board at the conclusion
of the 2008 Annual General Meeting.
After interviewing a number of
potential candidates against objective
criteria, the Nomination Committee
proposed, and the Board unanimously
accepted, that Andrew Allner be
appointed as Non-Executive Director
and Chairman of the Audit Committee
with effect from 24 October 2008.
During the year the Committee met
twice (not including interviews with
potential candidates) and, as part of the
annual Board evaluation, also undertook
a specific evaluation of its effectiveness.
Full details on the activities and the
responsibilities of the Remuneration
Committee can be found in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report on
pages 53 to 58.The following is a high-

Responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee has
responsibility for determining the
remuneration, contract terms and other
benefits of the Executive Directors,
including performance-related bonus
and share schemes.
Activities
During the year the Committee met
four times to consider bonus payments
and salary reviews for the Executive

The Board also continues to believe
that, in the circumstances of this Group,
the Chairman of the Board is the
proper person to be Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee.The
Chairman is not present when his own
remuneration is discussed and decided,
as is the case for all Directors.
Prior to his resignation on 23 October
2008, Christopher Collins was a
member of the Committee.Andrew
Allner became a member of the
Committee following his appointment
to the Board on 24 October 2008.
Support to the Committee
The Committee has appointed Watson
Wyatt Limited, independent
remuneration specialists, to advise on all
aspects of Board remuneration. In
addition to advising the Committee,
Watson Wyatt Limited are also
consulting actuaries toThe Go-Ahead
Group Pension Plan and advise the
Company on various pensions related
issues.
The Committee receives
recommendations from the Group
Chief Executive on Executive Directors’
remuneration, other than his own.
Role of the Committee
The key responsibilities and activities of
the Committee during the year
included:
• determining the overall remuneration
policy (including the balance between
fixed and performance-related
elements of pay);
• determining the remuneration and

Acceptance by the Board of
Remuneration Committee proposals
During the relevant period, the
Committee’s recommendations were all
accepted unanimously by the Board and
implemented without amendment.
This report has been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts
and Reports) Regulations 2008 and has
been approved by the Remuneration
Committee and the Board. Ernst &
Y oung LLP have audited certain parts of
this report.Where disclosures have
been subject to audit, they are indicated
as such.The auditors’ opinion is included
in their report on page 101.
The Board supports the principles of
good corporate governance relating to
Directors’ remuneration and, in
preparing this remuneration report, the
Remuneration Committee has followed
the provisions of the Combined Code.
An ordinary resolution to receive and
approve this Directors’ Remuneration
Report will be proposed at the
Company’s Annual General Meeting to
be held on 29 October 2009.
Remuneration
Committee
Meetings
Details of the members, the number of
meetings and attendees in the year are
shown on page 47.
A review of the terms of reference and
operation of the Remuneration
Committee, including its constitution
and chairmanship, was undertaken
during the year.The terms of reference
are available from the Company’s
website or upon request from the
Group Company Secretary.
It is the Board’s view that the
Remuneration Committee’s composition
enables the Board to comply with the
main principles of the Combined Code
in respect of remuneration.Although the
Committee is not made up of at least
three independent Non-Executive
Directors as required by the Combined
Code, the Board continues to believe
that, due to the small size of the Board, it
is appropriate for the Committee to
comprise the Non-Executive Chairman
and the two Non-Executive Directors.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Executive Directors’
remuneration policy
The overall policy adopted by the
Remuneration Committee is to ensure
that the Group is paying sufficient to
attract, retain and motivate high quality
Executive Directors capable of
achieving the Group’s objectives.The
Committee considers Executive
Directors’ cash bonuses, which are
dependent on the achievement of
safety, corporate governance and
financial targets in the relevant financial
year.The Committee is informed of the
pay, incentives and benefits packages of
senior managers in the Group and its
operating companies.
In considering the Executive Directors’
remuneration, the Committee follows
the provisions of the Combined Code.
The pay practices of its major
commercial competitors are also taken
into account, in addition to other
factors specific to the Group and to
each Director and his role and to the
wider pay market in the FTSE 250.
The Committee recognises that, for this
Group’s business, shareholder value is
dependent on factors not all necessarily
appearing within the published financial
statements, although their effect on
later financial statements can be
significant. Leading these corporate
governance issues are safety, control of
risk and other executive actions of a
strategic nature that may take several
accounting periods to show changes in
shareholder value. Executives in the
Group are encouraged to take
corporate governance and strategy
extremely seriously and always to
consider the long term implications of
their decision making.The
Remuneration Committee has regard
to these factors, as well as the annual
reported financial statements, in arriving
at the Directors’ overall remuneration
and in considering the mix between
fixed and variable pay.
There are currently three main
elements to the Executive Directors’
remuneration package: basic salary,
annual cash bonus and the LongTerm
Incentive Plan (LTIP).A substantial
proportion of the Executive Directors’
pay is performance related.The chart
on page 54 shows the balance between
fixed and performance related pay at
maximum performance levels.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
individual leaves the Company during
the deferral period for any reason other
than redundancy, retirement or ill-
health.The Committee considers it
important for a proportion of the
discretionary bonus to be taken in the
form of shares as this aligns the
Executives’ longer term interests with
those of the Group’s shareholders.
LongTerm Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Following its approval by shareholders
in October 2005, the LTIP replaced the
Group’s deferred share bonus plan.
Since then it has been the Group’s sole
long term share incentive plan for
senior executives.
Under the LTIP , participants are granted
awards whereby they are entitled to
acquire a specified number of ordinary
shares in the Company if, and to the
extent that, performance conditions are
met over a three year period.The rules
of the LTIP include, amongst other
provisions, limits on the number of
shares over which a participant can be
granted awards in any financial year (the
'individual limit').This limit (which is
determined by reference to the average
closing mid-market price of the shares
which are the subject of the awards on
each dealing day falling in the four week
period ending with the dealing day
immediately preceding their date of
grant) is 150% of the participant’s basic
salary.While the rules of the LTIP allow
this limit to be increased up to 200% of
salary in exceptional circumstances,
such as the recruitment of a senior
executive, no awards have been made
in excess of 150%.
The first awards were made in March
2006. Since then awards have been
made on an annual basis to the Group
Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director only, and on one occasion a
senior director who has now left the
Group.
Current performance conditions
When the LTIP was originally
introduced, it was a minimum
requirement that the Group should
achieve an increase in adjusted earnings
per share (EPS) over a three year
period of not less than the increase in
retail prices index (RPI) plus 3% per
year (the ‘minimum EPS hurdle’). If the
hurdle was not met, no part of the
awards would vest (and, accordingly,
participants would not acquire any
shares). If the hurdle was met, the
of 63.6% of basic salary to the Group
Chief Executive and the Group Finance
Director.A maximum bonus of 20%
was awarded for the achievement of
safety and corporate governance
targets.A further maximum of 10% was
earned after achieving 95% of budgeted
profits. Out of a potential maximum of
70% of bonus payable on the
achievement of 115% of budget, 33.6%
of bonus was earned after achieving
104.6% of budget.The bonus is non-
pensionable and is paid in cash.
27 June 2009 28 June 2008
Cash Bonus £’000 £’000
Keith Ludeman 318 338
Nick Swift 175 186
While the fundamental structure of the
cash bonus targets remains unchanged
for the new financial year, the
Committee has resolved that an
additional 15% of basic salary will be
achievable in relation to specific
strategic targets.The Executive
Directors will therefore be eligible to
earn an annual discretionary cash bonus
of up to 115% of basic annual salary for
the year ending 3 July 2010. In
subsequent years, the maximum cash
bonus potential will revert to 100%
Additional discretionary bonus
Following the year ended 27 June 2009,
and in recognition of the significant
achievement in retaining the Southern
franchise, the Remuneration
Committee exercised their discretion
and resolved to award a discretionary
bonus to the Group Chief Executive
and the Group Finance Director.The
Committee felt that it was necessary to
recognise the importance of the
retention of the franchise to the Group
outside of the normal annual bonus
structure, with a share element which
will provide long term alignment with
shareholders as the financial benefits of
the retention of the franchise flow
through to the financial results.
Out of a total discretionary award of
£100,000 each payable to the Group
Chief Executive and the Group Finance
Director, 50% (£50,000 each) will be
payable in November 2009 as an
additional cash bonus.The remaining
50% (£50,000 each) will be awarded
after the 2009 Annual General Meeting
as deferred shares, subject to a holding
provision of three years.The deferred
share awards will lapse if the relevant
Maximum performance assumes
achievement of maximum cash bonus
and full vesting of shares under the LTIP
rules.
Basic salary
Each of the Executive Directors is paid
an annual basic salary which is reviewed
in April each year. Salaries may be
increased beyond inflation if justified by
reference to the performance of the
individual and if there is clear evidence
that the existing salaries are not
competitive. In view of the current
wider economic conditions, the
Committee decided that no increases in
basic salary should be awarded to the
Executive Directors and senior
management at the last annual review
in April 2009.

Basic Salary £’000 pa £’000 pa
Keith Ludeman 500 500
Nick Swift 275 275
Annual cash bonus
Each of the Executive Directors is also
eligible to earn an annual discretionary
cash bonus of up to 100% of basic
annual salary.The bonus is paid in
November each year, on the basis of
achievement of challenging financial and
non-financial targets in the financial year
ended in the previous June/July.The
targets are notified to the Executive
Directors before the start of the year in
question and are on a basis designed to
introduce stretch into the performance
assessment.

Remuneration Committee proposed,

Committee considers that these
performance conditions are relevant,
challenging and designed to enhance
shareholder value and that awards will
vest in full only if exceptional
performance has been achieved.
Share bonus plan
Until 2005, the Executive Directors’
share bonus plan was used to make
share based awards to Executive
Directors and one senior director in
the Group.This has now been replaced
by the LTIP .
The final grant of shares under the
share bonus plan was made in relation
to the year ended 2 July 2005.The final
outstanding award from this grant
vested on 1 December 2008 when title
for 9,569 shares transferred to the
Group Chief Executive.
There are no further shares held under
the rules of this plan.
Savings related share option scheme
and share incentive plan
The Group operates a savings related
share option scheme and a share
incentive plan.The Executive Directors
are eligible to participate in either of
these arrangements, under terms
identical to any other participating
Group employee, if they so choose, and
any such participation would not be
separately regulated by the
Remuneration Committee.
There are no other share option or
long term incentive schemes available
to the Executive Directors.
Other benefits
The Group does not allocate company
cars to any employees, including the
Executive Directors. Instead, employees
who would have been allocated a
company car as part of their benefits, or
to accomplish their work, are given a
car replacement allowance. Such
allowances are non-pensionable.
Pension funds
The Executive Directors are entitled to
become members ofThe Go-Ahead
Group Pension Plan, a registered
pension plan.
Following his accession to Group Chief
Executive in July 2006, Keith Ludeman
opted out ofThe Go-Ahead Group
Pension Plan with effect from 1
December 2006, but retains a salary
TSR performance with the companies
comprised within the two comparator
groups i.e. theTransport Sector
Comparator Group and the
constituents of the FTSE 250 Index
(excluding investment trusts),
specifically:
• one half of the award requires a
comparison of the Group’sTSR with
theTSR of other companies in the
Transport sector; this is a highly
relevant but small peer group
comprising five companies only,
including the Group; and
• the other half of the award requires a
comparison of the Group’sTSR with
theTSR of the companies (excluding
investment trusts) that make up the
FTSE 250 index.
If the Group’sTSR is equal to theTSR
of a company that would fall mid-way
between theTSR of the lowest and
highest comparator companies in the
Transport sector, 25% of that portion of
theTSR-related Award will vest.The
extent to which that portion of the
TSR-related Award vests will increase,
on a straight-line basis, to 100% the
closer that the Group’sTSR is to the
TSR of a company that would fall three-
quarters of the way between theTSR
of the lowest and the highest
comparator companies in theTransport
sector.
Similarly, if the Group’sTSR is equal to
theTSR of the median comparator
company in the FTSE 250 index, 25% of
that portion of theTSR-related Award
will vest.The extent to which that
portion of theTSR-related Award vests
will increase, on a straight-line basis, to
100% the closer that the Group’sTSR is
to theTSR of the company that is
ranked at the lower end of the upper
quartile.
The calculation of these performance
conditions, with the exception of the
EPS hurdle which no longer applies to
any part of the award, is unchanged
from the calculation of the current
performance conditions.
It is the Committee’s view that the
changes to the LTIP will ensure that
senior executives continue to be
rewarded if they achieve substantial
improvements in the Group’s
underlying financial performance and
perform well relative to other
companies in the FTSE 250.The
number of shares that participants
could acquire depended upon a
comparison of the Group’s total
shareholder return (TSR) with theTSR
of companies within two comparator
groups.These awards were granted in
relation to financial years up to and
including the 2007/08 financial year.
Following consultation last year, the
awards granted in relation to the
2008/09 financial year were changed
and the performance conditions were
split, such that, only half of the award
would still be linked to comparativeTSR
against the two existing comparator
groups with the same conditions as
previously and, the other half would be
linked to real growth in EPS.
Remuneration Committee review
A further review was undertaken by
the Committee this year looking at the
appropriateness of the targets for
future awards in the current economic
situation. In undertaking their review,
the Committee sought advice from
Watson Wyatt Limited.
The Committee remains of the opinion
that the decision last year to increase
the emphasis on EPS was appropriate
at that time and was valid in principle.
However, the Committee has, in
considering the performance conditions
that should apply to the grant of awards
for the 2009/10 financial year, reached
the view that it is inappropriate to use
an EPS target, given the current
economic uncertainty, and that the
most appropriate way to set a suitably
stretching but motivating target is to
align with returns to shareholders,
namelyTSR.
Performance conditions for 2009/10
The Committee intends to continue to
use the LTIP as the sole form of long-
term share incentive for the Executive
Directors.
However, the Committee proposes to
alter the performance conditions that
will apply to the grant of awards under
the LTIP for the 2009/10 financial year
and subsequent years in order to
increase the motivational effect on
participants and to maintain the
alignment between participants and
shareholders.
It is proposed that the extent to which
awards will vest will be based solely on
a comparison of the Group’s three-year

Directors’ contracts
It is the Group’s policy to restrict the
notice periods for Executive Directors
to a maximum of twelve months. Both
Executive Directors have rolling service
contracts.There are no provisions for
special pension benefits, such as
beneficial early retirement terms. Other
than the notice periods specified below,
the Executive Directors are not due
any contractual compensation
payments in the event of loss of office.
Each Non-Executive Director has a
letter of appointment.There is no fixed
term of appointment, however, all
Directors are subject to rotation and
re-election in accordance with the
Company’s Articles of Association and
the Combined Code.Apart from salary
and benefits in relation to the notice
period for the relevant appointment,
the Non-Executive Directors’ terms of
appointment contain no entitlement to

Shareholding guidelines
As part of the review of remuneration
policy in 2008, shareholder guidelines
were introduced for the Executive
Directors.These provide for the
Executive Directors to build up a
personal shareholding equal to one
year’s basic salary over a period of five
years.At the end of the financial year,
the Group Chief Executive and the
Group Finance Director respectively
held 26,012 and 9,088 shares. Based on
the closing share price on 27 June 2009,
this equates to 64% and 41% of their
respective basic salaries held in shares
of the Company.
Non-Executive

The remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors is a matter for the
Chairman and the Executive members
of the Board, giving due regard to the
required time commitment and
responsibilities.The Remuneration
Committee considers the remuneration
of the Chairman in his absence.
The fees paid to the Chairman and
Non-Executive Directors are reviewed
by the Board annually in April with
consideration given to surveys of fees
paid to Non-Executive Directors of
comparable companies. Following the

Charitable donations, sponsorship and

amounted to £257,000 (2008: £302,000).
Political donations and expenditure
It is the Group’s policy not to make

such payments were made in the year
(2008: Nil).Additionally, the Company

transactions with suppliers. Payment is
then made on these terms, subject to
the terms and conditions being met by
the suppliers, including the timely
submission of satisfactory invoices. For
the year ended 27 June 2009, the trade

option scheme (Sharesave) has one
scheme currently in operation, whereby
eligible employees were invited to enter
into a three year savings contract which
will mature in June 2010.
The Group also operates a Share
Incentive Plan (SIP).This is an ongoing
scheme whereby eligible employees can
purchase Go-Ahead shares on the
open market each month. Deductions
from salary for the purchase of these
shares are made before tax and
national insurance is calculated and
employees retain the full tax and
national insurance benefit for all shares
that remain in the SIP for five years or
more from their purchase.
The Group is committed to developing
a culture of openness across all its
businesses and ensuring the highest
standards of probity and accountability.
We engage with our employees, who
are encouraged to discuss matters of
interest to them and subjects affecting
day-to-day operations with operating
company management.The Board also
actively encourages employees with
serious concerns regarding the interests
of others or the Group to come
forward.The Group and its operating
companies have policies in place to
ensure processes exist whereby
employees can raise serious concerns
constructively without fear or
victimisation, subsequent discrimination
or disadvantage.

an employer, including operating in a
socially and environmentally responsible
manner, can be found on pages 38 to
41 and also in the Group’s Corporate
Responsibility Report which is
published separately and can be found

Employees
The Group’s responsibility is to provide
a positive work environment conducive
to the recruitment and retention of
staff and one which meets its business
objectives by motivating and
encouraging its employees to be
responsive to the needs of its
customers, maintaining, and wherever
possible, improving operational
performance.
The Group is committed to providing

and treats employees fairly regardless of
gender, ethnic origin, age, religion, belief,
race and, where practicable, physical
disability.Appropriate training, career
development and promotion
opportunities are provided for all

continuing employment under normal
terms and conditions, wherever
possible, for existing employees who

promotion as appropriate to all
disabled employees.

with recognised trade unions and have
established a network of local
employee representatives who are
consulted on key business decisions.
Three of our companies have
Stakeholder Boards, which bring
together employees, individual passengers
and representative bodies to share
views.We produce a range of internal
newsletters, information circulars and
intranet sites that keep employees
abreast of developments at their
specific employing company and across
the Group as a whole.We have awards
to recognise and reward outstanding
contributions by our employees.

safeguarding the assets of the Company
and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.

We confirm that to the best of our

Directors’ statement as to disclosure
of information to auditors
The Directors who were members of

Directors’ report are listed on page

Directors and of the Company’s
auditors, each of these Directors

the balance sheet remains strong, with
funding secured to December 2012.
The Directors believe that the Group is
well placed to manage its business risks

accordance with IAS 8 ‘Accounting
Policies, Change in Accounting
Estimates and Errors’ and then apply
them consistently;
• present information, including
accounting policies, in a manner that

Go-Ahead Group plc for the year ended 27 June 2009, which 
comprise the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated 
balance sheet, the Consolidated cashflow statement, the 
Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense  
and the related notes 1 to 29. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union.  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Sections 495, 496 and 497 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As explained more fully in the Director’s Responsibilities 
Statement, set out on page 62, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.  
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as  
at 27 June 2009 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on the other matter prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the Group financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 61 and 62, in relation 
to going concern; and  
• the part of the Corporate Governance statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 
2008 Combined Code specified for our review. 
 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of The Go-Ahead Group plc for the year ended 27 
June 2009 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended 27 June 2009 
68 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement  
of compliance with IFRSs 
The consolidated financial statements of The Go-Ahead Group 
plc (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 27 June 2009 were 
authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 2 September 
2009 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by 
Sir Patrick Brown and Nick Swift. The Go-Ahead Group plc  
is a public limited company that is incorporated, domiciled and 
has its registered office in England and Wales. The Company’s 
ordinary shares are publicly traded on the London Stock 
Exchange and it is not under the control of any single 
shareholder. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) as 
they apply to the consolidated financial statements of the Group 
for the year ended 27 June 2009, and applied in accordance  
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Group is 
required to comply with international accounting requirements 
under IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ except in 
extremely rare circumstances where management concludes  
that compliance would be so misleading that it would conflict 
with the objective to ‘present fairly’ its financial statements. On 
that basis, the Group has departed from the requirements of   
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ and has accounted for its constructive 
but not legal obligations for the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS) 
under the terms of its UK rail franchise agreements. Details of the 
background and rationale for this departure are provided in  
note 28. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
A summary of the Group’s accounting policies applied  
in preparing the financial statements for the year ended  
27 June 2009 are set out below.  
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred 
thousand (£0.1m) except when otherwise indicated. 
As noted above, the Group has taken the decision to depart 
from the requirements of IAS 19 so as to present fairly its 
financial performance, position, and cashflows  
in respect of its obligation for the RPS. 
New standards 
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 IAS 19 ‘The Limit on Defined 
Benefit Assets Minimum Funding Requirements and their 
Interaction’ during the year. Adoption of this revised 
interpretation did not have any effect on the financial 
performance or position of the Group.  
Use of estimates 
The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions. Although these estimates are based 
on management’s best knowledge, actual results ultimately may 
differ from these estimates. 
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant 
risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying value of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year are in relation to:  
• the measurement and impairment testing of indefinite life 
intangible assets requires estimation of future cashflows and the 
selection of a suitable discount rate and growth rate, as detailed 
in note 13; 
• the measurement of defined benefit pension obligations 
requires the estimation of future changes in salaries, inflation, 
the expected return on assets and the selection of a suitable 
discount rate, as set out in note 28; and 
• the measurement of uninsured liabilities is based on an 
assessment of the expected settlement of known claims and an 
estimate of the cost of claims not yet reported to the Group.   
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 69 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of The Go-Ahead Group plc and its subsidiaries  
as at 27 June 2009.  
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control  
is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries for use in the consolidation  
are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company 
and are based on consistent accounting policies. All intra-group 
balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising  
from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full. 
Minority interests represent the interests not held by the Group 
in Govia Limited, a 65% owned subsidiary, and are presented 
within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from 
parent shareholders’ equity. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
income will flow to the Group and the value can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and 
other sales taxes or duty.  
Rendering of services 
The revenue of the Group comprises income from road 
passenger transport, rail passenger transport and aviation services. 
Bus revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket 
sales and revenue generated from services provided on behalf of 
local transport authorities. Aviation revenue represents income 
receivable generated from contracts in place with airlines and 
other aviation businesses. It also includes parking revenue 
generated through the operation and management of car parks 
and associated services, which include security and bus 
transportation. Where the Group acts as a managing agent at a 
car park it recognises only the commission earned as revenue.  
Rail revenue comprises amounts based principally on agreed 
models of route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited 
(which administers the income allocation system within the UK 
rail industry), in respect of passenger receipts and other related 
services such as rolling stock maintenance and commission on 
tickets sold. In addition, franchise subsidy receipts from the DfT 
and local Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs) are treated as 
revenue, and franchise premium payments to the DfT are 
recognised in operating costs. 
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion  
of the customer’s journey or for other services based on the 
proportion of services provided. The attributable share of season 
ticket or travel card income is deferred within liabilities and 
released to the income statement over the life of the relevant 
season ticket or travel card. 
Rental income 
Rental income is generated from rental of surplus properties  
and subleasing of rolling stock and railway infrastructure access.  
It is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Finance revenue 
Interest on deposits is accrued on a time basis, by reference  
to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable. 
Government grants 
Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there 
is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all 
attaching conditions will be complied with. When the grant 
relates to an expense item, it is recognised in the income 
statement over the period necessary to match on a systematic 
basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Where the 
grant relates to a non-current asset, value is credited to a 
deferred income account and is released to the income 
statement over the expected useful life of the relevant asset. 
Uninsured liabilities 
The Group limits its exposure to the cost of motor, employer 
and public liability claims through insurance policies issued by 
third parties. These provide individual claim cover, subject to high 
excess limits and an annual aggregate stop loss for total claims 
within the excess limits. An accrual is made within current 
liabilities for the estimated cost to the Group to settle claims for 
incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, subject to the 
overall stop loss. On the basis that the Group does not have an 
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months 
after the balance sheet date, these uninsured liabilities are 
classified as current. 
The estimation of the balance sheet uninsured claims accrual is 
made after taking appropriate professional advice and is based on 
an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims, 
together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in 
respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but 
that have not yet been reported to the Group. 
Franchise bid costs 
A key part of the Group’s activities is the process of bidding for 
and securing franchises to operate rail services in the UK. All 
franchise bid costs incurred prior to achieving preferred bidder 
status are treated as an expense in the income statement 
irrespective of the ultimate outcome of the bid. Directly 
attributable, incremental costs incurred after achieving preferred 
bidder status are capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised 
over the life of the franchise. 
Profit/revenue sharing agreements 
The rail companies have certain revenue and profit sharing 
agreements with the DfT. An accrual is made within amounts 
payable to central government for the estimated cost to the 
Group of the relevant amounts accrued at the balance sheet 
date.  
Exceptional items 
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the 
income statement, those material items of revenue or expense 
which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the 
events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
better understanding of financial performance. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost 
on transition to IFRSs less accumulated depreciation and any 
impairment in value. Freehold land is not depreciated. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter 
of their expected useful lives and the lease terms.  Financial Statements 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
 
70 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement based on cost 
or fair value, less estimated residual value of each asset, evenly 
over its expected useful life as follows: 
Short leasehold land and buildings The life of the lease 
Freehold buildings and  
long leasehold land and buildings 
 
Over 10 to 100 years 
Rolling stock Over 8 to 15 years 
Plant and equipment Over 3 to 15 years 
The carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment  
are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
If any such indication exists the assets are written down to their 
recoverable amount. 
Non-current assets held for sale 
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at  
the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying 
amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only 
when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be 
committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date  
of classification. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
Acquisitions of businesses since 3 July 2004 are accounted for 
under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the purchase method. 
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the 
excess of the costs of the business combination over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities, meeting the conditions for recognition under 
IFRS 3 at the acquisition date. It is capitalised and carried as an 
asset on the balance sheet. If an acquisition gives rise to negative 
goodwill, this is released immediately to the income statement. 
In some instances certain fair value accounting adjustments are 
required to be made using provisional estimates, based on 
information available, and amendments are sometimes necessary 
in the 12 months following the acquisition, with a corresponding 
adjustment to goodwill. 
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less  
any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for 
impairment, annually, or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income 
statement and not subsequently reversed. For the purposes of 
impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-
generating units monitored by management.  
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to 
IFRSs has been retained at the previous amounts, and has been 
subject to impairment testing as at the transition date and 
annually thereafter. Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 27 
June 1998 has not been reinstated. In the event of subsequent 
disposal of the business to which it relates, goodwill is included in 
the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain 
or loss on disposal to be charged to the income statement. 
Impairment of assets 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an 
indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount, 
being the higher of the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value 
less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined 
for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets  
or groups of assets, and the estimated future cashflows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset.  
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount.  
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the 
income statement in those expense categories consistent with 
the function of the impaired asset. An assessment is made at  
each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that 
previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or 
may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used  
to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recognised.  
The reinstated amount cannot exceed the carrying amount  
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future 
periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any 
residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. 
Franchise assets 
Where the conditions relating to the award of a franchise require 
the Group to assume legal responsibility for any pension liability 
that exists at that point in time, the Group recognises a liability 
representing the fair value of the related net pension deficit that 
the Group expects to fund during the franchise term. When a 
pension deficit exists at the start of the franchise, a corresponding 
intangible asset is recognised, reflecting a cost in acquiring the 
right to operate the franchise. If a pension surplus exists at the 
start of the franchise, then a corresponding deferred income 
balance is recognised, representing a government grant. The 
intangible asset or deferred income balance is amortised through 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of 
the franchise.  
The carrying value of franchise assets is reviewed for impairment 
at the end of the first financial year following the award of the 
franchise and in other periods if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable.   
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 71 
Software 
Software, that is not integral to the related hardware, is 
capitalised as an intangible asset and stated at cost less 
amortisation and any impairment in value. Amortisation is 
charged to the income statement evenly over its expected  
useful life of three to five years. 
Inventories 
Stocks of fuel and engineering spares are valued at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and 
costs incurred in bringing the items to their present location and 
condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling 
price less costs of sale. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and short term deposits in the balance sheet comprise  
cash at bank and in hand, and short term deposits with an  
original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of  
the consolidated cashflow statement, cash and cash equivalents 
consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts. 
Financial assets and derivatives 
Financial assets are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39. 
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, being the 
transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs.  
The Group uses energy derivatives to hedge its risks associated with 
fuel price fluctuations. Such derivatives are initially recognised at fair 
value by reference to market values for similar instruments, and 
subsequently re-measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are 
designated and effective as hedges of future cashflows are 
recognised in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. When the cashflow hedge 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, then 
at the time that asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains 
or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in 
equity are included in the initial measurement of that non-
financial asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the 
recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity 
are recognised in the income statement in the period which the 
hedged item affects net profit or loss. 
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains 
or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to 
the income statement as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, 
or otherwise no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that 
point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs, at which point it is taken to the income 
statement or included in the initial carrying amount of the related 
non-financial asset as described above. If a hedged transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 
recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement. 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds, being 
the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of 
issue costs. Following initial recognition the carrying amount is 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Amortisation of liabilities and any gains and losses arising on the 
repurchase, settlement or other de-recognition of debt, are 
recognised directly in the income statement. 
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the  
asset have passed to the Group, and hire purchase contracts are 
capitalised in the balance sheet, with a corresponding liability 
being recognised, and are depreciated over the shorter of their 
useful lives and the lease terms. The capital elements of future 
obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included 
as liabilities in the balance sheet. 
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to  
the income statement over the periods of the leases and hire 
purchase contracts and represents a constant proportion of  
the balance of capital repayments outstanding. 
Leases where a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Rentals payable under operating leases, and the 
amortisation of lease incentives and initial direct costs in securing 
leases, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. 
Treasury shares 
Re-acquired shares in the Group, which remain uncancelled, are 
deducted from equity. Consideration paid and the associated 
costs are also recognised in shareholders’ funds as a separate 
reserve for own shares. Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of the Group’s shares is transferred from  
the reserve for own shares to revenue reserves. 
Retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of pension schemes; both defined 
benefit and defined contribution. The costs of these are 
recognised in the income statement within operating costs. As 
discussed below, the Group has invoked the provisions of IAS 1 
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and has departed from the 
requirements of IAS 19 in respect of the Rail Pension Schemes 
(RPS). 
Non-rail schemes 
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is 
determined separately for each plan using the projected unit 
credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the 
current period (to determine current service cost) and to the 
current and prior periods (to determine the present value of 
defined benefit obligation) and is based on actuarial advice. The 
interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the 
change in present value of obligations during the period, and is 
determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present 
value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material 
changes in the obligation during the year. The expected return on 
plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of 
the year of long term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted 
for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions 
received and benefits paid during the year.  
The Group has applied the option under IAS 19 to recognise 
actuarial gains and losses in the Statement of Recognised Income 
and Expense in the period in which they occur.  
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and 
the interest cost, along with the current service cost, is 
recognised in the income statement within operating costs.  Financial Statements 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
 
72 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet 
comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high 
quality corporate bonds), less any past service cost not yet 
recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the 
obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on 
market price information and in the case of quoted securities is 
the published bid price. 
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the 
benefits have vested. When a settlement (eliminating all 
obligations for benefits already accrued) or a curtailment 
(reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in 
the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement) 
occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured 
using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss 
recognised in the income statement during the period in which 
the settlement or curtailment occurs. 
Contributions payable under defined contribution schemes are 
charged to operating costs in the income statement as they fall 
due. 
Rail schemes 
Our train operating companies participate in the RPS, a defined 
benefit scheme which covers the whole of the UK Rail Industry. 
This is partitioned into sections and the Group is responsible for 
the funding of these schemes whilst it operates the relevant 
franchise. In contrast to the pension schemes operated by most 
businesses, the RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that 
costs are formally shared 60% employer and 40% employee. A 
liability or asset is recognised in line with other defined benefit 
schemes in the Group, although this is offset by a franchise 
adjustment so that the net liability or asset represents the deficit 
or surplus that the Group expects to fund or benefit from during 
the franchise term. This represents a departure from IAS 19 so as 
to present fairly the Group’s financial performance, position and 
cashflow in respect of its obligations for the RPS. 
Share-based payment transactions 
The cost of options granted to employees is measured by 
reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, 
determined by an external valuation using an appropriate pricing 
model. In valuing equity-settled options conditions are linked to 
the price of the shares of The Go-Ahead Group plc (‘market 
conditions’) and to earnings per share criteria. 
The cost of options is recognised in the income statement over 
the period from grant to vesting date, being the date on which 
the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award, with 
a corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense 
recognised at each reporting date, reflects the extent to which 
the period to vesting has expired and the Directors’ best 
estimate of the number of options that will ultimately vest or,  
in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be 
treated as vesting as described above. 
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether  
or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied. Where an equity-settled 
award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of 
cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised for the award is 
recognised immediately.  
Taxation 
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply when the related asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base of 
assets and liabilities for taxation purposes and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. It is provided for on all 
temporary differences, except: 
• on the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time 
of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss; and 
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable 
that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the temporary differences will be reversed in the 
foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available to allow  
all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. The 
carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all 
or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.  
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised  
in equity and not in the income statement, otherwise, tax is 
recognised in the income statement.

3. Segmental analysis 
The Group’s primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments. The operating businesses  
are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business 
unit that offers different products and serves different markets, as detailed in the Directors’ Report. 
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. The Group 
has only one reportable geographical segment, being the UK. 
Business segments 
The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding the Group’s business

Sharesave Scheme 
The Group operates an HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) approved savings-related share option scheme, known as The Go-Ahead 
Group plc Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 2003 (the ‘Sharesave Scheme’). The Sharesave Scheme is open to all Group employees 
(including Executive Directors) who have completed at least six months’ service with a Group company at the date they are invited to 
participate in the scheme. Qualifying employees are invited to save between £5 and £75 per month (up to a maximum of £250 per month 
across all schemes) for a period of three years. At the end of that period, employees can apply the amounts saved, together with a bonus, 
in acquiring shares in the Company at a minimum price equal to 80% of their market price at the time of invitation. 
There are savings-related options at 27 June 2009 as follows: 
Scheme maturity 1 June 2010  1 July 2009 1 June 2008 
Option price (£) 19.14 14.62 12.10 
No. of options unexercised at 27 June 2009 383,612 477,983 – 
No. of options exercised during the year 89 1,937 47,910 
No. of options exercisable at 27 June 2009 3,927 476,672 – 
The expense recognised for these schemes during the year to 27 June 2009 was £0.7m (2008: £2.3m).  
The following table illustrates the number (No.) and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of share options for the SAYE:

Outstanding at the end of the year 861,595 16.63 1,150,741 16.38 
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised in the period was £17.61 (2008: £15.34). 
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contracted life of 0.4 years (2008: 1.3 years).  
These options are exercisable between £14.62 and £19.14 (2008: between £12.10 and £19.14).  Financial Statements

6. Staff costs continued 
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The key assumptions input into the model are future share price volatility, 
future dividend yield, future risk free interest rate, forfeiture rate and option life.  
Share incentive plans 
The Company operates an HMRC approved share incentive plan, known as The Go-Ahead Group plc Share Incentive Plan (the SIP). The 
SIP is open to all Group employees (including Executive Directors) who have completed at least six months’ service with a Group company 
at the date they are invited to participate in the plan. 
The SIP permits the Company to make four different types of awards to employees (free shares, partnership shares, matching shares and 
dividend shares), although the Company has, so far, made awards of partnership shares only. Under these awards, the Company invites 
qualifying employees to apply between £10 and £125 per month in acquiring shares in the Company at the prevailing market price. Under 
the terms of the scheme, certain tax advantages are available to the Company and employees. 
Long term incentive plans  
The Executive Directors participate in The Go-Ahead Group Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 (the LTIP). The LTIP provides for Executive 
Directors and certain other senior employees to be awarded shares in the Company conditional on specified performance conditions being 
met over a period of three years. Refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report for further details of the LTIP. 
The expense recognised for the LTIP during the year to 27 June 2009 was £nil (2008: £0.2m). 
The fair value of LTIP options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. The inputs to the model used for the options granted in the year to 27 June 2009 were:

2009 
The exceptional items were significant in the year, totalling £57.7m before taxation, of which £49.8m was recognised in the first half. Most 
of the items were non-cash, with cash items totalling £10.1m 
The largest item was a first half, non-cash impairment charge of £38.4m reflecting the challenging conditions in aviation service division. This 
reduced the carrying value of the ground handling and cargo operations within the aviation services division to approximately £20.0m at 
December 2008 and remains appropriate at the year end. 
Non-cash exceptional items also included £6.9m relating to the fair value of part of the current year bus fuel hedge (designated as 
ineffective under IAS 39), £0.8m in respect of accelerated depreciation on articulated buses in London with a further exceptional charge  
of around £3.0m expected over the next two years, and £1.5m of provision for onerous contracts in our Meteor parking operations. 
Exceptional cash costs totalled £10.1m, consisting of restructuring and reorganisation costs of £5.4m in the aviation services division and 
£4.7m in the rail division. 
These costs have been included due to their relative size and management’s anticipation of their non-recurring nature.

as Go West Midlands and The Birmingham Coach Company Limited) on 29 February 2008.

Rail franchise asset 
This reflects the cost of the right to operate a rail franchise. The brought forward element of the franchise intangible is made up of £25.2m 
relating to the opening deficit in the RPS and £12.0m relating to the cost of the intangible asset acquired on the handover of the franchise 
assets relating to the Southeastern rail franchise. The intangible asset is being amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the franchises 
(being between six and eight years).  
Software costs 
Software costs capitalised exclude software that is integral to the related hardware.  
Customer contracts 
This relates to the value attributed to customer contracts and relationships purchased as part of the Group’s acquisitions. The value is 
calculated based on the unexpired term of the contracts at the date of acquisition and is amortised over that period. 
Impairment 
During the year ended 27 June 2009 an impairment review of the aviation services division resulted in the goodwill of aviance and Plane 
Handling of £16.1m being written down to £nil. Software costs of £0.1m and customer contracts of £0.1m associated with the aviation 
services division were also impaired.   
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 85 
Goodwill 
As from 3 July 2004, goodwill is no longer amortised and is annually tested for impairment. 
The goodwill charge of £2.4m (2008: £2.4m) is in respect of rail businesses which, due to the finite nature of the franchises, require the 
goodwill to be impaired annually. 
Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to individual cash-generating units for impairment testing on the basis of the 
Group’s business operations. The carrying value of goodwill by cash-generating unit is as follows: 
 2009 
£m 
2008 
£m 
aviance and Plane Handling – 16.1 
Meteor Parking 18.4 18.4 
New Southern Railway 1.0 3.4 
Metrobus 6.5 6.5 
Go South Coast 28.6 28.6 
Brighton & Hove 2.1 2.1 
Go West Midlands – – 
London Bus 10.5 10.5 
Go North East 0.8 0.8 
 67.9 86.4 
The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation for each cash-generating unit, using cashflow 
projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three-year period. Growth has been 
extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts, using a growth rate of 3.0% which reflects the Directors’ view of long term growth 
rates in each business. 
The pre-tax cashflows for all cash-generating units have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.0% (2008: 12.1%), based on the 
Group’s weighted average cost of capital, plus an appropriate risk premium for each cash-generating unit of 0.0-2.0% (2008: 0.0-2.0%). 
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the forecast operating cashflows, the discount rate and the 
growth rate used to extrapolate cashflows beyond the budget period. The operating cashflows are based on assumptions of revenue, staff 
costs and general overheads. These assumptions are influenced by several internal and external factors. 
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each unit and to be realistically achievable 
in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts. We have conducted sensitivity analyses on our calculations and have confirmed 
that, apart from aviance and Plane Handling where we have recorded an impairment of our assets this year, there is no reasonably possible 
movement on assumptions which would lead to impairment.  
14. Business combinations 
Year ended 27 June 2009 
There have been no business combinations during the year ended 27 June 2009. 
Year ended 28 June 2008 
On 10 September 2007, Go North East Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the commercial bus operations and 
associated assets of Northumbria Coaches, a small independent Northumberland bus operator. On 15 October 2007, Go North East 
Limited acquired the commercial bus operations and associated assets of Stanley Taxis, a small independent Durham bus operator. On  
28 January 2008 Go North East Limited acquired the commercial bus operations and associated assets of Redby Buses, a small independent 
Sunderland bus operator. On 8 December 2007 Metrobus Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired FirstGroup’s 
regulated bus operations in Orpington. 
The total cash consideration for the above acquisitions was £5.5m. They have been accounted for as acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3. 
The acquisition balance sheets have been adjusted to reflect provisional fair values and the goodwill arising has been capitalised as an 
intangible asset. 
Intangible assets acquired represent customer contracts of £1.2m. 
Management believes that the goodwill represents future growth opportunities and created value to the Group in respect of non-
contractual relationships, customer loyalty, and an assembled workforce, for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is  
not permitted. A property valuation has been completed.  Financial Statements

if the combinations had taken place at the beginning of the year. 
15. Assets classified as held for sale 
Assets held for sale, with a carrying amount of £9.7m (2008: £2.6m), represent property, plant and equipment which are currently not used 
in the business and are now available for sale. These assets classified as held for sale had no associated liabilities at the year end

deposit rates. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is not materially different to book value. 
Amounts held by rail companies included in cash at bank and on short term deposit, can be distributed only with the agreement of the DfT, 
normally up to the value of revenue reserves or based on a working capital formula agreed with the DfT. As at 27 June 2009, balances 
amounting to £181.3m (2008: £122.9m) were restricted.

Bank loans 
Bank loans are stated net of debt issue costs of £1.2m (2008: £1.7m). 
Syndicated loan facility 
On 23 November 2007 the Group entered into a £340.0m five-year syndicated loan facility. The debt is unsecured and interest is charged 
at LIBOR + Margin, where the margin is dependent upon the gearing of the Group and the intended use of the borrowings. 
As at 27 June 2009, £239.0m (2008: £262.0m) of the facility was drawn down. 
Medium term loans

of £6.5m, £5.8m and £7.2m on 22 September each year. £5.3m is subject to fixed interest of 5.94% and is repayable in one final instalment 
on 6 March 2010. 
There is one floating rate loan which is unsecured. It is subject to interest at LIBOR + 0.3%, and is repayable in annual instalments of £5.6m 
on 22 August each year. 
On 26 August 2009 two additional floating rate loans were arranged. The first being a £15.0m loan subject to interest at LIBOR + 3.0% 
with a single repayment on 25 August 2012.  The second is also for £15.0m and is subject to interest at LIBOR + 2.25%. Repayments of 
£1.5m, £3.5m and £10.0m will be made in year one, year two and year three respectively. 
Bank covenants 
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans 
becoming immediately repayable. These covenants specify a maximum adjusted net debt to EBITDA of 3.5x, and EBITDA plus fixed charges 
to interest payable plus fixed charges ratio. At the year end the Group was not in breach of any bank covenants.

22.  Financial risk management objectives and policies 
Financial risk factors and management 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, hire purchase and finance lease contracts, and cash and short term 
deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide an appropriate level of net debt to fund the Group’s activities, 
namely working capital, fixed asset expenditure, acquisitions, dividends and share buybacks. The Group has various other financial 
instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations. 
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and fuel swaps. The purpose is to manage the interest rate 
and fuel price risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. 
It is, and has been throughout 2009 and 2008, the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken and derivatives are only 
purchased for internal benefit. 
The main financial risks arising from the Group’s activities are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  Risks arising from fuel derivatives 
are explained in note 23. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group borrows and deposits funds and is exposed to changes in interest rates. The Board’s policy toward cash deposits is to deposit 
cash short term on UK money markets. Interest payable on senior bank borrowings is based on re-fixing the rate of interest over short 
periods of time of up to 36 months. During the year the Group has partially managed interest rate risk by hedging. Excluding fixed rate 
debt, the Group has net borrowings and hence the present adverse risk is an increase in interest rates.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on financial instruments 
classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in  
the above tables are non-interest-bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk. 
At 27 June 2009, the Group had two interest rate swaps totalling £100.0m, fixing the interest on part of the variable rate syndicated loan. 
£50.0m was fixed at 2.01% plus margin until December 2011 and £50.0m was fixed at 2.39% plus margin until December 2012. To date 
these two interest swaps have resulted in a realised loss of £0.2m. 
These swaps result in a net floating rate asset of £50.3m and a net fixed rate liability of £141.3m at 27 June 2009.  Hence the adverse risk  
at year end is a decrease in interest rates. 
During the current year, the Group entered into an interest rate swap totalling £150.0m, fixing the interest on part of the variable rate 
syndicated loan at 6.4%. The interest rate swap covered the six months period October 2008 to March 2009 and resulted in a realised loss 
of £1.8m. 
During the year ended 2008, the Group took out a variable interest rate swap on a £100.0m drawdown of the syndicated loan. This was 
designated as a cashflow hedge of the interest on the loan, and a loss of £0.2m was recognised in the income statement.

Liquidity risk 
The Group has in place a £340.0m syndicated loan facility which allows the Group to maintain liquidity within the desired gearing range. 
The level of drawdown and prevailing interest rates are detailed in note 20. 
The Group’s road passenger vehicles are also financed by hire purchase or finance lease arrangements, or term loans at fixed rates of 
interest over two to five year primary borrowing periods. This provides a regular inflow of funding to cover expenditure as it arises. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group rarely enters into transactions in foreign currency and no transaction to date has been material. Should larger foreign currency 
transactions be undertaken, consideration would be given to hedging the foreign currency exchange risk. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash deposits (see note 17). The maximum credit risk exposure 
of the Group comprises the amounts presented in the balance sheet, which are stated net of provisions for doubtful debt. A provision is 
made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of future 
cashflows. 
The majority of the Group’s receivables are with public (or quasi-public) bodies (such as the DfT). The Group does not consider these 
counterparties to be a significant credit risk. Outside of this, the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk. Risk 
of exposure to non-return of cash on deposit is managed through a treasury policy of holding deposits with banks rated A+ or Aa3 or 
above with at least one of the agencies. Our treasury policy outlines the maximum level of deposit that can be placed with any one given 
financial institution.

Managing capital 
The Group manages its capital structure such that net debt (adjusted to exclude restricted cash), to EBITDA (before exceptionals) is within 
a range which retains an investment grade debt rating. Adjusted net debt at the year end was £272.3m (2008: £320.7m), equivalent to 
1.57x (2008: 1.65x) EBITDA in line with the Group’s aim to move to an adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x to 2.5x through the 
cycle.   
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 93 
Operating leases 
The Group uses operating leases for bus and coach purchases across the Group primarily where the vehicles service specific contracts to 
mitigate the risk of ownership at the end of the contract. This results in £0.4m (2008: £0.4m) of cost within operating charges which would 
otherwise have been charged to interest. The Group holds operating leases for its bus fleet with an asset capital value of £9.5m (2008: 
£6.4m). 
The majority of assets in the rail division are financed by operating leases, in particular rolling stock. Leases are entered into by the 
respective operating companies and are not the subject of parent company guarantees. 
23. Derivatives and financial instruments

The fair value of all other assets and liabilities in notes 17, 19 and 20 is not significantly different to their carrying amount. The fuel price 
derivatives were valued externally by the respective banks by comparison with the market fuel price at the relevant date. 
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cashflows at prevailing rates. 
b. Hedging activities 
Fuel derivatives 
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of fuel usage. The Group closely monitors fuel prices and uses fuel derivatives to 
hedge its exposure to increases in fuel prices, when it deems appropriate.  
At the year end, the Group had various fuel price swaps in place. For the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 financial years cashflow hedges 
were placed over 125, 113, 38, 6 and 1 million litres of fuel respectively. The fair value of the asset or liability has been recognised on the 
balance sheet. The value has been generated since the date of the acquisition of the instruments due to the movement in market fuel 
prices. 
As at 27 June 2009 the Group had derivatives against bus fuel of 109 million litres for the year ending 3 July 2010, representing 
approximately 98% of the anticipated fuel usage in our bus division. As at 27 June 2009 the Group also had derivatives against bus fuel for 
the 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 financial years of 100, 25, 3 and 1 million litres respectively.  
As at 27 June 2009 the Group had derivatives against rail fuel of 16 million litres for the year ending 3 July 2010, representing the 
anticipated fuel usage in London Midland and Southern. As at 27 June 2009 the Group also had further derivatives for the 2011, 2012 and 
2013 financial years of 13, 13 and 3 millions litres of rail fuel respectively.  
The Group’s hedging policy for the target percentage of anticipated bus fuel usage hedged for the next year and subsequent two years, and 
its compliance with that policy at the year ended 27 June 2009 is as follows: 
   
 
2010 
 
 
2011 
 
 
2012 
Percentage to hedge per Group policy  100% 50% 25%

recognised. The movement in the period is shown below.

Share capital 
Share capital represents proceeds on issue of the Company’s equity, both nominal value and share premium. 
Reserve for own shares 
The reserve for own shares is in respect of 3,954,897 ordinary shares (8.4% of share capital), of which 52,667 are held for Directors’ bonus 
plans. The remaining shares were purchased in order to enhance shareholders’ returns and are being held as treasury shares for future issue 
in appropriate circumstances. During the year ended 27 June 2009 the Company has repurchased 13,615 shares (2008: 3,571,000 shares).  
The Company has not cancelled any shares during the year (2008: 4,571,000 shares). A consideration of £0.2m (2008: £87.3m) including 
expenses was made for the shares purchased during the year.   
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 95 
Other reserve 
The other reserve represents the premium on shares that have been issued to fund or part fund acquisitions made by the Group.  
This treatment is in line with Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve records the movement in value of fuel price derivatives, offset by any movements recognised directly in equity. 
Capital redemption reserve 
The redemption reserve reflects the nominal value of cancelled shares.

Non-rail schemes 
The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan 
For the majority of non-rail employees, the Group operates one main pension scheme, The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan (the ‘Go-Ahead 
Plan’), which consists of a funded defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution section as follows: 
The defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is not contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new 
entrants. The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is £4.9m (2008: £4.5m) being the 
contributions paid and payable. 
The defined benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benefits based on a 
member’s final salary. The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Contributions to this section are assessed 
in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. The section is effectively closed to new entrants. As a result, it can be 
expected that the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll. However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a 
reducing total pensionable payroll. 
The Go-Ahead Plan is a Group plan for related companies where risks are shared. The overall costs of the Go-Ahead Plan have been 
recognised in the Group’s financial statements according to IAS 19. Each of the participating companies accounts on the basis of 
contributions paid by that company. The Group accounts for the difference between the aggregate IAS 19 cost of the scheme and the 
aggregate contributions paid. 
Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme and Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan 
Some employees of our Go South Coast operations participate in the Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme or the Southern Vectis Group 
Pension Plan. These are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme. 
Contributions to the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. The schemes are closed to 
new entrants, however eligible employees can join the defined contribution section of the The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.  
Other pension arrangements 
A small number of employees in aviance have access to separate defined contribution pension arrangements as part of legacy agreements. 
The expense recognised for this is £0.3m (2008: £0.4m), being the contributions paid. 
The Railways Pension Scheme (the RPS) 
The majority of employees in our train operating companies are members of sections of the RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme. The 
RPS is a shared costs scheme, with assets and liabilities split 60%/40% between the franchise holder/employee respectively. The RPS 
sections are all open to new entrants and the assets and liabilities of each company’s section are separately identifiable and segregated for 
funding purposes.   
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 97 
In addition to the defined benefit cost, BRASS matching AVC company contributions of £0.9m (2008: £0.7m) were paid in the year. 
It is our experience that all pension obligations to the RPS cease on expiry of the franchises without cash or other settlement, and therefore 
the obligations recognised on the balance sheet under IAS 19 are only those that are expected to be funded during the franchise term. 
However, in spite of our past experience and that of other train operating companies proving otherwise, our legal obligations are not 
restricted. On entering into a franchise, the operator becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the RPS 
rules is obliged to meet the schedule of contributions agreed with the scheme trustees and actuaries, in respect of which no funding cap is 
set out in the franchise contract.

The expected return on assets has been derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes  
(i.e. equities and bonds). The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward 
looking views of the financial markets (suggested by the yields available), and the views of investment organisations.  
Sensitivity analysis 
In making the valuation, the above assumptions have been used. The following is an approximate sensitivity analysis of the impact of the

The Directors were unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRSs and then taken directly 
to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since the inception of the pension schemes. Consequently the Directors are unable to 
determine the amounts of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group SORIE before 3 July 2004.

IAS 19 would require the Group to account for its legal obligation under the formal terms of the RPS and its constructive obligation under 
the terms of each franchise agreement. Following industry practice, the Group has concluded that the appropriate accounting policy for the 
RPS to ensure that the financial statements present fairly the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cashflows, is to recognise 
its constructive but not its legal RPS defined benefit obligations. In all other respects the Group’s accounting policy is consistent with IAS 19 
and the treatment adopted for non-rail defined benefit schemes. In doing so, the Group has applied the provisions of paragraph 17 of IAS 1 
and departed from the requirements of IAS 19 in order to achieve a fair presentation of the Group’s obligations regarding its rail schemes 
and prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new franchise owner at exit. 
The total surplus or deficit recorded is adjusted by way of a ‘franchise adjustment’, which is that portion of the deficit or surplus projected 
to exist at the end of the franchise which the Group will not be required to fund or benefit from.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of The Go-Ahead Group plc 
The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 101
We have audited the parent company financial statements of The 
Go-Ahead Group plc for the year ended 27 June 2009, which 
comprise the parent company balance sheet and related notes 1 
to 14. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Sections 495, 496 and 497 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and  
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As explained more fully in the Director’s Responsibilities 
Statement, set out on page 103, the Directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the parent company financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.  
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs  
as at 27 June 2009; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Director’s Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Director’s Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Director’s Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Director’s remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of The Go-Ahead Group plc for the year ended 27 June 2009.

Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the parent company financial statements 
 
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 103 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.  
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:  
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;  
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;  
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and  
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.  
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and to enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.  
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  Financial Statements 
Notes to the parent company financial statements 
 
104 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
1. Parent company accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented 
as required by the Companies Act 2006 and were approved  
for issue on 2 September 2009. They have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice. 
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as 
permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and the 
Company has taken the exemptions under FRS 1 to not present  
a cashflow statement.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available to 
parent companies under FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures’ so as not to provide the information otherwise 
required by the standard, as the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent 
disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures’. 
Tangible fixed assets 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost 
less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter 
of their expected useful lives and the lease terms. 
Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account based on 
cost or valuation, less estimated residual value of each asset 
evenly over its expected useful life as follows: 
Short leasehold land and buildings The life of the lease 
Freehold buildings and  
long leasehold land and buildings 
 
Over 10 to 100 years 
Plant and equipment Over 3 to 15 years 
The carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment  
are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
If any such indication exists the assets are written down to their 
recoverable amount. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown 
at cost less provision for impairment. 
Pension benefits 
The Company is a member of The Go-Ahead Group Pension 
Plan operated by The Go-Ahead Group plc for the majority of its 
employees. This defined benefit scheme is a multi-employer 
scheme for which individual employer shares of the underlying 
assets and liabilities cannot be identified and accordingly the 
Company accounts for them as defined contribution schemes. 
For the defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to  
the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other 
post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year. 
Differences between contributions payable in the year and 
contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or 
prepayments in the balance sheet. 
Share based payments 
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provision  
of FRS 20 and has applied FRS20 only to those options granted 
after 7 November 2002. The cost of options granted to 
employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date 
at which they are granted, determined by an external valuation 
using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled 
options, no account is taken of any performance conditions, 
other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of The 
Go-Ahead Group plc (‘market conditions’), and to earnings per 
share criteria. 
The cost of options is recognised in the profit and loss account 
over the period from grant to vesting date, being the date on 
which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award, 
with a corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense 
recognised, at each reporting date, reflects the extent to which 
the period to vesting has expired and the Directors’ best 
estimate of the number of options that will ultimately vest or, in 
the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be 
treated as vesting as described above. 
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether  
or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied. Where an equity-settled 
award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of 
cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised for the award is 
recognised immediately.    
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 105 
Deferred tax 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year  
and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes. 
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences which have 
originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date. Except 
where otherwise required by accounting standards, no timing 
differences are recognised in respect of: 
• property revaluation surpluses where there is no commitment 
to sell the asset; 
• gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over 
into replacement assets; 
• deferred tax assets except to the extent that it is more likely 
than not that they will be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the enacted rates at which it is 
estimated the tax will be payable. The deferred tax provision is 
not discounted to net present value. 
Uninsured liabilities 
The Company limits its exposure to the cost of motor, employer 
and public liability claims through insurance policies issued by 
third parties. These provide individual claim cover, subject to high 
excess limits and an annual aggregate stop loss for total claims 
within the excess limits. An accrual is made within current 
liabilities for the estimated cost to the Company to settle claims 
for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, subject to 
the overall stop loss. On the basis that the Company does not 
have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 
months after the balance sheet date, these uninsured liabilities are 
classified as current. 
The estimation of the balance sheet uninsured claims accrual is 
made after taking appropriate professional advice and is based  
on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims, 
together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in 
respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date  
but that have not yet been reported to the Company. 
Treasury shares 
Re-acquired shares in the Company, which remain uncancelled, 
are deducted from equity. Consideration paid and the associated 
costs are also recognised in shareholders’ funds as a separate 
reserve for own shares. Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of the Company’s shares is transferred from 
the reserve for own shares to profit and loss. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are accounted for in accordance with FRS 26. 
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, being the 
transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs. 
The Company uses energy derivatives to hedge its risks 
associated with fuel price fluctuations. Such derivatives are initially 
recognised at fair value by reference to market values for similar 
instruments, and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each 
balance sheet date. 
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are 
designated and effective as hedges of future cashflows are 
recognised in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the profit and loss account. When the cashflow 
hedge results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a 
liability, then at the time that asset or liability is recognised, the 
associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously 
been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement 
of that non-financial asset or liability. For hedges that do not 
result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts 
deferred in equity are recognised in the profit and loss account  
in the period which the hedged item affects net profit or loss. 
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains 
or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to 
the profit and loss account as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, 
or otherwise no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that 
point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs, at which point it is taken to the profit and loss 
account or included in the initial carrying amount of the related 
non-financial asset as described above. If a hedged transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 
recognised in equity is transferred to the profit and loss account. 
Leasing commitments 
Leases where a significant portion of all the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Rentals payable under operating leases, and the 
amortisation of lease incentives and initial direct costs in securing 
leases, are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. 
Debt 
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds, being 
the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of 
issue costs. Following initial recognition the carrying amount is 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Amortisation of liabilities and any gains and losses arising on the 
repurchase, settlement or other derecognition of debt are 
recognised directly in the profit and loss account.

7. Pension commitments 
Defined contribution: 
The Company participates in the defined contribution scheme of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan. This scheme is not contracted-out  
of the State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new entrants. The expense recognised in these accounts for the year is £0.1m (2008: 
£0.1m) being the contributions paid and payable.  
Defined benefit: 
The Company participates in a scheme which is part of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan. The assets of the scheme are held separately 
from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.  
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2006 and was updated by Watson Wyatt LLP to take account of the 
requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 27 June 2009 and 28 June 2008. The contributions paid to the 
scheme are paid in line with the schedule of contributions, being 13.3% and 11.2% of pensionable salaries paid to upper and lower tier 
sections respectively.  
The defined benefit scheme is effectively closed to new entrants. As a result it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future, 
as a percentage of payroll. However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.  
The scheme is a multi-employer scheme and in accordance with FRS 17, the Company has accounted for its contributions to the scheme  
as if it were a defined contribution scheme because it is not possible to identify the Company’s share of the net assets and liabilities in the 
scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis due to the high volume of members/pensioners and the historic interaction between Group 
companies. The following disclosures provide details of the entire defined benefit scheme.

available.We will send you a tax voucher
following each dividend payment.T o

documentation and split dividend
payments.T o request that your accounts
be combined, please contact Equiniti.

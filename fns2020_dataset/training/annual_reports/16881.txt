Cover story
The front cover of the 2006 Annual Report symbolises
Wagon. We are a manufacturing business, using steel 
as a primary raw material (as the coils on the left hand side
show). We rely on technology and manufacturing capability
to ensure that our products meet our customers’ exacting
standards. Finally, and most importantly, we must ensure
that our people have a safe environment in which to work,
with all appropriate training, protection and leadership by
example to achieve this, and to ensure that they constantly
and consistently communicate with each other. This is what
the photograph represents. High lights

Introduction
Against the backdrop of difficult European automotive markets,
Wagon has produced a solid performance in 2006 and traded in
line with expectations.
As expected, sales were lower than in the previous year, but 
in the context of weaker volumes, the small decrease in our
operating margin was a good achievement and illustrates the
strengthening of our operational controls, particularly from 
the impact of the Wagon Management System. 
Our order intake has maintained its progress providing a strong
platform for future organic growth, despite a year that has seen
OEM delay the award of new programmes. The Innovative
Solutions Business Group was significantly strengthened by
the technology and customer relationships brought through 
the acquisition of FKT .
Following the year end we completed the acquisition of 
Oxford Automotive ApS for £128.4 million satisfied through 
the issue of new ordinary shares. The combination of our
Engineered Structures and Metal Components businesses
with Oxford Automotive provides a strong technology and
market platform for future growth and provides Wagon with 
a transformational change in scale. The acquisition is expected 
to deliver material earnings enhancement in the year to 
31 March 2008
1
and paves the way for further strategic and
operational development. 
Results and dividend
Sales from manufacturing operations were lower at £389.5
million (2005: £405.1 million) due to reduced volumes and 
the effect of previously advised weakness in historic order
placements. In spite of this, underlying operating profit 
before the preference share dividend was £21.5 million 
(2005: £24.0m) with underlying operating margin only
marginally down from 5.3% to 5.2% reflecting ongoing
operational improvements, and our lower cost base 
offsetting some difficult volumes in the second half.
Underlying profit before taxation and preference share
dividend, was £17.0 million (2005: £19.7 million).

Chairman W agon plc 
Annual Report &
Accounts 2006
02/03
I am pleased to welcome to the Group the employees of FKT
GmbH and Oxford Automotive ApS, as we look forward to
working together on the exciting opportunities provided by
these acquisitions. 
Further I am pleased to welcome our new Wagon plc 
Directors, who were appointed as part of the acquisition of
Oxford Automotive: Wilbur Ross Jr., Hervé Guillaume, Sarkis
Kalyandjian and Rolf Zimmermann all bring broad international
experience to the Board table from a range of backgrounds.
Finally, I would like to thank Richard Wright who retired as a
Director during the acquisition of Oxford Automotive. Richard
has served the Group well, and his automotive experience 
has helped the Group’s perspective during his association 
with Wagon.
Current trading and outlook
Following the acquisition of Oxford Automotive, the Group 
has rapidly put in place the new organisation structure, and 
is implementing reorganisation plans affecting both central
functions and plants.
As part of this exercise, and as already announced, the Group 
is reviewing the ongoing ownership of 5 of its low tonnage
press plants.
The planned reorganisation projects will incur significant cash
outflow in the current year, and in the first half of 2007/08, as
anticipated at the time of the acquisition of Oxford. However,
the benefits will be derived in the year 2007/08.
As highlighted in our update of 10 May 2006, the current
financial year will be challenging. In addition to both Wagon 
and Oxford being at the low point of their revenue expectations
due to historically weak order intake, there is slow activity at
some of our major customers, particularly in France.
We are monitoring carefully raw material market price
developments to ensure Wagon maintains its value 
added margins.
However, despite near term challenges, the strong order 
intake of the past two years will benefit the enlarged Group's
turnover in the year to 2007/08 as these programmes come
into production either later in 2006/07 or in 2007/08. This,
coupled with the significant reorganisation projects, following
the acquisition of Oxford Automotive, means that Wagon is a
much stronger business compared with two years ago and the
Board is justified in looking to the future with confidence

The statement in this paragraph is not intended to constitute a profit forecast for the financial
year ending 31 March 2008 or for any other period. Nor should such statement be interpreted
to mean that earnings or earnings per share will necessarily be greater or lesser than those 
for the relevant preceding financial period for the enlarged Wagon plc group. Rather this
statement should be construed as a reference to an enhancement above the earnings that
might otherwise have been earned during the relevant financial period.
The Group incurred charges of £0.4 million relating to
redundancies carried out at the start of the year following 
the demise of MG Rover, as reported at the half year. The 
loss on disposals of £0.8m is made up of £0.3 million relating 
to the disposal of US Engineering Consulting business, Hawtal
Whiting, as announced in August 2005, and £0.5m relating to
the sale and closure of the machine tool building activities in
France and the UK, following the decision to out-source these
activities in future.
As a result of the adoption of IFRS, no goodwill amortisation
was charged and there was no goodwill impairment. Intangible
asset amortisation of £2.5 million represents the amortisation
of development costs, software and intangible assets acquired
with FKT .
Group profit after taxation was £10.2 million (2005: loss £(3.9)
million) and basic earnings per share were 19.9p (2005: loss 
per share (10.5)p). Underlying earnings per share were 22.2p
(2005: 24.2p).
Net interest charges before the preference share dividend
were £4.5 million (2005: £4.3 million), covered 4.8 times by
underlying operating profits (2005: 5.6 times). 
Net debt was substantially lower than previously expected 
at £44.1 million (before preference shares) (2005: £29.3 
million) due to strong working capital management. Net debt
movement, including £4.5 million relating to the acquisition 
of FKT was £(14.8) million (2005: net debt movement £18.9
million), despite the predicted increase in tooling working
capital due to growth in the amount of orders in the pipeline.
With the reclassification of £14.0 million of the preference
shares as debt at 1 April 2005 following the adoption of 
IAS32 and 39, the resultant aggregate net debt is therefore
£58.1 million (2005: £29.3m). 
As was noted in the Prospectus dated 13 March 2006 issued 
in connection with the acquisition of Oxford Automotive 
ApS, the Board declared a second interim dividend, in lieu 
of a final dividend, of 5.0 pence per ordinary share (2005: 
final dividend 5.0 pence). This will be paid on 6 September to
shareholders on the register as at 31 March 2006. This brings
the total interim dividends declared for the year to 9.0 pence
per ordinary share (2005: 9.0 pence). Accordingly no final
dividend is to be declared.
People and Board changes
As ever, our success is in the hands of our dedicated
employees, and I would like to thank all of them for their 
hard work and loyalty to Wagon. The improvement of our
operational controls was made possible by the hard work 
and drive of our management who have demonstrated 
strong leadership and focus delivering solid Wagon
Management System progress. “This last twelve months has 
been a year where we have 
seen the fruits of the changes 
and initiatives instigated in
2004/05 emerging, though we 
are ambitious for more” .
Wagon ended the year to 31 March 2006 on the verge of
becoming a significantly changed company from that which 
I described last year. Several days after the close of the year 
we completed the acquisition of Oxford Automotive, which 
has a transformational impact on Wagon’s scale. Our
expectations for the enlarged Group, and how it will run in 
the future are described on pages 10 to 13. However, before
looking forward to the shape of things to come in the enlarged
Group, it is important to ‘take stock’ of the year just ended.
In my first year as Chief Executive in 2004/05, we initiated a
number of significant changes and initiatives foundational to
the future development of Wagon. This last twelve months 
has been a year where we have seen the fruits of those
changes emerging, though we are ambitious for more. 
Review of 2005/06 Priorities
At the beginning of the year we established our five key
priorities for the year as the following:
1 Maintain momentum on order intake.
2 Carefully monitor the cash necessary to fund 
Wagon’s growth.
3 Drive the strategic initiatives to realise the corresponding
cost savings, especially in lean manufacturing and 
supplier development.
4 Cautiously look for acquisition targets in the domain of 
value added products and assembly manufacturing.
5 Accelerate the shift towards Eastern Europe.
Our assessment of what has been delivered on each of these
priorities in the year is set out below.
1. Maintain momentum on order intake
We have again produced a strong order intake in the year with
annual revenue value secured of £80.9 million (d118 million),
almost identical to our record achievement in the year ending
31 March 2005 of £83.0 million. The programme lifetime
revenue value of this additional business is £466.0 million
(2005: £486.0 million). Based on industry standard vehicle
replacement cycles, this represents 1.2 years of manufacturing
revenue (2005: 1.2 years), and provides us with a strong
pipeline of organic growth into the future.
2. Carefully monitor the cash necessary to fund Wagon’s growth
We anticipated a significant outflow of cash during the year,
reflecting the exceptionally good order intake performance in
2005 with the associated capital and tooling working capital
investment requirements. We are pleased to report that we
surpassed our own expectations, restricting the net debt
movement to £14.8 million, even after paying £4.5 million of
cash to acquire FKT . As a result, net debt before preference
shares at the year end was £44.1 million (2005: £29.3 million).
This illustrates the sustained focus on cash control across 
the Group.

Accounts 2006

3. Drive the strategic initiatives to realise the corresponding
cost savings, especially in lean manufacturing and 
supplier development
During the year the strategic initiatives became securely
established collectively as the Wagon Management System.
Our emphasis has been to impress on our teams that this is 
not in addition to their day-to-day work, but how they should
perform it. 
• We have continued to make significant progress on our
Safety First programme, beating our internal goal for lost
time accidents and cutting the 12 month rolling average by
more than half. 
• Wagon Excellence System – our lean manufacturing 
initiative – has continued to drive improvements in our stock
to sales ratio down 22% from 5.8% in January 2005 to 
4.5% in March 2006. We have also experienced significant
productivity improvements, which have enabled the
Company to maintain margins in the face of challenging
OEM volumes.
• Our Purchasing programme, Wagon Supplier Development,
has moved ahead strongly this year in direct and indirect
material. Centralised cost reduction action plans on direct
material restricted the non steel purchases to increases of
less than 1%, and a new general expenses cost reduction
initiative generated annualised savings of more than 
£0.8m. The team, tracking systems, and processes have
developed significantly this year, and the Group is achieving
leverage from centralised actions.

Continued
• The Wagon Customer Focus initiative has supported the
programme order intake process, which has resulted in
another strong year in order intake. Wagon has developed 
a more focussed strategy of programmes to target relative 
to its capabilities and future capacities.
• Under the Wagon People Empowerment programme, 
we are realigning our operating units around the principle 
of autonomous production units, which will accelerate the
benefits of the Wagon Excellence System and give more
autonomy to our employees. This will harness their
capabilities and increase their job satisfaction, whilst
improving our business.
4. Cautiously look for acquisition targets in the domain 
of value added products and assembly manufacturing
We completed the acquisition of FKT on 30 November 
2005, which has brought strong capabilities and customer
relationships into the Innovative Solutions Business Group. 
Earlier in the year, we also initiated a commercial association
with Oxford Automotive, which enabled our then separate
companies to win the contract for the Peugeot 308 Station
Wagon rear structural assembly. This venture led us to realise
the strategic benefits of a broader combination with Oxford.
5. Accelerate the shift towards Eastern Europe
Our new press capacity in the Czech Republic will be on stream
in August 2006. We have looked at a number of acquisition
opportunities in Eastern Europe this year, but have declined to
progress further as the fit was not close enough to our
business requirements. The acquisition of Oxford Automotive
gives a partial answer to this priority as it provides a substantial
footprint in T urkey, which is a rapidly developing low cost
location for automotive production.
Financial Results for 2006
This subject is covered in much greater detail in the Financial
Review; however, I am pleased to be able to report that:
• Sales from manufacturing were lower than last year as
predicted due to historic weak order bookings at £389.5
million (2005: £405.1 million), but were also further impacted
by certain weak programmes, particularly in France.
• Underlying operating profits were £21.5 million (2005: 
£24.0 million). Whilst lower than last year due to lower 
sales, the profit margin was only marginally impacted at
5.2% (2005: 5.3%). This maintenance of margin in the face
of weaker sales, and difficult second half volumes can be
correlated directly with the Wagon Management System
programmes, notably Wagon Excellence System and 
Wagon Supplier Development.

• Net debt movement was better than forecast at £14.8 
million increase, with net debt (before preference shares)
ending at £44.1 million. This reflects improvements in our
stockholding arising from Wagon Excellence System, 
as well as continuously improving focus on capital
expenditure, debtors and tooling working capital in our
business processes.
Operational Highlights
Engineered Structures
Despite volume pressures, the performance of our plants at
Sainte Gauburge, Gérardmer, and Waldaschaff was sound.
Brownhills was weaker earlier in the year and Fontaine
performance fell significantly short of expectations due to
surprisingly weak volumes on its sole model, the 307 coupé
cabriolet for Peugeot. Our newly constructed plant at Atessa 
in Italy started production towards the end of the year,
producing roll-profiled space frames for the new Ducato van
structure, and will make a significant contribution in 2007.
During the year we exited from our machine tool building
activities in France and the UK, as these activities can be 
out-sourced more cost effectively. Significant programme
awards secured in the year included the Peugeot 308 Station
Wagon rear structure assembly (in association with Oxford
Automotive), Peugeot Partner door rails, door structures on 
the Ford Maverick, and various structures on the Honda Civic
and CRV .
Metal Components
In the Czech Republic, our Bêlá plant had another successful
year. Our French plants (Bessines, La Souterraine and
Beaucourt) had a difficult year reflecting weak volumes from
the French OEMs in particular. In the UK solid progress was
made in the operational performance of Tyseley, and Wantage
staged a dramatic performance turnaround following the
impact of the MG Rover closure in April 2005. Programme
awards secured in the year include significant stamped parts
on the Skoda Fabia for Bêlá, and on the BMW Mini for our UK
plants and a range of stampings to several other Tier 1
Customers.
Innovative Solutions
Innovative Solutions made great strides during the year,
moving from just one plant in Bressuire a year ago to three 
live plants at the year end, with the addition of one in Spain 
and one in Germany. Bressuire was impacted by the expected
Renault Espace seat rail reconfiguration in July. In August we
were awarded the programme to produce flush windows for
the Hyundai Starex and we are in the process of preparing a
plant in Shanghai for this. In November we completed the
acquisition of FKT , which gives the business greater access 
to the German OEMs notably VW / Audi, and offering us a new
entry into BMW. The new plant at Orense, Spain is now open,
and in start-up phase for the production of sunblinds and
sunroofs for the new Citroen Picasso.
“Thanks to the efforts of all of 
our employees and managers,
Wagon is a safer place to work” . Chief Executive’ s Review
Continued
Oleo
Oleo continued to perform consistently and, as part of its
expansion to serve the fast growing Chinese market, is
establishing a lift buffer line alongside the Innovative Solutions
plant in Shanghai.
Acquisition of Oxford Automotive
On April 7 2006, Wagon completed the acquisition of Oxford
Automotive in an all share deal worth £128.4 million. 
The move will provide increased scale and greater
technological capability, which in turn will enable us to meet 
the growing trend in the automotive parts market for the
outsourcing of larger modules by the OEMs, and allow us 
to compete effectively for larger projects, and to offer
complete modules.
Wagon and Oxford Automotive share a number of 
customers: in particular Peugeot, Renault-Nissan, Ford and
DaimlerChrysler. The enlarged Group will be able to develop
its product and service offering to these groups and 
other OEMs including the Volkswagen Group, Fiat, Honda 
and Hyundai.
As a result of the transaction, Wagon’s existing technologies
and product offering – which include roll forming, stretch
bending, assembly, closure systems, shading and glazing
systems and cargo management systems – are complemented
by Oxford Automotive’s greater heavy stamping capability for
work above 1,000 tonnes, and expertise in larger structural
products and closure mechanisms.
Geographically our activities are well matched with plants
located close to the major OEM manufacturing centres
throughout Europe. The existence of plants in the Czech
Republic, T urkey and China reflects the continuing migration 
of the OEMs to these low-cost countries.
We are working fast to reorganise and integrate the two
businesses, and have realigned our autonomous business
groups to reflect the business capabilities and markets of the
enlarged Group. T wo months after completion, this integration
has advanced considerably. A new Board and Executive
Committee have been formed, new Business Groups and
functional organisations have been implemented and the
commercial and engineering teams have been combined.
Appointments have been made to the first two levels of the
organisation and the third level is nearing completion. We
are in the process of combining our two operational centre 
facilities in Paris.

As part of the integration process, we are in discussions
regarding the potential disposal of 5 low-tonnage stamping
plants – 3 in France (Beaucourt, Bessines and La Souterraine)
and 2 in the UK (Tyseley and Wantage) – representing a
combined turnover of up to £90 million.
As well as the many strategic benefits to be achieved from 
the combination of the two businesses, there will be 
significant benefits to Wagon shareholders following the
integration and reorganisation process, and we anticipate 
that the transaction will be materially earnings enhancing 
in the year to March 2008
1
.
2006/07 Priorities
Having completed the acquisition of Oxford Automotive, 
our primary focus for the coming year is to integrate the two
businesses swiftly and effectively thus realising the benefits 
of the combination:
1. Integrate the Oxford Automotive operations to improve
efficiency, and to secure cost savings.
2. Implement the Wagon Management System (and
particularly Safety First) across the enlarged company.
3. Establish a broader manufacturing footprint in low 
cost countries.
4. Leverage our customer base to further develop and 
enhance existing relationships.
5. Continue separate product and market development 
for the Innovative Solutions Business Group.
The coming year will bring fresh challenges on the road to
delivering the successful combination of Oxford and Wagon. 
In the last twelve months, the Group has responded to the
challenges faced by lower sales whilst increasing profitability,
and gained benefits from embracing the Wagon Management
System; I am confident that our enlarged ‘family’ of employees
will rise to the challenges in the year ahead, just as they have
done in 2006.

Innovative Solutions
Business Group
(“ISBG”)
The Business Group Director for
Innovative Solutions is François 
Bernès, who joined Wagon on 17 March
2006. François’ profile is set out on 
page 23. The ISBG product offering
includes research, development and
manufacturing expertise for best in class
in glazing, shading systems and cargo
management equipment. The main
technologies involved are assembly and
integration of parts.
Wagon Management System
The five Wagon Strategic Initiatives form
the enlarged Group’s Management
System, and each of the initiatives
is headed up by one of the T ransverse
Function Directors. The initiatives are:
Safety First
Wagon Supplier Development 
Wagon People Empowerment
Wagon Customer Focus
Wagon Excellence System
Safety First
Safety is the first priority in Wagon. 
The target is to achieve zero tolerance 
of accidents, through the
implementation of a continuous risk
management cycle involving the regular
reporting of accidents, immediate 
follow-up and training, and the sharing 
of best practice and learning experiences
across the Group. This initiative is
headed by François Liotard, who is
profiled on page 23.
Wagon Supplier Development 
Supplier management is not only an
issue of purchasing. The word
“development” is at the centre of 
this initiative: developing the Group’s
suppliers’ capabilities and a supplier
panel will create the right conditions 
for the Company to succeed. Xavier
Dessemond, Group Purchasing 
Director, heads this initiative. He is
profiled on page 23.
Wagon People Empowerment
People empowerment means ensuring
that all employees are respected, and
provided with responsibility and a
stimulating working environment and
regular training, with a view to
maximising the participation of everyone
in the Group in order to exploit the
potential of all the Strategic Initiatives. 
As such, People Empowerment is one 
of the foundation stones for all Wagon
Strategic Initiatives. It is led by Frederic
Babin, Group Human Resources
Director, who is profiled on page 23. W agon plc

Wagon Customer Focus
This initiative is about fostering excellent
commercial relationships with all the
Group’s external customers and
improving cross-selling between the
countries where Wagon operates. It is
essential that customers are everyone’s
priority, second only to safety. Christian
Bogeat heads up the Customer Focus
team; he is profiled on page 23.
Wagon Excellence System 
This initiative is about lean manufacturing
and lean engineering, enhanced quality,
reduced inventory and improved cost
structure in plants. It was created to
ensure that all of our plants run as
efficiently as possible and it is a
fundamental requirement of running a
plant within Wagon that the WES
principles are fully embraced. François
Liotard also leads this initiative, in
addition to Safety First. “The impact of predicted lower
sales was mitigated by the
productivity benefits derived
from the Wagon Excellence
System and material savings
from the Wagon Supplier
Development programme”.
Sales and profit before financing costs
Sales from manufacturing were lower at £389.5 million 
(2005: £405.1 million); T ooling revenues were £18.3 million
lower, as the weak order intake in years ending 31 March 
2002 to 2004 worked through the working capital cycle;
Engineering Services were £4.4 million lower, representing 
the last of the sales from the North American operation which
was sold in August 2005. Overall, sales were down by 8.4% 
to £417.2 million (2005: £455.5 million).
Underlying operating profit decreased by 10% to £21.5 million
(2005: £24.0 million). In profitability terms, the impact of
predicted lower sales from low order intake in 2002 to 2004,
together with certain specific volume issues, was mitigated by
the productivity benefits derived from the Wagon Excellence
System and material savings from the Wagon Supplier
Development programme. This resulted in operating margin
moving only marginally to 5.2% from 5.3% in the prior year.
The Group incurred charges of £0.4 million representing
residual MG Rover costs, as reported at the half year. 
These costs have been disclosed separately in the profit 
and loss account, to facilitate an understanding of underlying
financial performance.
Losses on disposal of operations of £0.3 million arose on 
the disposal of the US Engineering Consultancy business, 
as reported at the half year, and the closure and sale of the
machine tool building operations in the UK and France
respectively generated an aggregate loss of £0.5 million. 
Following the adoption of IFRS, goodwill is no longer
amortised, but is tested annually for potential impairment.
Following this review, no impairment of the carrying value is
necessary. Intangible asset amortisation of £2.5 million is
charged: of this £0.2 million is in relation to the FKT acquisition,
£1.7 million is the amortisation of development costs, and 
£0.6 million relates to software.
Financing Costs
Following the prospective adoption of IAS 32 and 39 under
IFRS, the preference share dividend is required to be shown 
as a financing expense, but no change to the comparatives 
is allowable. Before accounting for the preference share
dividend, the net financing costs for the year were similar to
2005 at £4.5 million (2005: £4.3 million). On this basis, net
financing costs were covered 4.8 times (2005: 5.6 times) by
underlying operating profit. 
After accounting for the preference share dividend of 
£1.5 million, aggregate net financing costs are £6.0 million
(2005: £4.3 million).

Taxation 
The total taxation charge for the year was £4.1 million (2005:
£5.0 million). The underlying tax charge as a percentage of the
underlying profit before taxation, was 26% (2005: 29%). This
effective rate is lower than the UK standard rate, primarily due
to the mix of where profits have been earned, including some
utilisation of previously unrecongnised deferred tax assets.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 19.9p (2005: loss per share
10.5p). We have also presented underlying earnings per share,
which excludes the impact of MG Rover costs, restructuring
costs, loss on disposal of operations, goodwill impairment and
amounts written off investments. Underlying earnings per
share were lower at 22.2p (2005: 24.2p), reflecting the reduced
volumes.
Dividends
In conjunction with the acquisition of Oxford Automotive ApS,
the Board declared a second interim dividend of 5.0 pence per
ordinary share (2005: final dividend 5.0 pence), payable on 
6 September 2006 to shareholders on the register at 31 March
2006. This makes the total dividends for the year of 9.0 pence
per ordinary share (2005: 9.0 pence) and is covered 2.8 times
(2005: 2.7 times) by underlying earnings after tax before
preference share dividend. There will be no final dividend
declared for the year ending 31 March 2006.
Cash flow, net debt and gearing 
Working capital
During the year working capital increased by £18.5 million
(2005: £18.1 million decrease), reflecting the anticipated
increase in tooling working capital and reduction in
restructuring provisions brought forward.
T ooling working capital increased by £11.6 million supporting 
the organic growth in the pipeline, which arises from the higher
order intake in the past two years. As relevant programmes
come into production in the coming year, it is expected that a
significant proportion of this tooling working capital will be
converted into revenue.
Non tooling inventory declined by £2.5 million, an 11%
reduction; allowing for the acquisition of FKT and the start-up 
of the Atessa and Orense plants, the like for like position
showed a 19% reduction against the previous year. This
improvement evidences the impact of the Wagon Excellence
System, our lean manufacturing programme, in improving 
cash generation.

Capital expenditure and return on investment
Capital expenditure in respect of tangible fixed assets
amounted to £25.6 million (2005: £16.0 million) and
represented 1.0 times the annual depreciation charge 
(2005: 0.6 times). Deferred engineering costs in respect of
major development programmes amounting to £3.8 million
(2005: £4.6 million) were also incurred. The accounting policy
of capitalising such costs with subsequent amortisation 
against future revenues, matches costs with the revenues 
they generate. 
In addition to capital expenditure, approximately £0.8 million
(2005: £1.4 million of equipment) has been made available 
to the Group by way of operating leases in France, Belgium,
Germany and USA.
The Board is focused on the need to generate an adequate
return on its invested capital and thereby create shareholder
value. All operating units are tasked with meeting challenging
financial targets to ensure cash returns are optimised and
investments made in the most value enhancing areas. Capital
expenditure projects are subjected to a rigorous evaluation
process to help ensure that the cash flow returns on such
investments will exceed the Group’s cost of capital and that 
all risks associated with each project are properly understood
and managed. 
One of the key measures used is the annualised return 
on invested capital, defined as profit before interest, non-
recurring items, impairment and tax as a percentage of 
average investment, including capitalised goodwill. The 
return on invested capital for continuing operations for the 
year was 12%, compared to 13% in the prior year. Our 
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital for the year was
approximately 10% (2005: 10%).
Net debt and gearing
Following the adoption of IFRS, net debt is now presented 
to include the debt proportion of the preference shares, 
with no restatement of the comparative allowed, and was
£58.1 million at the year end including this (2005: £29.3 million,
excluding the debt element of the preference shares). 
T o facilitate a comparison with last year, net debt before the
inclusion of the debt proportion of the preference shares was
£44.1 million (2005: £29.3 million). On this basis, comparing 
net debt to total equity of £87.9 million (2005: £89.2 million),
results in a gearing level of 50% (2005: 33%). 
As required by IFRS, net assets include the UK pension plan
deficit of £21.8 million (2005: £30.7 million) and as mentioned
above the debt proportion of the preference shares £14.0
million. Further details of the Group’s funding arrangements 
are set out below.

Treasury and management of financial risk
The Group has a central treasury function that operates within
clear policies and guidelines, approved by the Board, designed
to reduce the major treasury related risks. The main risks are
related to funding (liquidity), interest rate and foreign exchange
exposures. Control and reporting systems exist to ensure
compliance with the policies and speculative transactions are
not permitted. There have been no changes in the year to the
major financial risks faced by the Group, nor in the way in 
which they are managed. 
Funding
The Group’s policy is to maintain adequate committed facilities
to meet its expected funding needs, whilst aiming to manage
cash resources efficiently. As at 31 March 2006, the Group 
had borrowed US$65 million of Guaranteed Senior Unsecured
Notes, due for repayment on 10 September 2009. These
borrowings have been converted into a euro denominated
liability of d66.5 million by the use of cross currency swaps.
Also at 31 March 2006, the Group had a committed d62.5
million multi-currency revolving bank facility, due to mature 
in June 2009. In addition, further uncommitted facilities have
been made available to Group operating companies. 
The Group’s net borrowings before preference share debt 
at 31 March 2006, of £44.1 million, comprised gross
borrowings of £82.4 million, offset by cash balances of 
£38.3 million. Significant headroom remains available within
our committed facilities.
Since 31 March 2006, in order to provide funding for
reorganisation actions anticipated following the acquisition 
of Oxford Automotive, the Group has replaced the d62.5 
million term and multi currency revolving bank facility, with a
committed d225.0 million multi currency term and revolving 
bank facility due to mature in October 2008.
The adoption of IAS 32 also means that the presentation of
loans as current or non current liabilities changes. The
classification is now based on re-pricing date under IFRS 
rather than maturity date, as was the case under previous
GAAP . Under IAS 32, comparative figures are not allowed to 
be restated (see note 16 on page 65).
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s policy is to manage its exposure to short term
interest rate movements through the use of derivative
contracts where appropriate. At the year end, 48% of the
Group’s borrowings were protected by instruments providing
fixed or capped interest rates.
“On a like for like basis non 
tooling inventory showed a 19%
reduction against the previous
year. This improvement
evidences the impact of the
Wagon Excellence System in
improving cash generation.” Foreign currency risk
The vast majority of the Group’s transactions are conducted
within the ‘euro zone’, and therefore relatively few cross
currency transactions occur. Where they do arise, our policy 
is to hedge the exposure primarily by using forward exchange
contracts executed at either the point of commitment, or
where there is a high confidence of future commitment.
Group policy is to hedge a proportion of the overseas net
assets and operating profits translation exposure by foreign
currency borrowings. At 31 March 2006 approximately 42% 
of the net assets were hedged by this means. Further
information regarding the financial assets and liabilities is
detailed in the financial statements.
Pensions
The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan in the UK
(the”Plan”) and, in common with many other UK pension
schemes, the assets of the Plan are appropriately balanced
between equities and gilts/bonds. The Plan showed a deficit of
£30.7 million before deferred tax at 31 March 2005, calculated
on the basis of IAS 19. This deficit had reduced to £21.8 million
before deferred tax as of 31 March 2006, due to improved
asset investment performance, and the progressive recovery
of the deficit by enhanced contributions from the Company.
Following the adoption of IFRS and IAS19, this pension 
deficit of £21.8 million is recorded on the balance sheet. 
The Board has reviewed the position of the Plan in consultation
with the trustees and actuary of the scheme and remains
committed to the continued support of the Plan for the benefit
of existing members. The Plan was closed to new entrants
with effect from February 2002. The last full actuarial valuation
was conducted at 5 April 2005, and the Company and the
trustees are in the process of agreeing a revised schedule of
contributions. With the help of its advisers, the Company
estimates that the actuarial funding deficit has reduced from
£29.5 million at 1 April 2005 to approximately £22.0 million 
at 5 April 2006. The estimated normal service cost for the
Plan’s active members is approximately £0.7 million per 
annum (2005: £0.9 million). 
Accounting policies
In accordance with Regulation 1606 adopted by the European
Parliament in June 2002, EU-listed companies are required 
to issue consolidated financial statements, prepared in
accordance with adopted IFRS, and effective for accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005. These accounts
are the first set of full year accounts to have been prepared
under adopted IFRS, following the Interim accounts at 30
September 2005. Note 28 of the accounts on page 83 details 
the differences between the accounts under UK GAAP 
and IFRS.

Lifetime value Current turnover 
  There are two principle areas of impact, as discussed in the
sections above. The UK defined benefit pension plan is now
recorded on the balance sheet under IAS 19. The second area
concerns the treatment of preference shares: following
adoption of IAS 32 and 39, the value is attributed between
equity and debt, having formerly been treated 100% as equity.
This has two effects: increasing the reported net debt by 
£14.0 million and reporting the preference share dividend 
as a financing expense rather than as a distribution to
preference shareholders.
Acquisitions
FKT
As announced at the half year, on 30 November 2005, the
Group acquired the entire share capital of FKT GmbH.
Consideration was in the form of £4.5 million in cash and 
£0.1 million of Wagon ordinary shares, and a three year earn
out for the former owner managers capped at £3.5 million,
payable in Wagon ordinary shares. In the determination of 
the value of the assets under IFRS, an intangible asset of 
£4.8 million has been created, relating to patents, customer 
contracts and customer relationships. This amount will 
be progressively amortised and separately identified from
underlying operating profit over a period of 6 to 10 years.
Oxford Automotive
Since the balance sheet date, the Group has acquired 99.8% 
of the share capital of Oxford Automotive ApS and is in 
the process of acquiring the small number of shares
outstanding. The acquisition was completed on 7 April 2006.
The consideration for the Oxford Automotive shares was 
62.2 million new Wagon ordinary shares, implying a value of
£128.4 million based on the closing price immediately before
the shares resumed trading. The new ordinary shares were
admitted to trading on 7 April 2006.
As mentioned above under “Funding”, the Group has replaced
the revolving facilities existing at the balance sheet date with
expanded facilities to fund the anticipated integration process.
The background and prospects of the enlarged Group are
covered more fully in the Chief Executive’s Review, Business
Group Review, and Directors’ Report.

Pierre Vareille, Group Chief Executive and Richard Cotton,
Group Finance Director are also members of the Executive
Committee and are featured on page 20. Directors’ Report
The Group’s senior management is kept abreast of
developments in financial, commercial, strategic and human
resource matters and are thereby able to inform and consult
with employees as appropriate. This is done by a series of
regular telephone calls, written briefings, and a conference
which is to be held twice per year. 
The Group monitors employee attendance very seriously and
whilst recognising that illness is a human condition potentially
affecting all employees, it manages persistent absence where
this does not appear to be the case. Absence is defined for the
purposes of monitoring as time employees are not present at
work due to sickness or accidents in the workplace. Each site
has its own monthly target defined by the Executive
Committee, who may review the targets at any time during 
the year. In the last year there has been a reduction of 1.6% in
the absenteeism rate. However, the six month rolling average
percentage of absence at 31 March 2006 was 4%,
considerably higher than the target of 2.5%. During 2006/07
there will be greater focus on achieving set targets through a
programme of communication to all employees on the internal
procedures concerning illness. The management team will be
involved in this process and action plans will be closely
monitored by the Executive Committee.
The Group continues to consult with its European Works
Council (called the Wagon European Forum). This body and its
Select (or management) Committee have provided a useful
additional mechanism for sharing information and consulting
with our employees. 
The Group also recognises its responsibilities to ensure the fair
treatment of all of its employees in accordance with national
legislation applicable to the territories within which it operates.
Equal opportunities for appropriate training, career
development and promotion are available to all employees
regardless of any physical disability or their gender, religion,
race or nationality. In particular, having regard to their aptitudes
and abilities, the Group gives full and fair consideration to
applications for employment received from disabled persons. 
Pension arrangements in each of the countries in which 
the Group operates are maintained in accordance with
legislative requirements, custom and practice and Group 
policy as appropriate. 
The Directors present their report, together with the financial
statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2006. 
Activities and business review 
The principal activities of Wagon plc and its subsidiaries,
together with a review of the businesses, are set out on 
pages 2 to 19. 
Financial results and dividends 
The Group financial review for the year ended 31 March 2006 
is set out on pages 14 to 19 and the Group consolidated
income statement for the year ended 31 March 2006 is set out

the 7.25p (net) convertible participating preference shares. An
interim dividend of 4.0p was paid to ordinary shareholders on 
17 February 2006. 
As was stated in the prospectus dated 13 March 2006 issued 
in connection with the acquisition of Oxford Automotive ApS,
the Board declared a second interim dividend for the year of
5.0p per ordinary share. This will be paid to shareholders on the
register as at 31 March 2006. Accordingly no final dividend is 
to be declared.

Employees
The Group is conscious that its employees are key contributors
to its success. The Group therefore encourages good
communications and employee relations across all of its
operations by utilising practices developed in each operating
unit which are compatible with local circumstances and
individual national legislation.  W agon plc

Accounts 2006

Payment of creditors
In the UK, the Group agrees payment terms with its suppliers
when it enters into binding purchase contracts. At 31 March
2006 the number of creditor days outstanding for the Company
was 21.
Social responsibility
The Group recognises the importance of social, environmental
and ethical (SEE) matters and the Group continues to work
towards compliance with the ABI disclosure guidelines on
social responsibility. 
The Directors are satisfied that they have received adequate
information in order to make an assessment of the risks to the
Group’s short and long term value arising from SEE matters
and that the key business risks pertaining to the Group, and 
of which SEE matters form part, have been identified. These
risks are reviewed on a regular basis and account is taken of 
the potential impact to the business and its stakeholders
resulting from any such risks. A key part of this process is the
achievement of recognised accreditations such as ISO 14001
or OHSAS 18001 (on which subject see below), preparation of
reports to the Group’s Executive Committee every six months
and the implementation of a costed annual plan for proposed
areas for improvement in each financial year. 
The Group has put in place formal processes for the
management of significant risks which have been identified
and, as a result of the formal reports provided by the Business
Groups, the Directors are aware of the cost and resources
involved in managing these risks. 
The Group has continued its focus on health and safety in all of
its plants and offices. The “Safety First” initiative was the first
initiative to be launched in the Group following the appointment
of the Chief Executive in May 2004. Every facility is subject to
regular monitoring and reporting of its safety performance as
against key indicators. The Group’s formal health, safety and
environmental policy requires each Business Group to take
responsibility at a local level for establishing and maintaining
appropriate standards of health, safety and environmental
management, but with increased attention and visibility of
performance for the Group’s executive management. Internal
policies and procedures address a wide range of issues,
including the importance of formal risk assessments and the
development of local policies which reflect the requirements 
of the laws and regulations in each territory. 
Each operating unit is required to prepare an annual health,
safety and environmental plan with formal objectives intended
to continuously improve upon practices and standards. The
areas for improvement must be costed and adequate provision
made within the unit’s budget to accommodate required
expenditure. In addition, every month, the progress of each
plant is reviewed to confirm the progress made on addressing
the plan and advise how the objectives are being satisfied. 
All operating units are encouraged to achieve formal
accreditation as to the adequacy of the systems and
procedures in place to manage workplace risks. This includes
the environmental standards ISO 14001 or the eco-
management audit scheme ‘EMAS’ accreditation. In the year
to 31 March 2006 all plants (excluding Oxford Automotive
plants) had achieved accreditation under ISO 14001and the
health and safety standard Occupational Health and Safety
Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001. All recently acquired
plants have been set a target of achieving accreditation to 
both of these standards by March 2007.
Each operating unit is required to undertake regular audits of
health, safety and environmental practices. The unit can
conduct such audits using either internal resources or external
consultants. The findings from these audits and responses 
are reported to the Group Executive Committee and are also
monitored by the Board. In addition, each week, the Group
Executive Committee receives a report summarising accidents
and incidents which have occurred during the preceding week,
and these reports are then subject to a monthly review.
The Group undertakes thorough environmental reviews 
as part of its due diligence process when assessing 
potential acquisitions. 
The procedure for verification of SEE matters lies within the
Group’s risk management framework and verification is
conducted by both internal resources and external auditors 
as described in the corporate governance report. 
Risk Factors
The Directors present below their review of the principal risks
and uncertainties facing the business.
If any of the following risks actually materialise, Wagon’s
business, financial condition, prospects and share price 
could be materially and adversely affected to the detriment 
of Wagon and its shareholders. Further risks which are not
presently known to the Directors or that the Directors 
currently deem immaterial, may also have a material effect 
on Wagon’s business, financial condition and operating 
results. The Directors consider the following risks to be the 
most significant for investors, but the risks listed do not
necessarily comprise all those associated with an investment
in the Company.  Directors’ Report
Continued
1.5 Dependence on key suppliers for materials and services
Wagon has only a small number of suppliers for certain
materials and services. It may be difficult to resource such
materials or services if suppliers do not continue supply
Wagon. For any reason Wagon’s suppliers may refuse or not 
be able to continue to sell products on existing terms (or at all).
Wagon may find that it is unable to purchase stock in
appropriate quantities on terms acceptable to it in the future. 
Its operations would also be adversely affected by the lack of
availability or late delivery of products or by other problems in
the supply chain. Should any supplier fail to supply the
components needed by Wagon or be unable to supply
materials or services in a timely manner, Wagon could
experience delays in manufacturing its own products and 
may have to invest resources in finding an alternative supplier.
Should Wagon be unable to find an alternative supplier 
quickly, it could suffer significant interruption in the supply 
of components needed to manufacture its products. 
1.6 Prices of raw materials
Wagon’s profitability may be reduced due to increases in the
price of raw materials, including energy. The principal raw
materials which are used in Wagon’s business are
commodities such as steel, aluminium and plastics, although
the exposure to price increases for aluminium and plastic is
less than the exposure to steel price fluctuations. These
commodities experience price volatility caused by external
conditions, demand, commodity market and currency
fluctuations. Competing manufacturers can be affected
differently by these factors. Increased costs may not always 
be recoverable by Wagon from its customers.
1.7 Dependence on key operating facilities and equipment
Wagon services its customer base utilising a number of key
production lines within its manufacturing facilities across
Europe. The loss of one or more of these production lines
and/or operating facilities through, for example, equipment
mechanical failure or a natural event including, inter alia,
flooding, fire or earthquake, could potentially adversely affect
Wagon’s ability to supply products to its customers. Although
Wagon has a level of downside protection against such
potential events in the form of contingency planning,
preventative maintenance programmes and insurance liability
cover, the Directors cannot be certain as to the future level of
the impact of such events.
2. Economic factors
2.1 Economic downturn
Wagon’s performance depends on a number of factors outside
its control which impact the automotive industry, including
political, economic and environmental conditions.
1. Business risks
1.1 Ability to win or maintain market share
There are no assurances that Wagon’s competitiveness will
improve or that it will win any additional market share from 
any of its competitors or maintain the existing market shares.
Wagon’s competitors may be able to respond more quickly 
to new or emerging technologies and changes in customers’
requirements and/or demands. Existing and/or increased
competition could adversely affect Wagon’s market share
and materially adversely affect its business, financial condition
and operating results. It may be that competition will intensify
and force Wagon to reduce the price of its products, which
could adversely affect its business, financial condition and
operating results.
1.2 Dependence on key customers and programmes
Wagon will be dependent on four key customers which, for the 
year ended 31 March 2006, accounted for approximately
70% of Wagon’s revenue. The loss of one or more 
of its key customers or discontinuation of supply to a key
programme of one of its customers could result in lower than
expected turnover. In addition, there are risks that Wagon may,
for any reason, be placed on business hold with existing, or
new customers and Wagon may not be allowed to tender for
new projects and its customers could decide not to award 
new orders to Wagon. Wagon’s relationships with customers
is such that in certain circumstances, and in common with
automotive industry practice, a customer may require Wagon
to reprice its products (‘‘price downs’’). Wagon has some level
of protection against these price downs in the form of stated
procedures in contracts, however the Directors cannot be
certain as to the future level of these price downs. Customers
may also require Wagon to pass on to them any benefits
achieved through synergies, in particular any price reductions
on steel or raw material more generally.
1.3 Dependence on vehicle volumes
The automotive OEM supply chain is dependent on consumer
demand for newly manufactured automotive vehicles.
Accordingly, Wagon’s success depends on the manufacturers’
vehicle design, marketing, reputation and management to
generate demand and hence volume. 
1.4 T echnological change
The automotive OEM supply chain in which Wagon operates 
is subject to technological change and changes in customer
requirements. Wagon needs to be able to maintain or enhance
the competitive value of its products and develop and introduce
new products or technologies successfully. Wagon cannot
guarantee that it will successfully develop these types of
products or technologies. W agon plc 
Annual Report &
Accounts 2006
26/27
2.2 Currencies and interest rates
Wagon operates in, and sells products to, countries other than
the UK and conducts business in currencies other than UK
pounds sterling. In particular, Wagon’s principal operating
currency is the Euro. Material fluctuations in the exchange rate
of UK pounds sterling against the other currencies in which
Wagon transacts its business could have an adverse impact 
on Wagon’s operations. Wagon’s interest costs in respect of 
its borrowings will increase in the event of rising interest rates.
Rising interest rates may also have a more general effect upon
consumer confidence, resulting in lower demand in the
automotive sector, with a potential adverse effect upon its
financial performance.
3. Risks relating to the Acquisition of Oxford 
Automotive ApS
3.1 Wagon’s ability to integrate Oxford effectively
Wagon’s future success will, to a significant extent, be
dependent on its ability to integrate Oxford’s business
effectively, and any other business it may acquire in the 
future, without disruption to its existing business.
3.2 Dependence on restructuring and synergies
An integral part of the success of the Oxford acquisition
depends on the subsequent reorganisation and restructuring 
of the enlarged Group. If Wagon is unable to undertake the
reorganisation and the restructuring required in the time frame
and on the cost basis envisaged, it could adversely affect
Wagon’s business, financial condition and operating results.
The Directors’ expectations for the restructuring and synergy
benefits from the Oxford acquisition are highly dependent 
on the planned reorganisation and restructuring being
successfully implemented in a timely and cost efficient
manner, and synergy benefits from the acquisition being
achieved. As such, any unforeseen circumstance or difficulty
that would result in the reorganisation and restructuring not
going ahead on the time frame or cost basis, or being impeded
by labour law issues, social unrest and/or an adverse court
decision envisaged would have a material adverse effect on
Wagon’s business, financial condition and operating results.
Charitable donations 
The total charitable donations of the Group during the 
year amounted to £1,000. The Group does not make any 
political donations.
Special business at the Annual General Meeting 
Allotment of shares 
The Directors are proposing that authority be granted to 
them pursuant to section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 to 
allot shares. They are seeking authority by ordinary resolution
to allot unissued shares up to a maximum aggregate nominal
amount of £9,516,932 representing approximately 33% of 
the ordinary shares now in issue.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this
authority other than to the extent necessary to satisfy options
granted under the Company’s share incentive and share 
option schemes or to satisfy conversion rights in respect 
of the Company’s convertible preference shares.
Disapplication of pre-emption
The Directors are proposing a special resolution under section
95 of the Companies Act 1985 to renew the disapplication 
of statutory pre-emption rights in respect of ordinary shares
having an aggregate nominal value of £1,441,959 representing
approximately 5% of the ordinary shares now in issue.
Purchase of own shares for cash
As at the AGM in 2005, the Directors are proposing a special
resolution under section 166 of the Companies Act 1995 to
seek authority for the Company to purchase a maximum of
5,767,837 ordinary shares of the Company representing 5% 
of the ordinary shares now in issue. The prices paid for such
shares will not be less than the nominal value of 25 pence per
share nor more than 5% above the average of the middle
market quotations of the Company’s ordinary shares as derived
from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five
business days preceding the day on which the ordinary shares
are purchased.
The Directors believe it is advantageous for the Company to
have the flexibility to make market purchases of its own
shares. In the event that shares are purchased, they would
either be cancelled (and the number of shares in issue would
be reduced accordingly) or, subject to the legislation referred 
to below, retained as treasury shares. The Directors will only
make purchases after consideration of the possible effect on
earnings per share and the long term benefits to shareholders. 
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (T reasury Shares)
Regulations 2003 (the “Regulations”) permit any shares
purchased by the Company to be held and dealt with by it
(including selling them or transferring them for the purposes 
of employee share schemes) as treasury shares. In the event
that the resolution is approved by the Company’s shareholders,
the Company expects to apply the Regulations in dealing with
shares which it may acquire. However, there is no present
intention to acquire shares and deal with them in this way. 
The authority contained in the special resolution will expire 
15 months after it is given or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the
Annual General Meeting to be held in 2007 but it is the current
intention of the Directors to renew this authority annually.
Under the Company’s articles of association, the proposed
resolution must also be approved by the holders of the
Company’s convertible participating preference shares.
Accordingly, their consent will be sought at a separate
Extraordinary General Meeting of the preference shareholders
to be held on 21 July 2006.  Directors’ Report
Continued
The total number of outstanding options to subscribe for new
ordinary shares at 8 June 2006 (being the latest practicable
date prior to the publication of this report) was 1,819,229. This
represents 1.58% of the Company’s issued ordinary share
capital at that date. If the Company purchases the maximum
number of ordinary shares permitted under the authority given
by the resolution, then the total number of outstanding options
over ordinary shares at 8 June 2006 would represent 1.66% of
the Company’s issued ordinary share capital.
The Directors recommend all shareholders to vote in favour 
of resolutions 1 to 7, as the Directors intend to do so in respect
of their own shares and consider that they are in the best
interests of the Company and the shareholders as a whole. 
Going concern
After making due enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Group has adequate financial resources 
to continue to operate for the foreseeable future and,
consequently, continue to use the going concern basis for
preparing the financial statements which follow.
Auditors
Following a recommendation to the Board from the Audit
Committee, a resolution for the reappointment of KPMG 
Audit plc as auditors of the Company will be proposed at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Remuneration Report
the interests of Directors and senior managers with
shareholders is carefully considered, particularly in the design
of the performance-related elements of their remuneration
packages. The Committee has used the services of the
following advisers during the year: 
Alithos
Long term incentive plan performance criteria monitoring
Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow
UK Defined Benefit pension plan
Mercer Human Resource Consulting
Long term incentive plan
Pinsent Masons 
Shares-based incentives & service agreements
CMS Bureau Francis Lefebvre
Impact of French law on shares-based incentives

French tax advice
Watson Wyatt
UK actuarial advice
The use of advisers in the year related to detailed legal and tax
issues associated with amendments to the shares-based
incentive schemes to allow tax-efficient awards to be made to
France-based participants. Otherwise, ad hoc advice has been
taken in relation to the various shares-based incentives, and
pension schemes issues. 
Remuneration is reviewed in March each year and is
established with reference to the remuneration offered to
senior executives with similar roles, taking proper account 
of the particular responsibilities, skills, performance and
experience required for the executive role within the 
Company. Market comparisons are made with the assistance
of remuneration surveys, including specific surveys
commissioned with external consultants where appropriate. 
The remuneration of Executive Directors consists of a number
of separate elements: base salary, a short term incentive plan
(annual cash bonus), car and fuel allowance, benefits in kind
(medical expenses insurance, life assurance, accident
insurance and permanent health insurance), long term equity
incentives and pension provision or allowance. A significant
proportion of the remuneration is performance-related through
short and long term equity incentives. 
For the year to 31 March 2006, the recommendations of the
Remuneration Committee in respect of the remuneration 
of Executive Directors and the Chairman were accepted by 
the Board.
The Directors present their Remuneration Report for the year
ended 31 March 2006 produced in accordance with Schedule
7A to the Companies Act1985. 
The Company has complied throughout the financial year with
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in July
2003 (the “Code”) with regard to the remuneration policy as
described below. In framing the remuneration policy, the
Remuneration Committee and the Board have given full
consideration to Section B of the Code. 
Remuneration policy 
The Board as a whole establishes remuneration policy. The
Remuneration Committee determines and recommends to 
the Board the framework or Board policy for the remuneration
of the Executive Directors. It also ratifies the Chief Executive’s
remuneration proposals for the members of the Executive
Committee and those members of the Company whose basic
salary is £100,000 pa or more. 
The Committee also takes note of the remuneration policy 
and details (as set by the Chief Executive) for those individuals
whose salary is over £50,000 pa, but below £100,000 pa. 
The remuneration of the Chairman of the Board is determined
by the Remuneration Committee after consultation with the
Chief Executive. The remuneration of the remaining Non-
Executive Directors is a matter for the Chairman of the Board 
in consultation with the Chief Executive.
In determining the policy for the Executive Directors, the
Committee’s objective is to ensure that those individuals are
provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced
performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner,
rewarded for their individual contributions to the success 
of the Company.
During the year the Remuneration Committee comprised the
independent Non-Executive Directors and, until 28 July 2005,
the Company Chairman:
Ms Lyons (Committee Chairman)
Mr Kendall (retired 28 July 2005)
Mr Rennocks
Mr Wright (retired 13 March 2006)
Following the acquisition of Oxford Automotive on 7 April 
2006 the membership of the Committee was changed, and
now comprises:
Mr Kalyandjian (as Chairman from 1 June 2006)
Ms Lyons
Mr Rennocks
Mr Zimmermann
Remuneration Committee members are all considered
independent.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide
remuneration in a form and amount to attract, retain and
motivate high quality management. The importance of aligning  Remuneration Report

T argets have been set which will require the Group to comply
with budgeted cashflow in the year before any payment is
made. Payment will be made subject to the achievement of
targets relating to profit before tax. Any payment is entirely 
at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Executive shares-based incentive plans
The Remuneration Committee is firmly of the view that
offering senior executives the opportunity to be awarded
shares in the Company is an important part of motivating and
rewarding key employees, so that they may participate in the
future growth in value of the Company. It is also of the view
that senior executives should be encouraged to invest directly
in the Company through the purchase of shares.
The Company’s Long T erm Incentive Plan (“the L-TIP”), the
Executive Co-Investment Plan (“the EC-IP”) and the Approved
and Unapproved Executive Share Option schemes (“the ESOS
schemes”) are intended to support these objectives as well 
as to facilitate the retention of key senior executives over the
longer term.
The award of options under the executive share incentive 
plans is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking
into account, inter alia, the seniority of the individual, length 
of service and other such criteria as they may determine from
time to time. The Remuneration Committee’s current policy 
is that participation in the L-TIP is restricted to Executive
Directors. Furthermore, the Remuneration Committee
continues to apply its policy that an individual will not be
entitled to participate in both the L-TIP and the ESOS schemes.
The Wagon 2000 Long Term Incentive Plan (“L-TIP”)
Under the L-TIP rules, selected senior executives (including
Executive Directors) within the Group may each year be
Benefits
Mr Vareille received a car and fuel allowance of £7,120
(2005: £3,176) and benefits in kind of £43,135 (2005: £26,889).
Mr Cotton received a car and fuel allowance of £14,326 and
benefits in kind of £995.
Under the terms of his service agreement Mr Vareille’s salary
and benefits are paid 75% in France (at a contractual
conversion rate of £1:d1.50) and 25% in the UK. Benefits in
kind in the UK are limited to Life Assurance, the cost of which 
is included in “Benefits” in the table above. Mr Vareille
remains within the French Social Security System for the
purposes of pension entitlement (ARRCO/AGIRC) and for life
assurance, death in service (the “Prévoyance” Scheme) and
the standard statutory benefits provided by French Social
Security in respect of medical care and mutual insurance. 
As required by French law, the Company paid £28,420 for the
12 months of employment, which is included under “Benefits”
in the table above. Mr Vareille received a supplementary salary 
of £100,620 equivalent to 30% of his basic salary, specifically 
in lieu of any Company pension contribution as he does not
participate in a Company pension scheme. This payment is
shown under “Other” in the table above.
Bonuses
For the year ended 31 March 2006 the performance targets
were based upon Group profit before taxation, management 
of cash outflow, and to a limited extent, personal objectives.
Performance must reach a minimum target for a bonus of 25%
of basic salary to be payable and this bonus payment may rise
to a maximum of 75% of basic salary for Mr Vareille, and 60%
for Mr Cotton.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to vary the
awards payable under the foregoing formulae. For the year to
31 March 2006 the minimum performance targets were met,
and consequently Mr Vareille will be paid a bonus of £140,149
and Mr Cotton will be paid a bonus of £61,125 in June 2006. W agon plc

awarded conditional entitlements to shares in the Company.
The awards under the L-TIP are made by the trustee of The
Wagon Employees Share T rust (“the T rustee”) on the
recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.
Each award has a three year cycle. The initial market value of
the shares over which any such award is made may not exceed
120% of the amount of the participant’s basic annual salary.
The number or proportion of such award shares which vest 
and are released to the participant will be determined by
reference to the extent to which preset targets, relating to 
the performance of the Company over a fixed three year 
period beginning with that in which the award is made, are 
met or exceeded.
In light of certain changes to French tax laws, in June 2005 the
rules were amended such that for any award to a participant
who is tax resident in France the shares will remain registered
in the name of the T rustee for a further two years following
exercise before being released to the participant. During that
two year period the participant will be entitled to receive
dividends on such shares and may direct the T rustee how 
to exercise any voting rights attaching to those shares.
Performance targets are set by the Trustee on the advice of
the Remuneration Committee at the time the award is made.
The targets are considered to be exacting and provide
transparency for both the executives and shareholders.
For awards made since the Scheme was introduced in 2000,
vesting would only occur in the event that the Company is at
or above the median level in a table of comparator companies
ranked according to total shareholder return over the three
year cycle. If the Company is ranked:
– at or above the 50th centile but below the 60th centile, 
25% of the award shares will vest;
– at or above the 60th centile but below the 75th centile, 
the percentage of award shares which will vest will be
calculated on a linear basis between the percentage
thresholds 27.5% and 62.5% respectively;
– at or above the 75th centile, 100% of the award shares 
will vest; 
In addition, award shares will not normally vest unless the
average annual growth in the Company’s adjusted earnings
per share in the three consecutive years beginning in the year
in which the L-TIP award is made exceeds the percentage
growth in the retail price index by at least 3%.
The adjusted earnings per share criterion is the undiluted
underlying earnings per share of the Company. This is
consistent with the definition used for the ESOS schemes. 
In the event of a change in control of the Company the
Trustee of the L-TIP may determine the extent to which, and
the period within which Awards may be exercised, provided
that the amount to be exercised shall not normally exceed
such proportion as corresponds to the proportion of the
relevant performance period for an award which has elapsed
at the point of the change in control.
In previous years, the comparator companies comprised the
UK listed companies (excluding overseas companies listed in
the UK) in the Engineering & Machinery and Automobile
sectors contained in the London Share Service Listing
published by the Financial Times. The peer group selected
was composed of UK companies with a broad range of
manufacturing, engineering and automotive activities. 
Since the appointment of Mr Vareille as Chief Executive, 
the Company has sought to benchmark itself as a European
automotive company. As such a number of the companies
within the previous comparator list were no longer
considered appropriate. During the year the Remuneration
Committee selected a new list, made up of companies within
the FTSE Automobiles and Parts (Europe) sector. A list of the
comparator companies is available on request from the
Company Secretary.
This list of companies is monitored on behalf of the Company
by an independent third party. This list was applied to the
awards made to Mr Vareille and Mr Cotton in July 2005 and
will be applied to any awards made to them in financial year
2006/07, and the criteria will be kept under review by the
Remuneration Committee.

An executive may only participate in the EC-IP if for the year
in question, he has satisfied the performance conditions
required for the award of a cash bonus as set by the
Remuneration Committee.
As a result of feedback received from shareholders in 2004,
following the introduction of new executive approved and
unapproved share option schemes, in 2005 the
Remuneration Committee conducted a review of the award
of matching shares under the EC-IP . In previous years, the
matching shares awarded by the Company had not been
subject to performance criteria. The Remuneration
Committee is mindful of the fact that one of the purposes of
the scheme is to encourage executives to invest in the
shares of the Company by agreeing to use cash bonus
awarded in the year to purchase shares. The cash bonus
awards have already been subject to performance criteria. 
The Remuneration Committee is also mindful of the fact that,
since the arrival of the Chief Executive in May 2004, his
executive team has been completely changed and there
have been further changes made following the acquisition of
Oxford Automotive ApS on 7 April 2006, and that those
executives should be encouraged to build up a shareholding
in the Company.
The Wagon 2000 Executive Co-Investment Plan (“EC-IP”)
Under the EC-IP selected senior executives may elect to
commute a proportion of up to 50% of their annual
performance related cash bonus, net of payroll taxes, in the
acquisition of shares in the Company known as “bonus
award” shares.
If the executive remains with the Group for a period of three
years and retains the bonus award shares during this period
(or four years in the case of French executives), the executive
will be awarded a number of additional shares known as
“matching shares”. The number of matching shares which
will be awarded is the gross equivalent of the bonus initially
applied to acquire bonus award shares, divided by the 
market value prevailing when the bonus award shares were
acquired. The number of matching shares which will be
awarded will be reduced in direct proportion to the proportion
of bonus award shares sold or otherwise disposed of by the
participant before the end of the three year period. In the
event of a change in control of the Company the Trustee of
the EC-IP may transfer to the participants such proportion 
of the matching shares as the Trustee determines. 
In light of certain changes to French tax laws, in June 2005
the rules were amended such that for any award to an
executive who is tax resident in France the executive must
remain with the Group for a period of four years and retain
the bonus award shares during this period in order to become
entitled to the matching shares.

Nevertheless, the Remuneration Committee has decided 
that it is in the interests of shareholders for there to be a re-
balancing of the award of shares that are not subject to
performance criteria. Therefore for awards made in 2005 
and 2006, the Remuneration Committee has decided that in
matching the shares purchased by individuals, half of those
matching shares will be granted without performance criteria
applying. The remaining 50% matching shares will vest 
only if the average annual percentage growth in EPS exceeds
the average annual percentage growth in RPI by at least 3%
over the three year vesting period.
The Remuneration Committee applied this policy for the
financial year 2005/06 and proposes to apply it for the
financial year 2006/07, although it will be reviewed during 
the coming year.
Executive Share Option Schemes (ESOS)
Options issued under these schemes may be exercised
between three and ten years after the date granted, but 
only if a predetermined performance criterion is satisfied. 
The criterion requires that growth in the Company’s adjusted
earnings per share over the three financial years commencing
with the start of the year in which the grant occurs exceeds
the percentage growth in RPIx over that same period. 
The actual growth results in the following percentage of 
the original share options granted becoming exercisable:
If the growth equals or exceeds 12% all the options will vest.
If the growth exceeds 9% but is less than 12%, the
percentage of shares which will vest will be determined 
on a straight line basis between 51% and 99%.
If the growth equals 9%, half the options will vest.
If the growth is less than 9% no options will vest.
For the purposes of the schemes, adjusted earnings per
share means in relation to any year, the underlying earnings
per share as published in the Company’s annual report and
financial statements. RPIx means the general index of retail
prices (for all items excluding mortgage interest) published 
by the Central Statistical Office of the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer.
The rules of the executive share option schemes do not allow
for options to be granted at a discount to the market price at
the date of grant. In the event of a change in control of the
Company, both scheme rules allow for the exercise of a
proportion of the options, corresponding to the proportion 
of the performance period as has elapsed at the time when
control passes (or such other proportion as the Remuneration
Committee determines), within six months of such change 
of control.
Share options
The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved Save As
Y ou Earn share scheme for UK-based employees who have,
at the time an invitation to participate is made, completed one
or more years’ service. Under this scheme, options may, at
the Company’s discretion, be granted to acquire ordinary
shares in the Company at a discount of up to 20% of the
market price of the Company’s shares at the date of invitation
to participants who have contracted to save up to a maximum
of £250 per month over a period of three or five years.There
have been no grants under the scheme since January 2005.
Mr Cotton would be eligible to participate in future grants
under this scheme. Directors’ share options

Executive Directors’ Service Contracts
The policy for executive service contracts is that notice periods
will normally not exceed 12 months. Mr Vareille and Mr Cotton
each has a rolling contract with a notice period of twelve
months from either party.
The Committee’s policy in relation to termination of service
agreements is to apply an appropriate level of mitigation,
having regard to all of the circumstances of the individual 
and the termination of employment, and to any legal 
advice received.
Non-Executive Directors
The appointment of Non-Executive Directors is for a fixed 
term of three years. It is terminable on three months notice 
by either party. The Non-Executive Directors do not have
service contracts and do not participate in any Company
pension, share or incentive schemes. The Board has reviewed
its standard appointment letter for Non-Executive Directors in
line with Code recommendations, such that these are in place
for re-elected Directors and any future appointments. The
current letters of appointment for all Non-Executive Directors
will be available for inspection at each Annual General Meeting
and during normal business hours at the Company’s
Registered Office. Fees for Non-Executive Directors are
approved by the Board and are based on a standard fee with
additional fees payable for the chairing of the Audit and
Remuneration Committees.
Pensions 
As mentioned earlier, Mr Vareille receives a supplementary
salary of 30% of his basic salary in lieu of any Company pension
contributions as he remains within the French social security
system. Accordingly the Company makes no pension provision
for him.
Mr Cotton is entitled to the equivalent of 25% of salary by way
of employer’s pension contribution provided that Mr Cotton
contributes 5% of his salary and that the contributions are 
put into an appropriate pensions vehicle. On 9 May 2006 
the Company made a contribution of £41,786 for the period 
to 31 March 2006.
Outside appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to accept one appropriate
non-executive Directorship offered by listed companies and
other organisations, which provide industry experience or
public service. Such outside appointment is subject to prior
Board approval, taking into account existing duties and
potential conflicts of interest. Neither of the Executive
Directors have any such outside appointment at present.
Directors’ interests
The Directors in office at 31 March 2006 had the interests
detailed below (as shown in the register maintained under
section 325 of the Companies Act 1985) in Group companies,
being solely shares in Wagon plc. No changes have taken place
in the Directors’ shareholdings and options between 31 March
2006 and 8 June 2006.

(Outgoing) (Incoming)
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
8 June 2006 Corporate Governance
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s
decision only and which includes group strategy, acquisitions
and disposals, annual and interim results, dividend policy, the
annual budget, requests for major capital expenditure and 
other significant financial matters including material treasury
and investment decisions and risk management policy. This
process is undertaken following discussions in conjunction
with the Chief Executive who, through the Executive
Committee (which assists the Chief Executive in exercising 
the powers delegated to him by the Board) is responsible for
the implementation of agreed strategy, the day to day conduct
of the Group’s operations and for reporting to the Board on the
progress being made in meeting the Company’s objectives. 
The Board had six scheduled meetings in the year, although 
the total number of meetings was thirteen, given the
acquisition of Oxford Automotive ApS which was completed
on 7 April 2006. All Directors attended all Board meetings
(during their term of office), save that Mr Wright and Mr
Rennocks gave their apologies for two Board Meetings and 
Mr Kendall gave his apologies for one Board meeting. 
All Directors were in attendance at Committee Meetings; 
Audit 4
Nominations 4
Remuneration 4
save that Mr Kendall was unable to attend one Audit
Committee meeting and one Nomination Committee meeting
(where the subject matter was Chairman Succession). All
directors were consulted about the business being discussed
at meetings where they were unable to attend, and they all
approved the outcome of the meetings.
A comprehensive file of briefing papers and a meeting agenda
is provided for each Director, normally five days prior to each
meeting, and Directors are able to seek further clarification on
any matter from management whenever deemed necessary.
Decisions are taken by the Board in conjunction with the
recommendations of its Committees and advice from external
consultants and executive management, where this is
appropriate. The main Committees to which the Board
delegates its responsibilities and provides sufficient resources
with which to carry out their duties, are the Executive, Audit,
Remuneration and Nominations Committees, all of whose
terms of reference are determined by the Board, documented
and available on the Company’s web site or on request from
the Company Secretary. Only members of the Committees
have a right to attend meetings although others are invited to
attend as appropriate to the business being conducted. Full
details of each Committee’s activities appear later in this report.
The Company purchases appropriate liability insurance in
respect of any legal action which may be brought against the
Company or its Directors. 
At least annually the Chairman meets with the Non-Executive
Directors without the Executive Directors present. The Non-
Executive Directors led by the Senior Independent Director
have met to discuss the performance of the Chairman.
Compliance with the Combined Code 
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for
good governance and the information and statements below
describe how the Company applies the main and supporting
principles, and complies with the detailed provisions identified
in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in 
July 2003 (the “Code”).
The Company applies the principles of the Code by adopting
relevant recommendations and best practice from recognised
governance reports and organisations, by developing 
and documenting formal Board governance policies 
and procedures, and by monitoring developments and 
best practice.
Throughout the year under review, the Board considers that 
the Company has complied with the provisions recommended
in Section 1 of the Combined Code, save that: 
– The division of responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief
Executive were not formally set out in writing during the
financial year. The Board is firmly of the view that at all times
the respective roles and responsibilities were clearly
understood by both individuals, and by the Board as a whole. 
– The former Chairman was a member of both the
Remuneration and Audit Committees until his resignation 
on 28 July 2005. This arrangement ceased upon the
appointment of Mr Clark as Chairman of the Company 
on 28 July 2005, as he was not appointed a member of 
either Committee.
– A formal policy for the engagement of the auditors for non-
audit services was not formally set out in writing during the
financial year but a policy has subsequently been approved
and implemented by the Audit Committee.
– As part of the review of its Standards of Business Conduct
Policy, the Group will introduce a method by which
employees can raise any concerns regarding financial
reporting with the Audit Committee.
Directors
The Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the success of the
Company and responsible to shareholders for the effective 
and proper management and control of the Company. It is the
Board’s role to provide leadership within a framework of
effective controls that enables risk to be appropriately
assessed and managed. The Board determines and reviews
strategy and policy, sets the Company’s values and standards
and ensures the right financial and human resources are in
place to meet the Company’s objectives. The Board also
continually reviews management performance. All Directors
act in the best interests of the Company, are aware of their
obligations to shareholders and recognise the interests of 
other stakeholders. W agon plc 
Annual Report &
Accounts 2006

Chairman and Chief Executive
The Board’s policy is that the roles of Chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive of the Company should be split, and that
the role of the Chairman should be non-executive.
Whilst collectively they are responsible for the leadership of 
the Company, the Chairman’s primary responsibility is for
leading the Board and ensuring its effectiveness and the Chief
Executive is responsible for running the Company’s business.
Board balance and independence
The Board comprises two Executive Directors:
Mr Vareille, Chief Executive.
Mr Cotton, Group Finance Director 
(appointed 18 April 2005).
and seven Non-Executive Directors:
Mr Clark, Chairman of the Board and of the Nominations
Committee (appointed 28 July 2005).
Mr Guillaume, Non-Executive Director (appointed 
7 April 2006).
Mr Kalyandjian, independent Non-Executive Director
(appointed 7 April 2006) and Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee from 1 June 2006.
Ms Lyons, independent Non-Executive Director and Chairman
of the Remuneration Committee until 1 June 2006.
Mr Rennocks, Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
and Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Mr Ross, Non-Executive Director (appointed 7 April 2006).
Mr Zimmermann, independent Non-Executive Director
(appointed 7 April 2006).
Biographies of the current Directors are shown on pages 
20 to 21 .
There were two retirements from the Board during the year:
Mr Kendall, Chairman of the Board and of the Nominations
Committee (retired 28 July 2005).
Mr Wright, independent Non-Executive Director 
(retired 13 March 2006).
Throughout the year ended 31 March 2006, and at the date of
this report, at least half the Board, not counting the Chairman,
was made up of independent Directors as defined by the Code.
The Non-Executive Directors bring to the Board external
experience in a range of areas important to the Group and
assist the Board in its decision-making, constructively
challenging strategy and specific proposals.
The Board is satisfied that its composition ensures that no
individual or group of individuals dominate the decision-making
process. Throughout the year under review, given the then
small membership of the Board, and with the exception of the
Chairman post 28 July 2005, all Non-Executive Directors were
members of the Remuneration and Audit Committees. The
Board believes that shareholders’ interests were served and
corporate governance was in fact strengthened through the
resultant good flow of information to all Board members which
helped ensure that no undue influence could be exerted by any
one Director.
Upon the completion of the acquisition of Oxford Automotive
ApS on 7 April 2006 the Company appointed four new Non-
Executive Directors, bringing the total number of Non-
Executive Directors to seven. At that time a review of the
composition of the Committees was undertaken and details of
the existing composition of each Committee are provided on
pages 38 to 41.
Appointments to the Board
There is a formal, rigorous and, transparent procedure for 
the appointment of new Directors to the Board based on 
merit, using objective criteria and conducted by the
Nominations Committee which, when appropriate, makes
recommendations to the Board. Details of this process and 
the workings of the Nominations Committee can be found 
later in this report.
Information and professional development
The Chairman ensures Directors receive accurate, timely and
clear information with all papers for meetings of the Board and
its Committees issued in advance by the Company Secretary
who is responsible for good information flows within the Board
and its Committees, and between Non-Executive Directors 
and management.
All newly appointed Directors and senior management are
given a comprehensive introduction to the Group’s businesses
including visits to the Group’s manufacturing facilities and
meetings with other senior management. In addition, Directors
are given a detailed briefing pack containing group information
based on best practice guidelines. 
On request any newly appointed Non-Executive Director will
meet with major shareholders. 
All Directors are advised that they have access to the advice
and services of the Company Secretary who advises on all
governance matters and ensures Board procedures are
complied with. In addition, Directors are entitled to seek
independent professional advice in the furtherance of their
duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense. The
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a
matter for the Board as a whole. Corporate Governance

Executive’s remuneration proposals for the members of the
Executive Committee and those members of the Company

notes the salary and benefits of individual managers whose
salary is in excess of £50,000 per annum. The Committee met
four times during the year. The Board’s report to shareholders

complies with its provisions in relation to remuneration and on
how Directors are remunerated, together with details of
individual Directors’ remuneration in accordance with Schedule
7A to the Companies Act 1985, is shown on pages 29 to 35.
Nominations Committee 
During the year the Nominations Committee comprised 
all of the Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman of the
Board. The Chairman of the Board chairs the Committee save
in the circumstances of the selection of his own successor,
when the Committee would be chaired by the Senior
Independent Director. With effect from 7 April 2006, the date 
at which the Company appointed four new Non-Executive
Directors, the Nomination Committee comprises a majority 
of independent Non-Executive Directors, and consists of 
Mr Clark (as Chairman), Mr Ross, Mr Kalyandjian, Ms Lyons, 
Mr Rennocks and Mr Zimmermann.
The Committee met four times during the year. The
Committee is responsible for maintaining the balance and
effectiveness of the Board. Its remit is to review the Board
structure, particularly in relation to the diversity of skills,
experience, age and term of office and it seeks to ensure that
both Executive and Non-Executive Directors have the
necessary skills and attributes for the future success of the
Group. The Chairman of the Company, rather than the
Nominations Committee, takes responsibility for considering
the performance of any Director retiring and offering himself
for re-election before making a recommendation to the Board
on whether that person should put their name forward for re-
election by shareholders.
Any proposed appointment commences with an evaluation 
by the Nominations Committee of the balance of skills,
knowledge and experience on the Board and, in conjunction
with experienced external search consultants, a description 
of the role and responsibilities for the proposed appointment 
is then prepared. The appointed external consultant will then
prepare a shortlist of potential candidates in consultation with
the Chairman and Chief Executive. Following meetings with
candidates and the Chairman and other Directors, the
Nominations Committee then formally meets in order to
ensure that the views of the Executive Directors are taken into
account before finalising any recommendation regarding an
appointment to the Board. In the case of non-executive
appointments, any appointees are required to confirm that 
they have sufficient time to devote to the position. 
The Committee followed this process for the appointment of
the Group Finance Director on 18 April 2005 and the Chairman
(when the Committee was led by Mr Rennocks as Senior
Independent Director) on 28 July 2005.
The Board believes that the Directors possess a wealth of
diverse business skills and experience, and are consequently
best placed to identify their own training requirements.
However, they are encouraged to attend relevant courses upon
joining the board and, where appropriate, at regular intervals
thereafter and the Company makes the necessary resources
available for any such development needs. 
Performance evaluation
The Board conducted a formal appraisal of its performance and
that of its Committees and individual Directors during the year.
This process took the form of a questionnaire sent to each
director, with the responses and consequential Board report 
as prepared by the Company Secretary being reviewed by the
Board. Areas identified for development, including succession
planning and training, will be addressed in the current year.
Election and Re-election
The Company’s articles of association, which were adopted 
by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting held 
on 6 April 2006, require that all Directors who have been
appointed by the Board since the previous Annual General
Meeting or who have held office for three years or more shall
retire from office but shall be eligible for re-appointment. 
Mr Clark was appointed Chairman and Non-Executive Director
on 28 July 2005 and accordingly retires and offers himself for
election by shareholders at the AGM to be held on 21 July
2006. Biographical details of Mr Clark can be found on page 20.
Messrs Guillaume, Kalyandjian, Ross and Zimmermann were
elected by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting
held on 6 April 2006 and accordingly are not required to stand
down and offer themselves for election or re-election at the
AGM.
Committees of the Board 
The Board has four Committees, Remuneration, Audit,
Nominations and Executive. The duties of the Committees 
are set out in formal terms of reference and are available on
request from the Company Secretary and are also on the
Company’s website.
Remuneration Committee
During the year under review the Committee consisted 
of the Chairman of the Board (until 28 July 2005) and the 
Non-Executive Directors. It was chaired during the year by 
Ms Lyons. With effect from 1 June 2006 the Chairman of the
Committee was Mr Kalyandjian. With effect from 7 April 2006,
the date at which the Company appointed four new Non-
Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee comprises
solely independent Non-Executive Directors, and consists 
of Mr Kalyandjian (Chairman), Ms Lyons, Mr Rennocks and 
Mr Zimmermann.
The principal function of the Committee is to determine and
agree with the Board a framework or broad policy for the
remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman, and
within that agreed framework, to set the remuneration of all
Executive Directors and the Chairman. It also ratifies the Chief  W agon plc

Upon completion of the acquisition of Oxford Automotive ApS
on 7 April 2006 changes were made to the composition of the
Committee. The titles and profiles of the current members of
the Executive Committee and the Company Secretary are set
out on pages 22 to 23.
The Executive Committee is chaired by Mr Vareille. The
principal function of the Executive Committee is to assist the
Chief Executive in the performance of his duties including: 
the development and implementation of strategy, operational
plans, policies, procedures and budgets; the monitoring of
operating and financial performance; the assessment of control
of risk; and the prioritisation and allocation of resources and in
particular the approval of capital expenditure.
The Committee meets each month (with the exception of
August) and also holds weekly telephone business reviews.
Internal Control
Philosophy and policy
The objective of the Directors and senior management is to
safeguard and increase the value of shareholders’ investment
and the business and assets of the Group. Part of this objective
requires the development of relevant policies and appropriate
internal controls to ensure proper management of the Group’s
resources and the identification of risks which might serve to
undermine them.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. However, 
it is recognised that a system of internal control is designed to
manage, rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives and can provide only reasonable, not
absolute assurance, particularly against misstatement or loss.
The Chief Executive, in conjunction with the Executive
Committee and certain other senior executives and external
advisers therefore periodically review the suitability of current
systems of internal control and reports their findings to the
Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s findings to ensure
the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes implemented
by executive and senior management. Such reviews are
conducted through discussions held with executives and
consideration of reports that have been submitted. These
findings are in turn discussed by the full Board. The Board is
satisfied that this process accords with the internal control
guidance for Directors set out in the ICAEW T urnbull guidance
and that through its interface with management, the Board is
aware of all the major risks facing the Group and the steps
taken by the Group where possible to mitigate such risks.
Structures
Plant managers and financial controllers are responsible for
managing the business risks within their facility. Each year they
are asked to complete a letter of assurance, confirming
compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures and risk
management processes. 
Risk profiling
There is an ongoing process to identify and evaluate risks 
faced by the Group, through the conduct of risk workshops
throughout the Group. This is led by Business Group Directors
and involves the Executive Committee and certain other senior
executives. Findings from the workshops are reported to the
Audit Committee together with recommended action and a
timetable for implementation. A list of prioritised risks is
refreshed to reflect changes to the business including those
arising from new acquisitions. The list, along with other
management information, is used to develop an overall
assurance plan for the Group. It is reviewed on a regular basis
by both the Board, and the Executive Committee. At Business
Group level, the Business Group Directors conduct their own
divisional risk assessments. 
Controlling risk
The Group has a number of policies and procedures which
provide guidance and instruction to management in respect 
of key business, commercial, financial and operational risks.
These are issued to all of the Business Groups within 
the Group.  Corporate Governance
Continued
Audit Committee and Auditors
Audit Committee
Until 28 July 2005, the Audit Committee comprised the three
independent Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman of 
the Board. Mr Clark did not become a member of the Audit
Committee on his appointment as Chairman of the Company,
although he has a standing invitation to attend all meetings.
With effect from 7 April 2006, the date at which the Company
appointed four new Non-Executive Directors, the Audit
Committee comprises solely independent Non-Executive
Directors, and consists of Mr Rennocks (as Chairman), 
Mr Kalyandjian, Ms Lyons and Mr Zimmermann.
Mr Rennocks FCA, is the Chairman of the Committee and 
the Board is satisfied that he has recent and relevant financial
experience. The Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director and other senior executives regularly attend the
Committee meetings by invitation. The Committee also 
meets with the auditors without management being present.
The Committee met three times during the year to discharge
its responsibilities, (as set out in its terms of reference). In so
discharging its responsibilities, the Committee:
– Monitors the integrity of the financial statements and any
formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial
performance, reviewing significant financial judgements;
– Reviews the Company’s internal financial controls and
internal control and risk management systems;
– Monitors and reviews the Company’s requirements for 
an internal audit function;
– Makes recommendations to the Board in regard to the
appointment, re-appointment or removal of the external
auditors, the terms of engagement and remuneration and
maintaining an appropriate relationship with them;
– Reviews and monitors the external auditors’ independence
and objectivity, and the effectiveness of the audit process;
– Develops and implements the Company’s policy on the
engagement of the external auditor in the supply of 
non-audit services.
The Committee is planning to review the existing
arrangements by which all employees may, in confidence, 
raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of
financial reporting or other matters.
Monitoring and managing the status of residual risk
The Group carries out a programme of internal audits 
and management self-assessments over the status of 
residual risks.
The actions arising from internal and external audits are
consolidated and the results of the audits are reported to
the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee assesses the
findings and proposed actions for addressing residual risks. 
In addition, action points are reviewed during the regular
business review meetings. 
Internal controls
The Group has a comprehensive system for the regular
monitoring and reporting of the financial performance of each
Business Group and plant and for assessing the adequacy of
the Group’s systems of internal controls. Detailed budgets are
prepared at plant, Business Group, and shared service function
level and, following review by the Group’s Executive
Committee, are formally reviewed and adopted by the Board.
Budgets and targets are regularly updated via a rolling monthly
and quarterly forecasting process and variances from the
targets and budgets are discussed with operational and
commercial management.
The internal controls of each plant are also evaluated through
the review of completed questionnaires. Each plant manager
and financial controller is asked to confirm in writing that 
they have complied with the Group’s policy on internal 
financial control.
These internal controls are supported by focused auditing of
specific operations or functions, as determined by the Audit
Committee at the beginning of each financial year. The audits
have been conducted with the advice and assistance of
Deloitte who have facilitated the development of the annual
programme, assisted with its implementation and reported 
to the Committee at least twice each year on the findings and
their recommendations. Following a review of the operation 
of internal audit, an internal audit department was created in
February 2006. 
The Board confirms that it has reviewed the effectiveness of
the system of internal controls for the year ended 31 March
2006 and that this review covered all material controls including
financial, operational and compliance controls and risk
management systems.  W agon plc 
Annual Report &
Accounts 2006
40/41
During Audit Committee meetings at which the auditors are
present, the activities of both internal audit (as carried out by
Deloitte until the recruitment of an internal audit function in
February 2006), and the external auditors are reviewed. This
includes the approval of internal audit plans, and the scope of
work to be undertaken by the external auditors. Written reports
containing summaries of significant findings are reviewed and
action plans agreed where necessary.
During the year under review the Committee had not adopted 
a formal policy for the engagement of external advisers for 
non-audit services which includes certain services which the
auditors are prohibited from providing. However, the
Committee did have a general policy of not engaging the
Groups’ auditors, KPMG Audit plc for work other than audit
work, without its knowledge and consent. This included a
review of the suitability of KPMG to carry out work in
connection with the acquisition of Oxford Automotive ApS.
Subsequent to the year end, a formal policy has been approved
and implemented by the Committee. The Committee also
reviews annually any non-audit services provided by the
auditors and their cost which is disclosed in note 2 to the
accounts on page 56 and obtains written confirmation from the
auditors that they remain independent.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with Institutional Shareholders
Principally via the Executive Directors, the Company seeks 
to build on a mutual understanding of objectives with its
institutional shareholders through regular meetings and
presentations following the preliminary and interim
announcements. Institutional shareholders would be given the
opportunity to meet with a new Non-Executive Director should
any shareholders so request. The views of key analysts and
shareholders are communicated back to the Board directly by
the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director and via
reports from the Company’s broker, thus ensuring all members
of the Board develop a good understanding of the views of
major shareholders. The Senior Independent Director is
available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact
through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or
Group Finance Director have failed to resolve or for which such
contact is inappropriate. Corporate information including the
Annual Report and other financial presentations and
announcements are available on the Company’s website
www.wagonautomotive.com.
Constructive use of the AGM
The Board welcomes the attendance of shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting and confirms that the Company
complies with all Code provisions relating to constructive use
of the AGM. In addition to meeting its obligations to
shareholders, the Board recognises that it has a responsibility
to the Group’s customers, employees and suppliers and the
communities in which it operates and invests.

8 June 2006 Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group and 
of the profit or loss for the period. In preparing those
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the accounts
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and enable them to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities. W agon plc

Independent Auditors’ Report 
to the Members of Wagon plc 
Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the annual 
report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
financial statements. We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test 
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made
by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
• the group financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state
of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2006 and of its profit for
the year then ended; 
• the parent company financial statements give a true and 
fair view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the parent company’s
affairs as at 31 March 2006; 
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and,
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent
with the financial statements. 
KPMG Audit Plc

Birmingham 
8 June 2006 
We have audited the group and parent company financial
statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of Wagon plc for the
year ended 31 March 2006 which comprise the Group Income
Statement, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets,
the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group Statement of
Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes. These
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in
the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having
been audited. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other
purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report
and the group financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing the parent
company financial statements and the Directors’
Remuneration Report in accordance with applicable law and
UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities on page 42. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to
you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.
The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that
specific information presented in the Chief Executives Review,
Business Group Review and Financial Review that is cross
referenced from the Business Review section of the Directors’
Report. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of
the 2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report
if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Consolidated Income Statement

b) Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling,
rounded to the nearest 0. 1 million. The financial statements
are prepared on the historical cost basis except that
derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of
policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
income and expenses. The estimates and associated
assumptions are based on historical experience and various
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form a basis of making
the judgements about carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on a regular basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised 
if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of
revision and future periods if the revision affects both
current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of
IFRS that have significant effect on the financial statements
are limited to the estimates used to calculate the value in
use of various assets within impairment reviews and
recognition of deferred tax assets.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied
consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated
financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS
balance sheet at 1 April 2004 for the purposes of transition
to adopted IFRS except as otherwise noted.
c) Review of accounting policy
Following the publication of the IFRS restatement the
accounting policy for tooling has been reviewed, resulting in
a change in the comparative figures for the year ended 31
March 2005 and the transitional balance sheet at 1 April 2004.
The adjustment from Previous GAAP arises because under
IFRS the rules regarding offsetting assets with liabilities 
and income with expenditure are more defined. No items
must be offset unless required or permitted by a standard.
This affects the reporting of the Group’s tooling balances 
for which income has been received in advance. Under
Previous GAAP the related assets and liabilities of profitable
tooling projects were reported net within stock after
completion of the project. The profit was then released 
over the life of the project through cost of sales.
Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the year ended 31 March 2006
Significant accounting policies
Wagon plc (“the Company”) is a company domiciled in the UK.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the
year ended 31 March 2006 comprise the Company and its
subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
a) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and
adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRS”). These
are the Group’s first financial statements under adopted
IFRS and IFRS 1 “First-time adoption of international
financial reporting standards” has been applied. The
Company has elected to remain under UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Policies (“GAAP”) and as such all the
information provided in these financial statements relating
to the Company are prepared under UK GAAP . Therefore 
a separate section on the Company financial statements 
can be found from page 89. Information in the financial
statements from this page until page 88 relate to the Group.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has adopted IAS 32
“Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation”
and IAS 39 ”Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement” prospectively from 1 April 2005.
Consequently comparative information for the year 
ended 31 March 2005 has been prepared in accordance
with IFRS with the exception that Financial Instruments
have been accounted for under UK GAAP .
The adoption of IAS 32 has increased borrowings by £14.0
million representing the liability element of the preference
shares. Capital and reserves have also reduced by this value,
with the £2.0 million preference share capital also being
transferred from issued capital to reserves.
The adoption of IAS 39 resulted in the fair value of the Group’ s
derivative instruments, previously only disclosed in a note to
the financial statements, being included in the balance sheet
at 1 April 2005 under the new headings of financial assets and
financial liabilities. This increased the total current assets by
£2.3 million and increased the total current liabilities by £3.2
million. The net figure of £0.9 million resulted in a reduction to
reserves. Since 1 April 2005 the fair values of the derivative
instruments have changed to the values held in the balance
sheet at 31 March 2006 of £1.1 million in financial assets and
£2.2 million in financial liabilities.
As permitted by the transitional rules in the standard the
Group has adopted IAS 19 (revised), issued in December
2004, early. Accordingly the requirements of the standard
have been applied from 1 April 2004. W agon plc 
Annual Report &
Accounts 2006
48/49
On adoption of IFRS, and after publication of the IFRS
restatement document, the balances have been grossed 
up with the asset transferred to property, plant and
equipment and the liability transferred to deferred income.
Both the balances are then to be amortised over the life 
of the related projects, with the income being reported
through turnover and the property, plant and equipment
depreciation reported through cost of sales.
This change has resulted in a £26.7 million increase to
property, plant and equipment; a £10.3 million reduction
to stock and a £16.4 million increase in other payables at 
31 March 2004. The related changes at 31 March 2005 are
a £27.2 million increase to property, plant and equipment;
a £11.0 million reduction to stock and a £16.2 million
increase in other payables.
T urnover in the year to 31 March 2005 also increased by
£4.9 million as a result of this adjustment with a related 
£5.2 million increase in cost of sales and £0.3 million
reduction in administrative expenses. These changes are
reflected in the IFRS reconciliations contained in note 28.
d) Basis of consolidation
i) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the
financial statements of Wagon plc (the Company) and
subsidiaries controlled by the Group. Control exists when
the Company has direct or indirect power to govern the
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain
economic benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are
included in the consolidated financial statements from the
date that control transfers to the Group until the date that
control ceases.
ii) T ransactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses 
or income and expenses arising from intragroup 
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated
financial statements.
e) Foreign currencies
T ransactions denominated in foreign currencies are
translated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet
date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognised in the income statement.
On consolidation, the balance sheets of overseas entities
are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at
the balance sheet date. Income statements and cash flows
of overseas entities are translated into sterling at the
average exchange rate for the period where this rate
approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the
dates of the transactions. Gains or losses arising from the
translation of overseas entities are recognised in the
translation reserve. In accordance with the transitional
provisions of IFRS 1 exchange differences that arose prior
to 1 April 2004 are eliminated within the opening retained
earnings reserve at that date.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net
investment in foreign operations, and of related hedges, are
taken to the translation reserve. They are released into the
income statement upon disposal. 
f) Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge 
its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks
arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not
hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes. However from 1 April 2005 fair value movements
on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognised through the income statement.
From 1 April 2005 derivatives are initially recognised at 
fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and
subsequently re-measured in future periods at their fair
value. The method of recognising the resulting change in 
fair value is dependant on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated
amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate
the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account
current interest rates and other creditworthiness of the
swap counterparties. The fair value of forward exchange
contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet
date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Fair value movements in derivatives are recognised in the
income statement unless a hedge relationship exists.
In the comparative period all financial assets and financial
liabilities were carried at cost (amortised as appropriate)
less, in the case of financial assets, provision for any
permanent diminution in value. Gains and losses on 
forward foreign exchange contracts treated as hedging
instruments were not recognised in the income statement.
On recognition of the hedged transaction the unrecognised
gains and losses arising on the instrument were recognised,
either in the income statement or combined into the
carrying value of the associated asset or liability. Interest
differentials arising from interest rate swaps were
recognised by adjusting net interest payable or receivable
over the period of the contract.
g) Hedging
Cash flow hedges
From 1 April 2005 where a derivative financial instrument is
designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a
recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecasted
transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the
derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in
equity. When the forecasted transaction subsequently
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-
financial liability, or a forecast transaction for a non-financial
asset or non-financial liability occurs, the associated
cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included
in the income statement in the period in which the asset
acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss (i.e. in
periods when the depreciation expense or cost of sales 
is recognised). Notes to the Financial Statements Continued
for the year ended 31 March 2006
If a hedge of a forecasted transaction subsequently results
in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the
associated gains and losses that were recognised directly 
in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period
or periods during which the asset acquired or liability
assumed affects profit or loss (i.e. when interest income 
or expense is recognised).
For cash flow hedges other than those covered by the
preceding two paragraphs, the associated cumulative 
gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the
income statement in the same period or periods during
which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or 
loss. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge
relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point
remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the
above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged
transaction is no longer expected to take place, the
cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity 
is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge of net investment
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used
to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is
determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly
in equity in the translation reserve. The ineffective portion
is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Prior to 1 April 2005 hedge accounting was not applied
because the value of derivative financial instruments 
was held off balance sheet in accordance with Previous
GAAP . See note 28 on transition to adopted IFRS for 
more information.
h) Property, plant and equipment
i) Owned assets
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1
to retain the book value of freehold land and buildings as
deemed cost, therefore items of property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost as deemed cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (see
accounting policy on impairment).
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment
have different useful lives, they are accounted for
separately.
ii) Leased assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially
all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
finance leases. The owner-occupied property acquired by
way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the
lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum
lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated
depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (see
accounting policy on impairment). Lease payments are
accounted for as described in the accounting policy on
expenses. Property held under operating leases that would
otherwise meet the definition of investment property may
be classified as investment property on a property-by-
property basis and would then be valued using the fair 
value model.
iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates
calculated to write off the cost or valuation less estimated
residual value of each asset over its expected useful life 
as follows:
Freehold buildings – over expected economic life
not exceeding 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings – over the period of the lease
Plant and other equipment – 3 to 20 years
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or on assets 
in the course of construction. The residual value, if not
insignificant, and the useful economic life of the assets 
are reassessed annually.
i) Goodwill and other intangible assets
i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the
purchase method. Goodwill arising on acquisitions that have
occurred since 1 April 2004 represents the difference
between the fair value of the purchase consideration and
the fair value of the identifiable net assets and contingencies
of an acquired entity. Consideration includes attributable
costs of the acquisition. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1
April 2004 goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed
cost, which represents the amount recorded under Previous
GAAP . This is in accordance with the transitional provisions
of IFRS 1.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses in the consolidated balance sheet and is subject to an
annual impairment review.
ii) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the
prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge
and understanding, is recognised in the income statement
as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research
findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of
new or substantially improved products and processes, is
capitalised if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient
resources to complete development. The expenditure
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and
an appropriate proportion of overheads. Other development
expenditure is recognised in the income statement as
incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at
cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses
(see accounting policy on impairment).
iii) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill
and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are W agon plc 
Annual Report &
Accounts 2006
50/51
systematically tested for impairment annually. The
amortisation period of assets with definite useful life 
are as follows:
Software – 3 years
Development – expected life of project,
expenditure between three and seven
years
j) Investments
Investments are classified as financial instruments and
those held by the Group are classified as being available-
for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain 
or loss being recognised directly in equity, except for
impairment losses, which are recognised in accordance
with the policy on impairment. When these investments
are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously
recognised directly in equity is recognised in the 
income statement.
The fair value of financial instruments classified as available-
for-sale investments is their quoted bid price at the balance
sheet date, where available, or the value in use as calculated
using discounted cash flows based on estimated future
income and expense.
Financial instruments classified as available-for-sale
investments are recognised or derecognised by the group
on the date it commits to purchase or sell the investments.
k) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost is calculated using weighted average method 
or a method that approximates weighted average. Such a
method is the first-in-first-out principle and utilisation of
either depends on the country in which the stock is held.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in
progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads
based on normal operating activity. Net realisable value is
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business, less the estimated costs of completion and
selling expenses.
l) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and
deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand 
and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management
strategy are included as a component of cash and cash
equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
m)Impairment
Goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and
intangible assets that are not yet available for use are not
subject to amortisation and are tested for impairment at
each balance sheet date. Assets subject to amortisation and
depreciation are reviewed for impairment at each balance
sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable
amount is calculated as the greater of its net selling price
and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent
cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement
based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds
the recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in
respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-
generating unit (or group of units), and then to reduce the
carrying amount of other assets in the unit (or group of units)
on a pro rata basis.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at 1 April 2004, the date
of transition to IFRS, even though no indication of
impairment existed.
When a decline in fair value of an available-for-sale financial
asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is
objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative
loss that had been recognised directly in equity is
recognised in the income statement even though the
financial asset has not been derecognised. The amount of
cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the
difference between the acquisition cost and current fair
value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset
previously recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at
amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in
recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. An
impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity
instrument classified as available for sale is not reversed
through profit or loss. Similarly an impairment loss in respect
of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets an impairment loss is reversed if
there has been a change in the estimates used to determine
the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the
asset’ s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or
amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
n) Share capital
i) Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments
issues by the Group are treated as equity (i.e. forming part
of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet
the following two conditions:
a) They include no contractual obligations upon the Group to
deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange
financial assets or financial liabilities with another party
under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the
Group; and Notes to the Financial Statements Continued
for the year ended 31 March 2006
b) Where the instrument will, or may be, settled in the
Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-
derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable
number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a
derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging
a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed
number of its own equity instruments.
T o the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds 
of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the
instrument so classified takes the legal form of the
Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these
financial statements for called up share capital and share
premium account exclude amounts in relation to 
those shares.
ii) Preference share capital
From 1 April 2005 preference share capital is accounted for
as a compound financial instrument. The liability component
of the instrument is calculated by discounting the future
cash outflows for the non-discretionary dividend payments
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money. The equity
element is calculated as the residual interest in the assets 
of the Company after deducting all of the related liabilities.
Prior to 1 April 2005 the preference share capital was
accounted for as non-equity shareholders’ funds in line with
Previous GAAP . See note 28 on transition to adopted IFRS
for further information.
iii) Repurchase of share capital
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, 
the amount of the consideration paid, including directly
attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Repurchased shares (if not cancelled) are classified as
treasury shares and presented as a deduction from 
total equity.
iv) Dividends
Dividends on preference share capital are recognised as
a liability and expensed on an accruals basis. In the year 
to 31 March 2006 they are recognised in the income
statement as finance costs as they relate to the liability
element of the share capital. In the year to 31 March 2005
the dividends on preference share capital were reported 
as deductions to equity in line with Previous GAAP .
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the period
in which they are paid, or approved by shareholders in a
general meeting.
o) Employee benefits
i) Defined contribution plans
For defined contribution pension plans operated by the
Group, amounts payable are charged to the income
statement as they fall due.
ii) Defined benefit plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit
pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of
future benefit that employees have earned in return for 
their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is
discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value
of any plan assets (at bid price) is deducted. The liability
discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA
credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating 
to the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation is
performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit
credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in
full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of
Recognised Income and Expense.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1
cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 April 2004 are
presented within the opening retained earnings reserve
at that date. 
Some of the Group’s subsidiaries are also members of 
multi-employer state run schemes. These are accounted 
for as unfunded defined benefit schemes.
iii) Share-based payments
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1,
IFRS 2 ‘Share based payments’ has been applied to share
options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested
at 1 January 2005. Members of the Group’s senior
management team are entitled to participate in the
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) and the Long 
T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP). In addition, employees are able
to participate in the Sharesave scheme.
The fair values of the ESOS and Sharesave schemes at the
date of grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing
model. The fair value of the L TIP scheme is estimated using
a bespoke model that factors in the probabilities of achieving
the T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) performance conditions.
For all schemes the fair value determined at grant date is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period,
based on an estimate of the number of shares that will
eventually vest. Any significant changes in the earnings per
share criteria are considered at each reporting date and the
calculations updated accordingly.
p) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability.
i) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the 
Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring 
plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has 
been announced publicly. Future operating costs are 
not provided for. W agon plc 
Annual Report &
Accounts 2006
52/53
ii) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the
expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a
contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting 
its obligations under the contract.
q) Government grants
Government grants received are recognised in the balance
sheet initially as deferred income when there is reasonable
assurance that it will be received and that the Group will
comply with the conditions attached to it. Grants that
compensate the Group for expenses incurred are
recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis 
in the same periods in which the expenses are incurred.
Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset
are recognised in the income statement on a systematic
basis over the useful life of the asset.
r) T rade receivables and trade payables
T rade receivables and trade payables are stated at their
nominal value less any impairments.
s) Bank and other borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans
are recognised initially at fair value. Such borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost with the difference
between initial fair value and redemption value recognised 
in the income statement over the period to redemption.
t) Revenue
Revenue from manufactured parts and engineering services
is accounted for on delivery of the respective goods and
services. T ooling revenue is recognised on acceptance of
the completed tool by the customer, except where the tools
are to be invoiced over the production life of the vehicle, in
which case the revenue is recognised over such production
life. Revenue from claims income is recognised in the period
in which it is agreed.
u) Rental income
Rental income from investment properties and properties
held under operating leases sublet to third parties is
recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease.
v) Expenses
i) Lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term
of the lease.
Minimum lease payments on assets held under finance
leases are apportioned between the finance charge and the
reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is
allocated to each period during the lease term so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability.
ii) Net financing costs
Interest income and expense is recognised in the income
statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Financial expense
Financial expense comprises interest payable on
borrowings, dividends on preference shares, foreign
exchange losses, losses on hedging instruments that are
recognised in the income statement and financing costs
relating to employee benefits.
Financial income
Financial income represents interest receivable on cash and
cash equivalents, foreign exchange gains, gains on hedging
instruments that are recognised in the income statement
and return on assets held in defined benefit schemes.
w) T axation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is
recognised in the income statement except to the extent
that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in 
which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income
for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to
tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability
method, providing for temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation
purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on
the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the
related tax benefit will be realised.
x) Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that
is engaged in providing products or services (business
segment), or in providing products or services within a
particular economic environment (geographical segment),
which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from
those of other segments.
y) Tooling
As a part of contracts with customers Wagon manufactures
tools for use in specific projects. The customer funds this
manufacture, either wholly or in part, and it is anticipated
that the tool will remain in Wagon’s custody for use in
manufacturing the related component.
When the risks and rewards associated with a tooling
project are principally retained by Wagon, these tooling
costs are capitalised within property, plant and equipment
(as plant and equipment) and once completion has been
agreed with the customer, the profitability of the tooling
contract is assessed and any impairment provision
recognised. The capitalised costs, net of any impairment
provision, are then depreciated over the life of the related
project, which is usually 5 to 8 years. Notes to the Financial Statements Continued
for the year ended 31 March 2006
Contributions received from customers to fund the tooling
projects are recorded as deferred income and credited to
turnover over the life of the related project, which is usually 
5 to 8 years.
1. Segment reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s
business and geographical segments. The primary format,
business segments, is based on the Group’s management and
internal reporting structure.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated
on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly
corporate assets and expenses.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during
the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be
used for more than one period. This includes tangible fixed
asset additions, software additions and capitalised
development cost additions.
Business segments
The Group is split into the automotive and other sectors for
business segment analysis.
Geographical segments
During the year the business operated in two main
geographical areas being the UK and Mainland Europe. In
Europe manufacturing facilities and engineering departments
were located in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium and 
the Czech Republic.
In presenting information on the basis of geographical
segments, segment revenue is based on the geographical
location of the assets generating the revenue. W agon plc

The loss on disposal of operations of £0.8 million relates to the sale or closure of two machine and tool building facilities at a loss 
of £0.5 million and a loss of £0.3 million on the sale of the US engineering consulting business. Of the machine and tool building
facilities the France (Poissy) facility was sold at a loss of £0.3 million and the UK (T ravers Metal Products) facility was closed 
at a loss of £0.2 million. £0.1 million in cash was received for the France machine and tool building facilities and £0.4 million in cash
for the US consulting business. None of the operations had cash at the time.
The loss on disposal of operations of £1.3 million in the prior year related to the sale and termination of two UK manufacturing
plants (Oxford and Redditch) at a loss of £1.0 million and the termination of a machine and tool building facility in mainland Europe
at a loss of £0.3 million (Comas).
The only consideration received in relation to these disposals was £0.3 million in cash received for Redditch. The assets disposed
of at Redditch were stocks of £0.3 million. None of the disposed operations had cash at the time of disposal and there were no
liabilities disposed of.
At Oxford the assets written off were £0.2 million of receivables and £0.2 million of fixed assets. There were no liabilities disposed
of as the business was terminated.
All the assets written off at Comas were receivables and totalled £0.2 million. There were no liabilities disposed of as the business
was terminated.

Amortisation and impairment charge
The amortisation and impairment charge is recognised within administrative costs in the income statement in both years.
Impairment loss
In the previous year to 31 March 2005 the Group made the decision to exit the Hawtal Whiting business completely. Hence the
value of the goodwill in the financial statements in relation to this previously acquired business was considered fully impaired and
an impairment charge of £2.2 million was made.
Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill
The following groups of cash generating units have significant carrying values of goodwill:
2006 2005
£m £m
Ex-YMOS plants 11.7 11.7
Ex-Aries plants 23.1 23.1
FKT 3.4 –
38.2 34.8
The ex-YMOS plants consist of Waldaschaff, a manufacturing plant in Germany, and Fleurus, a manufacturing plant in Belgium.
The ex-Aries plants consist of the French manufacturing plants and Fiano, a manufacturing plant in Italy.
The FKT goodwill relates to the acquisition in the year of FKT GmbH T eknische Produkte. For more information on the acquisition
see note 25.
The impairment tests for each unit are based on value in use calculations. Those calculations use cash flow projections based 
on actual operating results and the three year business plan. Cash flows in perpetuity are then extrapolated based on the 
forecasts for the last year in the three year business plan. A pre-tax discount rate of 10% has been used in discounting the
projected cash flows.
The main key assumption and approach to determining their values is the volume trend on future and current projects. The values
in the calculation have been based on the latest estimations from the OEM and other customers.
The carrying amount of the unit equals its recoverable amount. Any adverse change in assumptions could reduce the recoverable
amount below carrying amount.
Research and development expenditure
The Group charged £5.0 million of research and development cost to the income statement during the year to 31 March 2006
(2005: £6.2 million). Notes to the Financial Statements Continued

anticipated to generate returns from this innovative technology.

Net tax (assets)/liabilities (0.8) (1.0) 7.1 4.6 6.3 3.6
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items:
2006 2005
£m £m
Deductible timing differences (12.0) (13.4)
Tax losses (12.8) (15.8)
(24.8) (29.2)
The tax losses and deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have not
been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available in the relevant
territories against which the Group can utilise the benefit there from. An unrecognised deferred tax asset of £6.6 million (2005:
£9.4 million) is included in respect to the liability on the UK defined benefit scheme further to adoption of IFRS.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in relation to the Group’s investments as the Group controls whether any liability will
be incurred and it is satisfied that none should arise in the foreseeable future.

As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has adopted IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation” prospectively from 1
April 2005. On adoption of the standard £14.0 million was transferred from equity to borrowings representing the liability element
of the preference shares. For further information on the preference shares and rights attributable to them see note 22.
The adoption of IAS 32 also means that the presentation of loans as current or non-current liabilities changes. The classification is
based on repricing date under IFRS, rather than maturity date, as was the case under Previous GAAP . As a result the Group’s
floating rate loans of £34.3 million are classified as current liabilities, because their interest rates are repriced every quarter,
despite the loans maturing during 2009. No restatement of the comparative figure is allowed for this.
The bank overdrafts are contained within cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows for the Group (see note 15)
because they are considered to form an integral part of the Group’s cash management strategy. 16. Borrowings (continued)

administered funds and pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the
projected unit method.
In addition to the DB Plan the Group’s overseas subsidiaries operate pension arrangements appropriate to the circumstances
prevailing within individual countries. These schemes are unfunded multi employer schemes run by the state. The annual actuarial
liability is funded by insurance premiums or provisions made by the subsidiaries concerned. These are accounted for as unfunded
defined benefit schemes.
The Group also operates a defined contribution pension plan. The pension cost charge for the period includes contributions
payable by the Group to the plan and amounted to £0.1 million (2005: £0.1 million).
The movements in the present value of the Group defined benefit schemes obligations are as follows:

The current service cost is recognised in administrative expenses, interest on defined benefit pension plan obligations is
recognised in financial expense and expected return on the DB Plan assets is recognised in financial income.
The cumulative actuarial gains/(losses) recognised in the statement of total recognised income and expenses since 1 April 2004,
the transition date to adopted IFRS, are £5.4 million gains (2005: £0.4 million losses).
The fair value of the DB Plan assets and the return on those assets were as follows:
2006 2005
£m £m
Equities 58.2 54.7
Corporate bonds 44.3 30.2
Cash 0.2 0.4
102.7 85.3
Actual return on DB Plan assets 15.7 7.4
The expected rates of return on the DB Plan assets are determined by reference to relevant indices. The overall expected rate of
return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plan’s investment portfolio.
The major assumptions used by the actuary in this valuation were:
2006 2005
(% p.a) (% p.a)
Inflation 2.9 2.9
Rate of general long-term increase in salaries 3.9 3.9
Rate if increase to pensions in payment 2.8 2.8
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.0 5.4
Expected rate of return on assets, for overall portfolio 6.1 6.6
Also the mortality rates used in the calculations form an assumption on the actuary’s behalf. The assumptions used are:
Mortality before retirement
Men: Standard table AM92 Ultimate
Women: Standard table AF92 Ultimate
Mortality in retirement
Current pensioners: Standard tables PMA92 and PFA92 projected forward to calendar year 2015, allowing for improvements in
mortality in line with the P92 Short Cohort improvement factors, also scaled up by 12.5%.
Future pensioners: Standard tables PMA92 and PFA92 projected forward to calendar year 2025, allowing for improvements in
mortality in line with the P92 Short Cohort improvement factors, also scaled up by 12.5%.
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the
timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The history of the plans for the current and prior periods is as follows:

Share based payments:
The Group has a number of share option schemes established
which entitle key management and senior employees to
purchase shares in the Company. Within these schemes 
there are some share options which were granted before 
7 November 2002 and had not vested at 1 January 2005. In
accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS
2 the recognition and measurement principles of IFRS 2 have
not been applied to these grants. The other schemes are all
accounted for using the requirements of IFRS 2.
The Wagon 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme and 
The Wagon 1994 Share Savings Scheme were approved 
by shareholders on 7 September 1994. The Wagon 2004
Executive Share Option Scheme and The Wagon 2004 
Share Savings Scheme were approved by shareholders 
on 27 July 2004.
The options under the Sharesave scheme are exercisable 
by the grantees (provided they remain in the Group’s
employment) within six months of the maturity date of the
three to seven year bonus due under the relevant share
save contract.
The options under the other schemes, which include the 1994
and 2004 Executive Schemes, are exercisable by the grantees
(provided they remain in the Group’s employment) at any time
after the expiration of three years but within ten years from the
date of grant.
Under the rules of the Long T erm Incentive Plan (L-TIP),
Mourant & Co. T rustees Limited may, on the recommendation
of the Remuneration Committee, grant conditional awards to
acquire ordinary shares in the company. The number of shares
awarded to a participant is based on defined maximum limits.
The number of awards shares which may vest to a participant
at the end of a minimum three year retention period will be
determined by reference to the extent to which preset targets
relating to the performance of the company over the fixed
three year period are satisfied. The first conditional award was
made on 21 July 2000.
An award of 307,470 was made in the year under the L-TIP .
There is no specified subscription price per share but the rules
require a participant to pay £1 for each allocation.
Under the Executive Co-Investment Plan, selected senior
executives may elect to commute a proportion of up to 50%
of their annual bonus, net of payroll taxes, in the acquisition of
“bonus award shares” in the Company. If the executive
remains with the Group for a further period of three years, or
four years for French tax resident executives, and retains the
bonus award shares during this period, the executive may be
awarded a number of additional “matching shares”. 18. Employee benefits (continued)

In line with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 the financial instruments have been accounted for under the recognition and
measurement requirements of IAS 39 and the presentation and disclosure requirements of IAS 32 from 1 April 2005. Prior to that
date they are accounted for as off balance sheet items. Therefore there are no balances recognised in the comparative figures for
the instruments. For further information on the transition to adopted IFRS see note 28.
Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed
primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The overall aim of the Group’s financial risk
management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Group’s treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the
Board of Directors. T reasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions, however because exposure to
interest rate, currency and credit risk arise in the normal course of the Group’s business derivative financial instruments are used
to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
a) Interest rate risk
The Group has interest bearing debt that is predominantly foreign currency denominated borrowings for hedging net assets of
overseas operations and sterling borrowings to finance short-term working capital requirements. Such borrowings are subject to
floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR. The Group enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate
exposure. Group policy is to recognise gains and losses on the fair value of the effective portion of the hedging instruments within
equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
There were two (2005: four) interest rate hedges in place during the year to 31 March 2006 of which one (2005: two) was in place
at the end of the year. Of the two contracts in place during the year to 31 March 2006 the contract still outstanding at the end of
the year was classified as a cash flow hedge and stated at fair value. This contract matures over the period until September 2009.
The other was only in place for half of the financial year and was classified as fair value through profit or loss, thus it was stated at
fair value in the financial statements. The fair value of the swaps at 1 April 2005 was adjusted against the opening balance of the
hedging reserve at that date.
The net fair value of swaps at 31 March 2006 was a £2.2 million liability (2005: £3.2 million liability). The change in fair value of the
hedging contract from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006 amounted to £0.9 million and was recognised in the hedging reserve. The
gain in fair value of the other interest rate swap of £0.1 million was recognised in the income statement within net financing costs.
The following table indicates the effective interest rates of income earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities
at the balance sheet date and periods in which they are repriced:

(58.1) 1.3 (2.0) (50.9) (6.5)
*These assets/liabilities bear interest at a fixed rate
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 the Group has adopted IAS 32 prospectively from 1 April 2005. As a result
the preference share dividend is only classified as a financial expense from that date. Therefore the instrument is not classified as
an interest bearing financial instrument during the year to 31 March 2005 and thus there are no related comparative figures in the
above table. Notes to the Financial Statements Continued
for the year ended 31 March 2006
19. Financial instruments (continued)
b) Currency risk
The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily Mainland Europe. In order to protect the Group’s balance sheet
from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets of overseas operations are hedged.
Net investment hedging is achieved through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies. Group policy is to
recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately
in the income statement.
The Group has small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures that are hedged using forward contracts as
described above.
The Group uses foreign forward currency contracts to hedge its currency exposure which arises on US Dollars sales by a mainland
European based subsidiary. The contracts in place during the year are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value. They
are due to mature over the next two years to the end of March 2008. The fair value of the contract at 1 April 2005 was adjusted
against the opening balance of the hedging reserve at that date.
The net fair value of the contracts at 31 March 2006 was £1.1 million (2005: £2.1 million). The change in fair value of the hedging
contract from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006 amounted to £1.0 million and was recognised in the hedging reserve.
c) Hedge of net investment in foreign entities
The Group’s Euro denominated borrowing is designated a hedge of the net investment in the company holding the investments 
in the Group’s European subsidiaries. The carrying amount of the loans at 31 March 2006 was £68.0 million (2005: £62.9 million).
A foreign exchange loss of £1.2 million was recognised in equity on translation of the loans to sterling.
d) Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient cash is available to fund on-going operations without the need to
carry significant net debt over the medium term. The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core
relationship banks in the form of borrowings and short-term overdraft facilities. The quantum of committed borrowing facilities
available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
e) Credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging
transactions. Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history. Short-term bank deposits
and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counter parties based on ratings
issued by the major rating agencies. Counter party exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any
counter party are within predetermined limits.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
f) Commodity contracts
The Group entered into a commodity swap transaction to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the price of certain raw materials.
This contract was accounted for at fair value through profit or loss financial instrument and as such it was held at fair value in the
financial statements. The fair value of the contract at 1 April 2005 which amounted to £0.2 million was adjusted against the
opening balance of the hedging reserve at that date. During the year this contract expired and therefore the fair value at 31 March
2006 was nil. The change in value was expensed in the income statement through the administrative expenses line.
e) Fair values
The fair values of the Group’s financial instruments together with their carrying amounts in the balance sheet are as follows:

19. Financial instruments (continued)
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments
reflected in the table:
Preference share dividend liability:
Fair value is based on future cash flows, discounted at 10.2%, the Group’s current cost of capital.
Derivatives:
The fair values of the interest rate swaps are calculated using expected future cash flows discounted at the prevailing
interest rates.
The fair values of the forward foreign currency contracts and the commodity swaps are based on listed market prices or calculated
by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.

At 31 March 2005 70.0 24.3 45.7
The fixed rate financial liabilities carried a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%. The weighted average period for which the rate
was fixed was 4 years. The floating rate financial liabilities were set by reference to a margin charged over the relevant LIBOR rate
for the currency of borrowing.
The Group’s transactional currency exposures gave rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss
account. Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the
functional currency of the operating unit involved. As at 31 March 2005, these exposures were as follows:

Where available market rates were used to determine fair values. When market prices were not available, fair values were
calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The Group entered into forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases
denominated in foreign currencies. It also used interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate exposure, and commodity swaps to
manage its exposure to fluctuations in the price of certain of its raw materials. Changes in the fair value of instruments used as
hedges for foreign currency, interest rate and commodity exposures were not recognised in the financial statements until the
hedged position matured. An analysis of these unrecognised gains and losses was as follows:

22. Capital and reserves (continued)
The nominal value of the preference shares which amounts to
£2.0 million is included in the preference share reserve at 31
March 2006 following the adoption of IAS 32. Also included in
this reserve at 31 March 2006 is £5.2 million which represents
the remaining equity element of the preference shares after
deducting the liability element included in borrowings (see
note 16).
The convertible participating preference shareholders are
entitled to a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of
7.25p (net) per share per annum payable half yearly in arrears
on 15 June and 15 December and a further non-cumulative
dividend equal, in aggregate, to 0.01 % of the excess over
£60,000,000 of the profits for the financial year of the company
available for distribution.
The convertible participating preference shares do not entitle
their holders to attend and vote (other than in certain
circumstances) on any resolution unless the fixed preferential
dividend is six months in arrears. The shares allow conversion
at the option of the shareholder into fully paid ordinary shares
of 25p each during the period to 20 August 2008 on the basis
of 28.5714 ordinary shares for every 100 convertible
participating preference shares.
In the event of a return of capital on liquidation or otherwise,
the assets of the company available for distribution among the
members shall be applied first in repaying to the holders of the
convertible participating preference shares any arrears or
accruals of the fixed preferential and participating dividend, and
second in repayment of the capital paid up or credited as paid
up, together with a further payment of a premium of 90p per
share. There are no further rights to participate in the assets of
the company.
During the year to 31 March 2006 51,025 ordinary shares were
issued for consideration of £33,838 in respect of share options
exercised under an Inland Revenue approved Save As Y ou
Earn share save scheme. On 7 September 2005, 15,078
preference shares were exchanged for 4,307 ordinary shares.
On 30 November 96,478 ordinary shares were issued as part
of the consideration for the purchase of FKT . For more
information on this see note 25.
During the year to 31 March 2005 135,103 ordinary shares
were issued for consideration of £172,369 in respect of share
options exercised under an Inland Revenue approved Save
As Y ou Earn share save scheme. On 26 August 2004, 4,000
preference shares were exchanged for 1,142 ordinary shares.
T ranslation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange
differences arising from the translation of the financial
statements of foreign operations that are not integral to the
operations of the Company, as well as from the translation 
of liabilities that hedge the net investment in the foreign
subsidiaries.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the
cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging
instruments related to hedged transactions that have not
occurred.
Reserve for own shares
The reserve for own shares represents shares held in
employee trusts which consists of a holding of 1,168,278
(2005: 1,177,334 ) of the Company’s ordinary shares with a
nominal value of £292,070 (2005: £294,334). These shares
were acquired by a trust in the open market using funds
provided by the Company to meet obligations under the
Group’s share option schemes (see note 18). The costs of
funding and administering the schemes are charged to the
profit and loss account of the Company in the period to which
they relate. Dividend income from, and voting rights of the
shares held by the trust have been waived and the shares 
have therefore been excluded from the earnings per share
calculation (see note 23). The market value of the shares at 
31 March 2006 was £2.9 million (2005: £2.2 million).
Other reserves
Other reserves include the capital redemption reserve of 
£0.3 million (2005: £0.3 million). 22. Capital and reserves (continued)

Following the adoption of IAS 32 prospectively from 1 April 2005 the preference share dividends are included within net financial
expenses in the income statement rather than being a deduction from retained earnings.
The final proposed dividends in 2005 and the second interim dividend in 2006 were approved by shareholders after the related
financial year ends and as such have not been provided for in the financial statements and there are no income tax consequences.
The proposed dividend relating to the year ended 31 March 2006 was £2.6 million, 5.0p per share (2005: £2.6 million, 5.0p).
23. Earnings per share
Earnings per share have been calculated as follows:

Amounts written off investments – 5.0p
Loss on disposal of operations 1.5p 2.5p
Goodwill impairment – 4.3p
Earnings per share - underlying 22.2p 24.2p
Underlying earnings per share is considered by the Directors to represent a more consistent measure of year on year operating
performance.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excludes those held by The Wagon Employees’ Share
T rust which are deemed to be cancelled on the basis that the right to dividends has been waived (see note 18).
After adjusting for the effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares exercisable under the Company’s share option schemes and the
dilutive potential convertible preference shares, diluted earnings per share amounts to 19.5p (2005: 10.5p loss per share) based
on an adjusted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue of 52,501,432 (2005: 52,395,740). The loss per share in 2005
was not amended for the effect of the dilutive shares.

Identity of related parties
The Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries and with its Directors and other key personnel.
T ransactions with key management personnel
Details of transactions with Directors are included in the Remuneration Report at the front of the financial statements. In addition
to these Directors the Group believes that members of the Executive Committee should be classified as key management
personnel. As such transactions with all key personnel are disclosed below as well. These are limited to salaries and bonuses,
contributions to post employment retirement benefit plans and non-cash benefits.
Members of the Executive Commitee also participate in the Group’s share option programme (see note 18).

Acquisition of subsidiaries
On 30 November 2005 the Group acquired all the shares in FKT Gmbh T echnische Produkte for £6.8 million: £4.5 million satisfied
in cash, £0.1 million in shares issued and £2.2 million in deferred consideration. The acquired company designs, manufactures and
markets automotive sun blinds and cargo management systems. In the four months to 31 March 2006 the subsidiary contributed
profit of £0.2 million to the consolidated profit for the year. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2005, Group revenue would
have been £422.5 million and profit would have been £10.5 million. 25. Business combination (continued)

Goodwill has arisen on acquisition of FKT Gmbh T echnische Produkte because of customer relationships that did not meet the
criteria for recognition of an intangible asset at the date of acquisition
26. Post balance sheet event
On 7 April 2006 the Group acquired 99.8% of the share capital of Oxford Automotive ApS and is in the process of acquiring the
small number of shares outstanding. The consideration for the shares was 62.2 million new Wagon ordinary shares, implying a
value of £128.4 million, based on the closing price immediately before the shares resumed trading.
As a consequence of the aquisition the revolving multi-currency bank facilities of B62.5 million existing at the balance sheet date
were replaced with committed B225 million multi-currency term and revolving bank facilities due to mature in October 2008. 
27. Accounting estimates and judgements
Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting
policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Note 10 contains information about the assumptions and their risk factors relating to goodwill and other impairment.
In note 12 detail of unrecognised deferred tax assets and the reasons for not recognising these balances is discussed.
Note 18 contains detail of the assumptions in relation to the pension liabilities.
In note 19 detail of and risks in relation to foreign exchange movements are given.
Investment Property
The Group has sublet a number of vacated buildings (see note 20 on operating leases) but has decided not to treat these
properties as investment properties because it is not the Group’s intention to hold these for the long-term or for capital
appreciation or rent. Accordingly these are still treated as a lease of property, plant and equipment.
These are considered to be the main estimates and judgements in the financial statements.

28. Explanation of transition to adopted IFRS
As stated in the accounting policies this is the Group’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
adopted IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in these accounts have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31
March 2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005 and in
preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004 (the Group’s date of transition to adopted IFRS).
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared
in accordance with its old basis of accounting (Previous GAAP). An explanation of how the transition from Previous GAAP to
adopted IFRS has affected the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in the following tables

28. Explanation of transition to adopted IFRS (continued)
a) Computer Software
Under Previous GAAP all software was classified as a tangible
asset. Under adopted IFRS, software that is not an integral 
part of owned computer hardware is classified as intangible.
Accordingly at 1 April 2004 £1.1 million (31 March 2005: £1.2
million) of asset value has been moved from tangible to
intangible assets. This has no effect to the charges recognised
in the income statement.
b) T ooling
No assets and liabilities or income and costs should be offset
unless required or permitted by a standard under IFRS. This
affects the reporting of the Group’s tooling balances for which
income has been received in advance. Under Previous GAAP
the related assets and liabilities of profitable tooling projects
were reported net within stock after completion of the project.
The profit was then released over the life of the project through
cost of sales. On adoption of IFRS, and after publication of the
IFRS restatement document, the balances have been grossed
up with the asset transferred to property, plant and equipment
and the liability transferred to deferred income to better reflect
the nature of the items. Both the balances are then to be
amortised over the life of the related projects, with the income
being reported through turnover and the property, plant and
equipment depreciation reported through cost of sales.
This change has resulted in a £26.7 million increase to
property, plant and equipment; a £10.3 million reduction to
stock and an £16.4 million increase in other payables at 31
March 2004. The related changes at 31 March 2005 are a
£27.2 million increase to property, plant and equipment; a
£11.0 million reduction to stock and a £16.2 million increase
in other payables.
T urnover in the year to 31 March 2005 also increased by £4.9
million as a result of this adjustment with a related £5.2 million
increase in cost of sales and £0.3 million reduction in
administrative expenses.
c) Goodwill amortisation
IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ covers the accounting for
acquisitions, which is dealt with under UK GAAP by FRS 6
‘Acquisitions and mergers’, FRS 7 ‘Fair values in acquisition
accounting’, and FRS 10 ‘Goodwill and intangible assets’.
The recognition criteria in the balance sheet are the same
under both adopted IFRS and UK GAAP however IFRS 3
prohibits the amortisation of goodwill. Instead, IFRS 3 requires
goodwill to be subject to annual impairment reviews.
As a result goodwill and profit before taxation have increased
by £2.3 million at 31 March 2005 representing the reversal of
the goodwill amortisation charged under the Previous GAAP in
the year to 31 March 2005.
d) Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented separately on
the face of the balance sheet under adopted IFRS whereas
under the Previous GAAP deferred tax liabilities were included
within provisions.
The effect of this adjustment is £2.2 million transferring out of
provisions to deferred tax assets at 1 April 2004 and £4.4
million of income tax liabilities transferring out of provisions at
the same date. At 31 March 2005 the corresponding figures
were £1.0 million and £4.6 million respectively.
e) Current tax assets and liabilities
Income tax assets and liabilities are presented separately on
the face of the balance sheet under adopted IFRS whereas
under the Previous GAAP income tax assets were included
within other receivables and income tax liabilities within 
other payables.
The effect of this adjustment is £0.2 million transferring out of
other receivables to income tax assets at 1 April 2004 and £7.4
million of income tax liabilities transferring out of other
payables. At 31 March 2005 the corresponding figures were
£5.2 million and £10.1 million.
f) Employee benefits
IAS 19 covers all employee benefits including post –
retirement benefits. The principal area of impact on the Group
is in relation to accounting for defined benefit pension
schemes. IAS 19 revised replaces SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for
pension costs’ and is broadly similar to the requirements of
FRS 17 ‘Retirement benefits’. Disclosure of the potential
impact of FRS 17 has been included in the Group’s annual
report and accounts since 2001. As permitted by IAS 19, the
Group has opted to recognise immediately and in full the
actuarial gains and losses arising in each accounting period in
the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. This
treatment is similar to the requirements of FRS 17.
Under SSAP 24, defined benefit pension costs were charged
to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of
providing pensions over the remaining average service lives of
current employees in the scheme. Differences between
contributions paid and the amount charged to the profit and
loss account were shown as prepayments or accruals in the
balance sheet. The surplus or deficit in defined benefit
schemes was not recognised in the balance sheet of the
Group, but highlighted in the notes to the accounts under FRS
17 transitional arrangements. W agon plc 
Annual Report &
Accounts 2006
84/85
28. Explanation of transition to adopted IFRS (continued)
Under IAS 19, the surplus or deficit in defined benefit schemes
is recognised on the balance sheet of the Group. Although the
methodology for determining the profit and loss account
charge is broadly similar to SSAP 24, the actuarial assumptions
are different. In particular, IAS 19 requires the discount rate
used in the evaluation of scheme liabilities to be based on
market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the balance
sheet date. In contrast, SSAP 24 requires the use of a long-
term investment return rate to discount liabilities.
The effect of adopting IAS 19 has been that the net scheme
liability in relation to the Group’s UK defined benefit plan have
been recognised on the balance sheet within employee
benefits liabilities. At 1 April 2004 this decreased net assets
by £33.1 million. At 31 March 2005 the corresponding figure
was £30.7 million.
Furthermore the SSAP 24 prepayments recognised under
Previous GAAP are taken off the balance sheet under adopted
IFRS. The effect of this is a £3.3 million reduction in
prepayments at 1 April 2004 with the corresponding figure at
31 March 2005 being £5.5 million.
T o report all the retirement benefit obligations in the same line
in the balance sheet the provisions held in relation to subsidiary
retirement benefit schemes have been transferred to the
employee benefits liability line. This transfer totalled £8.5
million at 1 April 2004 and £7.5 million at 31 March 2005.
The adoption of the standard also affects the charge
recognised in the income statement in relation to the defined
benefit scheme as noted above. These differences mean that
administration expenses reduced by £1.5 million in the year to
31 March 2005 and finance costs increased by £0.9 million
giving an overall benefit in profit for the period of £0.6 million
g) Proposed dividends
Under IAS 10, it is not permitted to recognise dividends
declared and approved by shareholders after the balance sheet
date as a liability at the balance sheet date. This differs from
the Previous GAAP treatment of proposed dividends, which
were accrued for in the financial period to which they relate. 
As a result £2.6 million of accrued dividends was taken out 
of other payables at 1 April 2004 and added back to
retained earnings.
h) Holiday pay accrual
Under IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ the Group is required to
provide for any holiday entitlements not yet taken by
employees in the year. An extra £0.2 million of liability has been
added within other payables at 1 April 2004 to ensure that the
Group is fully compliant.
i) T reasury shares and share based payments
IFRS 2 ‘Share based payment’ replaces UITF 17 ‘Employee
share schemes’ under UK GAAP .
IFRS 2 requires the fair value cost of providing employee share
option schemes to be charged to the income statement, and in
respect of equity settled share based payments, recognised
directly in equity. This differs to the UITF 17 approach under
which the charge to the income statement is based on the
intrinsic value of the share options. The scope of IFRS 2 is
wider than UITF 17 as it relates to all share based payments.
Consequently, Save as Y ou Earn (SAYE) schemes are within
the scope of IFRS 2, whereas under UITF 17 they are
specifically exempt.
As a result an extra £0.3 million has been charged within
administrative costs in the year to 31 March 2005 in relation to
the share option schemes currently in place.
j) Revaluation reserve
The revaluation reserve of £0.9 million which related to
revaluations of tangible assets under Previous GAAP 
transfers to retained earnings following adoption of IFRSs 
as a cost-depreciation model for valuing tangible assets is
being adopted. Notes to the Financial Statements Continued

l) T ranslation reserve
On adoption of IFRS a new reserve is created for the effects of foreign currency translation differences. Under Previous GAAP
these gains or losses were included within retained earnings. The effect of this is that £3.8 million is transferred from retained
earnings to the translation reserve at 31 March 2005 representing the gain on translation in the year to 31 March 2005. The 
Group has taken the allowed exemption under IFRS 1 not to restate reserves in relation to foreign exchange differences prior to 
1 April 2004.

Explanation of material adjustments to the cash flow statement for the year ended 31 March 2005
Bank overdrafts repayable on demand of £0.7 million which form an integral part of the Group’s cash management were classified
as financing cash flows under Previous GAAP and are reclassified as cash and cash equivalents under adopted IFRSs. There are
no other material differences between the cash flow under adopted IFRSs and the cash flow statement as presented under
Previous GAAP .
Reconciliation of equity following adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39
As noted in the basis of preparation the Group has taken the option of not restating comparatives for IAS 32 and 39 as allowed by
the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 and the aforementioned standards. As a result there are adjustments which occurred at 1 April
2005 in relation to the adoption of these standards. The reconciliation of equity at 1 April 2005 is as follows:

28. Explanation of transition to adopted IFRS (continued)
a) Financial assets and liabilities
The adoption of IAS 39 means that the fair values of the
derivative instruments come onto the balance sheet and
movements in fair value go through a new reserve called the
hedging reserve until the elements of the contract mature, at
which point the related values are taken to the income
statement. Under Previous GAAP their fair values were only
recognised in a note to the accounts and the related gains or
losses were recognised in the income statement when the
elements of the contract matured.
The effect of this is that a net liability of £0.9 million (Asset:
£2.3 million and liability £3.2 million) is transferred onto the
balance sheet and the £0.9 million is taken to the hedging
reserve at 1 April 2005.
b) Preference shares
The preference shares that have been in issue since 1988 are
accounted for differently under adopted IFRS compared to
Previous GAAP . The proportion of the carrying value of the
preference shares in the accounts that related to the payment
of the fixed dividend forms part of borrowings after adoption
of IAS 32 and the right to conversion into ordinary shares is
treated as equity.
This gives rise to the £14.0 million adjustment above (£1.5
million in current liabilities and £12.5 million in non-current
liabilities). It also means that the preference share capital of
£2.0 million is transferred from issue capital to a new equity
account called preference share equity reserve, along with the
remaining carrying value of the preference shares of £5.2
million, which is classified as equity under adopted IFRS.
The adoption of IAS 32 also means that the preference share
dividend cost of £1.5 million per annum forms part of finance
costs in the income statement as opposed to being treated as
a deduction from shareholders’ funds, like equity dividends. As
with all the adjustments on adoption of IFRS this does not
affect the cash flows of the Group.
The 31 March 2005 disclosures follow FRS 4 as applicable in
2005. This includes the analysis of 31 March 2005
shareholders’ funds into equity and non-equity components.
FRS 4 used “equity” as a subset of shareholders’ funds,
whereas IAS 32 applies the term “equity” to issued financial
instruments other than those, or those components, classified
as liabilities.
The main effects on the primary statement in the comparative
year, had IAS 32 and IAS 39 been adopted, would have been
similar to these stated above. W agon plc

Company Balance Sheet
for the year ended 31 March 2006 Company Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the year ended 31 March 2006 
Accounting policies
The financial statements set out on pages 89 to 99 comply with
applicable UK accounting standards and are prepared under the
historical cost convention except that derivative financial
instruments are stated at their fair value in the current year and
the statements have been modified to include the revaluation
of the Company’s freehold property.
a) Changes in accounting policies
With the convergence of UK GAAP to adopted IFRS there
are a number of new standards adopted in the year by 
the company:
i) Financial Instruments
The Company has adopted the standards FRS 25 ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and FRS 26
‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’ in the year. The
Company has adopted the standards earlier than required 
in order to harmonise accounting between the Group and
Company in this area.
The adoption of FRS 26 means that the fair values of the
derivative instruments are recognised on the balance sheet
and movements in fair value go through a new reserve
called the hedging reserve until the elements of the contract
mature, at which point the related values are taken to the
profit and loss account. Under Previous GAAP their fair
values were only recognised in a note to the Group accounts
and the related gains or losses were taken when the
elements of the contract matured.
The effect of this is that a net liability of £0.9 million (Asset:
£2.3 million and liability £3.2 million) is transferred onto the
balance sheet and the £0.9 million is taken to the hedging
reserve at 1 April 2005. This is in line with the transitional
requirements of the standard which allow no restatement
of comparative figures.
The adoption of FRS 25 means that the proportion of the
carrying value of the preference shares in the accounts that
related to the payment of the fixed dividend forms part of
borrowings after adoption of the standard.
This gives rise to £14.0 million being adjusted from equity 
to liabilities (£1.5 million in current liabilities and £12.5 million
in non-current liabilities). It also means that the preference
share capital of £2.0 million is transferred from issued capital
to a new equity account called preference share equity
reserve, along with the remaining carrying value of the
preference shares of £5.2 million, which is classified as
equity under FRS 25.
ii) Post balance sheet events
The Company adopted FRS 21 ‘Events after the balance
sheet date’ in the year. This UK standard is identical to the
International standard IAS 10. Under FRS 21, it is not
permitted to recognise dividends declared and approved by
shareholders after the balance sheet date as a liability at the
balance sheet date. This differs from the Previous GAAP
treatment of proposed dividends, which were accrued for in
the financial period to which they relate. 
As a result a prior period adjustment was made which took
£2.6 million out of other payables and added it back to
retained earnings. Also the second interim dividend for the
year ended 31 March 2006 was not accrued for.
iii) Pension accounting
The Company has adopted FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’
for full implementation in the year. Previously the pension
schemes that the Company was a member of were
accounted for under SSAP 24 ‘Pension Accounting’. As
a result of this adoption the SSAP 24 pension prepayment
of £5.6 million, recognised within other debtors under
Previous GAAP in the year ended 31 March 2005, was
reversed out against the retained earnings as a prior
period adjustment.
iv) Other standards
The Company adopted FRS 20 ‘Share based payments’ in
the year. There were no restatements required in adopting
this standard.
The Company has adopted FRS 23 ‘Changes in Forex Rates’
in the year. There were no restatements required in
adopting this standard.
The Company adopted FRS 28 ‘Corresponding Amounts’ in
the year. There were no restatements required in adopting
this standard.
b) Foreign currencies
T ransactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated
at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange
rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange
differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit
and loss statement except where the items are deemed to
be hedging items (see policy on hedging).
c) Leases
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
asset have passed to the Company, and hire purchase
contracts are included within owned tangible fixed assets
and the obligations relating thereto, excluding finance
charges, are included in creditors. Rentals payable are
apportioned between the finance element, which is charged
to the profit and loss account, and the capital element which
reduces the outstanding obligation of future instalments. 
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged in arriving
at the operating profit on a straight line basis over the 
lease term.
d) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates
calculated to write off the cost or valuation less estimated
residual value of each asset over its expected useful life 
as follows: W agon plc 
Annual Report &
Accounts 2006
90/91
Freehold buildings – over expected economic life
not exceeding 50 years
Leasehold land and  – over the period of the lease
buildings
Plant and other equipment – 3 to 20 years
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or on assets in
the course of construction.
e) Investments
Investments are shown at cost less provisions for
impairment in value.
f) Cash and liquid resources
Cash comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on
demand, less overdrafts payable on demand. 
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are
disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and
are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at
or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.
Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one
year (other than cash) and investments in money market
managed funds.
g) Deferred taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and
takes into account taxation deferred because of timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for
taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is
recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for
taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not
reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise
required by FRS 19.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the
related tax benefit will be realised.
h) Derivative financial instruments
The Company holds derivative financial instruments that
hedge the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange and
interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and
investment activities. In accordance with the Group’s
treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However from 1 April 2005 fair value movements on
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognised through the profit and loss statement.
From 1 April 2005 derivatives are initially recognised at fair
value on the date that the contract is entered into and
subsequently re-measured in future periods at their fair
value. The method of recognising the resulting change in fair
value is dependant on whether the derivative is designated
as a hedging instrument.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated
amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate
the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account
current interest rates and other creditworthiness of the
swap counterparties. The fair value of forward exchange
contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet
date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Prior to 1 April 2005 the value of derivative financial
instruments was held off balance sheet in accordance the
transitional requirements of FRS 26, see change in
accounting policies.
i) Hedging
From 1 April 2005 where a derivative financial instrument
is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of
a recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecasted
transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the
derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in
equity. When the forecasted transaction subsequently
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-
financial liability, or a forecast transaction for a non-financial
asset or non-financial liability occurs the associated
cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included
in the income statement in the period in which the asset
acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss (i.e. in
periods when the depreciation expense or cost of sales 
is recognised).
If a hedge of a forecasted transaction subsequently results
in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the
associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in
equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period
or periods during which the asset acquired or liability
assumed affects profit or loss (i.e. when interest income or
expense is recognised).
For cash flow hedges other than those covered by the
preceding two paragraphs, the associated cumulative gain
or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income
statement in the same period or periods during which the
hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss. The
ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately
in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or
exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge
relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point
remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the
above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged
transaction is no longer expected to take place, the
cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Prior to 1 April 2005 hedge accounting was not applied
because the value of derivative financial instruments was
held off balance sheet in accordance with the transitional
procedures of FRS 26. See changes in accounting 
policies note. Company Notes to the Financial Statements
Continued
for the year ended 31 March 2006 
j) Share capital
i) Classification of financial instruments issued by
the Company
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments
issues by the Company are treated as equity (i.e. forming
part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they
meet the following two conditions:
a) They include no contractual obligations upon the
Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or
to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with
another party under conditions that are potentially
unfavourable to the Company; and
b) Where the instrument will, or may be, settled in the
Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-
derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable
number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a
derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging
a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed
number of its own equity instruments.
T o the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of
issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the
instrument so classified takes the legal form of the
Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these
financial statements for called up share capital and share
premium account exclude amounts in relation to those
shares.
Where a financial instrument that contains both equity and
financial liability components exists these components are
separated and accounted for individually under the above
policy. The finance cost on the financial liability component is
correspondingly higher over the life of the instrument.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are
dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments
associated with financial instruments that are classified in
equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
ii) Preference share capital
From 1 April 2005 preference share capital is accounted for
as a compound financial instrument. The liability component
of the instrument is calculated by discounting the future
cash outflows for the non-discretionary dividend payments
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money. The equity
element is calculated as the residual interest in the assets of
the Company after deducting all of the related liabilities.
Prior to 1 April 2005 the preference share capital was
accounted for as non-equity shareholders’ funds in line with
the transitional requirements of FRS 25. See changes in
accounting policies.
iii) Repurchase of share capital
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased,
the amount of the consideration paid, including directly
attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Repurchased shares (if not cancelled) are classified as
treasury shares and presented as a deduction from
total equity.
iv) Dividends
Dividends on preference share capital are recognised as
a liability and expensed on an accruals basis. In the year
to 31 March 2006 they are recognised in the profit and loss
account as finance costs as they relate to the liability element
of the share capital. In the year to 31 March 2005 the
dividends on preference share capital were reported as
deductions to equity in line with the transitional procedures
of FRS 25.
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the period in
which they are paid or when approved by shareholders at a
general meeting.
k) Employee benefits
i) Defined contribution plans
For defined contribution pension plans operated by the
Group, amounts payable by the Company are charged to the
profit and loss statement as they fall due.
ii) Defined benefit plans
For defined benefit pension plans, the cost of providing
benefits for the Group is calculated annually by independent
actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Because
the assets and liabilities of the scheme cannot be
reasonably split between the contributing companies the
Company accounts for the plan as a defined contribution
scheme and amounts payable by the Company are charged
to the profit and loss statement as they fall due.
l) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the
Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to 
the liability.
i) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the
Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring
plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has
been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not
provided for.
ii) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the
expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a
contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its
obligations under the contract. W agon plc 
Annual Report &
Accounts 2006
92/93
m) Rental income
Rental income from investment properties and properties
held under operating leases sublet to third parties is
recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease.
n) Expenses
i) Net financing costs
Interest income and expense is recognised in the income
statement as it accrues, using the effective interest
method.
ii) Financial expense
Financial expense comprises interest payable on
borrowings, dividends on preference shares, foreign
exchange losses, losses on hedging instruments that are
recognised in the profit and loss statement and financing
costs relating to employee benefits.
iii) Financial income
Financial income represents interest receivable on cash and
cash equivalents, foreign exchange gains, gains on hedging
instruments that are recognised in the income statement
and return on assets held in defined benefit schemes.
o) Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the
Company is managed. In the course of its business, the
Company is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk,
interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The overall aim
of the Company’s financial risk management policies is to
minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance
and net assets.
The Group’s treasury department manages the principal
financial risks within policies and operating parameters
approved by the Board of Directors. T reasury is not a profit
centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
(i) Foreign currency risk
The Group operates in a number of overseas regions,
primarily Mainland Europe. In order to protect the Group’s
balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate
volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets of
overseas operations are hedged. Net investment hedging is
achieved through borrowings denominated in the relevant
foreign currencies. A number of these borrowings are taken
out by the Company. Group, and Company, policy is to
recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of
the hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions
immediately in the profit and loss statement.
The Group has small and infrequent transactional foreign
currency exposures that are hedged using forward
contracts taken out by the Company as described above.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Company has interest bearing debt that is
predominantly foreign currency denominated borrowings
for hedging net assets of overseas operations and sterling
borrowings to finance short-term working capital
requirements of the Group. Such borrowings are subject
to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR. The Company
enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its
interest rate exposure. Company policy is to recognise
gains and losses on the fair value of the effective portion 
of the hedging instruments within equity and to 
recognise ineffective portions immediately in the profit 
and loss statement.
(iii) Liquidity risk
The Company’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that
sufficient cash is available to fund on-going operations
without the need to carry significant net debt over the
medium term. The Company’s principal borrowing facilities
are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the
form of borrowings and short-term overdraft facilities. The
quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the
Company, and also Group, is reviewed regularly and is
designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
(iv) Credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade
receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency
hedging transactions. Policies and procedures exist to
ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging
transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated
authorised counter parties based on ratings issued by the
major rating agencies. Counter party exposure positions are
monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any counter
party are within predetermined limits.
Overall, the Company considers that it is not exposed to a
significant amount of credit risk.
p) Share based payments
The Group share option programme allows Group
employees to acquire shares in the Company. The
employees involved in these transactions are mainly
members of other Group companies. These subsidiary
companies recognise the fair value of options granted as an
employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the
period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to options.
When any shares of the Company are issued as a result of
such options the Company’s investment in the subsidiary is
increased by the nominal value of the shares. Company Notes to the Financial Statements

As permitted by the standard, the Company has adopted FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation
prospectively from 1 April 2005. On adoption of the standard £14.0 million was transferred from equity to borrowings
representing the liability element of the preference shares. For further information on the preference shares and rights
attributable to them see note 22 in the Group section of the accounts.
8. Financial instruments
The financial assets and financial liabilities lines in the balance sheet consist of the following items:
2006 2005
£m £m
Financial assets:
Forward foreign currency contracts 1.1 –
1.1 –
Financial liabilities:
Interest rate swaps (2.2) –
(2.2) –
In line with the transitional provisions of the standard the financial instruments have been accounted for under the recognition and
measurement requirements of FRS 26 and the presentation and disclosure requirements of FRS 25 from 1 April 2005. Prior to that
date they are accounted for as off balance sheet items. Therefore there are no balances recognised in the comparative figures for
the instruments.
Exposure to interest rate, currency and credit risk arise in the normal course of the Company’s business. Derivative financial
instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
For the Company’s policies on financial risk management see the related policy in the accounting policies section of the financial
statements. W agon plc 
Annual Report &
Accounts 2006
96/97
a) Interest rate risk
The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest
rate exposure and achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and
floating rate exposure. There were two (2005: four) interest
rate hedges in place during the year to 31 March 2006 of which
one (2005: two) was in place at the end of the year.
Of the two contracts in place during the year to 31 March 2006
the contract still outstanding at the end of the year was
classified as a cash flow hedge and stated at fair value. This
contract matures over the period until September 2009. The
other was only in place for half of the financial year and was
classified as fair value through profit or loss, thus it was stated
at fair value in the financial statements. The fair value of the
swaps at 1 April 2005 was adjusted against the opening
balance of the hedging reserve at that date.
The net fair value of swaps at 31 March 2006 was a £2.2
million liability (2005: £3.2 million liability). The change in fair
value of the hedging contract from 1 April 2005 to 31 March
2006 amounted to £0.9 million and was recognised in the
hedging reserve. The gain in fair value of the other interest rate
swap of £0.1 million was recognised in the income statement
within net financing costs.
b) Currency risk
The Company uses foreign forward currency contracts to
hedge the Group’s currency exposure which arises on US
Dollars sales by a mainland European based subsidiary. The
contracts in place during the year are classified as cash flow
hedges and stated at fair value. They are due to mature over
the next two years to the end of March 2008. The fair value of
the contract at 1 April 2005 was adjusted against the opening
balance of the hedging reserve at that date.
The net fair value of the contracts at 31 March 2006 was 
£1.1 million (2005: £2.1 million). The change in fair value of 
the hedging contract from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006
amounted to £1.0 million and was recognised in the 
hedging reserve.
c) Commodity contracts
The Company entered into a commodity swap transaction to
manage the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in the price of
certain raw materials. This contract was accounted for at fair
value through profit or loss financial instrument and as such it
was held at fair value in the financial statements. The fair value
of the contract at 1 April 2005 which amounted to £0.2 million
was adjusted against the opening balance of the hedging
reserve at that date. During the year this contract expired and
therefore the fair value at 31 March 2006 was nil. The change
in value was expensed in the income statement through the
administrative expenses line.
9. Employee benefits
The Company is a member of a group pension scheme
providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. Because the
Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets
and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, as
permitted by FRS 17 ‘Retirement benefits’ the scheme has
been accounted for in these financial statements as a defined
contribution scheme.
The Company is a member of a defined benefit pension
scheme in the UK operated by the Group. The assets are held
in separate trustee administered funds and pension costs are
assessed in accordance with the advice of independent
qualified actuaries using the projected unit method. Following
a further review of the changes in legislation and the effect
these have on pension provisions, employees who joined
company service on or after 13 February 2002 are not eligible
to join the Wagon Plan for pension purposes.
The latest full actuarial assessment was April 2005, and an
independent qualified actuary has updated this to 31 March
2006. Particulars of the actuarial assessment of the group
scheme are contained in the Group section of these accounts.
The pension cost of the period for the Company is £2.8 million
(2005: £3.3 million).
At 31 March 2006 the amount due to the pension scheme
amounted to £7,000 (2005: £22,000). Company Notes to the Financial Statements

10. Deferred tax
The Company has no recognised deferred tax assets or liabilities (2005: Nil) but there is a £2.4 million (2005: £1.2 million)
unrecognised deferred tax asset in relation to losses brought forward not recognised. This is not recognised due to uncertainty
over their utilisation in the next twelve months.
11. Operating leases
Operating lease payments falling due next year to which the Company was committed at 31 March were:
Land and buildings

Lease expires:
Within one year –
Between one and five years 0.3
After more than five years 0.5
At 31 March 2006 0.8
Within one year –

At 31 March 2005 1.0
The Company has guaranteed the lease payments of certain of its subsidiaries, the total minimum lease payments of which
amount to £2.2 million (2005: £3.7 million).
12. Contingencies
The Company has issued guarantees on behalf of the Group under the normal course of business amounting to £4.0 million and
had guaranteed operating leases of certain subsidiaries amounting to £12.6 million. Where the Company enters into financial
guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be
insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. W agon plc

Notes:
1 A member entitled to attend and vote is entitled to appoint
one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote instead of
him. The deposit of a form of proxy shall not preclude a
member from attending and voting in person at the meeting
or at any adjournment thereof.
2 A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
3 A white form of proxy is enclosed for use in respect of 
the meeting.
4 Forms of proxy should be lodged at the address shown
thereon not less than 48 hours before the meeting. Proxy
forms not so lodged will not be effective.
5 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies
through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service
may do so for the Annual General Meeting to be held on 21
July 2006 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the
procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal
Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those
CREST members who have appointed a voting service
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting
service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate
action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using
the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST
message (a "CREST Proxy Instruction") must be properly
authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo's specifications
and must contain the information required for such
instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the
appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction
given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be
valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's
agent (ID 7RA01) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy
appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as
determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the
CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer's agent is
able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the
manner prescribed by CREST . After this time any change of
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST
sponsors or voting service providers should note that
CRESTCo does not make available special procedures in
CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings
and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of
CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the
CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member
is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has
appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such
action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular
time. In this connection, CREST members and, where
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers
are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system
and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the
Uncertificated Securites Regulations 2001.
6 Copies of Directors’ service agreements will be available for
inspection at the registered office of the Company during
normal business hours on any weekday (except Saturdays,
Sundays and public holidays) until the conclusion of the
Annual General Meeting and at the place at which the Annual
General Meeting is held for at least 15 minutes prior to and
during the meeting.

Extraordinary General Meeting
Dear Sir or Madam
I am pleased to send you details of a separate class meeting 
of the holders of the Company’s preference shares which will
be held on 21 July 2006 at the Offices of ABN AMRO, 250
Bishopsgate, London EC2M 4AA. The meeting will start at
11.15 am or as soon thereafter as the Annual General Meeting
of the Company convened for the same day at the same 
place at 11.00 am has been concluded or adjourned. The 
formal notice of the separate class meeting of preference
shareholders is set out on page 105. 
The business to be considered at the meeting 
The Company’s articles of association require resolution 7 set
out in the notice convening the Annual General Meeting of the
Company dated 8 June 2006 to be approved by the preference
shareholders at a separate class meeting. Resolution 7 is a
resolution seeking authority for the Company to purchase its
own shares for cash and is explained in more detail on pages 
27 and 28 of the Company’s annual report under “Purchase 
of own shares for cash”. This is the only item to be considered
at the class meeting and will be proposed as an extraordinary
resolution. This means that, in order to be passed, at least 
75% of the votes cast must be in favour. 
Attending and voting
If you hold preference shares in the Company, you are entitled
to come to the class meeting and vote on the resolution. If you
cannot come to the meeting you can use the blue proxy form
enclosed with this letter to nominate someone else to come 
to the meeting and vote for you, or you can nominate me to
vote for you. Y our proxy does not have to be a member of the
Company. If you want to appoint a proxy for the class meeting,
you need to send back the blue proxy form not less than 
48 hours before the meeting. If you complete and return the
blue proxy form, you can still come to the class meeting and
vote instead of your proxy.
Recommendation
Y our Directors believe that the proposed resolution to be
considered at the class meeting is in the best interests of
Wagon and its shareholders as a whole. Y our Directors
unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of the
proposed resolution.
Y ours faithfully,
Christopher Clark
Chairman

Notes:
1 A member entitled to attend and vote is entitled to appoint
one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote instead of
him. The deposit of a form of proxy will not preclude a
member from attending and voting in person at the meeting
or at any adjournment thereof.
2 A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
3 A blue form of proxy is enclosed for use in respect 
of the meeting.
4 Forms of proxy should be lodged at the address shown
thereon not less than 48 hours before the meeting. Proxy
forms not so lodged will not be effective.
5 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies
through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service
may do so for the Extraordinary General Meeting to be held
on 21 July 2006 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the
procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal
Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those
CREST members who have appointed a voting service
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting
service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate
action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using
the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST
message (a "CREST Proxy Instruction") must be properly
authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo's specifications
and must contain the information required for such
instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the
appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction
given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be
valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's
agent (ID 7RA01) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy
appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as
determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the
CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer's agent is
able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the
manner prescribed by CREST . After this time any change 
of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should
be communicated to the appointee through other means.

CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST
sponsors or voting service providers should note that
CRESTCo does not make available special procedures in
CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings
and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of
CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the
CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member
is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has
appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such
action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular
time. In this connection, CREST members and, where
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers
are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system
and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. 
6 This notice is being sent to all shareholders but only holders
of 7.25p (net) convertible participating preference shares of
10p each in the capital of Wagon plc are entitled to attend

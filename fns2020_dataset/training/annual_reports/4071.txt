Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002 1
Financial Highlights
*before amortisation of goodwill Country & Metropolitan has achieved another set of outstanding
results in a year in which it made a significant profit on the sale of
its investment in Tay Homes PLC and during which it completed the
acquisition of NorthCountry Homes Group Limited.
Results and dividend
During the year ended 31 August 2002 the Group made pre-tax
profits before amortisation of goodwill of £3.99m, an increase of
81% over the previous year’s result of £2.21m. This included a
profit of £1.1m from the sale of our investment in Tay Homes PLC.
Operating profit before amortisation of goodwill increased by 37%
to £5.1m (2001: £3.7m) and basic earnings per share before
amortisation of goodwill increased by 34% to 16.56p per share
compared to 12.35p in the previous period. I am pleased to report
that the Board is recommending a final dividend of 2.14p (2001:
1.7p) per share bringing the total for the year to 2.75p, an
increase of 22% over the previous period in line with the
progressive dividend policy maintained since flotation. The final
dividend will be paid on 7 April 2003 to shareholders on the
register on 7 March 2003.
Net asset value per share has increased to 102.7p per share (2001:
86.4p) representing shareholders’ funds of £19.4m (2001: £14.4m).
These results demonstrate the Group’s ability to grow organically
and create further shareholder value by acquisition, identifying and
building strategic stakes in undervalued companies in the sector.
Operating review
The Southern Region’s programme included the sale of five houses,
with prices in excess of £950,000, prior to the year end and it has
contracted the sale of a property under construction for £2m. It
has two further properties under construction in this range for
which demand is expected to be strong. The Board is now taking a
more cautious view of developing properties in this price range,
with the emphasis now being placed on the more affordable end
of the market.  
The Region has however, purchased what we believe to be one of
the most prime sites in London, opposite Hampton Court, with a
direct frontage to the River Thames. By purchasing the land
unconditionally an extremely attractive price was agreed. We are
now well advanced with an agreement with Railtrack, regarding a
comprehensive development of our land and the adjoining land 
of Hampton Court Station, where we envisage a major mixed 
use development.
The final phase of 10 detached houses at Rissington is well
advanced with only two units remaining for sale. The annual rental
stream from the Business Park at Rissington has increased
significantly and now stands at £695,000 per annum. Although the
claim by the Ministry of Defence for additional consideration of
£820,000 by way of overage was lost, we are still confident of
obtaining a significant allocation for further residential development
on the remaining 70 acres.
The North and North West Regions have experienced good progress
with no properties in stock at the year end. They have strong
forward reservations on developments under construction and are
actively promoting a number of sites through the planning system.  
Chairman’s Statement
2 Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002
“The enlarged Group now has a diverse product range and a wide geographical
spread. Demand for our product in the current economic climate remains strong
as demonstrated by the strong forward order book.”
David Laing
Chairman Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002 3
We have now secured a resolution to grant planning consent on
the 140 acre site at the former Poole Hospital in Middlesborough to
develop 94 residential units, including the conversion of a
magnificent Grade II* Listed Mansion into 12 apartments.  
A prime site has been acquired in Leeds City Centre, for a waterside
development of 61 units. The development is expected to
commence before the end of 2002. This scheme will have a
completed value in excess of £12m. The current forward sales and
completions since the year end for Country & Metropolitan group
(excluding NorthCountry) is £15.4m.
The major difficulty we are experiencing is in obtaining planning
permissions. Politicians have now created a planning system which
is so complex that too few new homes are being built. This
serious shortage of supply is driving up prices, causing tremendous
frustration in the house building community who are prevented
from "getting on with the job". I cannot think of any other
business sector that suffers so much from government regulation
and interference.
Corporate activity
Having profitably disposed of our investment in Tay Homes PLC the
Board pursued the acquisition of NorthCountry Homes Group
Limited ("NorthCountry"), a specialist in low cost quality homes for
people on low incomes, which was concluded on 1 August 2002.
NorthCountry operates principally in the North of England and has
five trading subsidiaries. It completed 630 homes in its financial
year to 30 June 2002 and we expect further volume growth in the
current year. The integration of the enlarged group has taken place
smoothly and trading since 1 September 2002 has been particularly
strong with contracted and completed sales of £17.8m and forward
reservations of £10.9m. As a result of the acquisition of
NorthCountry, the Group will change its financial year end to 30th
June and accordingly will prepare its interim accounts for the 4
months to 31st December 2002.
The Group has recently accumulated a strategic stake of 9.98% in
an AIM quoted company, Headway PLC, a provider of managed
business space on 5 brownfield sites, totalling approximately 25
acres. These shares are currently held as a trade investment.
Prospects
The enlarged Group now has a diverse product range and a wide
geographical spread. Demand for our product in the current
economic climate remains strong as demonstrated by the strong
forward order book.
The Group’s comprehensive approach to residential and commercial
property development places it in an excellent position to secure
large urban renewal projects on brownfield sites which should
provide additional opportunities for NorthCountry. Our developments
are situated in appropriate locations in the markets we operate in
and I therefore anticipate further growth in the current year.

No.17 Nicholas Way, Northwood, Middlesex
A substantial detached 6 bedroom house, comprising approximately
5,500 sq ft. The construction is expected to complete Spring 2003.
The property has been sold from plan for £2.0m. I am delighted to report a year of tremendous progress for Country
& Metropolitan. 
Turnover was up by 67% to £32.3m with pre-tax profits before
amortisation of goodwill up by 81% to £3.99m. 
At the corporate level, highlights included the sale of our stake in
Tay Homes Plc for a profit of £1.1m and the acquisition of
NorthCountry Homes Group Ltd for a maximum consideration of
£14.5m (excluding costs), part of which was funded by the issue of
2,250,000 new shares in Country & Metropolitan. 
NorthCountry Homes was founded by Jolyon Harrison, the current
Managing Director and is a market leader in the provision of low
cost homes for sale in the North of England via five trading
subsidiaries. It completed 630 homes up to 30th June 2002 and
further volume growth is expected in the current year. 
NorthCountry has a land bank of 1,550 building plots owned with
planning permission and has secured substantial further land on
which it is seeking consent.
As widely reported in the press, there are concerns about the
housing market being overheated and it is true that the overall
house price inflation that has been seen over the last few years
cannot be sustainable for much longer. Particularly as the first time
buyers have been priced out of the market in large parts of the
South East of England and other "Hot Spots" around the country. 
As one of the smaller companies in the quoted sector, we are able to
adapt quickly to changing market conditions and having acquired
NorthCountry, I intend to refocus a large part of the existing Country &
Metropolitan business into the "Affordable Sector", particularly in the
South East, where we have some exciting new initiatives underway. 
Our current forward order book for the enlarged group is very
strong with forward sales of £44.1m. We have a wide geographic
spread and are currently building on 29 developments with homes
priced from £50,000 to £2m. 
I am pleased to report that in line with government guidance
approximately 70% of our developments are now on Brownfield sites.
The planning system in this country has now become a complete
farce with enormous delays and illogical decisions becoming
common place. It appears obvious that the government has little
understanding of what is going on at a local level with the difficulty
in obtaining consents forcing house prices higher due to lack of
supply coming through. 
However, despite the continued irritation of planning, our highly
skilled land teams are unearthing an exciting stream of new
opportunities for the Group, which should stand us in good stead
for the future.

NorthCountry Homes
16 Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002
The acquisition of NorthCountry Homes Group Limited
(“NCH”) for £14.5m was financed mainly by cash and
partly in C&M shares, resulting in the NCH
management holding 1,176,766 shares in C&M.
In its last full trading year NCH sold 630 units at an
average price of £63,000. The homes are often built
in derelict areas, mostly brownfield sites on land near
public sector homes. They are designed to encourage
council house tenants to become first time owner
occupiers, a section of the market overlooked by
many of the volume house builders.
These homes are ideal for those with a joint income
of less than £20,000 facilitating a mortgage that buys
a two or three bedroomed house and provides a
footing on the home ownership ladder.
The enlarged Group now has a diverse product range
and geographical spread. NCH is the market leader in
affordable housing for sale in the North and has a
land bank in excess of 1,500 plots. 
NCH has 5 operating subsidiary companies within its
Group; located in Lincolnshire, Pelham Homes,
Derbyshire, Whelmar Homes, Sunderland, Broseley
Homes, Nottinghamshire, Clarke Homes and Arundale
Homes in Lancashire and Yorkshire.

The site will take approximately 3 years to complete.

Typical street scene, NorthCountry homes development Accounting policies and standards
The accounts for the year ended 31 August 2002 have adopted the
transitional rules of Financial Reporting Standard ("FRS") 17
(Retirement Benefits) and FRS 19 (Deferred Taxation). The adoption
of FRS 19 has not had any material effect on the current year
results other than new disclosures.
Acquisition of NorthCountry Homes Group Limited
The acquisition of NorthCountry Homes Group Limited ("NCH") was
successfully completed on 1 August 2002 for a total estimated
consideration of £15.4m (including expenses) and consequently the
results for the year ended 31 August 2002 included one month’s
post acquisition trading. The consideration was satisfied by £10.2m
in cash (excluding costs), the issue of 2,250,000 ordinary shares in
the Company at 109.5p per share and a maximum earn out of
£1.875m. The net assets of NCH were reviewed and fair value
adjustments have been made as set out in note 16 to the accounts.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition was £5.3m.
Profit and loss account
The Group’s turnover increased by 67% from £19.3m to £32.3m and
£2.3m of this was generated by NCH. Gross profit increased to
£9.0m (2001: £6.5m) and the operating profit before amortisation
of goodwill was £5.1m (2001: £3.7m) of which £0.2m related to
NCH. Operating margins have reduced from 19.1% to 15.7% due to
an increase in sale proceeds from developments undertaken by the
Group as principals rather than through joint ventures. Net operating
expenses have increased in line with the growth of the business.
The sale of the Group’s investment in Tay Homes PLC realised a
profit of £1.06m. The profit on ordinary activities before
amortisation of goodwill and tax increased by 81% to £3.99m with
basic earnings per share increasing by 34% to 16.56p (2001:
12.35p). The directors have recommended a final dividend of 2.14p
per share resulting in a total of 2.75p for the year, an increase of
22% over the previous period.  
Capital structure and treasury policy
On 1 August 2002 the Company issued 2,250,000 ordinary shares
as part consideration for the acquisition of NCH.
The Group’s overall policy is to finance its operations through a
combination of shareholders’ funds, long term loans, bank loans
and cash in hand and at bank. Wherever possible the Group also
tries to secure deferred terms on acquisition of land.
In support of the acquisition of NCH, new three year committed
revolving credit facilities totalling £35m were arranged by the
Group with its principal bankers, Royal Bank of Scotland, primarily
for core borrowing requirements. The Group also arranged a three
year acquisition facility of £6.0m which was fully utilised upon the
acquisition of NCH.  
An overall offset arrangement between any cash and loan
balances exists for the calculation of interest. Interest rates are
either linked to LIBOR or base rates.The Group’s policy, which is
reviewed and agreed by the Board, is to be in a position to take
advantage of floating rates on part of the debt but also to be
protected against significant increases in interest rates by the use
of fixed rate loans or suitable hedging instruments. In accordance
with this policy the Group has a mixture of floating rate debt and
fixed rate hedging as shown in note 22 to the accounts. No new

18 Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002
“Profit before amortisation of goodwill and tax increased by 81% from £2.21m to £3.99m
and earnings per share has increased by 34% from 12.35p to 16.56p. Dividends have
increased by 22% from 2.25p to 2.75p with net assets per share standing at 102.7p.” fixed rate hedging was entered into during the year. The Group
had no foreign exchange exposure.
Cash flows 
The gearing at the year end reduced to 150% from 160% at the
previous year end after taking account of the cash consideration of
£10.2m paid for NCH (excluding costs). Total borrowings increased
from £23.0m to £29.1m at the year end. Against this the Group has
forward sales of £44.1m.  
Interest is written off as incurred and the charge for the year was
£2.3m which was supported by gross rental income of £1.1m. The
net cash flow generated from operations was £2.2m with £4.4m
being absorbed by an increase in debtors. In addition, the disposal
of our investment in Tay Homes PLC generated £7.8m of cash. The
acquisition of NCH resulted in a net cash inflow of £2.9m. 
Balance Sheet
The increase in tangible fixed assets is primarily due to the
continued refurbishment and improvement of the infrastructure at
the Business Park in Upper Rissington. The freehold and investment
properties have also been revalued by the directors resulting in a
revaluation surplus of £0.4m. The acquisition of NCH has generated
goodwill of £5.3m which is being amortised over 10 years.
Stocks and work in progress have increased to £31.9m (2001:
£19.5m) as a result of the acquisition. Debtors have increased
mainly due to land sales made prior to the year end.
The Group’s net current asset position has improved significantly
over the previous year end as have shareholders’ funds with net
assets per share standing at 102.7p per share at 31 August 2002
(2001: 86.4p).

promotion of urban villages together with the construction of new

share to be paid on 7 April 2003 to ordinary shareholders on the

Policy for payment of creditors

terms for all business and therefore there is no consistent policy
as to the terms used. We make sure that suppliers know the terms
on which business will take place and it is our policy to abide by
the terms. At 31 August 2002, the trade creditors of the Company
represented 125 days (2001: 115 days) of purchases made by the
Company.

During the year the Group made various charitable donations
totalling £2,000 (2001: £2,000). No political donations were made
in either year.
European Monetary Union (EMU)
The Group has no exposure to foreign exchange and will monitor
the implications of EMU.
Auditors
Our auditors, Smith & Williamson, have advised us that they have
incorporated their audit practice as a separate legal entity, Nexia
Audit Limited. A resolution to appoint Nexia Audit Limited will be
proposed at the next Annual General Meeting.

Responsibilities of the Directors
in respect of the preparation of the accounts
Company law requires directors to prepare accounts for each
financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of
the Group for that period. In preparing those accounts, the
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the accounts; and
• prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in
business.
The Directors of Country & Metropolitan Plc are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the Group and to
enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking
such steps as are reasonably open to them, to safeguard the
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other
irregularities.
22 Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 August 2002 The Board has considered the requirements of the Combined Code
adopted by the London Stock Exchange in performing the
Corporate Governance of the Group. The Company has complied
throughout the year ended 31 August 2002, except where noted,
with the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code which
relate to the principles of Good Governance and Code of Best
Practice.
The Board comprises of three Executive Directors and two Non-
Executive Directors. Of the latter, Mr D E Laing is considered to be
totally independent within the meaning of provision A.3.2 of the
Combined Code. The second, Mr J M Van Gelder is regarded as
effectively independent; although he is a representative of one of
the substantial shareholders, Allied Commercial Exporters Limited
("Allied") who own 8.81% of the issued share capital of the
Company. In view of the size and composition of the Board it is
considered to be inappropriate to recognise a senior independent
Director as required by provision A.2.1 and for a Nomination
Committee to be established under provision A.5.1. Under the
Articles of Association of the Company at least one third of the
Board is required to retire by rotation and offer for re-election.
Mr D E Laing has a letter of appointment effective from 1 March
1997 and terminable upon not less than six months written notice
by either party. Mr J M Van Gelder, is a representative of Allied who
are entitled to appoint and retain a seat on the Board so long as they
beneficially own any of the 10% Unsecured Loan Stock 2002 in
the Company.
Board and Committees
All members of the Board are equally accountable under the law
for the proper stewardship of the Company’s affairs. The roles of
the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and clearly defined.
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the running of the Board
and the Chief Executive is responsible for the running of the
business of the Group.
The Board meets regularly on a formal basis and is supplied with
appropriate information to enable it to discharge its duties. There
is an agreed schedule of matters reserved for the Board for
collective decision. The Executive Directors meet informally between
formal Board meetings to focus on strategy, cash management,
financial performance, major transactions and control of operations
generally.  
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to the Audit and
Remuneration Committees.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises of the two Non-Executive
Directors.  It meets once a year with the auditors and is
responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the
Group is properly reported on and monitored. In particular it
focuses on accounting policies, compliance and internal control. It
also reviews the scope and results of the audit and its cost
effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the
auditors.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises of the two Non-Executive
Directors and the Chief Executive, Mr S D Wicks. It meets at least
once each year and reviews remuneration and terms of
employment of Executive Directors and certain senior employees.
In particular, the Committee determines specific remuneration 
packages for each Executive Director. The fees for the Non-
Executive Directors are decided by a committee of the Board
comprising all the Executive Directors. The Directors’ Remuneration
Report is set out on pages 24 to 25.
Investor Relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders as
appropriate. All shareholders are kept up to date with the affairs
of the Group through the Annual and Interim Reports.  Save in
exceptional circumstances, all members of the Board attend the
Annual General Meeting ("AGM") which is used to communicate
with private and institutional shareholders. The chairmen of the
Audit and Remuneration Committees are also available at the AGM
to answer questions.
Internal Control
In applying the principle that the Board should maintain a sound
system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment
and the assets of the Group, the Directors recognise that they have
overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a
system of internal control to provide them with reasonable
assurance regarding effective and efficient operations, internal
financial control and compliance with laws and regulations.  The
Group has a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks the Group faces. The Board reviews this process on
an ongoing basis, which has been in place throughout the year
and up to the date of approval of the accounts and which is in
accordance with Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the
Combined Code published in September 1999. Such a system is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the control system that operated throughout
the period covered by the accounts are described below.  
- The Group has a defined organisation and management
structure to ensure a proper division of responsibility and
authority.
-The Board has identified areas of risk which are reviewed on a
regular basis for their relevance and appropriateness to the
business.
-Control procedures are in place to address key areas of risk.
These include authorisation procedures over land purchases
which are considered and approved by the Executive Directors
before contracts are entered into.  Controls are also in place to
cover other areas such as payment of invoices, cash control and
expansion of the business.   
- The Group’s systems provide weekly updates on key statistics in
relation to sales.  In addition a bank reconciliation of the
current account cash balances is prepared on a regular basis
identifying all receipts and payments.  Detailed short term and
two year forecasts are also used by the Board and the Executive
Directors to control the cash requirements of the Group.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future.  For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the accounts.

28 Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year ended 31 August 2002 Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies of the Group which have been
consistently applied in dealing with items which are considered
material in relation to the Group’s accounts are as follows:-
(a) Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with
applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost
basis of accounting as modified by the revaluation of certain
fixed assets.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company
and all its subsidiary undertakings from the date on which
control of each undertaking passes to the Group. Acquisitions are
accounted for under the acquisition method.
In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985,
the Company has not presented a separate profit and loss
account.
Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the
Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of
the voting rights and over which it exerts significant influence
are treated as associated undertakings.  The Group accounts
include the appropriate share of these undertakings’ results.
(c) Turnover
Turnover comprises amounts receivable from house sales, the
total value of contracting work executed during the period,
amounts receivable and related fees from project
management services, proceeds from disposal of sites
assembled for resale, rental income and amounts invoiced by
the Group in respect of other services rendered during the
period excluding value added tax.
(d) Recognition of income on property activities
Disposals of properties are accounted for at the date of
exchange, where there is a legally binding, unconditional,
irrevocable contract and where completion takes place by the
date of approval of the accounts.
Where the Group undertakes developments with other
investors and profits are shared and paid by way of a
development fee, income is recognised when individual units
within the development are sold.
(e) Cost of letting new developments
All costs incurred in the initial letting of development
properties are capitalised.  Any subsequent costs expended on
re-letting the properties are charged to the profit and loss
account in the year they are incurred.
(f) Investments
Investments are valued at cost less provision for impairment
in value.
(g) Investment properties
Investment properties are stated at their open market value at the
balance sheet date.
Surpluses or deficits on individual properties are transferred to
the investment revaluation reserve, except that a deficit
which is expected to be permanent and which is in excess of
any previously recognised surplus over cost relating to the
same property, or the reversal of such a deficit, is charged (or
credited) to the profit and loss account.  Other deficits on
revaluation not expected to be permanent are taken to the
statement of total recognised gains and losses.
In accordance with SSAP 19, no depreciation or amortisation is
provided in respect of freehold and leasehold investment
properties where the unexpired term of the lease is more
than 20 years.  This treatment for certain of the Group’s
investment properties is a departure from the requirements of
the Companies Act 1985 concerning depreciation of fixed
assets.  However, these properties are not held for
consumption but for investment and the Directors consider
that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the
accounts to give a true and fair view.  Depreciation or
amortisation is only one of the factors reflected in the annual
valuation, and the amount which might otherwise have been
shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
(h) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation less
the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets on a
straight line basis over their useful economic lives at the
following annual rates:
Plant and equipment 25%
Furniture, fixtures and fittings 20% - 25%
Motor Vehicles 25%
Freehold land is not depreciated in the accounts of the Group.
The Directors consider that freehold properties are maintained
in such a state of repair that their residual value is at least
equal to their net book value.  As a result the corresponding
depreciation would not be material and therefore is not
charged in the profit and loss account. The Directors perform
annual impairment reviews in accordance with the
requirements of FRS15 and FRS11 to ensure that the carrying
value is not lower than the recoverable amount.
(i) Intangible assets - goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings,
representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration
given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities acquired, is capitalised and written off on a straight
line basis over its useful economic life. The useful economic
life of goodwill is assessed separately for each acquisition and
is currently 10 years. Provision is made for any impairment.
(j) Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and
net realisable value.  Cost comprises all expenditure directly
related to development or land assembly projects.  Net
realisable value represents the Directors’ estimate of the net
proceeds receivable after taking account of market conditions
prevailing at the date of approval of the accounts.

Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 August 2002 30 Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 August 2002 continued
(k) Long term contracts
Profit on long term contracts is taken as the work is carried
out if the outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
The profit included is calculated on a prudent basis to reflect
the proportion of the work carried out at the period end, by
recording turnover and related costs as contract activity
progresses.  Turnover is calculated by reference to valuation of
the work carried out to date.  Full provision is made for losses
on all contracts in the period in which they are first foreseen.
(l) Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the result for the period,
which takes account of taxation deferred because of timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for
taxation purposes and the treatment under the Group’s
accounting policies.  The accounting policy in respect of
deferred tax for the year ended 31 August 2002 differs from
that used in prior years due to the adoption of Financial
Reporting Standard 19 “Deferred Taxation”. The effect of the
change in accounting policy on the profit reported in the prior
year was immaterial and accordingly no adjustment has been
made to the comparitive figures.
Deferred tax is provided for on a full provision basis on all
timing differences, which have arisen but not reversed at the
balance sheet date. No timing differnces are recognised in
respect of gains on sale of assets where those gains have
been rolled over into replacement assets. Deferred tax assets
are recognised to the extent that they are recoverable, that is,
on the basis of all available evdence, it is more likely than not
that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the
future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be
deducted. Any assets and liabilities recognised have not been
discounted.
(m)Leased assets
Fixed assets that are the subject of finance leases or hire
purchase contracts are capitalised and included in tangible
fixed assets.  The corresponding liability is included in
creditors.  The finance cost element of the lease or hire
purchase contracts is charged to the profit and loss account
over the period of the lease.
Expenditure on leases other than finance leases ("operating
leases") is charged to the profit and loss account in the period
it is incurred.
(n) Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme
and contributes into a small self administered scheme for one
of its directors.  Contributions payable for the period are
charged to the profit and loss account.
The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme. The
expected cost of providing pensions under this scheme, as
calculated periodically by professionally qualified actuaries, is
charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost
over the service lives of employees in the scheme in such a
way that the pension cost is substantially level percentage of
current and expected future pensionable payroll.
(o) Treasury instruments
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage financial risk.
Interest charges and financial liabilities are stated after taking
account of these swaps. 1. Turnover and segmental analysis

The book value of the assets and liabilities shown above has been taken from the management accounts of NCH at the date of
acquisition.
The accounting policy alignments, which align the accounting policies of the acquired group with those adopted by Country &
Metropolitan, relate principally to the capitalisation of design costs and other pre-development expenditure within work in progress and
the recognition of income on plots which have exchanged and where legal completion takes place by the date of approval of the
accounts.
The other valuation adjustments relate to the write down of work in progress following an assessment of its realisable value and to
provisions in respect of the funding deficit on the NCH defined benefit pension scheme.
The deferred consideration is an estimate and the actual amount will depend on the profits of NCH in the two years ending 30 June 2004
but is limited to a maximum of £1.875m.
As a consequence, the goodwill calculation is provisional and subject to the adjustment of this estimate.

4.67 years (2001: 5.5 years).

28. Contingent liabilities
The Company, together with 12 other Group undertakings, have given a corporate guarantee to the lender in respect of the Group’s
committed bank facilities of £35m and term loans of £6m. The amount drawn down against these facilities at 31 August 2002 was £27m.
The Company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the observance and performance by its former subsidiary undertaking of all
the stipulations and obligations contained in a contract for the purchase of a site including the prompt payment in full of the sum of £3.7m
(2001: £4.1m).
The Company has given guarantees against mortgage loans amounting to £6.4m at 31 August 2002 (2001: £4.9m).
In 1996 an order was made against one of the subsidiary undertakings, Country & Metropolitan Homes Surrey Limited ("Surrey") for failure
to complete the sale of a property.  The order included the payment of damages and interest to be assessed by the court at a later
hearing. Damages and interest have not yet been assessed and during the year ended 31 August 2001 the claimant gave notice that it
intends to apply to the court for assessment of damages and interest. The Directors are not able to quantify the amount of damages and
interest as they have received insufficient details from the claimant. The Directors believe that the claimant will not recover substantial
damages for the amount of loss of bargain for failure to complete the sale of the property as the contractual price was the market value of
the property.
The Company has provided a maximum guarantee of £750,000 in relation to the obligations of Jacksons (Piccadilly Basin) Limited under a
land and development loan provided to that company. Country & Metropolitan Homes PLC has provided a maximum guarantee of £500,000
in relation to the obligations of Robinsons (Moseley) Limited under a land and development facility provided to that company. The Group is
developing and managing projects on behalf of Robinsons (Moseley) Limited and Jacksons (Piccadilly Basin) Limited, both of which are
unconnected to the Group.
There are performance bonds and other engagements, including those in respect of joint venture partners, undertaken in the ordinary
course of business from which it is anticipated that no material liabilities will arise.
In addition the Company and certain subsidiary undertakings are required from time to time to act as guarantor for the observance and
performance by fellow subsidiary undertakings of contracts entered into in the normal course of their business.

32. Pensions
The Company operates defined contribution pension schemes for some of its Directors and employees. The assets of the schemes are
held separately from those of the Company in independently administered funds. The contributions made during the period
amounted to £104,000 (2001: £82,000).
NorthCountry Homes Group Ltd (“NCH”) which has a financial year end of 30 June, operates a funded defined benefit pension
scheme. The assets are all held in separate trustee administered funds. The scheme is subject to triennial valuation by independent
actuaries using the projected unit method. The most recent valuation was conducted at 1 July 2001, assuming that the real valuation
rate of investment return would be 6.5% per annum and that the real rate of salary increases would average 5% per annum. The
rate of contribution by NCH is 12.9%. The contribution by NCH for the for the period from 1 August 2002 to 31 August 2002 was
£14,000, including £2,000 relating to death-in-service. 
The valuation at 1 July 2001 showed that the market value of the scheme assets amounted to £272,000 and the actuarial value of
these assets represented 88% of the benefits that had accrued to members. The actuarial valuation showed a deficit of £38,000 after
allowing for future increases in earnings. 
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at July 2001 and updated by Scottish
Life to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 30 June 2002, the balance sheet
date of NCH. Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 30 June 2002. The financial assumptions used to calculate scheme
liabilities under FRS 17 are: 
Valuation method 30 June 30 June
2002 2001
Discount rate 5.7% 6.5%
Increase in pensionable salaries 5.0% 5.0%
Inflation assumption 3.0% 3.0%
Increase in pension in payment 3.0% 3.0%
The assets in the scheme and the expected rate of return were:
Long term Long term
expected 30 June expected 30 June
rate of 2002 rate of 2001 
return £’000 return £’000
Insurance policies 5.6% 385 5.6% 279
Total market value of assets 385 279
Present value of scheme liabilities (470) (351)
Deficit in the scheme (85) (72)
Related deferred tax asset 25 22
Net pension deficit (60) (50)
The full deficit of the NCH defined benefit scheme has been provided and reflected as a fair value adjustment on the acquisition 
of NCH.
FRS 17 requires more detailed disclosures. However, given the small nature of the scheme relative to the business, these are not
considered necessary.
33. Related Party Transactions
During the period the Group received development fees of £163,000 (2001: £156,000) from the associated undertaking, Country &
Metropolitan VCT Limited.
Mrs M Malde received fees totalling £15,000 for services provided in respect of arranging the Group’s internet service provider, email
systems, design, configuration, development and implementation of the Group’s website and associated maintenance services.  We have audited the accounts of Country and Metropolitan PLC for the year
ended 31 August 2002 on pages 26 to 46. These accounts have been
prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation
of certain fixed assets and the accounting policies set out therein. We have
also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is
described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’
Remuneration Report and the accounts in accordance with applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the accounts give a true and fair
view and whether the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.  We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’
Report is not consistent with the accounts, if the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if the information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the company and
other members of the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the
company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited accounts.  This other information
comprises only the Financial Highlights, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief
Executive’s Review, the Operational Review, the Financial Review, the
Directors’ Report, the Corporate Governance Statements and the unaudited
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the accounts.  Our responsibilities do not extend to any
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing
Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.  An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited.  It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the accounts, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s and the
Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the accounts and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the accounts and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited.
We do not, in giving our opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or in
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent
in writing.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and the Group as at 31 August 2002 and of the profit of the
Group for the year then ended; and
• the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985.

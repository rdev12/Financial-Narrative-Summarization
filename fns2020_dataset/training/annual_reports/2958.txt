Contents 2 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 2002
P&O Princess has enjoyed great success over the past few years as part of the
P&O Group and then, after the demerger two years ago, as an independent
company. During that time P&O Princess has grown considerably and further
modernised its fleet, expanded its North American, European and Australian
businesses and established a position in the fast growing German cruise sector. As
we have done this, we have continued to record good financial results. All this has
been achieved through the creativity, professionalism and dedication of our
management and seafarers and staff to whom I would like to pay special tribute.
On 8 January 2003, your Board approved and recommended Carnival Corporation’s
offer to combine with P&O Princess.
The UK parent company of the combined group will be called Carnival PLC and the
Dual Listed Company (DLC) structure will enable all shareholders to continue
to invest in the cruise industry – an industry that is one of the fastest growing
sectors of the leisure market and has significant growth potential in the major
vacation markets of North America, Europe, Australasia and South America.
The combined group will be the world’s largest cruise company. Its strength will
include having some of the finest cruise brands in the world such as Carnival, Holland
America, Cunard, Costa, Princess Cruises, P&O Cruises, Swan Hellenic and AIDA.
Each of these brands will continue to focus on its target market and in particular, P&O
Cruises will continue to operate with the best of British traditions. The combination
will provide our passengers with a truly broad range of brands and greater choice.
As I will be standing down from the board of P&O Princess on the expected
completion of the combination with Carnival in Spring 2003, I would like to
take this opportunity to thank my Board colleagues for their wise counsel and
dedicated efforts.
Finally, on a personal note, I have known Micky Arison for many years. We
share similar values and pride in our respective companies and I have every 
confidence in the future of the combined group.
A word from your Chairman
THE LORD STERLING OF PLAISTOW, GCVO, CBE, CHAIRMAN
February 6, 2003 Since becoming an independent
company in October 2000, P&O
Princess Cruises has expanded by
around 30%, grown its brands and
launched new cruise lines within the
fast growing German and UK cruise
sectors. It has modernised its fleet
and introduced new ways to give
passengers more personal choice
and greater flexibility within their
cruise holiday experience. Its cost
structure has improved through the
introduction of larger and more
cost effective ships and through
management action, including the
integration of systems and purchasing
across its global operations.
We believe that the cruise industry
has strong long-term growth potential
underpinned by demographic trends
and high levels of customer satisfaction.
Through continued investment in its
well-known local brands, and with
its modern fleet and strong global
reach, your company has improved
its potential for continued success.
By combining with Carnival under a
DLC structure to create the largest
cruise vacation group in the world,
your company will be even better
placed to capture future growth in
this industry. The new group will
include some of the best known
cruise brands globally and will be able
to offer a wider range of vacation
choices and be better placed to
attract customers from land-based
vacations to cruise vacations. The
DLC structure allows a continued
participation in the future of this
industry for all our shareholders. With
significant growth plans and a strong
position in this industry, the combined
group offers exciting career opportunities
for its employees.
I would like to thank the staff of
P&O Princess for their commitment
to the company. They have delivered
outstanding vacations for our customers
throughout this period of growth
and development for the company.
They have helped to improve the
efficiency of all our operations and
to deliver strong performance and
enhanced shareholder value. Their
contribution has been outstanding.
The continued strength of our brands
is testament to the professionalism
and dedication of our staff.

PETER RATCLIFFE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 4 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 2002
Background to the cruise industry
Cruising is one of the fastest growing segments of the travel industry. Over
the last five years, demand for cruising within North America, the largest
cruise sector in the world, has grown by an average of 8% per year.
Although Europe is one of the largest vacation markets, the cruise industry
there still remains relatively underdeveloped. Growth rates over the past
five years have been even stronger in Europe than in North America and
there is significant potential for future growth.
We believe that growth in cruising has been driven by demographic trends,
together with high levels of customer satisfaction and the introduction of
innovative new facilities onboard ships which continues to help generate
increased demand.
Cruising today appeals to a broad spectrum of individuals encompassing all
ages and interests. It has traditionally appealed to the middle and older segments
of the population. These segments are forecast to expand over the next 10 years.
Cruise vacations generally have high levels of customer satisfaction, which
we believe generates strong levels of repeat business. The cruise industry
continues to introduce greater personal choice for its customers through
the introduction of private balconies on outside cabins and multiple restaurants
and entertainment amenities. We believe that these innovative new facilities
and the increased levels of choice introduced onboard cruise ships are
enhancing customer satisfaction levels.

Princess’ modern fleet offers customers
a broad range of amenity-filled ships.
The fleet has an industry-leading 
proportion of balcony cabins and has
a wide variety of dining and 
entertainment options onboard. 
The scheduled programme of fleet 
modernisation and the introduction
of new ships will increase the proportion
of balconied cabins across the fleet
from 39% to 52% between December
31, 2001 and December 31, 2003
and will reduce the weighted average
berth age of the fleet from 6.4 to 5.4
years over the same period.
Princess Cruises was among the first
companies to recognise the increasing
demand for personal choice in cruising
and to create a product that caters
for this trend, through introducing
vessels characterised by a high 
proportion of balcony cabins and a
wide variety of dining and entertainment
choices. We have continued to 
innovate and give our passengers
more opportunities to customise
their holiday experience including
through the introduction of our 
popular flexible dining programme -
Personal Choice dining.

P&O Princess Cruises is committed to helping to conserve the natural environment. To
minimise harmful impacts that may be associated with our wastes and discharges, we have
sought to adopt more efficient operational and management practices and to equip our
ships with improved treatment technologies.
Managing our fossil fuel consumption and associated air emissions is of prime importance.
We strive to reduce emissions levels through investing in the development of new technologies
and through effective fuel management programmes.
The majority of our ships under construction are being fitted with environmentally cleaner
engines designed to reduce nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions. Coral Princess is the
first in the series of newbuilds to be in operation with these environmental technologies.
Island Princess, Diamond Princess and Sapphire Princess will also be fitted with similar
technologies. We are working with leading engine manufacturers to develop systems in
order to enable control technologies to be retrofitted to other newbuilds and older 
vessels in the fleet.
Our shore power system in Juneau, Alaska has been operating successfully and we have
now equipped six ships in our fleet with the appropriate connections. While in port, the
connected ship is able to turn off its diesel generators and boilers and run all onboard
services from surplus hydroelectric power and from shore based facilities, thereby cutting
smoke emissions and fuel consumption.
Control of our sea emissions is also of primary importance and we continue to promote
the development of innovative systems and processes to treat our ballast, bilge and
wastewaters. P&O Princess Cruises was one of the first cruise companies to trial and
install technologies for effectively treating ballast water, with three of our ships now operating
and testing various system designs. We are in the process of equipping our ships with
internationally approved coalescing and centrifugal oily water separators. In addition, we
are implementing a programme of fitting bio-membrane wastewater treatment technology
systems to our new and existing ships.
P&O Princess Cruises also places a high priority on minimising and responsibly managing
waste production and on ensuring that we have in place effective waste management
standards as well as waste sorting and segregation policies. Our waste minimisation initiatives
include the use of digital x-ray equipment and water-based chemical dry-cleaning systems
together with a programme to reduce the number of chemicals used on board. 18 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 2002
2002 OPERATING REVIEW
NORTH AMERICA
Throughout 2002 we continued to
expand and modernise the Princess fleet.
During the year, two newbuilds, Star
Princess and Coral Princess were delivered;
two former Renaissance Cruises’ ships,
Tahitian Princess and the new Pacific
Princess, were added to the fleet;
Crown Princess and Ocean Princess
were transferred to our German and
UK fleets respectively and the 1971 built
Pacific Princess was withdrawn.
Star Princess was introduced successfully
to our fleet in February 2002. Like her
sisterships, Grand Princess and Golden
Princess, the ship has a large proportion
of cabins with private balconies and features
multiple dining and entertainment venues,
including three theatres, eight restaurants,
an AOL internet café and a nine-hole
putting course. The wide variety of
amenities and restaurants demonstrates
Princess’ flexible approach to the cruise
experience, ‘Personal Choice Cruising’.
As our first mega cruise ship to be 
positioned on the West Coast of North
America, Star Princess has helped
strengthen our product offering in the
Alaska and Mexico trades.
Coral Princess, the first of the latest
panamax design ships from Chantiers de
l’Atlantique, was delivered to the
Princess fleet in December 2002 and
started operations in January 2003. She
is the largest of the line's ships to be able
to transit the Panama Canal and some
75% of her cabins have private balconies.
In October 2002, two former Renaissance
Cruises’ vessels were acquired under 
a lease purchase arrangement for
deployment in P&O Princess Cruises’
North American and Australian fleets.
These 670 lower berth ships have a
wide variety of dining alternatives and
have over two thirds of cabins with their
own balconies.
Tahitian Princess, the former R4, was
introduced into the Princess fleet in
December and will sail year round in
French Polynesia. Pacific Princess, the
former R3, will sail for six months of the
year as part of the Princess fleet offering
itineraries throughout the Pacific Region.
For the other six months of the year she
will sail as part of the P&O Cruises
Australian fleet. Pacific Princess was

GROUP STRATEGY
On 8 January 2003, our Board recommended the proposed Carnival DLC 
transaction. The strategy of the Combined Group after the expected completion of
the Carnival DLC transaction will be set out in the shareholder documents 
relating to that proposed transaction. 19 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC
introduced to the Australian fleet in
November 2002 and will sail under 
the Princess brand from May to
November 2003.
Crown Princess was transferred out of the
Princess fleet to our new destination-
oriented German brand, A’ROSA, in June
2002 where she is now sailing as A’ROSA
BLU. Ocean Princess was transferred to
the P&O Cruises UK fleet in November
2002 where she is sailing as Oceana.
Additionally, after some 30 years of service,
Pacific Princess, the original ‘Love Boat’,
was withdrawn from the Princess fleet,
in November 2002.
Over the next two years, Princess will
be taking delivery of four newbuildings:
Island Princess, Diamond Princess,
Caribbean Princess and Sapphire
Princess. Island Princess is the second of
the panamax ships from Chantiers de
l’Atlantique and is due to enter service
in July 2003. She will initially be deployed
in Alaska.
Diamond and Sapphire Princess are the
two new mega ships under construction
at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ Nagasaki
shipyard. Over 70% of cabins on these
ships will be outside cabins and more than
75% of these will have private balconies. In
October 2002, a major fire broke out
onboard one of the ships whilst under
construction in the shipyard. The two ships
from the yard will now be delivered in
February and May 2004. The first will
have its inaugural season in Mexico and
the second ship will initially be based in
Seattle for roundtrip Alaska cruises.
Finally the 3,100 lower berth ship,
Caribbean Princess, which is the fourth
Grand Princess style ship being built in
Fincantieri, is due to join the Princess
fleet in the second quarter of 2004.
These changes to the Princess fleet will
give customers a broader choice of
amenity-filled ships. By December 31,
2003, the proportion of balconied cabins
in the Princess fleet will be 52% and the
weighted average berth age of the fleet
will be under six years. We believe these
steps will further improve Princess’ cost
structure and revenue-earning potential
thereby improving its competitive position
in North America.
Princess has continued to differentiate
its product by introducing new ways to
give passengers greater flexibility and
more personal choice. Personal Choice
cruising has been well received by our
passengers. In particular, Personal Choice
dining, which enables passengers to
choose between true restaurant style
dining and the more traditional cruise
experience of fixed seating, has proved
to be popular with our guests.
A leader in providing cruise tours to
Alaska, Princess Cruises opened its fifth
wilderness lodge in Alaska in May 2002.
Princess Cruises now owns and operates
approximately 1,100 hotel rooms in
Alaska. The new lodge, which is on the
Copper River, proved popular during
the Alaska summer season and has
enabled us to grow our cruise tour
product in this important trade.
Alaskan Wilderness lodge - opens in Alaska June 2002 A'ROSA BLU introduced to our German fleet UNITED KINGDOM
The UK is one of the largest vacation
markets in the world. The UK cruise
sector has been one of the fastest 
growing cruise sectors in the world with
an average annual growth of around
17% between 1995 and 2000. During
2002, P&O Princess has improved its
position in this important sector.
In the summer, we launched Ocean
Village, a new cruise brand aimed at
younger passengers looking for a
relaxed and informal holiday in the sun.
From May 2003, Ocean Village, which is
currently sailing in the P&O Cruises fleet
as Arcadia, will provide one and two-
week Mediterranean cruises, together
with cruise and stay holidays based on
two alternating seven-night itineraries
sailing out of Majorca. The ship will be
deployed in the Caribbean in winter.
She will provide a relaxed and informal
cruise experience with an emphasis on
health and well being.
P&O Cruises is one of best-known
British cruise brands. During 2002, P&O
Princess took steps to expand and
develop the brand. In November 2002,
we introduced Oceana to the fleet. She
is the second P&O Cruises' ship to 
provide 24-hour dining options, giving
passengers greater choice and flexibility.
Of Oceana's 600 outside cabins, almost
70 per cent have private balconies.
Operating in the Caribbean during her
maiden season, Oceana has introduced
several new ports of call including
Cristobal in Panama, Costa Maya in
Mexico and Princess Cays, the Bahamian
private island operated by Princess Cruises.
Oceana will be deployed this summer in
Europe. Following 24 years of service in
the P&O Princess Cruises fleet, Victoria
was withdrawn in November 2002.
In May 2003, Adonia, currently sailing as
Sea Princess, will join the P&O Cruises
fleet to replace Arcadia, which will be
transferred to Ocean Village. Adonia will be
dedicated to adults and will be based in
Europe for her inaugural season. By the end
of 2003, the P&O Cruises fleet will have
a weighted average berth age of less than
six years and over a third of all cabins in
the fleet will have a private balcony.
In March 2002, we announced the expansion
of our successful discovery cruise brand,
Swan Hellenic, through the replacement of
our existing ship, Minerva, with the charter

to offer a wider range of destinations in its
discovery itineraries than the original ship.
GERMANY
Cruising represents only a small proportion
of the German vacation market, which is
one of the largest vacation markets in the
world. We believe that cruising in Germany
has a significant potential for future growth.
During 2002, our German operations
underwent significant expansion, with the
first cruises of a new destination-oriented
brand, A’ROSA, and the expansion of
our successful clubship brand, AIDA.
In July 2002, our ocean-going vessel, A’ROSA
BLU (the former Crown Princess) entered
into service. She was deployed in the Baltic in
Summer 2002. In May 2002, we introduced
two river cruise vessels, A’ROSA BELLA
and A’ROSA DONNA and started river
cruises on the Danube. Two new river
cruise vessels are on order, A’ROSA MIA
due for delivery in Spring 2003 and an
unnamed vessel due in Spring 2004.
AIDA is one of the best-recognised
cruise brands in Germany. In May 2002,
we doubled the capacity in our AIDA
brand through the successful introduction
of our second club ship, AIDAvita. A
third clubship, AIDAaura, is scheduled
for delivery in April 2003.
AUSTRALIA
In Australia, we expanded our capacity
through the introduction of Pacific
Princess in November 2002. This 670
lower berth ship will operate on a split
deployment between P&O Cruises
Australia and Princess Cruises. For the
six months of the year that coincide
with the southern hemisphere summer,
the ship will offer premium cruises to
French New Caledonia and elsewhere
in the South Pacific under the P&O
Cruises Australia brand. 
With the addition of the Pacific Princess
premium product to the existing 
contemporary product offered by the
Pacific Sky, P&O Cruises Australia will
increase its capacity by 30% and provide
products designed to appeal to a wide
range of Australian consumer tastes. The principal drivers of our profitability are
our capacity (measured in passenger cruise
days), and our net revenue yields and
underlying unit costs. Definitions of these
terms are provided in the Glossary of
terms on page 76.
For the year as a whole, passenger cruise
days increased by 13% over 2001. Within
this, Princess’ passenger cruise days grew
by 9% due mainly to the introduction of
Star Princess in February 2002 and the
inclusion of Golden Princess (delivered in
May 2001) for the full year, offset by the
transfers during 2002 of Crown Princess
to A’ROSA and Ocean Princess to P&O
Cruises. Passenger cruise days in Europe
and Australia grew by 20% due mainly to
the expansion in the German market with
the delivery of AIDAvita in May 2002 and
the introduction of A’ROSA BLU (formerly
Crown Princess) in June 2002. The UK and
Australian businesses also grew, with most
of that growth coming in the fourth quarter.
Net revenue yields, including on board
revenue, were 4% lower on a like for like
basis than for 2001. This reflects the impact
on yields of the disruption to bookings for
Princess in the period after the events of
11 September 2001. Underlying unit costs
were 8% lower than those in 2001.
Operating profit for the year, before 
transaction costs, was $415.7 million against
$361.3 million in 2001. The interest charge
increased to $74.0 million due to the
increase in borrowings following the delivery
of new ships, offset by lower interest rates.
Profit before tax and transaction costs
increased by 13% to $342.9 million.
The tax rate (before transaction costs)
remained at 5%, reflecting the tax advantages
that the company enjoys as an international
shipping business, including participation in
the tonnage tax regime in the U.K. The
adoption of Financial Reporting Standard
No. 19 'Deferred Tax' (FRS19) has resulted
in a restatement of the 2001 comparatives
which now include an additional one off
credit of $96.8 million on entry into 
tonnage tax (see note 1). After tax and
minority interests, but before transaction
costs, profits were $325.8 million. After
deducting transaction costs, profits were
$208.8 million. These figures compare with
$286.3 million of profits originally reported
for 2001, a figure that was restated to $383.1
million following the adoption of FRS19.
Adjusted earnings per share/ADS, excluding
transaction costs in 2002 and exceptional
tax items in 2001, were 47.1c/$1.88, 
compared with 41.3c/$1.65 in 2001 (see
note 7). After transaction costs, earnings
per share/ADS in 2002 were 30.2c/$1.21.
Dividends
The fourth quarter interim dividend was 3
cents per share (12 cents per ADS), bringing
the dividend for the year to 12 cents per
share (48 cents per ADS) (2001 12 cents
per share, 48 cents per ADS).
The annual dividend is covered 2.5 times
by basic earnings per share of 30.2 cents.
Capital
During 2002 the Company issued 829,191
ordinary shares following the exercise of
share options.
Capital commitments
As at December 31, 2002, the Group had
future capital commitments in respect of its
five ocean cruise ships and two riverboats
on order at that date of $1,790m million.
These vessels are scheduled to enter service
in 2003 and 2004. Of the total commitment

2002 RESULTS
In 2002 operating profit before transaction costs increased by 15%. The results reflect
the underlying strength of our business and our success in driving down unit costs
while continuing to deliver outstanding vacations for our customers. 23 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC
as at December 31, 2002, it is expected
that U.S.$610 million will be incurred in
2003 and U.S.$1,180 million in 2004.
Financial risk
We use derivative financial instruments to
manage financial risks associated with our
business. The main risks we are exposed
to are foreign currency and interest rate
risks. We do not undertake speculative
transactions.
Foreign currency risk
We report our results in U.S. dollars. In
2002 approximately 30% of our operating
profit was generated by P&O Cruises and
Swan Hellenic in the U.K., AIDA and
A’ROSA in Germany and P&O Cruises
Australia. Their local currencies are sterling,
euro and the Australian dollar respectively.
Any appreciation of the U.S. dollar against
these currencies reduces our reported
U.S. dollar operating profit but the impact
is partially mitigated by some interest costs
being incurred in these currencies.
Approximately 40% of our net operating
assets are held in sterling, euro and
Australian dollars. Currency movements
can significantly affect the U.S. dollar 
consolidated balance sheet with this effect
being mitigated by borrowings in these
local currencies.
Changes in exchange rates may also affect
our obligations under ship building contracts.
When the individual businesses enter into
capital expenditure commitments in currencies
other than their main local currency, these
commitments are normally hedged using
forward contracts and currency swaps in
order to fix the cost when converted to
the local currency.
Interest rate risk
To protect the financial results against
movements in interest rates, P&O Princess
Cruises maintains a significant portion of its
borrowings at a fixed rate of interest. At
December 31, 2002, approximately 35%
of our long term debt was at fixed rates,
and 65% at floating rates of interest.
Liquidity risk
We have a range of funding sources for
our debt, including both bank and bond
markets. At December 31, 2002, 50% of
the Group’s loans were repayable after
more than five years. At that same date
we had cash balances of $162.1 million
and committed undrawn facilities of $444
million to provide additional liquidity if
required. In addition, we had committed
financing arranged of $1,210 million to
fund the delivery payments on four of the
five ocean cruise ships on order.
Critical Accounting Policies and Judgments
The Group's accounting policies are 
disclosed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements
on page 47. Our critical accounting policies
are those that we believe are most important
to the presentation of the Company's
financial condition and results and require
our most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, often as a result of the need to
make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain. We therefore
highlight the following critical accounting
policies, related judgments and inherent
uncertainties affecting the application of
those policies, and the likelihood that
materially different amounts would be
reported under different conditions or
using different assumptions.
We have discussed the application of
these critical accounting policies with our
board of directors and Audit Committee.
There have been no changes to these
Critical Accounting Policies during the year.
Ship Accounting
Our most significant assets are our ships,
which represent 85% of our total assets
and are subject to several critical 
accounting policies:
(1) We depreciate our ships on a straight
line basis over their expected useful lives
This requires us to estimate the useful life
of our assets as well as their residual values,
considering, among other things, the
impact of technological change, market
conditions and industry experience. We
have estimated our new ships’ average
useful lives at 30 years and their residual
values at 15% of our original ship cost.
January 2003 Introduction of Coral Princess to our North American fleet 24 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 2002
Financial review (continued)
If we had assumed useful lives of the ships
at 25 years, the impact on our results for
2002 would have been to reduce operating
profits by approximately $29 million.
If we had assumed residual values at 10%
of our original ship cost and expected useful
lives of 30 years, the impact on our results
for 2002 would have been to reduce 
operating profits by approximately $8 million.
(2) We review our long-lived assets, 
particularly our ships for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be fully recoverable. If such
an indication of impairment exists we are
required to estimate the fair value of the
asset and its remaining useful life, either by
obtaining third party appraisals or performing
discounted cash flow analysis through the
use of estimated future cash flows and
assumed appropriate discount rates. Any
provision for impairment in value of the
assets would be made in the profit and
loss account.
Determination of fair values by these
methods is subject to many uncertainties:
an active trading market for cruise ships
may not exist at a particular time, discounted
cash flow techniques used in appraisals
require significant judgments such as 
estimated future yields and related costs,
expected fleet development and the 
market environment. We believe that we
have made reasonable estimates and
judgements in reviewing any potential
impairment of our long-lived assets.
However, if there is a material change in 
economic conditions or other circumstances
influencing fair value, we could be required
to recognize an impairment charge.
(3) We account for subsequent expenditure
on a ship after it has been brought into
service by capitalizing only those costs
which we believe are an improvement of
the ship which is a judgemental area and
requires experience and technical information.
These capitalized costs are then depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. Any remaining
costs are treated as either dry-docking costs
or repairs and maintenance.
Given the complexities associated with the
accounting for cruise ships all the above
policies can result in estimates which are
highly subjective. If we materially changed
our assumptions of ship lives, residual values
or carrying values, our depreciation
expense and net book value of our ships
would be materially different. Also, if we
were to change our assessment of ship
expenditure, the amounts we expense
each year as repair and maintenance costs 
could increase, partially offset by a
decrease in depreciation expense, as less
ship costs would have been capitalized.
We believe that the estimates and judgments
we have made in reviewing the carrying
value and determining the useful lives of
our fixed assets together with the treatment
of ship expenditure after it has been
brought into service are appropriate.
Contingencies
The likely outcome of any claims brought
against us or of which we have been notified
is a subjective matter. We use our best
judgment in determining the likelihood of
any probable expense or liability that may
result to the Group and provide for such
costs where appropriate. Note 25 to the
Financial Statements, on page 63, discloses
additional information on the Group's
contingent liabilities.
Given the inherent uncertainty related to
the eventual outcome of any such claims,
it is possible that these matters may be
resolved for amounts materially different
from any provisions that we may have
made. We believe that the assessments we
have made, and the resulting provisions, are
appropriate. However, as new information
becomes available, we may need to
reassess the likely outcome and it is possible
that our revised estimates could materially
impact our results and financial position. 25 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC

29 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC
Quarterly information for 2001 The directors of P&O Princess Cruises plc present their report to shareholders together with the audited financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2002.
Principal activities
The Group’s principal activities during the year were the international operation of cruise ships and the provision of related land-based
tourist services, including tours and accommodation in Alaska.
Business review and future developments
A review of Group activities during the year and likely future developments is provided in the Chairman’s statement, the Chief
Executive’s review, the overview of the brands and the operating and financial review on pages 2 to 24. 
Dividend
The Company has paid three interim dividends during the year totalling 9 U.S. cents per share (2001 9 U.S. cents). A fourth interim dividend
of 3 U.S. cents per ordinary share (2001 3 U.S. cents paid as a final dividend) will be paid on March 14, 2003 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on February 21, 2003. No final dividend is proposed so the total dividends for the year will be 12 U.S.
cents per share (2001 12 U.S. cents). 
Although the dividend is declared in U.S. cents, it will be paid in sterling unless shareholders elect to receive their dividends in U.S. dollars.
The dividend will be converted into sterling at an exchange rate set on March 4, 2003.
Holders of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADSs) will receive their fourth interim dividend of 12 U.S. cents per ADS in U.S. dollars.
Dual listed company transactions
On November 20, 2001, the Company announced that it had entered into agreements to combine with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.
(Royal Caribbean) under a dual listed company (DLC) structure. On December 13, 2001, Carnival Corporation (Carnival) submitted a 
proposal to the board of the Company regarding an offer to acquire the entire issued share capital of the Company. Carnival also proposed
the possibility of effecting a combination of Carnival and P&O Princess Cruises by other means, including a DLC structure. The board
of P&O Princess Cruises carefully considered Carnival’s proposal and determined that it was not more favourable from a financial point
of view to the Company’s shareholders than the proposed transaction with Royal Caribbean and that there was reasonable doubt as
to its deliverability. On January 30, 2002, Carnival revised its offer to acquire P&O Princess Cruises but, for reasons as before, the board
of the Company continued to recommend the Royal Caribbean proposal.
On February 7, 2002, Carnival announced the terms of a further increased offer of 0.3004 shares in Carnival for each share in P&O
Princess Cruises plc. The Board considered the offer from Carnival but, in view of its concerns about the structure and deliverability of
the proposal, the Board continued to recommend the proposal to enter into a dual listed company combination with Royal Caribbean.
On February 14, 2002, at an Extraordinary General Meeting convened to consider the Royal Caribbean proposal, shareholders voted to
adjourn the meeting until such time as the outcome of the reviews by the relevant competition regulators of both the Royal Caribbean
proposal and the Carnival proposal were known.
On October 4, 2002, the Federal Trade Commission of the United States announced that it would not oppose a combination of the
Company with either Royal Caribbean or Carnival. The regulatory authorities of the European Commission, the United Kingdom and
Germany had previously cleared both proposals. Following the Federal Trade Commission’s announcement, the Company entered into
talks with Carnival. On October 24, 2002, Carnival announced the terms of a pre-conditional proposal to enter into a DLC transaction
with P&O Princess on the same economic terms as its latest previously-announced share exchange offer. As part of the transaction,
Carnival proposed a Partial Share Offer for up to, in aggregate, 20 per cent. of the issued share capital of the Company. On October
25, 2002, the Board announced that it was withdrawing its recommendation of the Royal Caribbean proposal. The Board also announced
that, on payment of the agreed fee of $62.5m, it had agreed with Royal Caribbean to terminate the implementation agreement between
the companies and, subject to there being no change of control of P&O Princess prior to January 1, 2003, to terminate the joint-venture
agreement between the two companies on that date. On January 2, 2003, the Company announced that the joint-venture agreement
had been terminated.
On January 8, 2003, the Board announced that it recommended the proposal to enter into a DLC transaction with Carnival. It is expected
that an Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders to consider the proposed transaction with Carnival will be held in April 2003.

Directors’ report The Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice (the ‘Combined Code’) are incorporated into the Listing Rules of the
U.K. Listing Authority. Section 1 of the Combined Code contains 14 principles of good governance and 45 code provisions which are
applicable to listed companies.
The provisions of the Combined Code applicable to the Company are divided into four parts:
Part A: Directors
Part B: Directors’ Remuneration
Part C: Relations with Shareholders
Part D: Accountability and Audit
Set out below is a statement of how the Company has applied the principles of the Combined Code during the year.
Part A: Directors
Board of Directors
The business of the Company is managed by the board of directors. The board has seven members; the Chairman, two executive directors
and four non-executive directors. One of the non-executive directors, Horst Rahe, is not considered to be independent on account of
his interest in a deferred consideration arrangement relating to the Group’s purchase of AIDA Cruises Limited, described in note 23 to
the financial statements. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and no individual or group of individuals dominates
the board’s decision making. The directors have wide ranging experience and all have occupied, or currently occupy, senior positions in
industry or government.
In accordance with the articles of association of the Company, directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at intervals
of no more than three years. The biographical details of the board members are set out on page 16. On joining the board, directors
are briefed on the Company and its activities. Arrangements are made for senior executives not on the board to attend board meetings
and make presentations on the results and strategies of their business units. 
The non-executive directors other than Horst Rahe are independent of management and have no relationships which could materially
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. Sir John Parker was appointed Deputy Chairman on September 26, 2002, in 
succession to Peter Foy, and has been identified as the senior independent director. Board members are given appropriate documentation
in advance of each board and committee meeting. All directors have access to the Company Secretary and are able to take independent
professional advice, at the Company’s expense, if required. The board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision. This
includes the approval of annual and interim results, acquisitions and disposals, as well as material agreements, major capital expenditure,
budgets and strategic plans. Other matters are delegated to board committees including those detailed below.
Generally, the board meets monthly, but additional meetings were held during the year to consider the proposed transactions with Royal
Caribbean and Carnival. The following table sets out the number of meetings of the Board, and of the principal committees of the Board,
during 2002 together with details of attendance. In addition to formal board meetings, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer maintain
regular contact with all directors and hold informal meetings with the non-executive directors to discuss issues affecting the Company.

Other members: Sir John Parker, Peter Foy
The audit committee is scheduled to meet four times a year and at other times if required. The Chief Financial Officer normally attends
meetings at the invitation of the committee.
32 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 2002
Corporate governance The audit committee examines the process of financial reporting within the Group, reviews the Group’s accounting policies and monitors
the integrity of the financial statements. It also reviews the Group’s system of internal control and the processes for monitoring and evaluating
the risks facing the Group. The committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent external auditors, reviewing the scope and
results of the audit with the external auditors and monitoring the independence of the external auditors. Further details of this are set out
below. The Committee is also responsible for monitoring the terms of reference and results of the work of the internal audit department.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Chairman: Peter Foy
Other members: Baroness Hogg, Sir John Parker
The remuneration committee is scheduled to meet at least twice a year and at other times as required. Executive directors are invited to attend
for appropriate items but are excluded when their own performance and remuneration are under review.
The remuneration committee makes recommendations and approves on behalf of the board the salaries, incentives and other benefit
arrangements of the Chairman and executive directors and oversees the Company’s incentive schemes. Fees payable to non-executive
directors are determined by the board.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
Chairman: Lord Sterling
Other members: Baroness Hogg, Sir John Parker, Peter Ratcliffe, Peter Foy
The nomination committee meets periodically as required. Its function is to assess and recommend to the board candidates for appointment
as executive and non-executive directors of the Company. It makes recommendations to the board on its composition and balance and
also reviews proposals for changes in responsibilities of directors.
Part B: Directors’ Remuneration
The remuneration report is set out on pages 35 to 40
Part C: Relations with Shareholders
The formal channels of communication by which the board accounts to shareholders for the overall performance of the Company are
the annual report and accounts, the Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the yearly and quarterly
announcements made through the stock exchanges on which the Company’s shares are listed.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer meet frequently with representatives of institutional shareholders to discuss their
views and to ensure that the strategies and objectives of the Company are well understood. Issues discussed with institutional shareholders
include the Company’s performance, the impact of major transactions such as acquisitions or disposals and any corporate governance concerns.
Presentations are made to representatives of the investment community at appropriate intervals in the U.K., the U.S. and elsewhere and
are simultaneously made available to shareholders by telephone and by live broadcast over the internet.
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’)
The date, time and location of the third AGM of the Company have not yet been set, pending the outcome of the Extraordinary General
Meeting convened to consider the proposed transaction with Carnival, which is expected to be held in April 2003. The AGM will be
held before July 31, 2003 and shareholders will receive notice of the meeting in due course.
Part D: Accountability and Audit
Directors’ Responsibility
The statement of directors’ responsibilities in relation to financial statements is set out on page 30.
Independence of Auditors
The Audit Committee is responsible for recommending a firm of auditors of appropriate independence and experience and for the
approval of all audit fees and terms. The Committee’s policy is to undertake a formal assessment of the auditors’ independence each
year which includes:
•a review of non-audit services provided to the Group and related fees;
•discussion with the auditors of a written report detailing all relationships with the Company and any other parties that could affect 
independence or the perception of independence;
•a review of the auditors’ own procedures for ensuring the independence of the audit firm and partners and staff involved in the
audit, including the regular rotation of the audit partner; and
• obtaining written confirmation from the auditors that, in their professional judgement, they are independent.
33 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC
Corporate governance During the year, the Audit Committee implemented procedures relating to the provision of non-audit services by the Company’s 
auditor. These include:
• the maintenance of a schedule of certain non-audit services, including consultancy, investment banking and legal services, which 
the Company is specifically prohibited from obtaining from the audit firm;
•requiring the selection of providers of permitted non-audit services to be subject to a tender process, where appropriate;
•requiring non-audit work and the fees involved to be approved in advance; and
• procedures which control, and in certain circumstances, prohibit, the recruitment by group companies of staff formerly employed
by the external audit firm and involved in the audit of the group.
An analysis of the fees payable to the external audit firm in respect of both audit and non-audit services during the year is set out in
note 3 to the accounts.
Going Concern
On the basis of current financial projections and facilities available, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, consider that it is
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Internal Control and Risk Management
Internal control and risk management within the Group’s business units is a well-defined, ongoing process embedded in each of the operations.
It is designed to identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks faced by the Group. A system of controls designed to be capable of
responding quickly to evolving risks in the business has been established, comprising procedures for the prompt reporting of significant
control weaknesses, together with the appropriate corrective action.
Each principal business activity is controlled by a local executive committee, which receives detailed reports so that issues can be discussed
and corrective action determined at the appropriate level to remedy identified control weaknesses. The executive committees are supported
by risk management committees which focus on the business unit concerned but draw on Group-wide technical and auditing resources.
In addition to an internal audit function, such resources include specialised technical audit teams and centralised control of health, safety,
welfare and environmental issues.
The Group executive management team receives information on the issues arising at the business units, together with regular trading,
operations, finance and business risk updates. This is provided via formal reporting processes and the close involvement of relevant individuals
in the management of the business units. The primary focus of this aspect of the system are the executive directors, with a head office
executive committee monitoring the process, ensuring that issues common to more than one business unit are identified and that all
relevant matters are brought to the attention of the board as a whole.
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control, but recognise that any such system can provide only reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Statement of Compliance with the Combined Code
The system of internal control was in place throughout the year and has continued in place up to the date of approval of this annual
report. The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. The board confirms
that it has reviewed its effectiveness and that it accords with the Turnbull guidance.
Throughout the period from January 1, 2002 to the date of approval of the financial statements, P&O Princess Cruises plc has complied with
the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code.
Compliance with other Corporate Governance Requirements
In addition to complying with the Combined Code, as a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, P&O Princess Cruises plc
also complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the NYSE, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other legislation
applicable to overseas companies listed in the U.S., including the recently-enacted Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These rules and regulations
impose requirements on the Company related to good corporate governance practices.
34 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 2002
Corporate governance CONSIDERATION OF MATTERS RELATING TO DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The remuneration policy of the Company is set by the board. The remuneration committee makes recommendations to the board, within
agreed terms of reference, on the Company’s framework of executive remuneration and its cost. The members of the remuneration
committee, all of whom are independent non-executive directors, are set out on page 33. The committee is also responsible for the
implementation of remuneration policy and determining on behalf of the board specific remuneration packages for each of the executive
directors. To assist in reaching its decisions, the committee has access to survey information and independent advice where it considers
it appropriate. The remuneration policy was established at the time of the demerger with advice from independent remuneration consultants.
As the policy and its implementation have not subsequently been changed significantly, the committee has not needed to take specific
advice from external consultants during the year. The committee consults with the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer as appropriate
with regard to its proposals relating to the remuneration of the executive directors. In framing the policy, the board has regard to the
views of shareholders and seeks to ensure that contact with shareholders is maintained on remuneration as with other matters.
The board has considered the principles and provisions of the Combined Code and this report explains how the Company has applied
the principles in the code which relate to directors’ remuneration.
Policy on Directors’ Remuneration 
The Company’s policy with respect to directors’ remuneration is to maintain a remuneration structure capable of attracting, motivating
and retaining high-quality individuals within a cost-effective framework. It seeks to reward executive directors and senior employees within
the Group competitively, taking into account the Company’s performance, the markets in which the Group operates, and pay and conditions
elsewhere in the Group. 
In constructing the remuneration packages, the emphasis is on linking reward to both short-term and long-term performance objectives and accordingly,
as explained in more detail below, for each of the executive directors a significant proportion of the remuneration package is performance related. The
packages include participation in the company’s long-term incentive plans, which comprise a deferred bonus and co-investment matching plan and an
executive share option plan. The plans are designed to align the interests of participants with those of shareholders. The remuneration committee seeks
to ensure that the operation of the plans in practice is consistent with their overall objectives, recommending changes to achieve this if necessary. During
the year, on the recommendation of the committee, changes were made to the rules of the deferred bonus and co-investment matching plan and 
discretion was exercised in respect of the executive share option plan so that the effect on the plans of the proposed dual listed company transaction
with Carnival is substantially the same as would have been the case had Carnival’s previously-announced share-exchange offer proceeded.
The main components of remuneration for executive directors and, where relevant, the performance criteria on which they are based,
are set out below. In agreeing the level of base salaries and the annual performance bonus, the committee takes into consideration the
total remuneration available to executives and has the discretion to vary individual elements of the remuneration package. 
Base salary
Base salaries are set at levels competitive with pay for directors and executives based in similar locations and holding equivalent positions
in comparable companies.
Benefits in kind
These principally comprise car benefits, life assurance and membership of the Group’s healthcare insurance schemes. The level of benefits provided
to executive directors is consistent with that provided by other major companies. These benefits do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus earned in any year is dependent on the extent to which performance targets are achieved. Targets for directors, which are
common to each director and approved by the remuneration committee, are based on the Group’s earnings per share, as the committee is
of the view that this is the most appropriate measure of the performance of the executive directors The targets, which are set at the
beginning of the relevant year based on group budgets, are designed to take account of the anticipated trading environment. For example,
in 2002, the targets took account of the difficult trading conditions faced by the Group in the aftermath of the terrorist incidents on
September 11, 2001. The maximum annual bonus that can be earned by directors is 75% of base salary (100% in the case of the Chief
Executive Officer). Subject to the discretion of the remuneration committee, half of the bonus is paid in cash with the balance awarded
in shares as a share award for the purpose of the deferred bonus and co-investment matching plan, as described below.
Long-term incentive plans
DEFERRED BONUS AND CO-INVESTMENT MATCHING PLAN
The deferred bonus and co-investment matching plan provides participants with the opportunity to receive matching awards of shares
depending upon the performance of the Company over a specified retention period.
Share awards granted to participants are automatically invested in the plan and, in addition, participants may choose to invest all or part
of their post-tax cash bonus, or funds from their own resources, into the plan (invested shares) subject to an overall limit on the amount
invested in the plan in any one year of 75% of base salary (100% in the case of the Chief Executive Officer). An award of shares equivalent
to the total of a participant’s share award and gross value of invested shares is granted to a participant (a matching award).
The extent to which a new matching award may be exercised is based on the growth in earnings per share of the Company over the three-year
retention period as disclosed in the audited financial statements. If the Company achieves earnings per share growth of 15% over this period,
participants will be entitled to exercise 25% of their matching award. If earnings per share growth is 50%, the entire matching award may
be exercised. For growth between 15% and 50%, the extent to which a matching award may be exercised is determined on a straight-line
basis between these points. Generally, the matching award may only be exercised if the share award and invested shares are retained
throughout the retention period. The remuneration committee, which regularly reviews these performance thresholds, believes that they
provide appropriately stretching targets taking account of the Company, its competitors and the nature of the industry in which it operates.
In framing the deferred bonus and co-investment matching plan when it was launched in 2000, the board sought to encourage participants
to commit their own resources to the plan, believing this to be an important aspect of aligning participant’s interests with those of shareholders.
In addition, the plan was designed to be competitive in all territories in which participants are based, including the United States. For these reasons,
the plan was based on a two-year retention period. However, in June 2002, on the recommendation of the remuneration committee the board
35 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC
Remuneration report agreed that all future share and matching awards would have retention periods of three years, consistent with the recommendations of Schedule
A to the Combined Code. In addition, the retention period of existing share and matching awards held by executive directors was extended
to three years. The remuneration committee did not consider it appropriate to adjust the performance targets for existing matching
awards following extension of the retention periods. Consequently, the thresholds at which participants will be able to exercise between
25% and 100% of existing matching awards remain the achievement by the Company of earnings per share growth of between 10%
and 40% respectively over the relevant performance period. However, if the proposed DLC transaction with Carnival Corporation is
completed, all share awards will vest and be released and all matching awards granted prior to 2003 and outstanding at completion will
be immediately exercisable in full. In reaching its decision to allow the exercise in full of all matching awards on completion of the proposed
DLC transaction with Carnival Corporation, the remuneration committee has taken account of the Company’s relative total shareholder
return performance as shown below.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION PLAN
Options at market value at the date of grant are granted to eligible employees based on guidelines approved by the remuneration committee. These
guidelines govern the total number of options which may be granted and the frequency of awards and ensure that the progression to maximum
awards is within individual and overall limits authorised by shareholders, so phasing grants of options to executives over a number of years.
Options granted to directors may not be exercised unless the growth in the Company’s earnings per share over a period of at least
three years from grant, as disclosed in the audited financial statements, exceeds the growth in an appropriate recognised index of retail
prices by an average of at least 3% per annum. The remuneration committee, which regularly reviews performance criteria, believes targets
based on earnings per share growth to be the most suitable in assessing performance of the executive directors and considers this target
to be appropriate in the context of the aims of the board’s remuneration policy. Options granted to other executives are not subject
to any performance condition. If the proposed DLC transaction with Carnival Corporation is completed, all share options outstanding
at completion will vest and any performance conditions will cease to apply.
To ensure appropriate phasing of grants of share options, the value of shares under option granted to directors and certain other senior
executives in any year is normally limited to 150% of base salary. Lower limits apply to other executives. The remuneration committee
reserves the right to vary these limits if it determines that exceptional circumstances exist. The Company has the facility to require option
holders to assume any liability to employers’ national insurance contributions arising on the exercise of Inland Revenue-unapproved
options, and may grant additional options in recognition of the liability being assumed.
Retirement benefits
The Group operates various retirement benefit schemes for its executives in which the executive directors also participate. Further
details of these are set out below. Retirement benefits are based solely on base salary; no other emoluments are pensionable.
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board within the limits set out in the articles of association of the
Company. Non-executive directors receive a basic fee and additional fees if they serve as deputy chairman of the board or as chairman of
any board committees. Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in the Group’s long-term incentive or pension plans.
Service contracts
It is the policy of the company that service contracts with executive directors should not be of more than 12 months’ duration.
Lord Sterling, who has a service contract with the Company which came into effect on October 23, 2000 and which is terminable by
the Company on 12 months’ notice, was due to retire from the Board on October 23, 2002 but agreed to continue his service until
the Company concluded its proposed transactions with either Carnival Corporation or Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. He will therefore
retire from the board, and, due notice having been given, his service contract will expire, on completion of the proposed DLC transaction
with Carnival Corporation. Peter Ratcliffe and Nick Luff each have service contracts with the Company which came into effect on
October 23, 2000 and which may be terminated by the Company on 12 months’ notice. In the case of early termination of their contracts
by the Company without cause, these contracts provide for payments in lieu of notice equivalent to 12 months’ base salary, benefits
and a bonus equivalent to that paid in respect of the year preceding the year in which employment terminates. If the proposed DLC
transaction with Carnival Corporation is completed, Nick Luff’s service contract will be terminated by the Company on this basis with
a payment in lieu of notice of £583,250 ($877,200).
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but instead have a letter or agreement setting out the terms and conditions of
their appointment. Each of the non-executive directors has been appointed for an initial term of five years, although the appointment
may be terminated by either the director or the Company giving 12 months’ notice. In addition, the appointments are subject to the
provisions of the articles of association of the Company. In the case of Sir John
Parker, Baroness Hogg and Peter Foy, these agreements and their initial term came
into effect on September 18, 2000. Horst Rahe’s appointment and initial term came
into effect on May 16, 2001. On September 26, 2002, Sir John Parker was appointed
as deputy chairman of the board, an appointment that will terminate automatically,
without any notice having to be given, if the proposed DLC transaction with Carnival
Corporation is completed. If the proposed DLC transaction with Carnival
Corporation is completed, the appointments of Peter Foy and Horst Rahe as non-
executive directors will be terminated by the Company with payments of £32,500
($48,900) and £25,000 ($ 37,600) respectively.
Total shareholder return
The Company commenced to trade on October 23, 2000 following its demerger
from The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. The chart shows the
cumulative total shareholder return of the company since that date. For comparison,
the chart also shows the total shareholder return of the FTSE All-Share index
which provides a broad representation of the company’s peer group in terms of

The base salaries of Lord Sterling, Peter Ratcliffe and Nick Luff during 2002 were £330,450, $800,000 and £270,000 respectively. With effect
from January 1, 2003, Peter Ratcliffe’s salary was increased to $832,000 and Nick Luff’s salary was increased to £295,000. Non-executive directors
receive a basic fee of £25,000 and an additional fee of £7,500 per annum if they serve as chairman of any board committees. Until September
26, 2002, Peter Foy received fees at a total annual rate of £130,000, representing fees payable as a non-executive director and as deputy chairman.
Following his decision to step down from the position of deputy chairman on that date, the fee payable to him was reduced accordingly and Sir
John Parker, who took up the appointment, received fees at the rate of £105,000 per annum in addition to fees payable as a non-executive director.
With the exception of amounts paid to Peter Ratcliffe, the remuneration of directors was in sterling and has been converted into U.S. dollars at
the average rate for the year of $1.504:£1. The Company retains a serviced apartment in London at an annual rent of £120,800 ($181,700). This
is available for the use of executives, including Peter Ratcliffe, for accommodation whilst visiting London on the Company’s business.
Pensions
The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not receive any pension benefits from the Company.
Peter Ratcliffe and Nick Luff are each members of the P&O Princess Cruises Pension Scheme (the ‘U.K. Scheme’), a U.K. resident
defined-benefit scheme approved by the Inland Revenue. Peter Ratcliffe accrues pension rights under the U.K. scheme at a rate of up
to 1/45th of final salary for each year of service. For this purpose, final salary is defined as the basic salary received in the final 12 months
of service. Normal retirement age is 60.
The benefits payable to Nick Luff from the U.K. Scheme are restricted by Inland Revenue limits, including the earnings cap. He accrues
pension rights at the rate of 1/82nd of the earnings cap (currently £97,200 ($146,200)) for each year of service. The Company also oper-
ates a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme (‘FURBS’) for Nick Luff. This operates on a defined contribution basis and the total
amount payable by the Company during the year was £58,800 ($88,400).
Peter Ratcliffe is also a member of the Princess Cruises Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan in the U.S. (the ‘Supplemental Plan’). This plan
provides benefits to supplement those received from other plans, including the U.K. Scheme. The overall effect is to provide, on retirement, a
pension of 65% of final salary, subject to having completed 15 years’ service. For this purpose, final salary is the average basic salary for the
five years immediately preceding retirement. Normal retirement age is 60 and the pension is payable in full to Mr Ratcliffe or, on his death,
to his widow. Benefits from the U.K. Scheme can exceed those resulting from the Supplemental Plan, in which case no further amounts would
be received from the Supplemental Plan. In addition, Peter Ratcliffe is also a member of the Princess Cruises Retirement Savings Plan in the
U.S. This is a defined-contribution 401(k) plan and the contribution payable by the Company in respect of the year was $11,000.
Details of the retirement benefits of directors arising from their participation in defined-benefit pension arrangements are set out below:

The accrued benefit is that pension which would be paid annually on retirement at 60, the normal retirement age under the pension
scheme in the U.K., based on service to December 31, 2002.
EARLY RETIREMENT
In the event of compulsory early retirement, or voluntary early retirement after the age of 55, Peter Ratcliffe would receive a minimum
pension of two thirds of final salary. In the event of voluntary retirement before the age of 55, the minimum pension is reduced pro rata
37 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC
Remuneration report for actual service compared with potential service to age 60. In the event of voluntary retirement after the age of 50, Nick Luff would
receive a pension determined according to actual pensionable service, reduced to take account of payment prior to normal retirement
age. In the event of compulsory early retirement after the age of 53, no such reduction would be made. If compulsory early retirement
were to take place between the ages of 50 and 53, the pension would be reduced to take account of payment prior to the age of 53.
Peter Ratcliffe’s service in the Supplemental Plan commenced on September 1, 1986. As his service exceeds 15 years, the maximum
pension would be payable on retirement. However, there is an actuarial reduction if a pension is drawn under the age of 55 following
voluntary early retirement.
DEATH-IN-SERVICE BENEFITS
The U.K. Scheme provides death-in-service benefits to Peter Ratcliffe and Nick Luff. In the event of death before retirement, a lump sum
is payable (of four times basic salary or pensionable earnings, whichever is the higher, or, if applicable, four times the earnings cap at the
date of death) together with a refund of the member’s contributions. In addition, a spouse’s or dependant’s pension is payable, equivalent
to 66% of the pension (prior to commutation) that would have been payable to the member had he continued in service until normal
retirement date. Children’s pensions of 25% of the spouse’s pension may also be payable. As the death-in-service benefits provided by
the U.K. Scheme to Nick Luff are restricted by Inland Revenue limits, and as Lord Sterling is not a member of the U.K. Scheme, additional
life assurance cover is purchased on their behalf. The relevant premiums are included within the table on page 37 as a benefit-in-kind.
The U.K. Scheme also provides pensions in the event of the total incapacity or ill-health of a member.
PENSION INCREASES IN RETIREMENT
Pensions in payment arising from the U.K. Scheme are increased each year in line with the Retail Price Index, up to a maximum of 5%.
Pensions in payment from the Supplemental Plan are not increased after retirement.

38 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 2002
Remuneration report On March 4, 2002, Lord Sterling, Peter Ratcliffe and Nick Luff acquired 79,269 shares, 86,165 shares and 36,946 shares respectively
through the exercise of 2001 LTIP Awards. A nominal consideration of £1 per award was payable to exercise each award and the value
of the shares on exercise was £4.115 per share. The value of the awards on exercise was therefore £326,191 ($490,591), £354,568
($533,270) and £152,032 ($228,656) respectively. The exercise of the awards gave rise to an income tax charge which was financed by
the sale, on the same date, of 31,804 shares, 43,213 shares and 14,823 shares by Lord Sterling, Peter Ratcliffe and Nick Luff respectively
at a price of £4.115 pence per share. On March 4, 2002 Nick Luff purchased 2,000 shares at a price of £4.10 per share.
On November 21, 2002, Peter Ratcliffe acquired 214,976 shares through the exercise of a P&O LTIP Option. A nominal consideration
of £1 was payable to exercise the option and the value of the shares on exercise was £4.905 per share. The value of the option on
exercise was therefore £1,054,456 ($1,585,902). The exercise of the option gave rise to an income tax charge which was financed by
the sale, on the same date, of 107,500 shares at a price of £4.905 per share.
On December 18, 2002, Deutsche Seereederei GmbH (‘DS’), a company wholly-owned by Horst Rahe and his family, entered into a
share sale agreement (the ‘Agreement’) with Commerzbank AG (‘Commerzbank’) for German tax-planning purposes. The Agreement
is in respect of the 11,366,415 ordinary shares of P&O Princess owned by DS (the ‘Shares’) which comprise Mr Rahe’s interest in the
ordinary shares of P&O Princess. It will result in DS disposing of its interest in the Shares on June 23, 2003, or earlier if it so elects, but
until then, through DS, Mr Rahe retains full economic interest in the Shares. 
Under the Agreement, on December 18, 2002, DS transferred the Shares to Commerzbank for £50,580,547 ($76,073,143) (£4.45 per
share). At the same time, DS entered into a total return swap agreement with Commerzbank under which the Shares will be valued on
June 23, 2003 or earlier, if DS so elects (the ‘Valuation Date’). To the extent that the valuation of the Shares on the Valuation Date (the
‘Final Price’) exceeds £4.478 per share (the ‘Initial Price’), Commerzbank will pay the difference to DS. Conversely, if the Final Price is
less than the Initial Price, DS will pay the difference to Commerzbank. Any dividends receivable in respect of the Shares prior to the
Valuation Date will be for the benefit of DS.
The ordinary shares above include 33,888 shares, 42,952 shares and 45,274 shares, in the case of Lord Sterling, Peter Ratcilffe and
Nicholas Luff respectively, that have been designated as ‘Invested Shares’ for the purpose of the deferred bonus and co-investment
matching plan. As described below, matching awards have been granted to each individual in respect of the ordinary shares they have
designated as Invested Shares.
P&O LTIP Options
P&O LTIP Options are options over ordinary shares granted on October 24, 2000 to directors who, through arrangements put in place
for the purposes of the demerger from P&O, exchanged fully-vested awards previously granted under P&O incentive schemes for such
options. The options are exercisable on payment of £1 and will lapse on March 27, 2005. The market value of the shares at the date
of grant was £2.92 per share. The number of shares to which P&O LTIP Options relate increased during the year due to shares allocated
or purchased by the Trustee in lieu of dividends foregone.
P&O LTIP Awards
P&O LTIP Awards comprise two awards of ordinary shares granted on October 24, 2000 to directors who, through arrangements put
in place for the purposes of the demerger from P&O, exchanged awards granted under P&O incentive schemes for which the retention
period had not been completed for such awards. One half of the shares comprising an individual’s P&O LTIP Award represented a 2001
LTIP Award and the other half represented a 2002 LTIP Award. The market value of the shares at the date of grant was £2.92 per
share. Each of Lord Sterling, Peter Ratcliffe and Nick Luff exercised their 2001 LTIP Awards on March 4, 2002.
The 2002 LTIP Awards are exercisable no earlier than the date on which the Company announces its results for the year ended
December 31, 2003, the retention period having been extended during the year in line with the board’s decision to extend to three
years the retention period of awards granted to directors under the deferred bonus and co-investment matching plan. However, if and
when the proposed DLC transaction with Carnival Corporation is completed, the 2002 LTIP Awards will vest and become exercisable.
Each award lapses three months after it becomes exercisable. The number of shares to which P&O LTIP Awards relate increased during
the year due to shares allocated by the Trustee in lieu of dividends foregone. The P&O LTIP Awards are eligible for matching awards
in accordance with the rules of the deferred bonus and co-investment matching plan.
Share Awards
Share Awards comprise awards of ordinary shares under the terms of the deferred bonus and co-investment matching plan. Lord
Sterling, Peter Ratcliffe and Nick Luff were granted awards on March 4, 2002 in respect of their 2001 annual bonus, the value of which
was disclosed in the 2001 Annual Report. The market value of the shares comprising these awards on the day of grant was £4.0775
per share. The number of shares to which Share Awards relate increased during the year due to shares allocated by the Trustee in lieu
of dividends foregone. Share Awards are eligible for Matching Awards in accordance with the rules of the deferred bonus and co-investment
matching plan.
Share Awards are subject to a retention period of three years from grant. None of the awards shown above is currently vested but, if
and when the proposed DLC transaction with Carnival Corporation is completed, the Share Awards will vest and be released.
Matching Awards
Matching Awards are granted in respect of P&O LTIP Awards, Share Awards and Invested Shares. Under the terms of the deferred
bonus and co-investment matching plan, the actual number of shares each director would normally receive from the exercise of Matching
Awards will depend on the extent to which the relevant performance conditions have been satisfied at the relevant time. However, if and
when the proposed DLC transaction with Carnival Corporation is completed, the Matching Awards will be released to participants in full.
Matching Awards granted in respect of 2001 LTIP Awards lapsed as the relevant performance criteria had not been achieved at the time
the 2001 LTIP Awards were exercised on March 4, 2002.

Options marked (*) are replacement options, granted by the Company in accordance with its obligations under the agreements which
governed the demerger of the company from P&O in October 2000. Replacement options were granted to replace options over P&O
deferred stock held by participants in P&O stock option schemes prior to the demerger which were exercised or released as part of
the demerger arrangements. The number of shares over which replacement options were granted was determined by a formula which
took into account the exercise price of the original option. The period in which a replacement option is exercisable is identical to that
of the option it replaced. The exercise of replacement options is not subject to performance conditions.
The other options shown above were granted as part of general grants of options to a large number of executives. The exercise of such
options by directors is conditional upon the growth in the Company’s earnings per share over a period of at least three years from grant
exceeding the growth in an appropriate recognised index of retail prices by at least 3% per annum.
If and when the proposed DLC transaction with Carnival Corporation is completed, all the above options will vest and become 
exercisable and any performance conditions will cease to apply.
Employee Benefit Trust
As potential beneficiaries of the P&O Princess Cruises Employee Benefit Trust, Lord Sterling, Peter Ratcliffe and Nick Luff are deemed

Remuneration report Report of the independent auditors to the members of P&O Princess Cruises plc
We have audited the financial statements on pages 42 to 73. We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report
that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the directors’ remuneration report. As described on page 30, this
includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and by our profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement on pages 32 to 34 reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions
of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the Corporate governance statement and the unaudited part of
the directors’ remuneration report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the implications
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a
test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to
be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at December 31, 2002 and
of the profit of the Group for the year then ended; and
• the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

Group statement of total recognised gains and losses
Years ended December 31
Reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds
Years ended December 31 1Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group.
Basis of preparation of financial statements
The Group financial statements comprise the consolidation of the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries and incorporate the
Group’s interest in its joint ventures. The accounts of its subsidiaries and joint ventures are made up to December 31.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
Kingdom (‘U.K. GAAP’) under the historical cost convention, and in accordance with applicable U.K. accounting standards. These principles
differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (‘U.S. GAAP’). Application of U.S.
GAAP would have affected shareholders’ funds at December 31, 2002 and 2001 and profit attributable to shareholders for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, to the extent summarised in note 28, additional information for U.S. investors.
Basis of consolidation
P&O Princess Cruises plc acquired the cruise business of The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (‘P&O’) on October
23, 2000. The acquisition was effected by the issue of ordinary shares in P&O Princess Cruises plc to the holders of deferred stock in
P&O in settlement of a dividend declared by P&O.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using merger accounting principles as if the businesses comprising P&O Princess
Cruises had been part of P&O Princess Cruises for all periods presented, since they have been under common control throughout this
period. Businesses acquired from or disposed of to third parties during the periods presented have been accounted for using acquisition
accounting, from or to the date control passed.
Prior year adjustment on implementation of FRS19
The Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Reporting Standard No. 19 ‘Deferred Tax’ (FRS19) in December 2000. The standard
is effective for accounting periods ending on or after January 23, 2002. The standard requires full provision to be made for deferred tax
assets and liabilities arising from most types of timing difference between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements
and their recognition in a tax computation. Deferred tax assets are, however, only to be recognised to the extent that it is regarded as
more likely than not that they will be recovered. P&O Princess Cruises has adopted the standard as of January 1, 2002 resulting in the
restatement of comparative data from partial provisioning for deferred tax to the full provision basis. 
As a result of the implementation of FRS19, the balance sheet as at December 31, 1999 was restated to reflect full provision for deferred
tax, an increase in deferred tax liabilities of $92.0m.
The net effect on net assets and shareholders’ funds as at December 31, 2000 as a result of implementing FRS19 is a reduction of
$108.1m with a charge to the profit and loss account for the year of $16.1m.
The tax credit in the profit and loss account for the year to December 31, 2001 has increased by $96.8m to reflect the elimination of
the majority of future potential tax liabilities upon P&O Princess Cruises’ election to enter the U.K. tonnage tax regime. This is consistent
with the elimination of the partially provided deferred tax in the 2001 audited financial statements. The net effect on net assets and
shareholders’ funds as at December 31, 2001 as a result of implementing FRS 19 is a reduction of $11.3m.
Use of estimates
Preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.K. GAAP and U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of turnover and expenses for an accounting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions
Goodwill arising on business acquisitions being the difference between the fair value of consideration compared to the fair value of net
assets acquired represents the residual purchase price after allocation to all identifiable net assets. Goodwill is included within intangible
fixed assets and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated to write off goodwill on a straight line basis over
its expected useful life, which can be up to 40 years. A life of more than 20 years is adopted when the directors consider the period for
which the value of the underlying business acquired exceeds the value of the identifiable net assets is demonstrably longer than 20 years.
Goodwill with an expected useful life of more than 20 years is reviewed annually for any impairment, by comparing carrying value with 
discounted cashflows.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has a long term interest and shares control with one or more co-venturers. Joint ventures
are stated at P&O Princess Cruises’ share of underlying net assets. P&O Princess Cruises’ share of the profits or losses of joint ventures
is included in the consolidated profit and loss account on an equity accounting basis.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less provisions for impairment.
Shares in P&O Princess Cruises plc held for the purpose of long term incentive plans (LTIPs) are held within fixed asset investments. To
the extent that these shares have been identified for bonus awards, provision is made for the difference between the book value of
these shares and their residual value, if any.
47 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC
Notes to the financial statements 1Accounting policies (continued)
Tangible fixed assets
Ships are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Subsequent ship improvement costs are capitalised as additions to the ship, while
costs of repairs and maintenance are accounted for as dry docking costs.
Properties and other fixed assets, including computer hardware and software, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Interest incurred in respect of payments on account of assets under construction is capitalised to the cost of the assets concerned.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost to estimated residual value on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of the
asset concerned as follows:
Cruise ships 30 years
Freehold buildings 40 years
Other fixed assets 3 – 16 years
Freehold land and ships under construction are not depreciated.
Dry-docking costs
Dry-docking costs are capitalised and expensed on a straight line basis to the date of the next scheduled drydock.
Impairment of fixed assets
P&O Princess Cruises reviews all fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. Provision for impairment in value of fixed assets
is made in the profit and loss account.
Stocks
Stocks consist of provisions, supplies, fuel and gift shop merchandise and are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cash and borrowings
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market deposits and certificates of deposit. All cash equivalents have original maturities
of 90 days or less. Cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date are deducted from bank loans and overdrafts where formal rights
of set-off exist.
Turnover
Turnover comprises sales to third parties (excluding VAT and similar sales taxes). Turnover includes air and land supplements and on
board sales and is taken before deducting travel agents’ commission.
Deposits received on sales of cruises are initially recorded as deferred income and are recognised, together with revenues from shipboard
activities and all associated direct costs of a voyage, on a pro rata basis over the period of the cruise.
Marketing and promotion costs
Marketing and promotion costs are expensed over the period of benefit, not exceeding one year from the end of the year the cost is incurred.
Leases
Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in creditors. Rentals under
operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Pension costs
Contributions in respect of defined contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account when they are payable.
Contributions in respect of defined benefit pension plans are calculated as a percentage, agreed on actuarial advice, of the pensionable
salaries of employees. The cost of providing defined benefit pensions is charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over
the periods benefiting from the services of employees, and is calculated with the advice of an independent qualified actuary, using the
projected unit method. This is in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 ‘Accounting for pension costs’, the basis
on which the Group accounts for pension costs. Additional disclosure as required by FRS17 is also provided.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and
accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS19. A net deferred
tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more
likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Derivatives and other financial instruments
P&O Princess Cruises uses currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts to manage its exposure to certain foreign 
currency and interest rate risks and to hedge major capital expenditure or lease commitments by businesses in currencies other than their functional
currency. Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Foreign currencies
The functional and reporting currency of the Group is the U.S. dollar as the majority of its trade and assets are denominated in that currency.
Transactions in currencies other than a business’ functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Profits and losses of subsidiaries, branches, and joint ventures which have functional currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S.
dollars at average rates of exchange. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the year end exchange rates.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures which have currencies
of operation other than U.S. dollars and any related loans are taken to reserves, together with the differences arising when the profit
and loss accounts are translated at average rates and compared with rates ruling at the year end. Other exchange differences are taken
to the profit and loss account.

During 2001 P&O Princess Cruises elected to enter the U.K. tonnage tax regime which eliminated future potential tax liabilities on its profits in
the U.K. The regime includes provision whereby a proportion of capital allowances previously claimed by the Group may be subject to tax in the
event that a significant number of vessels are sold and not replaced. This contingent liability decreases over the first seven years following entry
into tonnage tax to nil. The contingent tax liability at December 31, 2002 was $186.3m (2001: $262.0m) assuming all vessels on which capital
allowances had been claimed were sold for net book value and not replaced. No provision has been made as no liability is expected to arise.
$10.7m of contingent consideration, payable in cash in relation to the purchase of 49% of AIDA Cruises Limited in November 2000, has been
released as the condition requiring its payment did not arise. The total estimated amount contingently payable is unchanged, but the whole of the
remaining consideration is payable in cash or shares at the Company’s option, and therefore an adjustment has been made to shares to be issued.
Deferred taxation comprises:

of distribution of the Company. The subscriber shares have no dividend rights nor voting rights nor any rights to payment of capital upon
a distribution of assets by the Company. The preference shares and subscriber shares are unlisted.

In accordance with s230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. The profit attributable
to shareholders of the Company for the year was $86.3m (2001 $135.3m).
Group and Company ‘Other reserves’ represent the difference between the market and nominal value of shares issued as initial 
consideration of $35.6m together with the estimated value of outstanding consideration ($57.5m) in respect of the purchase of 49% of
AIDA Cruises Limited in November 2000. The shares issued in respect of the initial consideration have been accounted for in accordance
with the merger relief provisions of the Companies Act 1985. The outstanding consideration is mainly dependent on the future results
of the Seetours business and may be payable between 2003 and 2006. The Company has the option to settle the outstanding consideration
in either cash or new P&O Princess Cruises plc ordinary shares. The purchase agreement provides that in the event of a change in control
of P&O Princess Cruises plc payment of the outstanding consideration can be accelerated by the vendor of AIDA Cruises Limited. In
such an event, the minimum amount payable would be approximately 59m ($61.9m), payable in cash.

Employee Option Schemes
Options under the P&O Princess Cruises Executive Share Option Plan (‘the Option Plan’), are exercisable in a period normally beginning not
earlier than three years and ending no later than ten years from the date of the grant. Options granted immediately after the demerger from P&O
in October 2000 to replace options over P&O deferred stock previously held by P&O Princess Cruises employees are exercisable over the same
period as the options replaced. The exercise price is set at the closing market price on the day the option was granted.

22 Pensions
P&O Princess Cruises is a contributing employer to various pension schemes, including some multi-employer merchant navy industry schemes.
In the UK, P&O Princess Cruises operates its own defined benefit pension scheme, the assets of which are managed on behalf of the
trustee by independent fund managers. This scheme is closed to new membership. As at March 31, 2001, the date of the most recent
formal actuarial valuation, the scheme had assets with a market value of $60.9m, representing 102 per cent of the benefits accrued to
members allowing for future increases in earnings. Approximately 70 per cent of the scheme’s assets are invested in bonds and 30 per
cent in equities. The principal valuation assumptions were as follows:
%
Rate of salary increases 4.0
Rate of pension increases 2.5
Discount rate 5.25
Expected return on assets 5.25
The Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (‘MNRPF’) is a defined benefit multi-employer scheme in which sea staff employed by companies
within the P&O Princess Cruises group have participated. The scheme has a significant funding deficit and has been closed to further
benefit accrual. Companies within the P&O Princess Cruises group, along with other employers, are making payments into the scheme
under a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to reduce the deficit. Payments by P&O Princess Cruises’ group companies to the
scheme in 2002 totalled $2.0m, which represented 7 per cent of the total payments made by all employers. As at March 31, 2002, the
date of the most recent formal actuarial valuation, the scheme had assets with a market value of $814m, representing 84 per cent
59 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC
Notes to the financial statements 22 Pensions (continued)
of the benefits accrued to members. Approximately 68 per cent of the scheme’s assets were invested in bonds, 25 per cent in equities
and 7 per cent in property. The valuation assumptions were as follows:
%
Rate of salary increases 4.0
Rate of pension increases (where increases apply) 2.5
Discount rate 5.8
Expected return on assets 5.8
The Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (‘MNOPF’) is a defined benefit multi-employer scheme in which officers employed by companies
within the P&O Princess Cruises group have participated and continue to participate. This scheme is closed to new membership. The
share of the contributions being made to the scheme by P&O Princess Cruises group companies (based on the year to December 31, 2002)
was approximately 7 per cent. However, the extent of each participating employer’s liability for any deficit in the scheme is uncertain.
Accordingly, P&O Princess Cruises accounts for the scheme on a contributions paid basis, as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The scheme is divided into two sections – the New Section and the Old Section. As at March 31, 2000, the date of the most recent
formal actuarial valuation, the New Section had assets with a market value of $2,680m, representing approximately 100 per cent of the
benefits accrued to members. The valuation assumptions were as follows:
%
Rate of salary increases 4.0
Rate of pension increases (where increases apply) 2.5
Discount rate 5.75
Expected return on assets 5.75
At the date of the valuation, approximately 77 per cent of the New Section’s assets were invested in equities, 14 per cent in bonds and
9 per cent in property and cash. As a result of this asset distribution, it is expected that the fall in equity markets since March 2000 will
have resulted in the New Section now showing a significant funding deficit. The estimated current position is discussed below with the
additional information presented under FRS17. The Old Section has been closed to benefit accrual since 1978. As at March 31, 2000,
the date of the most recent formal actuarial valuation, it had assets with a market value of $2,233m representing approximately 
111 per cent of the benefits accrued to members. The assets of the Old Section are substantially invested in bonds. Contributions from
P&O Princess Cruises group companies to the MNOPF during the year to December 31, 2002 were $1.2m.
P&O Princess Cruises also operates a number of smaller defined benefit schemes in the U.S. which are unfunded, other than assets in a
Rabbi Trust held on the Group’s balance sheet, and makes contributions to various defined contribution schemes in various jurisdictions.
The pension charges arising from the schemes described above were:

U.S.$m U.S.$m U.S.$m
The P&O Princess Cruises Pension Scheme 5.5 4.3 4.0

12.1 9.8 9.7
(in 2000 the P&O Princess Cruises Pension Scheme figure includes $3.1m in respect of payments to the P&O Pension scheme prior to demerger in October 2000)
Differences between the amounts charged and the amounts paid by P&O Princess Cruises are included in prepayments or creditors as
appropriate. At December 31, 2002 total prepayments amounted to $6.3m (2001 $7.3m), and total creditors amounted to $14.3m
(2001 $13.1m), giving a net pension liability in the balance sheet of $8.0m.
Additional information presented under FRS17 ‘Retirement Benefits’
Whilst the group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 ‘Accounting
for Pension Costs’, under FRS17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ the following additional information has been presented in respect of the P&O
Princess Cruises Pension Scheme, P&O Princess Cruises’ share of the MNRPF and the unfunded U.S. defined benefit schemes. In accordance
with FRS 17, the MNOPF is not included in this analysis as P&O Princess Cruises’ share of its underlying assets and liabilities cannot be
identified with certainty. However, some additional information on the overall funding position of this scheme is provided.
The actuarial valuations of the P&O Princess Cruises schemes and P&O Princess Cruises’ share of the MNRPF were updated to
December 31, 2002 and 2001 by P&O Princess Cruises’ qualified independent actuary. The assumptions used are best estimates chosen
from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not necessarily be borne out in practice. Using weighted averages, these
assumptions for the U.K. and U.S. schemes together were:

It is estimated that the funding position of the MNOPF has changed significantly since the valuation as at March 31, 2000 referred to
above and that the New Section is now in deficit. The Annual Report of the MNOPF for the year ended March 31, 2002 showed that
the market value of the assets of the New Section at that date was $2,404m, of which 66 per cent was invested in equities, 22 per cent in
bonds and 12 per cent in property and cash. P&O Princess Cruises’ actuary has estimated the deficit in the New Section at December 31,
2002 based on the estimated movement in assets since March 31, 2002 and in liabilities since March 31, 2000, and applying a discount rate 
61 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC
Notes to the financial statements 22 Pensions (continued)
to the liabilities of 5.1% in accordance with FRS 17. As noted above, the extent of each employer’s liability with respect to the deficit in
the fund is uncertain. Based on the share of current contributions made to the scheme by the P&O Princess Cruises group, its share of the
estimated deficit would be approximately $85m, although the appropriate share of the deficit actually attributable to the P&O Princess Cruises
group is believed to be lower than this.
On full adoption of FRS17 ‘Retirement benefits’, in future years the difference between the fair value of the assets held in the Group’s
defined benefit pension schemes and the value of the schemes’ liabilities measured on an actuarial basis, using the projected unit method,
will be recognised in the balance sheet as a pension scheme asset or liability, as appropriate, which would have a consequential effect on
reserves. The carrying value of any resulting pension scheme asset would be restricted to the extent that the Group is able to recover
the surplus either through reduced future contributions or refunds. The pension scheme asset or liability would be recognised net of any
related deferred tax. However, this is expected to be minimal due to the tax structure of the group. Movements in the defined benefit
pension scheme asset or liability would be taken to the profit and loss account or directly to reserves.
23 Related party transactions
Mr Horst Rahe, a non-executive director of the Company, has an interest in a deferred consideration arrangement relating to the Group’s
purchase of AIDA Cruises Limited in November 2000. Amounts provided for as at December 31, 2002 in respect of this deferred 
consideration were $57.5m in aggregate (2001 $57.0m) (see note 17).
In July 2002, P&O Princess Cruises International Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into, on an arms-length basis, a lease on
an office property in Germany with a company in which Horst Rahe, a director of the Company, has an interest. The lease is for a term
of 10 years, commencing in 2004, with options to extend. The rent payable under the lease each year varies over the term of the lease,
within the range 350,000 to 500,000. These figures are net of relevant regional government grants.

25 Contingent liabilities
P&O Princess Cruises has provided counter indemnities of $213.4m (2001 $179.7m) relating to bonds provided by third parties in support
of P&O Princess Cruises’ obligations arising in the normal course of business. Generally these bonds are required by travel industry regula-
tors in the various jurisdictions in which P&O Princess Cruises operates.
An Italian subsidiary of P&O Princess Cruises made a claim for a tax allowance for the 1995 financial year under the Italian Tremonti
law, reducing taxable profits by just over 250 billion Lire. Qualification for the allowance is dependent on ownership of relevant assets.
The subsidiary in question bare-boat chartered a vessel it owned to a fellow subsidiary. In December 2001, the Italian tax authorities submitted
an assessment for tax of 70.7m ($74 m) with penalties of 70.7m ($74 m) on the grounds that the subsidiary had finance leased,
rather than chartered, the vessel and therefore did not qualify for such an allowance. The Italian subsidiary has appealed against the
assessment and the outcome of court proceedings in the Low Tax Court of Palermo is awaited. The P&O Princess Cruises board, which
has been so advised by its Italian advisers, believes that the relevant assets were owned and not the subject of a finance lease and that
the allowance is due.
Princess Cruises is party to a purported class action litigation relating to alleged inappropriate assessing of passengers with certain port
charges in addition to their cruise fare. The plaintiffs have not claimed a specific damage amount but settlement of this litigation had been
agreed in principle with the plaintiffs for coupons for future travel in amounts between $5 and $24 with a total face value of approximately
$13.4m. However, on January 17, 2002, a Los Angeles Superior Court Judge ruled that he would not consider the class-wide settlement
agreed by the parties on the grounds that he had previously ruled that there was no appropriate class. As a result of this ruling, the case
remains pending. Notwithstanding this development, the P&O Princess Cruises board does not believe that a material liability will arise
with respect to this case and no provision has been made in the accounts for this contingency. However, if there is a settlement, there
can be no guarantee that it would be of an amount previously indicated.
In the normal course of business, various other claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against P&O Princess Cruises. The
majority of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance. P&O Princess Cruises management believes the outcome of any such
suits, which are not covered by insurance, would not have a material adverse effect on P&O Princess Cruises’ financial statements.
26 Financial instruments
P&O Princess Cruises uses financial instruments to finance its operations. The financial instruments held by P&O Princess Cruises include
cash, overdrafts, bonds and loans. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from
its operations and its sources of finance. The derivatives used for this purpose are principally currency swaps, interest rate swaps and
forward currency contracts.
The main financial risks to which P&O Princess Cruises is exposed are summarised below. No transactions of a speculative nature 
are undertaken.
The accounting policies for financial instruments are described in note 1.
For the purpose of this note, other than currency disclosures, the only debtors and creditors included are deferred consideration receivable
or payable, loans, bank overdrafts and short term borrowings, in accordance with FRS13.
Foreign currency risk
P&O Princess Cruises has international business operations. Its principal operating currency is the U.S. dollar, but it also operates in a number
of other currencies, the most important of which are sterling and the euro. In general, P&O Princess Cruises’ profits and shareholders’ funds
benefit if sterling or the euro are strong against the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar/sterling and the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rates at the
respective period ends were

Approximately 40% of P&O Princess Cruises’ net operating assets are denominated in non U.S. dollar currencies with the result that
P&O Princess Cruises’ U.S. dollar consolidated balance sheet, and in particular shareholders’ funds, can be affected by currency movements.
P&O Princess Cruises partially mitigates the effect of such movements by borrowing in the same currencies as those in which the assets
are denominated. An analysis of financial liabilities by currency is shown below.
63 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC
Notes to the financial statements 26 Financial instruments (continued)
In addition, approximately 30% of P&O Princess Cruises’ operating profit is currently generated by businesses with functional currencies
other than U.S. dollars. The results of these businesses are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the purposes of
consolidation. The impact of currency movements on operating profit is mitigated partially by some interest costs being incurred in non
U.S. dollar currencies.
P&O Princess Cruises’ businesses generally generate their turnover and incur costs in their main functional currency. Exceptions to this include:
•Princess Cruises generates some revenue in Canadian dollars and in sterling.
•Princess Cruises incurs some costs in euros.
•U.K., German and Australian businesses incur costs in U.S.$, including fuel and some crew costs.
The following table shows P&O Princess Cruises’ currency exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the
profit and loss account. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of P&O Princess Cruises that are not denominated
in the functional currency of the operating unit concerned, excluding certain non U.S. dollar borrowings treated as hedges of net investments
in non U.S. dollar functional currency operations.

rate financial assets include deferred consideration relating to the sale of fixed assets.
Liquidity risk
At December 31, 2002 P&O Princess Cruises had committed financing arranged of $1,210m (2001 $1,657m) to fund the delivery payments
on four of its five ocean cruise ships on order, of which $475m relates to ship deliveries in 2003 and $735m to ship deliveries in 2004.
In addition, at December 31, 2002 it had $444m (2001 $605m) of undrawn committed bank facilities with a weighted average life of
five years and a further $162.1m (2001 $120.4m) of cash available for general corporate purposes, including ship purchases.
Credit risk
Management does not consider there to be any significant concentration of credit risk. Potential concentrations comprise principally cash
and cash equivalents and trade debtors. P&O Princess Cruises enters into derivative transactions and maintains cash deposits with several
major banks. Management periodically reviews the credit rating of the institutions and believes that any credit risk is minimal. Concentration
of credit risk with respect to trade debtors is limited due to the large number of debtors comprising P&O Princess Cruises’ customer base.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a positive fair value at

The notional principal amount of derivative financial instruments held as hedges against currency exposures on ship capital expenditure
is $690.2m (2001 $924.2m) in respect of forward foreign currency contracts and $798.3m (2001 $741.8m) in respect of currency and
interest rate swaps providing hedges against currency and interest rate exposure on loans.
The fair value of notes and bonds is based on quoted market price or if these are not available the quoted market price of comparable debt.
Other loans, which include short term borrowings and bank term loans, are largely at variable interest rates and therefore the book
value approximates to the fair value.
The fair value of cash and bank overdrafts approximates to the book value due to the short term maturity of the instruments.

Notes to the financial statements  26 Financial instruments (continued)
The fair value of other investments and deferred consideration is based on the estimated recoverable amount.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are discounted to the net present value using prevailing market rates and foreign currency rates
at the balance sheet date.
Hedging
When P&O Princess Cruises’ businesses enter into capital expenditure or lease commitments in currencies other than their main functional currency,
these commitments are normally hedged using forward contracts and currency swaps in order to fix the cost when converted to the functional currency.
The most significant of P&O Princess Cruises’ foreign currency commitments of this nature are in respect of certain cruise ships under construction.
The periods of the forward contracts match the expected cash flows of the capital commitments, usually between three and five years. Other cruise
ships have been ordered in currencies matching the main functional currencies in which these ships will generate their revenue.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised. Unrecognised
gains and losses on currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts are as follows:

Notes to the financial statements 28 Additional information for U.S. investors
Accounting principles
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.K. GAAP, which differs in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP. A
descriptionof the relevant accounting principles which differ materially is given below.
Treasury stock
Under U.K. GAAP, the Company’s shares held by employee share trusts are included at cost in fixed asset investments and are written down
to the amount payable by employees over the vesting period of the options. Under U.S. GAAP, such shares are treated as treasury shares and
are included in shareholders’ equity.
Depreciation
Under U.K. GAAP, until December 31, 1999 certain freehold properties were not depreciated. Under U.S. GAAP useful economic lives have
been applied to these properties and a depreciation expense recorded based on these lives.
Goodwill and contingent consideration
Under U.K. GAAP, if an acquirer can satisfy contingent consideration by the issue of shares at its option, this element of the consideration is not
a liability as there is no obligation to transfer future economic benefits. Consequently this element of the purchase price is accounted for within
shareholders’ funds. Under U.S. GAAP this consideration is not recognised until the consideration is settled.
In June 2001 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘FASB’) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (‘SFAS’) No. 141 ‘Business
Combinations’ and SFAS No. 142 ‘Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets’. SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting
be used for all business combinations. SFAS No. 141 specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to
be recognised and reported separately from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
no longer be amortised, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142.
The Group adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141 as at July 1, 2001 and SFAS No. 142 as at January 1, 2002. Goodwill and intangible assets
determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortised. Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets acquired in business
combinations completed before July 1, 2001 continued to be amortised through to December 31, 2001. Amortisation of such assets ceased
on January 1, 2002 upon adoption of SFAS No. 142. Accordingly, goodwill amortisation recognised under U.K. GAAP from January 1, 2002
has been reversed for the purposes of U.S. GAAP.
Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Group was required to evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase
business combinations, and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new classification criteria SFAS No. 141 for
recognition separate from goodwill. The Group was also required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangibles acquired
and to make any necessary amortisation period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption. For intangible assets identified
as having indefinite useful economic lives, the Group was required to test those intangible assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 142 within the first interim period. Impairment is measured as the excess carrying value over the fair value of an intangible asset
with an indefinite life. The results of this analysis did not require the Group to recognise an impairment loss.
In connection with the SFAS No. 142 transitional goodwill impairment evaluation, the Statement required the Group to perform an assessment
of whether there was an indication that goodwill is impaired as of date of adoption. To accomplish this the Group was required to identify
its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill
and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of January 1, 2002. The Group was required to determine the fair value of each reporting
unit and compare it with the carrying value of the reporting unit within six months of January 1, 2002. This transitional impairment test upon
the adoption of SFAS No. 142 did not result in an impairment charge. The Group performed the annual impairment test in December 2002
and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Marketing and promotion costs
Under U.K. GAAP, marketing and promotion costs have been expensed over the period of benefit, not exceeding one year from the end of
the year the cost is incurred. U.S. GAAP requires that these costs are expensed in the financial year incurred.
Relocation costs
The Group had accrued expenses relating to the relocation of employees which under U.K. GAAP are recognisable as liabilities. Under U.S.
GAAP these costs may not be recognised until incurred by the employees.
Employee share incentives
THE EXECUTIVE SCHEMES
Under U.K. GAAP the intrinsic value of shares or rights to acquire shares when the rights are granted, less contributions by employees, is charged in
arriving at operating profit. If this forms part of a long term incentive scheme the charge in the profit and loss account is spread over the period to
which the schemes’ performance criteria relate, otherwise recognition occurs when shares or rights are granted. Under U.S. GAAP, compensation
expense is recognised for the difference between the market price of the shares and the exercise price for performance and variable plans. The amount
of compensation expense is adjusted each accounting period based on the value of the shares for both types of plan and also upon the estimated
achievement of the performance criteria for the performance plans, until the date at which the number of shares and the exercise price are known.
SAYE SCHEME
When employed by P&O, certain employees of P&O Princess Cruises were eligible to participate in the P&O save as you earn (‘SAYE’) share option
scheme. P&O Princess Cruises does not operate a SAYE scheme. U.K. GAAP does not recognise the cost of SAYE discounts in financial statements. U.S.
GAAP requires the full discount given to employees on the market price of shares provided as part of a ‘non-compensatory plan’ (such as the SAYE scheme)
to be charged to the profit and loss account when it is greater than that which would be reasonable in an offer of shares to shareholders or others.
Pensions
Under U.K. GAAP, pension costs include the regular cost of providing the benefits as a level percentage of current and expected future earnings
of the employees covered. Variations from the regular pension cost are spread on a systematic basis over the estimated average remaining
service lives of current employees in the plans.
U.S. GAAP requires that the projected benefit obligation (pension liability) be compared with the market value of the underlying plan assets,
and the difference may be adjusted to reflect any unrecognised obligations or assets in determining the pension cost or credit for the period.
The actuarial method and assumptions used in determining the pension expense can be significantly different from that computed under current
U.K. GAAP. U.S. GAAP also requires the actuarial valuation to be prepared as at a more recent date than U.K. GAAP.
67 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC
Notes to the financial statements 28 Additional information for U.S. investors (continued)
During 2001, one of the multi-employer schemes in which the Group participates, the MNRPF, closed its fund for future benefit accrual. Under
U.K. GAAP, the Group is recognising this liability over the period in which the funding deficit is being made good which approximates to expected
remaining service lives of employees in the scheme. Under U.S. GAAP, the Group has accounted for its share of the scheme’s net pension
liability with an expense of $3.7m being recognised in 2002 (2001: $15.1m).
Derivative instruments and hedging activities
Under U.K. GAAP, gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised. Under
U.S. GAAP, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS No. 133) ‘Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities’, as amended, requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value
of derivatives will either be recognised in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of related hedged items or, for forecast transactions,
deferred and recorded as a component of other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are recognised in earnings.
The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative’s change in fair value is recognised immediately in earnings. This statement became effective
for P&O Princess Cruises on January 1, 2001, and a transition adjustment of $9.0m was debited to reserves on implementation as the cumulative
effect of the U.S. GAAP accounting policy change.
In accordance with SFAS No. 133, U.S. GAAP assets are increased by $68.7m and liabilities by $80.3m as at December 31, 2002 (2001 U.S.
GAAP assets increased by $214.3m and liabilities by $219.3m.) Cash flow hedges, of $3.3m have been taken to other comprehensive income.
Taxes
DEFERRED TAX
Following the implementation of FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’, under both U.K and U.S. GAAP deferred taxes are accounted for on all temporary
differences. Deferred tax can also arise in relation to the tax effect of the other U.S. GAAP adjustments. During 2001, the Group elected to enter
the U.K. tonnage tax regime, as a result of which temporary timing differences in respect of fixed assets within the scheme became permanent
differences. The deferred tax liabilities in respect of these assets have therefore been released under both U.K. and U.S. GAAP.
IMPLEMENTATION OF FRS 19 ‘DEFERRED TAX’
Following the implementation of FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’, as detailed in note 1, the reconciliation of U.K. profit and shareholders’ funds to U.S.
GAAP has been restated for 2001 and 2000. In 2001, the impact on the U.S. GAAP reconciliation is a decrease in the ‘Taxes’ U.S. GAAP
adjustment to profit of $96.8m and an increase of $11.3m in the ‘Taxes’ U.S. GAAP adjustment to shareholders’ funds. In 2000, the effect is
a reduction in the ‘Taxes’ U.S. GAAP adjustment to profit of $16.1m and a reduction in the ‘Taxes’ U.S. GAAP adjustment to shareholders’
funds of $108.1m.
OTHER TAXES
The Group incurred income tax in 2001 as a result of taxable gains on intercompany transactions that were undertaken to maximise its tax
efficiency. Under U.K. GAAP, this was charged to the profit and loss account. Under U.S. GAAP, income taxes paid on intercompany profits on
assets remaining within the Group must be deferred. This deferred charge is being amortised over 25 years.
Dividends
Under U.K. GAAP dividends are accounted for in the period to which they pertain, which may be earlier than the date of declaration. Under
U.S. GAAP dividends are accounted for in the period in which they are declared.
Transaction costs
In 2001, it was expected that the proposed dual listed company transaction with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. would be accounted for under U.K.
GAAP using merger accounting principles with the costs of carrying out the combination being expensed to the profit and loss account when the
combined group came into existence. When the P&O Princess Cruises Board withdrew its recommendation for this proposed transaction in
October 2002, these costs were expensed under U.K. GAAP. Under U.S. GAAP, it was intended that the proposed transaction would be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting with P&O Princess Cruises being treated as the acquiree. Accordingly, under U.S. GAAP the costs
incurred by P&O Princess Cruises in connection with the proposed combination were expensed to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Assets and liabilities
Current assets under U.K. GAAP of $20.4m (2001 $8.6m) would be reclassified as non current assets under U.S. GAAP.
Provisions for liabilities and charges under U.K. GAAP of $nil (2001 $0.2m) would be reclassified as ‘Creditors - amounts falling due within
one year’ under U.S. GAAP 
Deferred financing costs of $17.6m included within Creditors ‘amounts falling due after more than one year’ under U.K. GAAP would be
reclassified as ‘other assets’ under U.S. GAAP.

(i) Employee share incentives
The profit and loss account charge/(credit) in respect of employee share compensation schemes was $0.7m in 2002 and nil in each of the
two years ended December 31, 2001 under U.K. GAAP, and $(1.1)m (2001 $5.1m, 2000 $(1.9)m) under U.S. GAAP.
P&O Princess Cruises has adopted the disclosures of SFAS No. 123 ‘Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation’, but continues to measure
its share-based compensation expense under U.S. GAAP in accordance with APB 25 and its related interpretations. If P&O Princess Cruises
had measured compensation costs for the P&O Princess Cruises share options that were granted to its employees in 2002, 2001 and 2000
under the fair value based method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the net profit would have been the illustrative amounts shown below.

As reported under U.S. GAAP 212.9 425.2 253.7
Pro forma under U.S. GAAP 208.5 421.6 250.2
The weighted average fair value of options granted to P&O Princess Cruises employees in 2002 was $2.84. Equivalent fair values in 2001 and
2000 in respect of options over P&O Princess Cruises ordinary shares were $3.78 and $1.91 respectively.
These pro forma amounts may not be representative of the effect on pro forma net income in future years, since the estimated fair value of
stock options is amortised over the vesting period and additional options may be granted in future years.
The fair value of grants during the year has been estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions; expected dividend yields of 1.7% (2001 3.0%, 2000 2.5%); expected volatility of 51.4% (2001 72.5%, 2000 42.0%); risk free interest
rates of 3.75% (2001 5.0%, 2000 5.8%) and expected option lives of up to six years.
(ii) Pensions
For the purposes of U.S. GAAP, the pension costs of The P&O Pension Scheme and of its successor, The P&O Princess Cruises Pension Scheme
have been restated in the following tables in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 87. The changes in projected benefit obligations, plan

Cash flow statements
The cash flow statements have been prepared in conformity with U.K. Financial Reporting Standard 1 (Revised) ‘Cash Flow Statements’. The
principal differences between these statements and cash flow statements presented in accordance with SFAS No. 95 are as follows:
(a) Under U.K. GAAP, net cash flow from operating activities is determined before considering cash flows from (a) returns on investments and
servicing of finance (b) taxes paid and (c) dividends received from joint ventures. Under U.S. GAAP, net cash flow from operating activities is 
determined after these items.
(b) Under U.K. GAAP, capital expenditure is classified separately while under U.S. GAAP it is classified as an investing activity.
(c) Under U.K. GAAP, movements in bank overdrafts are classified as movements in cash while under U.S. GAAP they are classified as a
financing activity.
(d) Under U.K. GAAP, equity dividends paid to shareholders are classified separately while under U.S. GAAP they are classified as a financing activity.
Set out below is a summary cash flow statement under U.S. GAAP:

New U.S. accounting standards
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘FASB’) issued SFAS No. 143 ‘Accounting for Asset retirement obligations’. SFAS No.
143 requires the Group to record the fair value of asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated retirement costs in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. SFAS No. 143 will be
adopted by the Group in the 2003 fiscal year. The Group has not yet determined the impact of adopting SFAS No. 143.
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145 ‘Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections.’ SFAS No. 145 provides for the rescission of several previously-issued accounting standards, new accounting guidance for
the accounting for certain lease modifications and various technical corrections that are not substantive in nature to existing pronouncements.
SFAS No. 145 will be adopted with effect from January 1, 2003, except for the provisions relating to the amendment of SFAS No. 13, which
was adopted for transactions occurring subsequent to May 15, 2002. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 145 on the results of operations and
financial position of the Group remains to be evaluated.
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 ‘Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.’ SFAS No. 146 nullifies Emerging
issues Task Force No. 94-3 ‘Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including
Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)’. SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should
be recorded when it is incurred and initial measurement be at fair value. The statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002, although earlier adoption is encouraged. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 146 on the results of operations and
financial position of the Group remains to be evaluated.
In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45, ‘Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others’ (FIN45), which addresses, among other things, the
disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees. The Interpretation
also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees.
72 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 2002
Notes to the financial statements 28 Additional information for U.S. investors (continued)
The Interpretation requires the guarantor to recognise a liability for the non-contingent component of the guarantee, this is the obligation to
stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur. The initial measurement of this liability is the fair value
of the guarantee at inception. The recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be required under the
guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements.
As noted above the Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of the Interpretation and will apply the recognition and measurement
provisions for all guarantees entered into or modified after December 31, 2002.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148 ‘Accounting for Stock Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment
of FASB statement No. 123’. SFAS No. 148 permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. The Statement also requires new disclosures about the ramp-up effect of stock-based
employee compensation on reported results. The Statement also requires that those effects be disclosed more prominently by specifying the
form, content and location of those disclosures. The transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, with earlier application permitted in certain circumstances. The interim disclosure provisions are
effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company has not
decided yet if it will adopt the transition provisions of SFAS No. 148.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, ‘Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities’ (FIN 46) which interprets Accounting
Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements. FIN 46 clarifies the application of ARB No. 51 with respect to the consolidation
of certain entities (variable interest entities - ‘VIE’s’) to which the usual condition for consolidation described in ARB No. 51 does not apply
because the controlling financial interest in VIE’s may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests. In addition, FIN
46 requires the primary beneficiary of VIE’s and the holder of a significant variable interest in VIE’s to disclose certain information relating to
their involvement with the VIE’s. The provisions of FIN 46 apply immediately to VIE’s created after January 31, 2003, and to VIE’s in which an
enterprise obtains an interest after that date. FIN 46 applies in the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2003, to VIE’s in which an enterprise
holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The Group is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FIN 46 will
have on its financial statements.
29 Post balance sheet event
on January 7, 2003, the P&O Princess Cruises board approved the proposed DLC transaction with Carnival Corporation and agreed to 
recommend to the P&O Princess Cruises shareholders that they vote in favour of the resolution to implement the DLC structure. In the early
morning of January 8, 2003, Carnival and P&O Princess Cruises signed the implementation agreement setting out the terms and conditions
for the implementation of the DLC structure. Completion of the DLC transaction is conditional on certain events, including approval by the
shareholders of both P&O Princess Cruises and Carnival.

Shareholder information Like for like is defined as movements in net revenue yields after adjusting for changes in exchange rates.
Net revenue is defined as gross revenue (turnover) from the sale of cruises, shore tours and goods and services sold on board our
cruise ships after deducting certain costs including travel agents' commissions, airfares and direct costs of shore tours and goods and
services sold on board our cruise ships.
Net revenue yield is defined as net revenue divided by our lower berth capacity offered.
Occupancy is calculated by dividing the achieved pcds by the offered pcds. Since the former includes upper berths whereas the latter
includes only lower berths, the occupancy can exceed 100%.
Passenger cruise days (pcds) means the number of passengers who could be carried on board (defined by lower berth capacity) multiplied
by the available cruise days. Cruises that begin in one accounting period and end in another have their pcds apportioned accordingly;
the financial results are treated similarly. Figures include all ocean going vessels and riverboats operated by the Group.
Underlying unit cost movements are defined as movements in the total of unit vessel operating costs and unit selling and administrative
expenses after adjusting for changes in exchange rates and fuel prices. Vessel operating costs and selling and administrative expenses
broadly represent the difference between total net revenues and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation).

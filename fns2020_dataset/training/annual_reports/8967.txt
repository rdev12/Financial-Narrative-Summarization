At a Glance
What does K3 do?
K3 is one of the UK’s leading providers of integrated business solutions to 
the supply chain sector. Our customers are Retailers, Manufacturers and 
Distributors who are looking for global, brand leading business solutions 
from a specialist provider who is dedicated to their market sector.
We support over 3,000 customers from five regional 
centres in the UK, with our international operations 
headquartered in Holland.
Increasingly our customers are considering Cloud 
Computing, to defray IT costs and to provide a more 
flexible and secure IT infrastructure that will deliver 
them a competitive edge.
We take market leading solutions from Microsoft, 
Sage and SYSPRO and add our own Intellectual 
Property (“IP”) to create industry specific solutions.
By having our own IP , we can tailor these solutions 
to our core markets and our solutions are thus more 
competitive, creating more loyal customers, whilst at 
the same time driving up margins.
We have loyal customers and once installed, our 
software systems can remain in place for 15 years 
or longer. This ensures that K3 generates very high 
levels of recurring income. 
K3 has a strong and successful track record of 
growth. We have steadily grown organically and 
through acquisition over the last 10 years and will 
continue with this dual growth strategy.

Our markets
Retail
K3 entered the retail market in 2004 
with a key acquisition. This business 
unit has grown significantly since 
then. Our customers tend to be 
well known ‘high street’ retailers 
which select K3 because of our 
sector knowledge, track record and 
innovative solutions. In recent times, 
high street retailers have been under 
pressure but K3 has continued to 
benefit from a strategic investment 
in multi-channel retail (including 
internet, store and mail order), and 
continues to win major new contracts 
year on year. Over the last two years, 
K3 has invested heavily in its new ax|is 
offering which will provide a Retail 
and Wholesale solution for Microsoft 
Dynamics AX. The ax|is solution is 
being marketed worldwide through 
global distributors.
Manufacturing
With over 1,000 manufacturing 
customers, K3 is the largest provider 
of integrated business solutions to 
the manufacturing sector. We offer 
solutions for both ‘discrete’ and 
‘process’ manufacturers, and our 
customers range from global multi-
nationals running K3 solutions.
Distribution
Distribution is the most recent 
area of K3’s expansion, with several 
acquisitions creating a dedicated 
business unit of size and scale. Whilst 
there is considerable overlap with our 
retail and manufacturing customers, 
we now have some 700 dedicated 
distribution customers relying on K3 
for their IT services and support.
International
Our International Operations 
Division based in The Hague 
has become a major contributor 
to K3s performance in recent 
years. From here we support our 
international retail and distribution 
customers, with some major global 
corporate customers such as Inter 
IKEA Systems B.V., the owner and 
franchisor of the IKEA concept. Our 
Pebblestone fashion distribution 
solution is managed from here, 
supporting a network of 24 
distributors in 27 countries.
Hosting and 
Managed Services
From data centres in Edinburgh, 
London, New York and Toronto 
we support a global hosting and 
managed service business that 
looks after the IT infrastructures for 
K3 customers around the globe, 
both on-premise and hosted. Cloud 
Computing is a fast growing sector 
for industry as a whole and this is 
also one of K3’s fastest growing 
business units.

Chairman’s Statement
“Very encouragingly, the total value of major 
orders won in the year at £25.3m was more 
than double the level of last year”
Overview
In my final results statement as Chairman 
I am delighted to report on the very 
encouraging progress K3 has made 
across the business. Most importantly, 
we have commercially launched our 
new flagship Microsoft-based software 
product, “ax|is” , which has been 
developed for the retail sector. Results 
for the year to 30 June 2014 reflect this 
progress with revenues up 13% year-
on-year to £71.95m and adjusted profit 
before tax
*1
 up 51% to £6.6m.
Very encouragingly, the total value 
of major orders won in the year at 
£25.3m was more than double the 
level of last year (2013: £11.8m). All our 
software products achieved year-on-
year increases, assisted by a general 
improvement in trading conditions in 
the UK. The strongest growth came from 
our “ax|is” solutions which accounted 
for approximately £12.63m of our new 
business wins, some 50% of K3’s total. 
This included two important pilot “ax|is” 
projects which are currently underway 
and should lead to further large orders. 
The financial benefits of these major 
new wins will continue to come through 
in the new financial year. 
We are pleased with the traction we are 
gaining with our “ax|is” solution. The 
significant development work we have 
invested in tailoring Microsoft’s generic 
Dynamics AX product for the retail 
sector and initial market reaction has led 
to a closer relationship with Microsoft. 
This is extremely helpful in supporting 
our plans to expand our channel to 
other markets around the world. 
As we previously reported, the 
expansion of our existing international 
partner channel is a major strategic 
focus and we have invested 
significantly in this over the year. We 
have already entered into agreements 
with a number of new key partners 
and are engaging with global system 
integrators. The development of this 
indirect sales channel will fuel high 
margin growth and will be a key area of 
investment over the new financial year 
and beyond. We are now co-ordinating 
our plans with Microsoft.
We stepped up our recruitment and 
training of AX resource over the year. As 
we have commented before, Microsoft 
Dynamics AX skills are currently in 
short supply and this has had the effect 
of increasing our costs. However, our 
Dynamics AX in-house training and use 
of Dynamics AX resources which we 
have established in near-shore locations 
will help to mitigate this. 
Our SYSPRO and Sage Division 
continued to generate high levels of 
recurring income and cash and the 
Division also saw strong software sales. 
New sales of our SYSPRO software also 
benefit our Managed Services Division 
as we are now delivering most of our 
new SYSPRO systems as part of a hosted 
cloud offering. Our Managed Services 
activities recorded a profit of £0.43m 
for the year compared to a loss of 
£0.56m last year. This reflected both the 
reorganisation and managerial changes 
we made in the Division and increasing 
sales of our products. The potential to 
develop significant recurring revenues 
from this activity, especially as we add 
new “ax|is” customers, remains exciting.
K3 continues to generate high levels 
of recurring revenues, principally from 
software licence renewals and support 
contracts, and as we grow our software 
product sales, this income stream 
will incrementally increase. Recurring 
revenues for the year amounted to 
£35.42m, accounting for 49% of K3’s 
total revenues (2013: £34.54m, 54%). 
Net debt at the year end was £13.63m, 
only marginally lower than at the same 
period last year. We anticipate that it 
will reduce in the new financial year 
as a result of significantly decreased 
exceptional costs and a further 
improvement in profitability. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

Financial Results
Revenues for the year ended 30 June 
2014 increased by 13% to £71.95m 
(2013: £63.51m), with revenues in the 
second half 17% ahead year-on-year 
at £37.48m (2013: £31.96m). Growth 
was largely driven by the improving 
performance of our Microsoft-based 
activities, including our traditional 
Microsoft Dynamics NAV business 
but most especially from our newer 
Microsoft Dynamics AX-based  
solution, “ax|is” . 
Adjusted profit from operations
*2
 over 
the year increased by 43% to £7.30m 
(2013: £5.09m). Adjusted profit from 
operations
*3
 in the second half year was 
up 72% year-on-year to £3.69m (2013: 
£2.15m). The performance in the second 
half was especially notable in a business 
which historically has been H1 weighted 
due to the profit arising on SYSPRO 
annual licence fee renewals.
Adjusted profit before tax
*1
 for the year 
ended 30 June 2014 increased by 51% 
to £6.60m (2013: £4.37m). Adjusted 
earnings per share
*4
 increased by 33% to 
18.6p (2013: 14.0p). 
This recovery came off the back of 
the significant software product 
development investment that the 
Group has been making which totalled 
£3.99m over the year (2013: £3.56m). 
The largest element, approximately 
£2.06m (2013: £1.45m), was related to 
our “ax|is” solution but we made further 
investment in our other products, 
including Dynamics NAV and SYSPRO, 
and in our sales channel products.
We incurred exceptional costs of £1.72m 
(2013: £0.73m). This principally related 
to: our decision to restructure our 
Microsoft UK Division and Managed 
Services Division to accelerate the return 
of these businesses to profitability; 
senior management changes and some 
restructuring of prior acquisitions. We 
do not expect major exceptional costs in 
the coming year.
Finance expenses were broadly flat 
at £0.70m (2013: £0.73m) as working 
capital requirements increased for the 
enlarged business.
We have recognised a deferred tax 
credit of £0.89m (2013: £0.65m) largely 
in respect of intangibles and together 
with the impact of lower profits and 
research and development credits (that 
are recognised only as claims are agreed 
with tax authorities), there is an overall 
tax credit of £0.68m in the year (2013: 
£0.78m).
Taking into account amortisation of 
intangibles of £2.99m (2013: £3.18m) 
and exceptional reorganisation costs 
of £1.72m (2013: £0.73m), profit from 
operations for the year more than 
doubled to £2.59m (2013: £1.19m). Profit 
before taxation rose 3.1 times to £1.89m 
(2013: £0.46m). Basic earnings per share 
increased by 91% to 8.2p (2013: 4.3p).

Cash flows and banking
K3 has traditionally generated good 
cash flows, with a seasonal weighting to 
October-December. This has continued 
to be the case, although a combination 
of exceptional costs and increased 
working capital as the business 
expanded into larger contracts has 
meant that cash generation has reduced 
from historical levels. We have seen a 
working capital outflow of £2.79m in 
the current year as the business grew, 
compared to an inflow of £1.51m in the 
prior year. Adding back the cash impact 
of exceptional costs the adjusted cash 
flow from operations
*5
 was £7.07m 
(2013: £8.66m), with cash generated 
from operations being £5.35m  
(2013: £8.02m). 
Whilst the Group made debt repayments 
of £2.31m (net), raised £0.28m from 
the issue of share capital as employees 
exercised share options, and received 
£0.29m of tax repayments (net) in the 
year, net debt at 30 June 2014 was only 
marginally lower at £13.63m (2013: 
£13.81m). A major factor in this was the 
investment in product development of 
£3.99m which has been fundamental 
to the order wins that have driven the 
current year profit improvement. As 
K3’s profitability improves further, and 
with significantly reduced exceptional 
costs, we expect the net debt position to 
improve significantly, whilst continuing 
our investment programme.
In August 2014 we agreed the extension 
of the Group’s banking facilities for 
three years through to August 2017 
on substantially the same terms as the 
existing facilities. 
Dividend
With the improving prospects for the 
Group, the Board is pleased to propose 
an increased final (and total) dividend 
for the financial year of 1.25p per share 
(2013: 1.0p). Subject to shareholder 
approval at K3’s General Meeting, this 
dividend will become payable on  
16 January 2015 to shareholders on  
the register on 12 December 2014. 
K3’s Annual General Meeting will be held 
on 26 November 2014 at 10.30am, at the 
Group’s head office at Baltimore House, 
50 Kansas Avenue, Manchester M50 2GL. 
Board Changes
In January 2014, we announced that 
after nearly 14 years as Chief Executive, 
Andy Makeham was leaving the Group 
and that Chief Finance Officer, David 
Bolton, who had led the Group’s 
expansion with Andy, was assuming the 
role of Chief Executive. On behalf of the 
Board, I am delighted to welcome David 
in his new role and to thank Andy for his 
significant contribution over the years. 
We appointed two new Non-executive 
Directors, Peter Cookson in July 2013 
and Paul Morland in May 2014. Peter, a 
chartered accountant, has many years’ 
experience in senior management 
and finance roles, especially in the 
technology and retail sectors. Paul 
Morland has a well-established track 
record in the Technology sector both in 
management and as an analyst. 
In June 2014, we announced that, after 
nine years as Non-executive Chairman 
of the Group, I would be retiring at 
K3’s forthcoming AGM. Plans for my 
succession are well advanced and the 
Board expects to announce further 
appointments in due course.
Outlook
The year has seen a strong recovery in 
the business with the initiatives we have 
taken in the development of intellectual 
property for the Retail sector paying 
dividends. The work we are now doing 
with Microsoft provides the opportunity 
for substantial further growth in our 
Microsoft Dynamics AX proposition, 
supported by a stable and profitable 
underlying business. Whilst further 
investment will be required to exploit 
the opportunity fully, I am confident 
that K3 is well placed to do this in 
future years. With a strong pipeline of 
opportunities ahead, the outlook for K3 
is particularly encouraging.

Key Performance Indicators
The Board considers the key performance indicators by which it measures the performance of the Group 
to be revenue, recurring revenue (both the level and the percentage of total revenue), gross margin, profit 
from operations and earnings per share, both adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangibles, acquisition 
costs, exceptional reorganisation costs and exceptional income. The key performance indicators used by the 
Board are summarised below and the table sets out K3’s performance for the year under review.
Definitions:
Revenue is the gross revenue as reported 
in the financial statements, comprising 
software, hardware, consultancy, and 
support and managed services. This is 
a key measure of activity within each 
business segment and for the Group as 
a whole.
Recurring revenue is the income 
provided for annual licence renewals 
and support for software used by our 
customers. This is a key indicator in 
measuring the underlying resilience and 
growth of the business.
Percentage of recurring revenue 
measures the growth of income 
providing core stability to the business.
Gross margin percentage is calculated as 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue. 
This measure identifies the level of 
contribution derived from each sale or 
component thereof. 
Adjusted profit from operations is 
calculated as profit from operations per 
the financial statements, adjusted for 
the impact of amortisation of acquired 
intangibles, acquisition costs, exceptional 
reorganisation costs and exceptional 
income. This is a key performance 
indicator for quoted companies. 
Adjusted operating cash percentage 
is the operating cash generated after 
adding back cash flows in respect 
of regularising liabilities that were 
significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at 
the date of acquiring companies and 
trades, acquisition costs and exceptional 
reorganisation costs, divided by the 
adjusted operating profit. This is a key 
indicator in measuring the Group’s ability 
to convert operating profit into cash. 
Adjusted EPS is calculated as profit 
for the period, adjusted for the 
tax affected impact of acquired 
intangibles amortisation, exceptional 
reorganisation costs and acquisition 
costs, divided by the weighted average 
number of shares during the period. 
This is a key performance indicator for 
quoted companies. 
Chief Executive’s Review
Strong growth in revenues with significant rise in software at £12.89m (2013: £9.0m) and services at £19.83m (2013: £16.4m).
The improvement in gross margin to 54% reflected higher services revenues and improved software margin.
The adjusted cash flow from operations

 reduced due to higher working capital as the business has grown over the last  
12 months, but has remained healthy at 97% (2013: 170%) of adjusted profit from operations

The closure of major software wins for 
both our “ax|is” proposition (based on 
Microsoft Dynamics AX) and Dynamics 
NAV product drove a major turnaround in 
the Division’s performance this year. 
After a very encouraging first half, the 
Division continued to perform well, 
fuelled by “ax|is” and improving retail 
sentiment. Divisional revenue increased 
by 34% to £25.26m (2013: £18.86m) and 
turned an adjusted loss
*10
 in the prior 
year of £1.66m into an adjusted profit
*10
 
of £0.65m. As would be expected, the 
improvement in services revenue to 
£8.90m (2013: £5.88m) and software 
revenue to £5.57m (2013: £3.64m) 
has had a major impact on the results. 
However there has also been a large 
increase in the cost of delivery. At the 
half year we highlighted that a significant 
increase in demand for Dynamics AX had 
in turn created a surge in demand for 
skilled Dynamics AX resource. We have 
made a significant short term investment 
on an accelerated programme of global 
recruitment, including near-shoring, and 
training to equip our staff. The reduction 
of costs of delivery is a key initiative for 
future profitable growth in the division.
Having secured a number of pilot orders 
for our “ax|is” product at the end of the 
last financial year, the Division secured 
wins worth a total of £12.63m for the 
solution over the year, across nine major 
contracts. This contributed some 82% 
of the total value of the Division’s new 
wins. Including orders for our established 
Microsoft Dynamics NAV solution, the 
total value of new orders was £15.4m 
over the year (2013: £6.87m). Of these 
orders, we closed £6.16m in the second 
half year, including another two pilot 
projects for “ax|is” that could lead to 
further large orders.
What has helped to drive our new 
Microsoft Dynamics AX orders is our 
intellectual property (“IP”), which 
has created a richer more enhanced 
enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) 
solution for retailers. It is worth noting 
that the average size of Microsoft 
Dynamics AX orders is much larger than 
for our traditional Microsoft Dynamics 
NAV business and that delivery is also 
over a more extended period. We are 
working closely with Microsoft on 
product releases and this relationship on 
product development is benefiting our 
overall stance in the marketplace. 
Whilst our focus has been on the 
Microsoft Dynamics AX proposition, 
our traditional Microsoft Dynamics NAV 
business has also returned to growth with 
two major contracts worth £1.3m secured 
in the year, and a further deal worth 
£0.86m secured since the year end. We 
are also investing in a product upgrade 
path for existing customers to provide 
additional functionality for solutions 
purchased in previous years.
Software income of £5.57m compared to 
£3.64m in the prior period. These sales 
are from a mix of traditionally structured 
deals and Microsoft Enterprise 
Agreements. Enterprise Agreements are 
used by Microsoft on larger contracts 
and under these agreements K3 
receives a “commission” for the software 
delivered to the customer combined 
with follow-on services as normal. We 
estimate that the software recognised 
would have increased by £1.16m to 
£6.73m on the traditional sales basis. 
Recurring maintenance income of 
£9.47m is up 14% over the prior year 
(2013: £8.32m) reflecting the impact of 
new deals and initiatives to encourage 
customer retention.
Whilst the Division is primarily focused 
on the Retail market, it also includes our 
businesses that service the wholesale, 
manufacturing and distribution, and 
events sector. These units saw strong 
growth, with an encouraging level of 
new contract wins in both our AX and 
NAV businesses. Revenues grew by 
18% to £7.43m (2013: £6.27m) with a 
strong recovery in adjusted profit from 
operations
*11
 to £0.49m (2013: £0.10m). 
We also saw some good growth in our 
point of sales RSG business that focuses 
on the events sector, utilising the 
Microsoft Dynamics RMS product. The 
opportunities in this area encouraged 
us to make a small acquisition of a 
competitor (RTL) in July 2014.
At 30 June 2014, the pipeline for the 
Division was at £37.9m (2013: £38.8m). 
This excludes approximately £7.18m still 
to be delivered on the large contracts 
won in the current year.
Microsoft UK Division
Divisional revenue increased by 34% to £25.26m  
(2013: £18.86m) and turned an adjusted loss in the 
prior year of £1.66m into an adjusted profit of £0.65m £25.3m

The International Division includes 
our Dutch Microsoft Dynamics reseller 
business, our Point of Sale business 
focused on smaller retailers, and our 
ISV (software author and channel 
management) company. 
The ISV contains the “ax|is” product 
set developed in conjunction with the 
Microsoft UK Division, which has been 
pivotal in the improvement in the results 
of the Group. Early market interest in 
our enhanced retail solution is very 
encouraging and Microsoft’s support for 
our software development programme 
has led to a deepening relationship  
with them. 
Revenue was broadly flat year-on-year 
at £12.53m (2013: £12.86m), however 
adjusted profit from operations
*12
 
decreased to £1.54m (2013: £2.26m). 
Whilst the slow recovery of the Dutch 
fashion and retail market has continued 
to be a major factor in the business 
performance, we have also made 
an investment in resources in the 
Dynamics AX product, which we have 
not historically sold in this territory. This 
division also includes our global reseller 
channel and personnel engaged in the 
development and marketing of our “ax|is” 
software product, which is having a 
profound impact on Group performance. 
Software sales at £1.93m were up 
19% (2013:£1.62m) though services 
revenues at £4.64m were down 3% 
(2013: £4.81m). Margins at 50% showed 
an improvement over the prior year as 
the development of product has been in 
full swing throughout the year and more 
cost has been capitalised. There has 
however been a significant increase in 
sales and marketing personnel to build 
our channel team and prepare the Dutch 
business to become a player in the local 
Dynamics AX market, having previously 
focused on the Dynamics NAV product.
Our relationship with Inter IKEA 
Systems B.V. (the owner and franchisor 
of the IKEA concept and the largest 
customer in the Group) continues to 
be very strong, with good levels of 
services income on planned projects, 
with further potential business to 
come. Shortly before the year end we 
commenced a major work stream for 
one of the franchisees and we are being 
encouraged by certain franchisees 
to use our expertise to assist them in 
other activities.
The Unisoft business is performing in 
line with our expectations with its RVE 
Point of Sale product gaining traction, 
whilst the market remains difficult. The 
move to subscription based sales is a 
big change, reducing the sales cycle 
down to weeks instead of months and 
building a recurring revenue base with 
commitments up to five years. Sales in 
the current year at £3.45m were in line 
with the prior year (2013: £3.48m). We 
are looking at the wider potential sales 
opportunities for this product. 
The Division secured a total of £3.2m 
of major order wins (2013: £1.13m). 
The prospects pipeline, excluding 
potential business anticipated in a long 
term plan with Inter IKEA Systems B.V., 
currently amounts to £6.7m of orders 
(2013: £5.2m), highlighting that further 
improvement in business performance 
can be expected.

Revenues at the SYSPRO and Sage 
Division increased marginally to £26.02m 
(2013: £25.38m). Adjusted profit from 
operations
*13
 was satisfactory at £5.07m 
(2013: £5.58m), with the reduction mainly 
due to investment in sales resources 
in Sage and the acceleration of a 
programme in our SYSPRO business that 
is designed to replace employees likely to 
retire in the coming years. 
The Division’s recurring revenues 
remain high at £15.12m, albeit a £0.86m 
decrease on last year (2013: £15.98m), 
with the reduction reflecting the disposal 
of a small non-core Sage business in 
May 2013. SYSPRO maintenance and 
support levels remained strong with 
a 97% renewal rate (2013: 98%). Total 
software sales were excellent at £5.00m 
(2013: £3.84m) and total services income 
increased by £0.32m to £5.56m (2013: 
£5.24m).
The SYSPRO operation is the exclusive 
UK and sole European SYSPRO partner 
with a rolling five year distribution 
agreement. It has over £1.0m of income 
from own IP products covering functional 
requirements which are usually found 
only in significantly more expensive 
software. The SYSPRO business remains 
strong with high levels of recurring 
income, excellent management of 
opportunities and encouraging levels of 
new business wins. These increasingly 
involve elements of hosted services. 
The SYSPRO business secured 14 new 
wins in total worth £2.34m compared 
with ten worth £1.77m last year. The 
majority of these new deals came 
with extended period maintenance 
agreements. At the year end the pipeline 
was £2.8m (2013: £3.4m), the reduction 
coming about as a result of a number of 
the current year wins were sizeable and 
are taking longer to replace. 
Our SYSPRO customer base generates 
high levels of recurring revenues through 
annual software licence and support 
renewals, with income at £7.35m (2013: 
£6.96m). The major part of this income 
is recognised at the annual renewal 
date in October, giving the first half in 
this division a significant weighting 
compared to the second half. We will be 
investing in new resources over the next 
year to underpin longer term continuity 
within our professional services team and 
to take advantage of new technologies 
that will improve our own IP products, 
maintaining our competitive advantage.
After a slow start to the year as it 
reorganised its delivery and support 
functions and recruited a new Sales 
Director (ex-Sage), our K3 Sage operation 
enjoyed an extremely good second half 
year. In total, we signed 87 deals worth 
£3.7m over the year (2013: 60 deals 
worth £2.05m). The second half year was 
very strong for Sage’s new X3 Enterprise 
level solution and we closed 12 deals 
worth £1.85m. We have an extremely 
popular standard template X3 model 
that allows us to deliver an ERP solution 
in less than 60 man days, which is almost 
unheard of for a relatively functionally 
rich ERP product. The X3 product is also 
sold in a premium version for larger 
implementations and this is a market that 
we are gradually moving into. 
Our other business units in the Division 
have customers who can be offered 
upgrade opportunities to our Enterprise 
level solutions and hosting. These 
businesses contributed £3.58m (2013: 
£3.24m) of sales in the year. £2.50m of the 
income is recurring (2013: £2.52m). 
The pipeline of prospects for the Division 
totalled £17.0m (2013: £14.8m) after 
significant wins in the final quarter of the 
financial year.

The Managed Services Division offers  
a range of application solutions 
delivered on-premises, hosted or via 
‘Software as a Service’ using hosting 
centres in Philadelphia, London, 
Edinburgh and Toronto. 
Revenue over the year rose by 27% 
to £8.15m (2013: £6.41m) and moved 
back into profit, generating £0.43m 
of adjusted profit from operations
*14 
(2013: adjusted loss
*14
 of £0.56m). 
The move back into profitability was 
achieved through a combination of 
increased revenues and lower operating 
costs. At the beginning of the year we 
recruited a small team of “operating 
system” consultants, who are delivering 
managed services for a number of our 
retail clients who were reported in 
our Microsoft UK division. Prior year 
comparatives for divisional results have 
not been restated as the impact is not 
material to the Group.
The run rate of recurring income at the 
year-end showed a 16% increase year-on-
year to £5.30m (2013: £4.55m). Hosting 
represented £2.75m (2013: £2.78m) of 
this recurring revenue, having lost a 
major contract in the second half year 
with an external customer. 
We have focused very strongly on 
widening the product offering to include 
“network as a service” , “platform as a 
service” and “infrastructure as a service” , 
in addition to our traditional “ERP as a 
service” model. Our ability to host multi-
site overseas customers offers significant 
growth opportunities with deal wins of 
this nature in both AX and SYSPRO. We 
also expect to benefit from the marked 
improvement in new order wins in the 
Microsoft UK division in due course.
The pipeline of demand for hosting has 
increased to £4.1m (2013: £3.37m).

Central costs
*15
 for the year were £0.39m (2013: 
£0.53m). These costs included Directors’ costs, group 
human resources, accounting and legal personnel, 
and costs associated with the Plc including financing. 
The costs are stated net of recovery of elements 
recharged to the operating units. The costs have 
fallen year on year due to changes in management 
implemented in the second half year.
Change in  
reporting structure
It should be noted that in future the 
Board intends to report the Group’s 
performance by reference to its 
industry sectors (retail, manufacturing 
and distribution) and its global 
intellectual property.
Outlook
The investments we have made 
over the last two years in Microsoft 
technology are starting to yield real 
benefits for the Group. We believe that 
there is significant long term potential 
to accelerate and widen sales for our 
new enhanced Microsoft Dynamic 
AX solution. The route is via further 
development of our global partner 
channel, which also brings margin 
benefits, and the launch of additional 
Dynamics AX products over the next 
few years, tailoring our existing “ax|is” 
template with IP for various retail market 
segments. Our deepening relationship 
with Microsoft is another positive step 
forward as we seek to scale the growth.
Whilst there are further costs to growth, 
we are also concentrating on driving 
margins and expect to see these improve 
progressively over the near term.
Overall, we continue to remain very 
encouraged by growth prospects  
and look forward to another year  
of progression.

Financial Review
“Revenue for the year was £71.95m

30 June 2013. The increase of 13% is largely

of the Microsoft-based activities” 
Trading results
Revenue for the year was £71.95m 
compared to £63.51m for the year to 
30 June 2013. The increase of 13% 
is largely as a result of the improved 
performance of the Microsoft-based 
activities, in particular our new Microsoft 
Dynamics AX-based solutions, “ax|is” . 
The Group registered an adjusted profit 
from operations
*16
 of £7.30m for the year 
ended 30 June 2014 (2013: £5.09m). 
Profit from operations for the year was 
£2.59m (2013: £1.19m).
Exceptional reorganisation costs were 
£1.72m (2013: £0.73m) which related 
primarily to changes in the business 
structure to facilitate improvements in 
operating performance and also some 
changes to senior management and 
restructuring of acquisitions made in 
recent years.
The amortisation of intangible assets 
was £2.99m (2013: £3.18m). Finance 
costs were £0.71m (2013: £0.73m). The 
resulting profit for the year was £2.56m 
(2013: £1.24m).
Earnings per share and dividends
Adjusted earnings per share
*17
 was 
18.6p (2013: 14.0p). Earnings per share 
was 8.2p (2013: 4.3p).
The directors propose to pay a dividend 
of 1.25p per share (2013: 1.0p).
Cash flow and net debt
The net cash position at 30 June 2014 
was a net overdraft of £3.00m (2013: 
£0.83m). There were bank and other 
loans of £14.28m (2013: £14.08m). 
Repayments against bank and other 
loans during the year were £3.37m 
(2013: £3.64m). New loans of £1.08m 
were obtained during the year. £0.13m 
was paid to vendors of acquisitions 
made in prior years compared to £1.94m 
in the previous year. 
The Group’s net cash outflow in the 
year was £2.17m (2013: £0.99m). The 
Group’s inflow from operations in the 
period was £5.33m compared to £8.02m 
in the previous year, largely as a result 
of the exceptional costs incurred in the 
year and the increased working capital 
required for the growing level  
of business. 
Taxation
There was a tax credit for the year of 
£0.68m (2013: £0.78m) comprising a 
charge of £0.22m (2013: credit of £0.13m) 
of current taxation and a credit of £0.89m 
(2013: £0.65m) of deferred taxation, of 
which £1.04m (2013: £0.91m) related to 
the amortisation of intangible assets. 
This credit for deferred tax in the year 
includes £0.40m following the reduction 
of the tax rate in the UK from 23% to 20%. 
The charge for current taxation is net of 
a credit for an adjustment in respect of 
prior periods of £0.38m arising from the 
recognition of research and development 
credits recognised only as claims are 
agreed with tax authorities. The effective 
tax rate was 16.4% (2013: 15.7%) due to 
the inclusion of profits from overseas 
subsidiaries which are taxed at lower 
rates. The effective tax rate is determined 
by applying the tax rate in each tax 
jurisdiction to the profits arising there.

There are a number of potential risks 
and uncertainties, which could have 
a material impact on the Group’s 
performance and could cause actual 
results to differ materially from expected 
and historical results. The Group’s risk 
management policies and procedures to 
deal with operational risk are included 
in the Corporate Governance report on 
pages 21 and 22. The principal business 
risks which the Group faces can be 
categorised as follows: 
Strategic
Changes in the business environment 
influence the Group’s development 
in terms of the strategies which it 
pursues and the products and services 
it offers. These changes may stem 
from market competition or economic 
and technological advancement. The 
directors regularly review the Group’s 
strategic progress and obtain market 
information to assist in strategic 
decisions around products, competitors 
and potential acquisitions. We recognise 
that acquisitions have played a key 
role in the growth of the business as 
illustrated by the major acquisitions 
made since 2003, and may do so in the 
future. We also recognise that the ability 
to integrate acquisitions and derive 
synergies is key and, to this end, we have 
a strong central management team to 
ensure that strategic objectives and 
targets are reached. 
We see the ownership of intellectual 
property as being critical to the future 
of the business, both in terms of full 
systems and innovative add-ons 
to third party products. We see the 
development of our Retail software IP 
into the Dynamics AX product set as 
being a key strategic business driver 
over the next year. 
Business environment
The Group’s customer base is 
mainly in the retail, distribution and 
manufacturing sectors, primarily in 
the United Kingdom and Europe. The 
environment in which the Group offers 
its products and services is, therefore, 
dependent on the economic and other 
circumstances affecting these business 
sectors including competitor behaviour. 
Over the years we have developed 
a creative, innovative, competitive 
culture and a reputation for advanced 
functionality and product quality. The 
Group has made significant investment 
in its library of IP which protects the 
business from competition and increases 
the barrier to entry in our specialists 
markets. This has enabled the Group to 
build high levels of predictable income 
from its existing customer base, both in 
the UK and in its overseas markets. We 
anticipate that the Group will develop a 
presence in the USA in the coming years.
Relationships
The Group benefits from a number of 
close commercial relationships with 
key suppliers and customers. Damage 
to or loss of these relationships could 
have a direct and detrimental effect 
on the Group’s results. The key Group 
supplier relationships are secured by 
commercial agreements lasting for up 
to 8 years and management participate 
in regular product and strategy reviews 
with the supplier. On an annual basis 
our customers commit to maintenance 
and support agreements that facilitate 
availability of product upgrades and 
business support.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014
20
Delivery
Our products and services operate in 
business critical areas for our customers 
and any failure to meet contractual 
commitments and client expectations 
could damage our reputation and 
impact upon our financial position. 
To mitigate this risk we monitor our 
performance continuously against 
contractual commitments and 
expectations and deploy a wide range 
of experienced technical specialists 
and project managers to evaluate 
performance. High risk projects are 
monitored at Divisional board level, 
meetings of which are attended by main 
Board executive directors.
Financial
Whilst all risks may be considered 
to have a financial impact, the 
management of the Group’s financial 
resources represents a key area of focus. 
Financial risks are faced in ensuring 
sufficient funds are available to meet 
financial commitments as and when 
they fall due and protecting the Group’s 
financial strength against adverse 
movements in financial markets. Further 
details are provided in note 19.
• Credit risk – The Group’s credit risk 
is primarily attributable to its trade 
receivables. The amounts presented 
in the statement of financial position 
are net of allowances for doubtful 
debts, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior 
experience and their assessment of 
the current economic environment. 
The Group operates in three key 
markets and hence the credit risk is 
concentrated on retail, manufacturing 
and distribution customers. The Group 
manages credit risk by ensuring that 
outlays by the Group are matched 
with receipts from customers where 
possible and by tight control over 
contractual terms.
• Currency risk – The Group’s currency 
risk is primarily attributable to its trade 
receivables where certain customers 
are billed in US Dollars or Euros 
where these are not the functional 
currency of the Group company. 
Where possible the risk is hedged by 
amounts payable in those currencies.
• Price risk – The Group does not have 
any financial instruments which are 
exposed to price risk.
• Liquidity and cash flow – The Group 
has deferred contingent consideration 
and a bank loan with set payment 
dates. The Group ensures that it has 
sufficient funds to meet its obligations 
or commitments associated with its 
financial instruments by monitoring 
cash flow as part of its day-to-
day control procedures and also, 
more strategically, to ensure that 
financing is in place with manageable 
repayment periods and that 
appropriate facilities are available to 
be drawn upon when the need arises. 
The facilities from the Group’s bankers 
require the Group to meet certain 
covenants throughout the term of 
the loans and the Group’s forecasts 
indicate that the Group will remain 
within the set parameters.
• Interest rate – Interest rate risk arises 
from the extent to which the Group 
holds interest rate sensitive assets  
or is exposed to interest rate  
sensitive liabilities.  K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

Acquisition History
In pursuing our strategy, we have completed a number of acquisitions to create what is today a major 
ERP system and service provider to the retail, manufacturing and distribution sectors. 
2001:
• Business reversed onto AIM.
2001 to 2007:
• Acquired five businesses providing maintenance bases and 
key software distribution agreements with Microsoft and 
SYSPRO in the UK retail and manufacturing markets.
2007 included three major acquisitions:
• Acquired McGuffie Brunton Ltd (“MBL”) to make K3 the 
exclusive distributor of SYSPRO in UK;
• Acquired Landsteinar Nederland BV (“Landsteinar”) 
– essentially the sister company to our UK Microsoft 
Dynamics NAV software business. The acquisition expanded 
the K3 presence into Europe, the Middle East, the Far East 
and Australasia;
• Acquired Index Computer Systems Limited and with it 
the distribution rights to Microsoft Dynamics AX and 
complementary modules to support food and process 
manufacturing.
2010: 
• Acquired DigiMIS Limited and with it cloud computing 
services. It provides us with hosting capabilities which 
significantly enhances our managed services offering and 
enables K3 to move into other product areas;
• Acquired the trade and certain assets of Pebblestone 
Netherlands which is a leading European provider of 
Microsoft Dynamics ERP solutions for the fashion industry. 
The business has been integrated with our existing Dutch 
retail solutions business.
• Acquired the IP and international sales channel and 
customers from the Pebblestone Group, thereby 
strengthening our presence in Europe and adding to our 
growing library of IP .
2011:
• Acquired Panacea, a major Sage supplier with a significant 
Managed Services base and a small number of Dynamics 
NAV contracts;
• Acquired FDS Sage 200, purchased from Fifth Dimension 
Systems Limited, focused primarily on the Sage 200 product;
• Acquired Sense Enterprise Solutions, a provider of Microsoft 
Dynamics AX into similar markets to K3, with a significant 
maintenance base; and
• Acquired Clarita Solutions Limited, a competitor in the 
Retail and Distribution markets selling Microsoft Dynamics 
NAV solutions.
2012:
• Acquired Azurri Retail, which provides additional 
maintenance income in the Retail sector; 
• Acquired Fifth Dimension Systems Limited, a Sage Enterprise 
and E Commerce system provider with a significant 
maintenance base;
• Acquired Unisoft, a leading provider of retail point of sale 
solutions in Holland and Scandinavia;
• Acquired RSG, one of the leading providers of Microsoft 
Dynamics ‘RMS’ to retailers in the UK and Ireland, which 
brings us a software suite more suitable for smaller retailers; 
and 
• Acquired IBS, a business with a substantial maintenance base.
The acquisitions are in line with K3’s strategy to build recurring 
revenues and acquire profitable user bases with significant 
cross-selling opportunities, in particular for its hosting and 
managed services offering.
We continue to look for selective opportunities that will add 
additional or complementary products, IP and skills, together 
with customer bases that we can grow through our managed 
services and cloud capability.
During 2013 and 2014, we have concentrated on developing 
and investing in our own IP rather than on acquisitions.
Since the year end, we have acquired Retail Technology 
Limited, a Microsoft Dynamics based EPOS provider to 
smaller retailers.

The Board supports the principles of good governance. In fulfilling their responsibilities, the 
directors believe that they govern the company in the best interests of the shareholders, whilst 
having due regard to the interests of the stakeholders in the group including, in particular, 
customers, employees and suppliers. The UK Corporate Governance Code, applies to companies 
of the main list of the London Stock Exchange, and the Quoted Companies Alliance’s 2010 
Corporate Governance Guidelines for Smaller Companies is applied to companies outside 
the main list. Although as a company quoted on AIM it is not required to comply with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and does not give a statement of compliance, the directors have 
sought to apply certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code in so far as they 
consider it appropriate having regard to the size and nature of the group. 
The Board
The group is headed by an effective 
board which meets on a bi-monthly 
basis. All meetings in the period 
were attended by all the directors. It 
is supplied in a timely manner with 
information of a quality to enable it 
to discharge its duties. The board has 
determined those matters which are 
retained for board sanction and those 
matters which are delegated to the 
executive management of the business. 
Day to day management of the business 
is dealt with by the Chief Executive 
Officer who has an Operational Board 
reporting to him which includes senior 
management from each of the divisions 
together with the Chief Financial Officer 
and Operations Director. 
The types of decisions which are to be 
taken by the Board are:
• approval of the financial statements 
and profit plans for the group;
• approval of any unbudgeted plans  
in accordance with prescribed 
authority levels;
• approval of all shareholders’ circulars 
and announcements;
• approval of the appointment or 
termination of advisors to the group;
• the purchase or sale of any business 
or subsidiary;
• any new borrowings, facilities and 
related guarantees;
• any asset purchase or lease, hire 
purchase facility or rental agreement 
over prescribed authority limits;
• any donation to a political party,  
or any charitable donation  
exceeding £250.
The Board has established three standing 
sub-committees to assist in the discharge 
of corporate governance responsibilities. 
They are the nominations committee, 
remuneration committee and audit 
committee. The roles of each of the 
committees, their members and activities 
during the period are covered separately 
within this report.
During the year the Board comprised 
the Chairman, two executive (until 24 
January 2014 when Mr NA Makeham 
left the Board) and two non-executive 
directors until 29 May 2014 when  
Mr PC Morland joined the Board as a 
third non-executive director. Details of 
the Board are included on page 28. The 
composition of the Board is designed 
to provide an appropriate balance of 
group, industry and general commercial 
experience and is reviewed as required 
to ensure that it remains appropriate to 
the nature of the group’s activities. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive are distinct. The office of 
Chairman is held by Mr TA Milne. Since 
24 January 2014, the office of Chief 
Executive is held by Mr DJ Bolton. Prior to 
that it was held by Mr NA Makeham. 
Appointments to the Board are the 
responsibility of the Nominations 
Committee.

Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other
Nominations Committee
During the year the Nominations 
Committee comprised the Chairman, 
Mr TA Milne, and one of the non-
executive directors, Mr PJ Claesson, 
and was chaired by the Chairman. 
Mr NA Makeham was a member of 
the committee until 24 January 2014. 
Meetings are arranged as necessary 
and one meeting was held during the 
year. The committee is responsible for 
nominating candidates (both executive 
and non-executive) for the approval of 
the Board to fill vacancies or appoint 
additional persons to the Board. 
Its terms of reference are available 
upon request and are placed on the 
company’s website.
All directors receive induction on 
joining the Board covering the group’s 
operations, goals and strategy, and 
their responsibilities as directors of 
the group. The company supports the 
directors in developing their knowledge 
and capabilities.
The directors have established a 
procedure, agreed by the Board, for 
directors in the furtherance of their duties 
to take independent professional advice, 
if necessary, at the company’s expense.
All directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first opportunity 
after their appointment. In accordance 
with the Articles of Association, all 
directors are required to retire by 
rotation and shall be eligible for re-
election. The terms and conditions of 
appointment of the non-executive 
director are available for inspection 
upon request.
Remuneration Committee
During the year the Remuneration 
Committee comprised the Chairman,  
Mr TA Milne, and one of the non-
executive directors, Mr PJ Claesson, 
and was chaired by the Chairman. 
It reviews the remuneration and 
contractual arrangements of the 
executive directors. The remuneration 
of the Chairman and the non-executive 
directors is determined by the Board 
as a whole, based on a review of the 
current practices in other companies. 
The committee met once during the year 
and the meeting was attended by both 
members of the committee. The terms of 
reference are available upon request and 
are placed on the company’s website.
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
The Board recognises its responsibility to 
present a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the group’s position 
and prospects, both within its half year 
and annual financial statements and in 
other price-sensitive public reports. The 
statement of the directors’ responsibility 
in preparing the financial statements is 
made on page 26.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors 
have formed a judgement, at the time 
of approving the financial statements, 
that there is a reasonable expectation 
that the group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason 
the directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Internal control
The Board recognises its ultimate 
accountability for maintaining an 
effective system of internal control which 
is appropriate in relation to both the 
scope and nature of the group’s activities. 
The system covers all controls including:
• financial;
• operational;
• compliance; and
• risk management.
The responsibility for managing 
risks on a day to day basis lies with 
the Operational Board. The principle 
business risks and the actions to mitigate 
the risks are included in the Strategic 
Report on pages 17 and 18. Details of 
operational risks are included below.
Operational
These risks, which are inherent in all 
business activities, are those which 
mainly result from the potential 
breakdown of individual business units 
or the group’s control of its human, 
physical and operating resources. The 
potential financial or reputational loss 
arising from failures in internal controls, 
flaws or malfunctions in computer 
systems and poor product design or 
delivery all fall within this category.
There is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant issues faced by the group 
which has been in place throughout the 
period and up to 14 September 2014. It 
has been regularly reviewed by the Board 
and it accords with the Turnbull guidance. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014
24
The Board and senior management have 
a clear and consistent understanding of 
the key risks facing the business. Whilst 
they recognise that it is not possible 
to eliminate risk completely, they have 
established an infrastructure of controls, 
systems, staff and processes which 
aim to minimise the likelihood of risks 
occurring or reduce the impact should 
they do so. The key elements of this 
infrastructure which enable the Board to 
review the effectiveness of the system of 
internal controls are as follows:
• establishment of a formal 
management structure, including the 
specification of matters reserved for 
decision by the Board;
• setting and reviewing the strategic 
objectives of the group;
• Board involvement in the setting and 
review of the annual budget;
• the regular review of the group’s 
performance compared with budget 
and forecasts;
• pre and post investment appraisal of 
capital expenditure;
• integrity and competence of 
personnel as part of the control 
environment; and 
• group reporting instructions and 
procedures including delegation of 
authority and authorisation levels, 
segregation of duties and other 
control procedures, and standardised 
accounting policies.
The Board and senior management are 
aware that any significant operational 
matters which raise cause for concern 
may have arisen because of or give rise to 
material internal control issues. There is a 
process in place whereby any member of 
management who becomes aware of an 
internal control issue can bring this to the 
attention of the Chief Financial Officer. 
There were no such issues raised during 
the period under review.
The Board acknowledges its responsibility 
for the group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Board is committed to operating 
comprehensive processes to manage 
the key risks which face the business. 
They have established a framework of 
policies, systems and procedures to 
ensure that the nature and extent of 
the risk undertaken is commensurate 
with the commercial returns and, where 
necessary, to ensure prudent risk-taking 
to protect shareholder value. Such a 
system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can 
provide only reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. 
 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises the 
Chairman, Mr TA Milne, and the  
non-executive directors, Mr PJ Claesson, 
Mr PJ Cookson and Mr PG Morland, 
and is chaired by the Chairman. The 
committee met twice during the year. 
The role of the Audit Committee is 
to consider the appointment of the 
auditors, audit fees, scope of audit work 
and any resultant findings. It reviews 
external audit activities, monitors 
compliance with statutory requirements 
for financial reporting and reviews the 
interim and full year financial statements 
before they are presented to the Board 
for approval. The Chief Executive, Chief 
Financial Officer and external auditors 
attend meetings of the Audit Committee 
by invitation. The committee is also 
required to review the effectiveness of 
the group’s internal control systems, to 
review the group’s statement on internal 
control systems prior to endorsement by 
the Board and to consider, from time to 
time, the need for a “risk sub-committee” 
to assist in monitoring the group’s 
internal control systems. Its terms of 
reference are available upon request and 
are placed on the company’s website.
The Audit Committee considers and 
determines relevant action in respect 
of any control issues raised by the 
auditors. Given the size of the group 
and the close day to day control 
exercised by the Operational Board, 
no formal internal audit department is 
considered necessary. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014
25
Relations with shareholders
The company seeks to maintain good 
communication with shareholders. 
The Group Chief Executive Officer 
together with members of the senior 
management team make presentations 
to institutional shareholders covering 
the interim and full year results. 
Whilst most shareholder contact 
is with Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer, the Chairman 
and the non-executive directors are 
available to meet major shareholders if 
requested to do so. The views of major 
shareholders are obtained through 
direct face-to-face contact and analysts’ 
or brokers’ briefings. 
The Board considers the AGM to be an 
important opportunity to communicate 
with shareholders and encourages their 
participation. The company despatches 
the notice of AGM, with explanatory 
notes describing items of special 
business, at least 21 working days 
before the meeting. All shareholders 
have the opportunity formally or 
informally to put questions to the 
company’s AGMs. All directors attend 
the AGM and the Chairman of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees is available to answer 
questions from shareholders. At each 
AGM the Chairman advises shareholders 
of the proxy voting details on each of 
the resolutions which is dealt with on a 
show of hands.
Auditors’ remuneration
Fees for services provided by the 
auditors have been as follows:
 2014 2013
 £’000 £’000
Audit services
 • Statutory audit 118 109
Further assurance

 •  Advisory services 14 14

 •  Other services 1 1
   159 166
During the year, the auditors provided 
non-audit services in relation to 
consultation on interim results and 
taxation advice on potential overseas 
activities. The Board considered the 
proposed non-audit services in advance 
to ensure that it was satisfied that 
neither the nature nor the scale of the 
non-audit services would impair the 
auditors’ objectivity and independence.

The salaries of the executive directors are determined after giving full consideration to the best practice 
provisions and after a review of the performance of the individual. It is the aim to reward directors 
competitively; consideration is, therefore, given to the median remuneration paid to senior management 
of comparable public companies. No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
for the financial statements
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the directors’ report,  
strategic report and financial  
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors 
to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law 
the directors have elected to prepare 
the group financial statements 
in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union 
and the company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under company 
law the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the 
group and company and of the profit 
or loss of the group for that period. The 
directors are also required to prepare 
financial statements in accordance with 
the rules of the London Stock Exchange 
for companies trading securities on the 
Alternative Investment Market.
 
In preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
Supplier payment policy
The company’s policy, which is also 
applied by the group, is to agree terms 
of payment with suppliers when setting 
the terms of each transaction, ensure 
that suppliers are made aware of the 
terms of payment and abide by the 
terms of payment. Trade creditors of 
the company at 30 June 2014 were 
equivalent to 63 (2013: 58) days’ 
purchases, based on the average daily 
amount invoiced by suppliers during 
the period.

Disabled employees
Applications for employment by 
disabled persons are always fully 
considered, bearing in mind the 
aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In 
the event of members of staff becoming 
disabled every effort is made to ensure 
that their employment with the group 
continues and that appropriate training 
is arranged. It is the policy of the group 
that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons 
should, as far as possible, be identical 
with that of other employees.
Employee consultation
The group places considerable value on 
the involvement of its employees and 
has continued to keep them informed 
on matters affecting them as employees 
and on the various factors affecting 
the performance of the group. This is 
achieved through informal discussions 
between management and other 
employees at a local level.
Directors’ indemnity cover
All directors benefit from qualifying 
third-party indemnity provisions in place 
during the financial period and at the 
date of this report.
Environmental matters
The directors recognise that whilst the 
group’s business activities as a developer 
and supplier of software applications 
have minimal direct environmental 
impact, they acknowledge that the 
group’s actions may have an impact on 
the environment through its day to day 
activities and through its wider network. 
They acknowledge a commitment to 
the protection of the environment and 
the group’s environmental policy aims 
to raise awareness of environmental 
matters and to establish standards. 
The group’s intention is to establish 
a paperless working environment 
wherever appropriate. This is supported 
through the automation of a number of 
internal management and administrative 
processes such as timesheets and 
performance appraisals. The group also 
encourages staff to minimise unnecessary 
travel by using web exchange, telephone 
conferencing and working from home in 
appropriate circumstances.
Events after the reporting date
These are detailed in note 28 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Website publication
The directors are responsible for 
ensuring the annual report and the 
financial statements are made available 
on a website. Financial statements are 
published on the company’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and 
integrity of the company’s website is 
the responsibility of the directors. The 
directors’ responsibility also extends to 
the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.
Auditors
All of the current directors have taken 
all of the steps that they ought to have 
taken to make themselves aware of  
any information needed by the 
company’s auditors for the purposes 
of their audit and to establish that the 
auditors are aware of the information. 
The directors are not aware of any 
relevant audit information of which the 
auditors are unaware.
The Notice of Annual General Meeting 
contains a resolution to re-appoint  
BDO LLP as auditors for the ensuing year.

The K3 Business K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014
32
We have audited the financial statements 
of K3 Business Technology Group plc 
for the year ended 30 June 2014 which 
comprise the consolidated income 
statement, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated 
statement of financial position, the 
consolidated statement of cash flows, 
the consolidated statement of changes 
in equity, the company balance sheet 
and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the group 
financial statements is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in 
preparation of the parent company 
financial statements is applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the 
company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with sections Chapter 3 of

A description of the scope of an audit of 
financial statements is provided on the 
FRC’s website at

group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements
Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs and 
IFRIC interpretations) as endorsed by the European Union (“endorsed IFRS”) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies preparing their accounts under endorsed IFRS. The company has elected to prepare its parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 81 to 94. 
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. The policies have 
been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated. The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain derivative financial instruments which have been 
valued in accordance with IAS 39.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following standards and interpretations were effective in 2014 but have not had a material impact on the group::
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement

The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will only have a material 
impact on the presentation in the financial statements of the Group.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into 
the Group.
Revenue comprises the value of sales to third party customers of software licences, customised software, hardware and fees 
derived from installation, consultancy, training, support and managed services. It is stated exclusive of value added tax and net of 
trade discounts and rebates.
Revenue on the sale of software licences is recognised where there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with a customer 
(contract and/or binding purchase order), delivery of the software has taken place and the customer has the ability to use the 
software, collectability is probable and the fee is fixed and determinable. If significant post-delivery obligations exist, revenue is 
deferred until no significant obligations remain. Where the Group acts as an agent, commission income is recognised at the point 
the customer has placed an order and the Group’s obligations have been fulfilled. Revenue on the sale of customised software, 
hardware and installation is recognised on delivery to a customer or on completion of contractual milestones. Revenue from 
training and consultancy is recognised as the contract progresses. Revenue from support and managed services is generally 
invoiced in advance, termed “deferred revenue” , and taken to revenue in equal monthly instalments over the relevant period. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Profit from operations
Profit from operations is stated after charging all operating costs including those separately disclosed by virtue of their size or 
unusual nature or to facilitate a more helpful understanding of the group’s results. It is stated before finance income and costs.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries (“the group”) as if they formed a single 
entity. Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated in the group consolidation.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control exists when the group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights 
that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries’ assets and 
liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date. The results of 
subsidiaries acquired in the period are included in the income statement from the date on which control is obtained. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the 
assets, including any intangible assets identified, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but 
is measured at cost less impairment losses. In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity issued is the 
market value of equity at the date of completion, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based upon the present value 
of the expected future cash flows based on whether the directors believe performance conditions will be met and thus the 
extent to which further consideration will be payable. 
As permitted by IFRS 1, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2006 (date of transition to IFRS) has been frozen at 
the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. 
The group performs its impairment reviews at the cash-generating unit level. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable net book value of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss  
on disposal. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014
41
1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Impairment charges of non-financial assets (excluding deferred tax assets)
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken at the financial 
period end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the 
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use (effectively the expected cash to be generated from using the asset in 
the business)), the asset is written down accordingly. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the 
asset’s cash-generating unit (i.e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separable identifiable 
cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from the other assets or groups of assets). Goodwill is allocated 
on initial recognition to each of the group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination giving rise to the goodwill.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not 
been adjusted. 
Impairment charges are included in administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent they 
reverse gains previously recognised in total comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions entered into by group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which they operate (the “functional currency”) are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of transactions. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. Exchange 
differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are similarly recognised immediately in the 
income statement except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, in 
which case exchange differences are recognised in a separate component of equity. 
On consolidation, results of overseas subsidiaries are translated using the average exchange rate for the period. The balance 
sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated using the closing period end rate. Exchange differences arising, if any, are taken to 
a separate component in equity (the translation reserve). Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in 
the period in which the operation is disposed of. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
Exchange differences recognised in the income statement of group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of 
long-term monetary items forming part of the group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to the 
translation reserve on consolidation.

Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Operational Board.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset 
was acquired. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
Financial assets are recognised at fair value on the group’s statement of financial position when the group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They 
arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers, e.g. trade receivables. Trade receivables do not carry 
any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the 
terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value 
of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such 
provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the 
income statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written 
off against the associated provision.
The group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call and overdrafts with banks. 
Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives (see Financial liabilities section for out-of-money derivatives). They are 
carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income 
statement in finance income or expense line. Other than derivative financial instruments which are not designated as a hedging 
instrument, the group does not have any assets held for trading nor does it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair 
value through profit or loss.
Available-for-sale
Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available-for-sale and comprise principally 
the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries or associates. They are carried at fair value with 
changes in fair value generally recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in an available-for-sale reserve. 
Where there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset (which constitutes 
objective evidence of impairment), the full amount of impairment, including any amount previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income, is recognised in profit or loss. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014
43
1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Financial liabilities
The group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, depending on the purpose for which it was acquired. 
Other than financial liabilities in a qualifying hedging relationship (see below), the group’s accounting policy for each category 
is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises only out-of-the-money derivatives (see financial assets for in-the-money derivatives) and contingent 
consideration. They are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. 
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities include the following items:
• Bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the 
instrument. Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the 
liability carried in the statement of financial position. Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and 
premiums payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding; 
• Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Fair value measurement hierarchy
IFRS 7 requires certain disclosures which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value 
using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurement (see note 19). 
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
(a) quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
(b) inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) (Level 2); and
(c) inputs from the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or financial liability is categorised is determined on the basis 
of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in 
their entirety into only one of the three levels.

Hedge accounting
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured 
at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a net 
investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
The group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as 
well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The group also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an on-going basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation 
Where the group has foreign currency borrowings to hedge changes in the net investment of foreign operations arising from 
movements in the forward exchange rate, to the extent that the hedge is effective, gains and losses arising on the foreign 
currency borrowings are recognised directly in equity. The ineffective portion of such hedges is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Pension contributions
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as 
incurred. The group has no defined benefit arrangements in place.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, that is, share options and warrants. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Fair value is measured by use of a trinomial lattice model. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the group’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s 
estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting 
the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised 
over the vesting period is based on the amount that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of 
the options and warrants granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether 
the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition.
The group has applied the exemption available under IFRS 2, to apply its provisions only to those options and warrants granted 
after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 1 January 2006. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

Leased assets
Leases for which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Assets 
held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected 
useful lives. The amount initially recognised as an asset is the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of 
the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. 
Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant 
proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease. The capital 
element reduces the balance owed to the lessor.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Externally acquired intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic lives. The amortisation expense is included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other 
contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques (see 
section related to critical estimates and judgements below).
The significant intangibles recognised by the group, their estimated useful economic lives and the methods used to determine the 
cost of intangibles acquired in business combinations are as follows:
Intangible asset Estimated useful economic life Valuation method
Software distribution agreements 5-9 years Estimated royalty stream if the rights were to be licensed
Contractual customer relationships 5-15 years Estimated discounted cash flow
Intellectual property rights 6-10 years Estimated royalty stream if the rights were to be licensed
Internally generated intangible assets (research and development costs)
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally-generated 
intangible asset arising from the group’s software development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:
• it is technically feasible to develop the product for it to be sold;
• adequate resources are available to complete the development;
• there is an intention to complete and sell the product;
• the group is able to sell the product;
• sale of the product will generate future economic benefits; and
• expenditure on the project can be measured reliably.
The expenditure capitalised represents the cost of direct labour incurred in developing the software product. 
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives commencing from the date of first 
income recognition. The estimated useful lives for development expenditure are estimated to be in a range of between three and 
seven years. The amortisation expense is included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement. Where 
no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period 
in which it is incurred.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on intangible assets and other 
temporary differences recognised in business combinations.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly 
to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
• the same taxable group company; or
• different group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
are expected to be settled or recovered. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is its 
purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition. As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly attributable 
costs of bringing the asset into use.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the asset 
concerned, the cost of property, plant and equipment, less estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each 
reporting date. The principal economic lives used for this purpose are:
• Long leasehold buildings Period of lease
• Leasehold improvements Period of lease
• Plant, fixtures and equipment Three to five years
• Motor vehicles Four years
Provision is made against the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment where impairment in value is deemed to 
have occurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. The group considers all highly liquid investments with 
original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form 
an integral part of the group’s cash management system are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the 
purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Employee share ownership plans
As the company is deemed to have control of its ESOP trust, it is treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes of the 
group accounts. The material assets, liabilities, income and costs of the K3 Business Technology Group plc Share Incentive Plan 
are included in the financial statements. Until such time as the group’s own shares vest unconditionally with employees, the 
consideration paid for the shares is deducted in equity shareholders’ funds. 
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions 
are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are 
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and released to income statement where changes in circumstances indicate that a 
provision is no longer required.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The 
nature of the group’s business is such that there can be unpredictable variation and uncertainty regarding its business. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The key 
sources of estimation that have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below:
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash 
generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. An impairment review has been performed at the 
reporting date and no impairment has been identified. More details including carrying values are included in notes 11 and 12.
Capitalised development expenditure and subsequent amortisation 
Where such expenditure meets the relevant criteria the group is required to capitalise development expenditure. In order to assess 
whether the criteria is met the Board is required to make estimates in relation to likely income generation and financial and technical 
viability of the relevant development projects and the period over which the group is likely to benefit from such expenditure.
Useful economic lives of intangible assets 
Intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives. Useful lives are based on management’s estimates of the 
period over which the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Changes to 
estimates can result in changes in the carrying values and hence amounts charged to the income statement in particular periods 
which could be significant. More details including carrying values are included in note 11.

5 Segment information
IFRS 8 requires identification of operating segments on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the entity’s 
chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’) in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance. The CODM has 
been determined to be the Operational Board as they are principally responsible for evaluating operating segment performance 
and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.
The reporting of results to the CODM reflects four trading divisions: Microsoft UK, International, SYSPRO and Sage, and Managed 
Services, together with Head Office costs. These five segments represent the group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8. Each 
reportable segment has a segment manager who is directly accountable to, and maintains regular contact with, the CODM.
Whilst there are several operating units within each reportable segment, the results of these operating units have been 
aggregated into one reportable segment as they exhibit similar economic characteristics and have one overall manager.
The Head Office segment comprises head office and other centrally incurred costs which are recharged to the units through a 
central management charge. 
The activities and products and services of the operating segments are detailed in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 15. 
The CODM primarily assesses the performance of the operating segments based on adjusted operating profit. This is a measure 
of divisional operating profit less an allocation of head office costs. Adjusted operating profit is profit before interest, tax, 
amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional costs.
The segment results for the year ended 30 June 2014 and for the year ended 30 June 2013, reconciled to profit before taxation as 
included in the consolidated income statement, are as follows:

*Interest expense is reported net of interest income as this is how it is reported to the CODM. Interest income is not sufficiently 
material to disclose separately. Tax expense is reviewed by the CODM for the Group in total. According, no disclosure of the tax 
expense for individual segments has been made.
Segment assets and segment liabilities are reviewed by the CODM in a consolidated statement of financial position. Accordingly, 
this information is replicated in the group consolidated statement of financial position on page 33. As no measure of assets or 
liabilities for individual segments is reviewed regularly by the CODM, no disclosure of total assets or liabilities has been made, in 
accordance with the amendment to paragraph 23 of IFRS 8.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting 
policies. Transactions between segments are accounted for at cost.

benefit from that business combination. Details of goodwill allocated to each CGU are as follows:

Cash generating units are identified as the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the 
cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets and have been changed this year to reflect management’s current day-to-day 
operation of the business.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, derived from the present value of future 
cash flows generated by the CGUs. There are a number of assumptions and estimates involved in calculating the present value of 
the future cash flows, including but not restricted to the following:
• growth rates applied to profit from operations used as the basis for the future cash flows;
• the discount rate applied to the cash flows to calculate their present value.
Although the directors are satisfied that the assumptions used are appropriate to the current circumstances of the group, 
changes to these key assumptions or estimates could significantly affect the result of the impairment calculation. The basis of the 
assumptions used is as follows:
• management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the business. The growth rates are based on management forecasts for the markets in which 
each CGU operates.
• the group prepares pre-tax cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by the directors 
for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for a further two years at growth rates of between 2% and 5% with 
exception of the Walton and IBS CGUs. These CGUs relates to small systems and a gradual attrition of income is expected, 
and an attrition rate of 5% has been applied. The most recent financial forecasts have been prepared on the assumption 
that gross margins will be consistent with those generated historically and that overheads are in line with any changes in 
the level of revenues forecast. The growth rates are based on industry growth rates, management’s view of the observable 
markets as well as historical and estimated requirement by customers for the products and services. 
• the rate used to discount the forecast pre-tax cash flows is 14% and represents the directors’ current best estimate of the 
weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”).
As a result of the impairment testing carried out on the basis of these estimates and assumptions, no impairment provisions are 
considered necessary. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

Of the above, trade receivables of £0.33m (2013: £0.50m) and accrued income of £1.25m (2013: £0.17m) is due after more than 
one year.
The group is exposed to credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers. The group has over 3,000 customers 
spread across various industries, although predominantly in the retail, manufacturing and distribution sectors, and hence 
the concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large and diverse customer base. The group assesses the credit rating for 
new customers to minimise the credit risk. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts are made based on management’s objective 
assessment of the risk taking into account the age of the debt and items considered to be in dispute with customers. Given that 
the large number of customers limits the concentration of credit risk, the directors consider that no further credit provision is 
required other than the provision for impairment of £0.59m (2013: £1.43m).  K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

individually significant receivables included within this provision. The group takes a prudent view in assessing the risk of non-
payment and considers provision for all debts more than three months in arrears unless there are specific circumstances to 
indicate that there is little or no risk of non-payment of these older debts.

Bank borrowings
The bank loans are secured by a fixed charge over the group’s long leasehold property and floating charges over the remaining 
assets of the group.
The group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 30 June 2014 of £1.36m (2013: £3.76m) for which all 
conditions have been met. It is a Revolving Credit Facility on which interest is charged at a floating rate linked to LIBOR and, 
following the renegotiation since the year end, now expires in August 2017.

Risk management
The group is exposed through its operations to one or more of the following financial risks:
• Market price risk
 – Fair value or cash flow interest rate risk
 – Foreign currency risk
• Liquidity risk
• Credit risk
Policy for managing these risks is set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer. Certain risks 
are managed centrally, while others are managed locally following guidelines communicated from the centre. The policy for 
each of the above risks is described in more detail below. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented 
throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantive changes from previous periods in the group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its 
objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or methods used to measure them.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the group, from which financial risk arises, are as follows:
• Trade receivables
• Cash at bank
• Trade and other payables
• Floating-rate bank loans
• Loans from related parties
• Forward currency contracts.
Market risk
Market risk arises from the group’s use of interest bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that 
the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), 
foreign exchange rates (currency risk) or other market factors (other price risk).
Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk
The group has fixed interest loans in respect of finance leases with a net book value of £0.03m (2013: £0.05m) and loans from 
related parties of £0.64m (2013: £0.64m). The fixed rates applicable are 14% and 8.5% respectively.
Bank debt totalling £10.0m (2013: £12.29m) is held under floating rates linked to quarterly LIBOR.

Notes forming part of the

19 Financial instruments (continued)
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk arises because the group has operations located in Europe whose functional currency is not the same 
as the group’s primary functional currency (sterling). The net assets from overseas operations are exposed to currency risk 
giving rise to gains or losses on retranslation into sterling. The group has hedged its net investments in overseas operations by 
denominating a proportion of its bank loans in Euros so that the cash flow risk created from such hedging techniques reduces 
the volatility in consolidated net assets. Following the repayment of the Euro denominated borrowings in March 2014, the net 
investment hedge was not in place at the end of the financial year.
Foreign exchange risk also arises when individual group operations enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than 
their functional currency. It is group policy that such transactions should be hedged by entering into forward contracts where 
it is considered the risk to the group is significant. This policy is managed centrally by group treasury entering into a matching 
forward contract with a reputable bank.
It is group policy that transactions between group entities are always denominated in the selling entity’s functional currency 
thereby giving rise to foreign exchange risk in the income statement of both the purchasing group entity and the group. No 
external hedge is entered into as there is no exposure to consolidated net assets from intra-group transactions.
Other market price risk
Where the group has generated a significant amount of surplus cash it invests in money market over-night deposits. The 
directors believe that the exposure to market price risk from this activity is acceptable in the group’s circumstances.
Liquidity risk
The liquidity risk of each group entity is managed centrally by the group treasury function comparing to budgets and 
quarterly forecasts. 
All surplus cash is held centrally to maximise the returns on deposits through economies of scale. The type of cash instrument 
used and its maturity date will depend on the group’s forecast cash requirements. The group maintains a revolving credit 
facility with a major banking corporation to manage any unexpected short-term cash shortfalls. The facilities from the Group’s 
bankers require the Group to meet certain covenants throughout the term of the loans and the group’s forecasts indicate that 
the group will remain within the set parameters.
The principle terms of the group’s borrowings are set out in note 17.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the group. The 
group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new 
customers before entering contracts. Such credit ratings, taking into account local business practices, are then factored into any 
contractual arrangements.
The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer. The carrying amount of financial assets 
recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Further details, including quantitative information, are included in note 15. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

Capital disclosures
The group monitors “adjusted capital” which comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium, retained 
earnings and other reserves) other than amounts in the translation reserve. Other reserves comprise a merger relief reserve.

Total equity 52,605 51,125
Less: amounts in translation reserve (229) (1,297)

The group’s objective when maintaining capital is to safeguard the company’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it 
can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. In order to maintain the capital structure, 
the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell 
assets to reduce debt.
Sensitivity analysis
Whilst the group takes steps to minimise its exposure to cash flow interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk as described above, 
changes in interest and foreign exchange rates will have an impact on profit.
The directors consider a 0.75% movement in the interest rate to be reasonably possible as at the reporting date. The annualised 
effect of a 0.75% increase or decrease in the interest rate at the reporting date on the variable rate debt carried at that date 
would, all other variables being held constant, in the directors’ opinion, be immaterial. 
The group’s foreign exchange risk is dependent on the movement in the Euro to sterling exchange rate. Following the repayment 
of the Euro loan in March 2014, there will be no impact on the annualised interest arising from movements in the Euro to sterling 
exchange rate.

and the risk premium specific to the unlisted security of 13% (2013: 13%). Were the risk premium adjustments to be increased by 
2%, the fair value of the level 3 asset would have been reduced by £nil (2013: £nil). K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

24 Leases
Finance leases
The group leases a small proportion of its office equipment and motor vehicles (net carrying value £0.09m). Such assets are 
generally classified as finance leases as the rental period approximates to the estimated useful economic life of the assets 
concerned and often the group has the right to purchase the assets outright at the end of the minimum lease term by paying a 
nominal amount.

Operating leases
With the exception of the property in Manchester, the group leases all of its properties. The terms of property leases vary, although 
they all tend to be tenant repairing with rent reviews every 2 to 5 years and many have break clauses. In addition, the group leases 
the majority of its motor vehicles which are generally 3 year contracts.

where the options vest on the achievement of target growth in adjusted earnings per share, i.e. adjusted for amortisation of 
acquired intangibles, cost of share-based payments and exceptional items and with the tax charge being 30% of the operating 
profit so adjusted. All options are subject to the employee having completed three years service from the date of grant.

remain exercisable. In addition, 500,000 warrants for ordinary shares of 25p each were issued to CA Fastigheter AB during 2007 in 
recognition of the reduction in its security following the increase in borrowings from the bank to fund the acquisition of McGuffie

29 Notes to the cash flow statement
Cash generated from operations is stated after payments to regularise liabilities that were significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at the date of acquiring companies, that the directors consider to be a cost of acquisition. In 
addition, cash flows from operations include acquisition costs and exceptional reorganisation costs arising as a result of 
acquisitions during the year. The adjusted cash generated from operations has been computed because the directors consider it 
more useful to shareholders and investors in assessing the underlying operating cash flow of the Group. The adjusted cash 
generated from operations is calculated as follows:

1 Accounting policies for the company financial statements
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the 
preceding year.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom accounting standards. 
Intangible assets – goodwill
The group has previously hived up the trade and assets of a subsidiary undertaking into the parent undertaking at book 
value. This results in the investment in a subsidiary which has no trade and hence provision would normally be made against 
that investment under UK GAAP . The company has however transferred an amount equal to the accounting impairment from 
investments to goodwill. The Board feels that this more accurately reflects the fact that in substance there has been no loss of 
value to the company. Had the investment been written down in strict accordance with UK GAAP , this would have resulted in a 
provision, in the parent undertaking only, of £nil (2013: £221,000) which has now been amortised over its useful economic life of 
five years. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of trade and assets is the difference between the value of the consideration paid and the 
value of the net assets acquired. It is amortised over the period during which the company is expected to benefit, which is 
between 9 to 10 years. Provision is made for any impairment.
Intangible assets – research and development
Research expenditure is written off as incurred. Development expenditure is also written off, except where the directors are 
satisfied as to the technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects. In such cases, the identifiable expenditure is 
deferred and amortised over the period during which the company is expected to benefit. This period is between three and six 
years. Provision is made for any impairment. The directors do not consider the capitalised development costs are a realised loss as 
their carry forward is justifiable under the provisions of SSAP 13.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all 
tangible fixed assets, at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, 
as follows:
Leasehold improvements Period of lease
Plant and machinery, office equipment and fixtures 20-33% per annum
Motor vehicles 25% per annum
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill
The need for any fixed asset impairment write-down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the 
higher of realisable value and value in use. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

1 Accounting policies for the company financial statements (continued)
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment except for foreign currency investments where the 
company has applied net investment hedging. Where net investment hedging is applied, the revaluation is recorded in reserves. 
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is 
measured either by reference to the nominal value or the fair value of the shares where appropriate. Any premium is ignored 
when the nominal value is used.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at the amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events that resulted in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future 
have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the group’s taxable profits and its results as 
stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from 
those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it 
can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying 
timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Turnover
Turnover is calculated net of value added tax and represents the total amount receivable by the company in respect of the sale 
of software licences, customised software, hardware and fees derived from installation, consultancy, training and support.
Income on the sale of software licences is recognised where there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with a customer 
(contract and/or binding purchase order), delivery of the software has taken place and the customer has the ability to use the 
software, collectability is probable and the fee is fixed and determinable. If significant post-delivery obligations exist, income is 
deferred until no significant obligations remain. Where the company acts as an agent, commission income is recognised at the 
point the customer has placed an order and the company’s obligations have been fulfilled. Income on the sale of customised 
software, hardware and installation is recognised on delivery to a customer or on completion of contractual milestones. Income 
from training and consultancy is recognised as the contract progresses. Income from support is generally invoiced in advance, 
termed “deferred revenue” , and taken to income in equal monthly instalments over the relevant period. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

Company Financial Statements (continued)
for the year ended 30 June 2014
1 Accounting policies for the company financial statements (continued)
Pension costs
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other 
post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the period. Differences between contributions payable in the period and 
contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward 
contract rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the 
rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Where the company enters into foreign currency borrowings to hedge changes in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries 
arising from movements in the forward exchange rate, gains and losses arising on the foreign currency borrowings are 
recognised directly in equity. 
Leases
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to 
owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful 
lives. The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the 
profit and loss account over the period of the lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are dealt with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on 
such a basis. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly spread on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term, except where the period to the review date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the 
prevailing market rate is shorter than the full lease term, in which case the shorter period is used.
Share-based payment
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the profit and 
loss account over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting 
period is based on the amount that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options 
granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting 
conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition.
When the terms and conditions of the options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, 
measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the profit and loss account over the remaining 
vesting period.
Fair value is measured by use of a trinomial lattice model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the 
directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.  K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting
Please refer to notes 7 to 20 relating to entitlement to attend and vote at the meeting and the appointment of proxies.
1. Mr PJ Claesson was appointed as a non-executive director of the Company in March 2001. Biographical details of  
Mr PJ Claesson are set out on page 28 to these financial statements.
2. Mr PG Morland was appointed by the Board as a non-executive director on 29 May 2014. Biographical details of  
Mr PG Morland are set out on page 28 to these financial statements.
3. The payment of a dividend requires approval of the shareholders and that approval is sought in Resolution 5.
4. Resolution 6 would empower the directors to allot shares for any reason up to an aggregate nominal amount of  
£2,648,917 representing approximately one-third of the issued share capital of the Company at the date of the notice of 
Annual General Meeting. 
5. Resolution 7 would empower the directors to allot equity securities for cash other than to existing shareholders pro rata 
to their existing holdings. Such power would be limited to the situations referred to in sub-paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 of that 
resolution. Sub-paragraph 7.1 refers to rights issues and similar issues, where difficulties arise in offering relevant securities 
to certain overseas shareholders or where fractional entitlements arise. Sub-paragraph 7.2 permits allotments for cash (other 
than rights issues or similar) of ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £794,675 representing approximately 
one-tenth of the current issued ordinary share capital of the Company. The resolution is proposed so as to give the directors 
greater flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. The directors have no present intention of 
exercising the authority.
6. Resolution 8 seeks authority for the Company to make market purchases of its own ordinary shares and is proposed as a 
special resolution. If passed, the resolution gives authority for the Company to purchase up to 4,764,871 of its ordinary 
shares, representing approximately 14.99 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) 
as at 20 October 2014. The resolution specifies the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for any ordinary 
shares purchased under this authority. The authority will expire on the earlier of the Company’s 2015 annual general 
meeting and the date 15 months after the resolution.
The directors will only exercise the authority to purchase ordinary shares where they consider that such purchases will be in 
the best interests of shareholders generally and will result in an increase in earnings per ordinary share.
The Company may either cancel any shares it purchases under this authority or transfer them into treasury (and 
subsequently sell or transfer them out of treasury or cancel them).
7. On a show of hands every shareholder present in person has one vote, on a poll every shareholder has one vote for each 
share held by him. The necessary quorum at this meeting is two members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote 
upon the business to be transacted. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

9. As at 5.00pm on 20 October 2014, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 31,786,997 ordinary shares of 25 pence 
each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number

Documents on display
10. The following documents will be available for inspection at Baltimore House, 50 Kansas Avenue, Manchester M50 2GL from

 • Copies of the letters of appointment of the non-executive directors of the Company.
Appointment of proxies
11. If you are a member of the Company at the time set out in note 8 above, you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all 
or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote at the Meeting and you should have received a proxy form with this notice of 
meeting. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form.
12. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the Meeting to represent you. Details of how to 
appoint the Chairman of the Meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the 
proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the Meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy 
(not the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to them.
13. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. 
You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. Further copies of this form may be 
obtained by photocopying this form. Please indicate in the box next to the proxy’s name the number of shares in relation to 
which he/she is authorised to act as your proxy. Please also indicate by ticking the box provided if the proxy instruction is 
one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and should be returned in the same envelope. 
14. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against 
the resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy 
will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the Meeting. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

Appointment of proxy using hard copy proxy form
15. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote.
 To appoint a proxy using the proxy form, the form must be:
 • completed and signed;
 • sent to Capita Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU or delivered to Capita Asset Services at 
 The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham Road, Kent BR3 4TU; and
 • received by Capita Asset Services no later than 10.30am on 24 November 2014.
In the case of a member which is a company, the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf 
by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company.
Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or 
authority) must be included with the proxy form.
Proxy voting using the Registrar’s share portal
16. You may also submit your proxy vote electronically using the Share Portal service at www.capitashareportal.com. If not 
already registered for the Share Portal, you will need your Investor Code as shown on a recent dividend tax voucher or 
recent share certificate. For an electronic proxy vote to be valid, your appointment must be received by no later than  
10.30am on 24 November 2014.
CREST proxy voting (uncertificated shareholders)
17. (a) CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may 
do so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored 
members and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
(b) In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST 
message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited’ (formerly CRESTCo’s) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as 
described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an 
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so 
as to be received by the issuers’ agent (ID RA10) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this 
notice. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to 
the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the registrars are able to retrieve the message by enquiry 
to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through 
CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members and, where applicable, their 
CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in 
relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if 
the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), 
to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that 
a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members 
and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections 
of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as 
invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting (continued)
Appointment of proxy by joint members
18. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint 
holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
Changing proxy instructions
19. To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment using the method set out above. Note that the 
cut-off time for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also apply in relation to amended instructions; any amended 
proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-off time will be disregarded.
Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another 
hard-copy proxy form, please contact Capita Asset Services on 0871 664 0300. Calls cost 10 pence per minute plus network 
extras. Lines are open 8.30am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday.
If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of 
proxies will take precedence. If the Company is unable to determine which of more than one valid proxy appointment was 
deposited or delivered last in time, none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of the share(s) to which they relate.
Termination of proxy appointments
20. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company by sending a signed hard copy notice clearly 
stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to Capita Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, 
Kent BR3 4TU. In the case of a member which is a company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal 
or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or any other 
authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included 
with the revocation notice.
The revocation notice must be received by Capita Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU no 
later than 10.30am on 24 November 2014.
Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the Meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a 
proxy and attend the Meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.

What We Do
WE HA VE A TECHNOLOGY 
AND KNOW-HOW BASED 
BUSINESS MODEL
Cobham is focused at the tier 2 (subsystems) and  
tier 3 (components) levels of its markets. It has a 
good understanding of the characteristics of these 
markets, where it focuses its technology investment. 
The Group’s leading market positions increases  
the returns it can deliver for its shareholders and 
ensures it can continue to invest in technology  
and in its employees. 
Cobham in action
Cobham is marine and land launch partner with 
Inmarsat on the new GX satellite constellation, which 
will offer customers faster download speeds globally. 
It has developed and brought to market new 
SA TCOM antennas and terminals in the year, with  
the GX system expected to enter global service  
early in the second half of 2015.
1.  Leading positions  
in our markets
Our business model 
Our integrated business model depends on our  
deep understanding of how to successfully manage  
a leading edge and specialist technology business  
on a sustainable basis and on our close customer 
relationships, which have been built up over many 
years. This is combined with a focus on safety,  
ethics and on developing the skills and capabilities  
of our employees. 
Investing in skills and expertise 
In a technology led business, developing employee 
skills and capabilities are critical to the delivery of the 
Group’s growth strategy. Cobham has continued to 
build on the previously increased level of investment 
in learning and development. Cobham plc

STRATEGIC REPORT
Investment in technology is crucial to Cobham 
maintaining and building its leading market  
positions. The Group’s strategy of increasing 
technology investment, positions it well to deliver 
revenue growth. Cobham further increased its  
Private Venture (PV) investment to £97m (2013: 
£88m), representing 6.7% of revenue (2013: 6.2%). 
This included an initial contribution from Aeroflex.
PV investment
£97 m
(2013: £88m)
Total R&D investment
£198m
(2013: £186m)
Total Group R&D investment, including customer 
funded projects, was £198m (2013: £186m). The 
increase in customer funded R&D was primarily 
driven by the Group’s ongoing major development 
activity on aerial refuelling programmes. 
Cobham in action
Cobham has successfully developed a suite of 
complex valves for use on the Space Launch System 
(SLS), which is NASA’s first exploration-class vehicle 
since the Saturn V took astronauts to the moon  
40 years ago. These valves perform critical functions 
for the main propulsion system on the SLS. 
 See page 10 for more information.
The Group’s technology often has application  
in different end markets, with emphasis on growing 
revenue in commercial markets. This should enable 
the Company to produce sustainable growth through 
economic cycles, as it shifts its portfolio accordingly. 
This organic leverage is supplemented by targeted 
acquisitions, which bring complementary technology 
with application across adjacent end markets.
Revenue from commercial markets
39%
(2013: 35%)
Cobham in action
Cobham’s fuel tank inerting technology, originally  
a technology used in military applications, is a safety 
related product that decreases the probability of 
combustion of flammable material in aircraft fuel 
tanks. It is gaining increased traction in large aircraft 
transport markets and is being used on the Boeing 
787 wide body aircraft, which is now in full rate 
production. It has also been chosen for the Japanese 
Mitsubishi Regional Jet, which is expected to have  
its first flight in the second quarter of 2015. 
 See page 12 for more information.
The business has, as anticipated, substantially 
concluded its successful Excellence in Delivery  
(EiD) programme. The EiD programme has  
delivered significant improvements across a range  
of operational and customer metrics, including 
productivity, on time delivery, quality and within the 
supply chain. The Group is seeking to build on the 
foundation EiD provides by driving a culture of 
continuous improvement across its operations.  
The Group’s EiD expertise is being leveraged into  
the Aeroflex integration programme.
Total efficiency savings from EiD
£100m
There has been a focus on enhancing programme 
and life cycle management capabilities, with a 
streamlined functional structure put in place, together 
with a clearly defined career development path. There 
has been increased training and development activity, 
as this capability is critical to the future success of  
the business. 
Cobham in action
During the year, Cobham has set up an internal 
project management training academy (PPM 
Academy) which has received accreditation from 
the Association of Project Management Practitioners.

Financial characteristics
The business delivers above average

These are due to its differentiated 
technology and know-how and its 
leading positions in its specialist 
markets. The business also has a 
relatively low capital intensity and, 
when combined with its margin 
characteristics, this has resulted  
over time in good cash generation.

Chairman’s Statement
Overview
I am pleased with the progress we have made, 
implementing the Group’s strategy and positioning 
the business to deliver sustainable growth, despite 
the challenging market background in the year, 
In the US, the defence/security market is continuing 
through its periodic down-cycle, albeit with the rate of 
decline expected to moderate. Our other global defence/
security markets are mixed, with investment in Europe being 
held back but we are seeing growth in other parts of the 
world. Our commercial businesses continue to benefit  
from good momentum and we expect this to continue.
We are also going through a phase of increased engineering 
and development activity which, while it creates short term 
pressures for the business, will ultimately result in a stream 
of long term revenue from high priority programmes, as 
they move into production and aftermarket phases. 
Over a number of years, we have successfully increased 
the rate of our investment in technology and this now 
stands at 6.7% of revenue. We have also continued to  
invest in the Group’s employees, building on the training  
and development programmes that were initiated in 
previous years. Cobham has also joined the 5% club,  
an initiative which commits UK employers to hiring 5%  
of its intake as apprentices or graduates within five years. 
We substantially completed the multi-year EiD programme 
in 2014, which has improved productivity, as well as 
delivering a fundamental improvement across a range of 
operational metrics. It has also delivered significant cost 
savings. Not only is this programme supporting us in our 
efforts to grow the business through consistent delivery to 
our customers, the savings have also given us the 
opportunity to increase our investment in the business.  
We are now using the expertise gained during the EiD 
implementation in the integration of Aeroflex. Building on 
the progress made over the last few years, we have also 
further moved the balance of the portfolio towards 
attractive and growing commercial markets. We have 
continued to grow our commercial revenue organically 
often leveraging technology from our defence/security 
markets into adjacent commercial markets. 
Bob Murphy has transitioned the Group to a new 
operational structure in the year, through the organisational 
design project. Four realigned Sectors have replaced the four 
Divisions and it has strengthened the senior management 
and reporting structure to align it with the drive to deliver 
sustainable growth.
We have continued to review and align the culture of the 
business, with the initiation of the Great Place to Work
®
 
survey. Included in this, is a Group-wide employee 
engagement and feedback initiative, which had an initial 
response rate of over 80% of employees. Work will continue 
on this initiative through 2015 to build on and sustain 
engagement with employees. This should ensure the 
workforce is fully aligned with the Group’s growth strategy 
and other objectives as well as monitoring and building 
the job satisfaction of our employees.
Of course, acting ethically and in compliance with all 
applicable laws and regulations is another fundamental 
cornerstone of sustainable growth and a key foundation of 
our culture, on which we will not compromise. This principle 
is enshrined within the Cobham Code of Business Conduct. 
We have striven to ensure that every single Cobham

employee knows what is expected of them and understands 
the standards to be met. We have been mandating training 
programmes on the Cobham Code of Business Conduct for 
a number of years and I am pleased to say that we have 
achieved 100% employee training in the year. This will 
continue to receive an appropriate level of senior 
management focus going forward.
The Board
After nine years service John Patterson, Non-executive 
Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee,  
stood down from the Cobham Board at the conclusion  
of the Annual General Meeting on 24 April 2014. We are 
grateful for his significant contribution and support over  
this period. Alison Wood has taken over as Chair of  
the Remuneration Committee.
Also on 24 April 2014, we welcomed Birgit Nørgaard to  
the Board as a Non-executive Director. Birgit is a Danish 
national and has extensive experience in engineering related 
markets, including as the former Chief Executive Officer  
of Grontmij Carl Bro, the Danish engineering consultancy 
group, as well as the Chief Operating Officer of Grontmij NV, 
its Dutch parent company. She currently holds a number of 
non-executive roles in the private and public sector in the 
UK and overseas. Birgit has also joined Cobham’s 
Remuneration Committee.
We have also welcomed Alan Semple to the Board on 
25 February 2015. Alan is currently a Director and Chief 
Financial Officer at John Wood Group plc, a role which he 
has announced he will retire from in May 2015, after 15 
years service. Alan has also been appointed to the Group’s 
Audit Committee, so that it can benefit from his deep and 
extensive financial knowledge. At the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting on 23 April 2015, Alan will become 
Chair of the Audit Committee. He will replace Mike Wareing, 
who will stand down as Chair on that date but remain a 
member of the Audit Committee. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend for 2014 
of 7.746p (2013: 7.04p). This, together with the interim 
dividend of 2.904p (2012: 2.64p), will result in a total 
dividend per share for 2014 of 10.65p (2013: 9.68p),  
an increase of 10% on the prior year, in line with the  
Group’s progressive dividend policy. 
The Group has a long track record of dividend growth 
and the Board remains committed to continuing to pay 
a progressive dividend. As Cobham now enters a new 
phase of sustainable growth, the Board has considered 
its future approach to dividends. It has concluded that 
future dividend increases should be broadly aligned with 
underlying earnings growth, while rebuilding dividend  
cover over time. This policy will give it flexibility to drive 
growth and maximise shareholder returns.
Conclusion 
We will now focus the Group on delivering organic revenue 
growth, integrating Aeroflex, generating strong cash flows 
from operations and continuing to upgrade our programme 
management skills and capabilities. We will also continue  
to make significant investment in the portfolio to further 
strengthen our leading market positions 
Overall, Cobham has excellent prospects based on its close 
customer relationships, differentiated technology and

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
Strategy and progress overview
The Board has a clear and unwavering focus on creating 
value for Cobham’s shareholders through leveraging the 
Group’s innovative technology, know-how and 
understanding of customer requirements to build and 
maintain leading positions in the second and third tiers  
of commercial aerospace, marine, wireless and other land 
markets and the global defence/security market. We will 
deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth, relative  
to the markets in which we operate, while consistently 
generating good free cash flow. 
Our strategy has two major strands. The first is an organic 
strategy, based on the three pillars of continuously investing 
in the business, improving execution and increasing 
customer intimacy. We invest to keep our technology, 
people and processes at the cutting edge in the markets 
in which we operate. Maintaining technology differentiation 
is critical to the future success of the business and it needs 
to be backed up with flawless execution to meet ever 
increasing customer expectations. This includes maintaining 
an efficient, competitive cost base. The combination of 
these pillars enables us to compete effectively and deliver 
organic growth.
This organic investment is supplemented by using the healthy 
cash flows that the business generates and its balance sheet 
capacity to acquire businesses that operate in the same or 
closely adjacent markets. This further strengthens our leading 
market positions and ensures our portfolio is exposed to 
markets that are growing organically as we move through 
economic cycles. Potential acquisitions must have similar 
operating characteristics and leading edge technology or 
know-how. As two thirds of the Group’s portfolio is now 
exposed to connectivity markets, which is underpinned by 
strong macro growth trends, this will continue to be a focus 
for the Group. 
Organic strategy and execution
We increased PV investment in the year to £97m 
(2013: £88m), representing 6.7% of revenue (2013: 6.2%). 
We continued to focus this investment on our leading edge 
technologies where there is most opportunity for profitable 
growth, investing in a range of exciting new products and 
technologies, including the following examples:
 − Development and launch of the SATCOM SAILOR 100 
GX system for the marine market and the EXPLORER 
5075 GX system for the land market. Shipments of 
SATCOM terminals are expected to benefit from the 
global entry into commercial service of the Inmarsat GX 
satellite constellation. This is currently anticipated to be 
early in the second half of 2015, with Inmarsat 
announcing the successful launch of the second of 
three satellites in February 2015;
 − The Semiconductor Solutions business, formerly part  
of Aeroflex, has successfully developed and brought to 
market a 90nm application specific integrated circuit for 
use in space, delivering size and weight benefits to its 
customers together with reduced power requirements;
 − The Mission Systems Sector has developed its on-board 
oxygen system (OBOGS), which has been used for 
military applications for the general and business 
aviation markets. First revenue is expected in 2015. 
OBOGS has a number of advantages over alternative 
technologies including being cheaper to use as well as 
being lighter. It also has additional safety features;

STRATEGIC REPORT
 − Within the Advanced Electronic Solutions Sector, the 
technology focus within its defence businesses has been 
on developing smaller and lighter products which use 
less power, provide enhanced mission effectiveness and 
which are less costly for customers. These are for priority 
defence applications including: ship protection, the next 
generation of radar and contested airspace applications.
Total Group R&D investment, including customer funded 
projects, was £198m (2013: £186m). The increase in 
customer funded R&D was primarily driven by ongoing 
major development activity on aerial refuelling programmes. 
Total Group R&D investment, including customer funded 
projects, was £198m (2013: £186m). The increase in 
customer funded R&D was primarily driven by ongoing 
major development activity on aerial refuelling programmes 
which, as they move through this phase, tend to generate 
lower margins and so dilute the Group’s overall margin 
performance. In February 2015 we also announced we 
would make a one-off provision of £15m on these 
programmes, addressing cost escalation. However, these 
are critical programmes and we are confident that they 
will lead to significant future streams of production and 
aftermarket revenue over an extended timeframe. 
In addition to our investment in our core technology 
capabilities we have, as anticipated, substantially  
concluded the successful multi-year EiD programme.  
EiD has succeeded in significantly reducing the cost base 
through a targeted programme of site integrations and 
rationalisations. These, when combined with business 
improvements, have enabled us to deliver the anticipated 
£24m of year-on-year efficiency savings in the year, bringing 
total annualised benefits to £100m since the programme 
was launched in 2010. These savings have, in part, been 
used to significantly increase organic investment, including 
in technology and in skills and capabilities.
The Group has transitioned to a new operational  
structure in the year, through its organisational design 
project, with four realigned Sectors replacing the four 
Divisions and it has strengthened its senior management 
and reporting structure to align it with the drive to deliver 
sustainable growth.
Capital deployment strategy
In the context of maintaining a robust balance sheet,  
which enables recurring business commitments to be met, 
including external financing and pension obligations, the  
key elements of our capital deployment strategy are:
 − To prioritise investment in the business for  
organic growth;
 − To maintain a progressive dividend policy; and
 − To utilise the balance sheet and strong cash generation 
to acquire businesses that reinforce our differentiated 
technology and know-how, in particular where these 
enable us to leverage our capabilities into adjacent, 
growing commercial markets.
Acquisition of Aeroflex
In 2014, as well as continuing to meet our strategic 
objectives in respect of organic investment and dividends, 
we have increased our exposure towards growing, 
commercial markets through the acquisition of Aeroflex,  
for an enterprise value of approximately US$1,460m. In 
total, some 70% of Aeroflex’s revenue is generated from 
commercial markets. Consistent with Cobham’s strategy, 
Aeroflex’s revenue is connectivity focused, further 
increasing exposure to the growing demand for data, 
connectivity and bandwidth, so that approximately two 
thirds of the Group’s revenue is now focused in this area. 
Aeroflex is a leading global provider of radio frequency  
and microwave subsystems and components for critical and 
harsh environments. It also operates in high end, technology- 
led segments of the wireless and communications market, 
having a leading position in the provision of technology for 
specialist wireless infrastructure testing applications. Aeroflex 
has similar revenue growth potential to Cobham, with similar 
trading margins and cash generation characteristics.
We have been pleased with the trading performance of 
Aeroflex in the period since completion, which has been 
in line with the Board’s plan. Aeroflex also brings substantial 
revenue and cost synergy opportunities. Its microelectronics 
business has been combined with Cobham’s Advanced 
Electronic Solutions Sector, so that they are now being 
managed together, having considerable complementary 
technology and customer cross-selling opportunities.  
There are also opportunities for synergy between Aeroflex’s 
wireless business and existing Cobham businesses, including 
Axell Wireless. These businesses have also been placed 
under common management as part of Cobham’s 
Communications and Connectivity Sector.
We remain encouraged by the overall potential scope  
for realising synergies from combining the companies, 
targeting some US$85m on an annualised, run rate basis,  
for a total cost of US$215m. Approximately 60% of the 
benefits and 70% of the costs are expected to be in the 
first three years of ownership. The integration of the two 
businesses has got off to a good start, with good early 
progress on delivering the underlying synergies identified 
including a significant reduction in central costs, the 
commencement of supply chain initiatives and the 
announcement of the first major physical site integration. 
Conclusion
In 2014 we made significant progress on the delivery of 
Cobham’s strategic objectives. Completing the Aeroflex 
acquisition was a key highlight, increasing the Group’s 
exposure to growing commercial markets, and Aeroflex’s 
post acquisition trading and integration has been in line with 
the Board’s expectations. This progress enhances Cobham’s 
position as a technology company with exciting prospects 
based on its close customer relationships, differentiated 
technology and know-how, market leading positions and 
an increasingly strong operational foundation.
Overall we have made significant progress on the delivery  
of our strategic objectives in 2014 and, as anticipated, 
Cobham remains well positioned to deliver mid-single  
digit organic revenue growth from 2015.

Our Markets
OUR TECHNOLOGY IS USED 
GLOBALL Y IN DEFENCE AND
COMMERCIAL MARKETS
Competitive position within our markets
Cobham operates in three broad end markets; commercial, 
which comprises aviation, marine and wireless and other 
land markets; US defence/security and non-US defence/
security. The proportion of Group revenue attributable  
to each end market is shown in the charts below. 
Commercial markets
Specialist commercial markets now make up the largest of 
the Group’s end markets, with Cobham successfully growing 
its presence over a number of years. Cobham’s primary 
commercial markets are marine SA TCOM, commercial 
aerospace, including large transport aircraft, regional and 
business jets, helicopters and smaller aircraft, and wireless 
and other land markets. Across these markets it specialises 
in communications, in particular supplying products and 
services for environments where the communication 
solution represents a technology challenge. In addition, 
Cobham has significant and growing positions in specialist 
aviation services, largely in Australia. 
Driving long term demand in Cobham’s main commercial 
markets is the increased need for bandwidth, as the desire 
to communicate increases, increasingly stringent safety 
requirements and the demand for smaller and lighter 
products, which bring operational benefits for customers.  
In addition, in commercial aerospace markets Cobham 
benefits from increasing aircraft production. In its specialist 
aviation services markets, Cobham benefits from the 
increased outsourcing of airline flying operations and 
growth in labour demand from the natural resources 
industry. This is aligned with a reputation for performance, 
for exceptional safety standards and for the ability to 
provide differentiated capabilities and know-how.
Cobham leverages technology used in defence/security 
markets into new commercial applications. For example, the 
Group’s fuel tank inerting technology was originally used on 
military programmes. This safety related product decreases 
the probability of combustion of flammable material in 
aircraft fuel tanks. It is gaining increased traction in 
commercial large aircraft transport markets and is being 
used on the Boeing 787 wide body aircraft, which is now  
in full rate production. It has also been chosen for the 
Mitsubishi Regional Jet, which is expected to have its first 
flight in the second quarter of 2015 and there are also airline 
retrofit opportunities beginning to become available.

US defence/security market
The US defence/security market is continuing through its 
periodic down-cycle with continuing pressure on budgets 
due to high levels of Government indebtedness. The Group 
believes there are indications that the investment accounts, 
which comprises spending on procurement and research, 
development, testing and evaluation, are beginning to 
stabilise with the adverse impact on Group revenue 
slowly moderating.
However, there remains residual risk and uncertainty  
in this market, with the potential for further significant 
disruption and cuts in 2016 unless timely action is taken  
by Congress to avoid the mechanism of Sequestration  
that is currently mandated.
The Group’s leading edge technology, strong programme 
positions on high priority platforms and its strategy of 
increasing technology investment positions it well to deliver 
revenue growth once the down-cycle is completed. It is 
currently involved in the development or low rate initial 
production phases of a number of attractive long term 
programmes, including the US Air Force KC-46 aerial 
refuelling aircraft, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the  
next generation Air and Missile Defence Radar (AMDR) 
upgrade programme for the US Navy, among others.
The KC-46 development programme took an important step 
forward just before the end of 2014 with the completion of 
its first flight. Subsequent flights are scheduled for 2015, 
which will include testing of its aerial refuelling capability, 
and the Group remains on track to participate in this.
Cobham’s focused investment in priority areas of technology 
has continued to deliver results, with the Group increasing its 
ship set on the F-35 aircraft by US$100,000 in the year, as 
the customer looks to implement capability enhancements. 
The increased ship set includes unique integrated microwave 
assemblies which will be used to upgrade the aircraft’s 
electronic warfare system. 
Non-US defence/security markets
The generally subdued economic situation and outlook 
and the high levels of public indebtedness in many 
countries, have continued to hold back defence and security 
investment in Europe, notwithstanding increased internal 
and external security tensions. However, certain countries, 
including in Eastern Europe, are starting to increase their 
defence budgets, in part driven by the current politically 
uncertain environment.
Elsewhere, particularly in Asia, the Middle East, Australia and 
parts of South America, defence investment has continued 
to increase. This is driven by local and regional security 
tensions and underpinned by economic growth. 
Cobham’s revenue in non-US defence/security markets will 
be driven in particular by growth in outsourced maintenance 
and training for fixed and rotary wing aircraft and increased 
production on non-US aerial refuelling programmes, primarily 
the Airbus A400M, the Airbus A330 MRTT and the Embraer 
KC-390 aircraft. Cobham also benefits from export orders, 
won by larger US and non-US defence companies in 
accessible markets around the globe, as its critical 
components and subsystems are used across a wide  
and diverse range of platforms and programmes. 
During the year Cobham demonstrated significant progress 
in its non-US defence/security market, including the award 
of a significant new contract with the Australian Maritime 
Safety Authority for airborne search and rescue, with flying 
commencing in 2016. This contract has a potential value 
of AUS$700m over its life, if all options are exercised. 
The aerial refuelling market, in which Cobham has a  
leading position, has also remained active with Qatar, 
Singapore and France all announcing in 2014 that they  
have chosen to purchase the Airbus A330 MRTT aircraft.  
In addition, the Brazilian air force has ordered 28 KC-390 
aircraft, with this aircraft successfully undertaking its first 
flight during February 2015.

Our technology is a key differentiator in our markets, and 
is intrinsic to the future success of the business. The ability 
to maintain a close relationship with the customer, so as to 
understand the customer’s needs and develop products 
and services in line with these needs is equally critical.
Our competitive edge is in the tier 2 (subsystems) and tier 3 
(components) segments of our markets, where we make 
significant investment in technology. This investment, 
combined with our knowledge of the markets and close 
customer relationships, give us a competitive edge.
Target: mid-single digit organic revenue growth  
from 2015 
Total Group revenue increased 3%, with a good contribution 
from acquisitions, including a strong initial contribution from 
Aeroflex, which completed in September 2014. Partially 
offsetting this was a significant adverse foreign currency 
translation impact.
Organic revenue was 2% lower overall.
Target: 6%  
Following the significant increases in prior years, the rate  
of technology investment in the existing business has been 
maintained, in addition to a first time contribution from the 
former Aeroflex businesses, which has increased the Group’s  
overall rate of investment.

 3. Leverage our technology 4. Focus on M&A
Identify adjacent markets where our existing 
technology and know-how can be leveraged 
to meet the needs of new customers.
Use mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to shift 
the emphasis of the portfolio ahead of market 
movements to remain exposed to faster 
growing markets.
M&A is used as a supplement to our organic technology 
investment. It brings the potential for technology and 
revenue synergy as well as efficiency savings. M&A is funded 
from the Group’s cash flows and balance sheet and is 
subject to the Group’s rigorous and disciplined financial 
investment criteria.
During the year, Cobham invested in the acquisition 
of Aeroflex, for an enterprise value of approximately 
US$1,460m. The business has brought access to attractive 
commercial markets and technology. It is expected to bring 
significant cost savings and its complementary technology 
brings good potential for revenue synergies. 
In 2014 commercial revenue growth of 5% was in part 
driven by a strong performance from the SA TCOM business, 
which delivered good growth in marine and aerospace 
markets. The Aviation Services Sector also showed good 
growth during the year in its outsourced aviation services 
business and in its regional services business, although 
commercial growth moderated in the second half.

The acquisition of Aeroflex
Overview 
Aeroflex is a leading global provider of high performance 
subsystems and components. The acquisition builds on 
Cobham’s connectivity strategy, following the 2012  
Thrane & Thrane SA TCOM acquisition and the 2013  
Axell in-building wireless acquisition.
Approximately 60% of Aeroflex revenue is focused on 
microelectronics technology, typically for demanding 
and harsh environments including defence, in space, energy 
and medical applications. The remaining 40% of its revenue 
is in technology led segments of the wireless and 
communications market for specialist test applications.  
This revenue is predominantly generated in commercial  
end markets. The business has made significant investment 
in R&D, with the recent launch of a number of new and 
innovative technologies and it has good potential for  
future revenue growth.
Why we bought Aeroflex
The acquisition of Aeroflex is consistent with Cobham’s 
strategy of having leading positions in attractive, high 
technology led commercial segments. Aeroflex and 
Cobham have complementary products and customers in 
microelectronics, with good potential to generate revenue 
synergies. Combining the Cobham and Aeroflex businesses 
will also generate an estimated US$85m of cost savings, 
driven by the significant physical overlap in the US.
The 7100 digital radio test set is a single box 
solution for protocol performance and radio 
frequency testing of 4G high speed data 
cellular devices and components.

Provides aircraft and in-building communications 
equipment, law enforcement and national security 
monitoring solutions, satellite communication equipment 
for land, sea and air applications, specialist composite 
products for military and commercial applications,  
and test and measure instrumentation for radio frequency, 
cellular communications and wireless networking.
Revenue
T otal revenue increased £19m, due to an initial part year 
contribution from the former Aeroflex T est Solutions business 
and the full year contribution from Axell. This was partially 
offset by a significant adverse impact from foreign currency 
translation of £26m. There was an organic revenue decline of 
6%, driven by lower defence/security revenue. 
The Sector saw organic revenue growth from its  
commercial markets, with a good performance from 
SA TCOM in its marine and aerospace markets. In addition, 
there was revenue growth from increased volumes of radio 
management systems and antennas into the large transport 
and regional jet markets. Within defence/security markets 
there continued to be weakness in many of its shorter cycle 
land oriented businesses, particularly for counter-improvised 
explosive device and surveillance products.
Trading profit
The Sector’s trading profit increased by £3m largely due to 
the contribution from Aeroflex and the incremental 
contribution from Axell. Trading profit also benefited from 
increased volumes in commercial markets and from 
proactive implementation of rationalisation and other cost 
reduction activities. However, these positive factors were 
offset by lower volumes in defence/security markets and 
by the adverse impact from foreign currency translation. 
The Sector’s trading margin was unchanged at 1 7 .0%.
Developments impacting the future
 − Delivery of the first Airbus A350 wide body aircraft for 
which Cobham supplies standard fit content including 
audio and radio management systems and antennas;
 − The TM/E500 secured a market leading position  
in the 4G Radio Access Network wireless load test market, 
winning new customers in the US, Australia, France, China 
and South Korea; 
 − Launch of the SAILOR 100 GX SATCOM marine system 
with the land based EXPLORER 5075 GX also completed. 
This is ahead of the global entry into commercial service 
of Inmarsat’s new, next generation GX satellite 
constellation, early in the second half of 201 5.

bomb disposal vehicles for homeland security and military. 
Revenue
T otal revenue was lower by £24m, including an adverse 
foreign currency translation impact of £12m, primarily 
due to the US dollar, and an organic revenue decline of 4%.
The organic decline was driven by a lull in production of 
the KC-130 tanker aircraft in the US and lower production 
and aftermarket activity in support of the UK Future Strategic 
Tanker Aircraft programme’s Airbus A330 MRTT aircraft. 
This was partially offset by increasing customer funded 
engineering and development revenue on next generation 
aerial refuelling programmes, principally the Boeing KC-46 
and the Airbus A400M.
Trading profit
The Sector’s trading profit decreased to £36m. This was 
in part due to an unfavourable mix in the aerial refuelling 
business driven by lower production and aftermarket 
revenue, which was partially offset by increased lower 
margin engineering and development revenue. In addition 
there was an adverse impact from a provision of £15m on 
aerial refuelling development programmes. Reflecting the 
above factors, the trading margin decreased to 10.8%.
Developments impacting the future
 − Following Qatar, Singapore and France announcing they 
had selected the Airbus A330 MRTT aircraft, additional 
aerial refuelling production orders are expected;
 − The Brazilian Air Force signed a contract for 28 Embraer 
KC - 390 aircraft and a new multi-year order was received 
from Lockheed Martin for the KC - 1 30 tanker;
 − New orders for weapons carriage and release products 
received for the Eurofighter aircraft and for programmes 
for the US and for Oman. An order was also booked for 
a major upgrade programme on the weapons systems 
of the Indian Air Force Jaguar aircraft;
 − Fuel tank inerting system orders and revenue continue 
to build for commercial aircraft, most notably for the 
Boeing 787 and the Mitsubishi Regional Jet programmes. 
This market remains attractive with several further 
sizeable opportunities to be concluded in 2015, as well  
as significant airline retrofit opportunities.

Provides critical solutions for communication on land,  
at sea, and in the air and in space, by moving data through 
off-the-shelf and customised products including radio 
frequency, microwave, and high reliability microelectronics, 
antenna subsystems and motion control solutions.  
This incorporates defence, wireless/mobile and fixed 
broadband, X-ray imaging, medical, industrial, and point  
of sale markets.
Revenue
Total revenue increased by £38m due to an initial part year 
contribution from the former Aeroflex Microelectronics 
Solutions business, which was partially offset by a significant 
adverse currency translation impact from the US dollar of 
£19m. Organic revenue was 1% lower, a good performance 
notwithstanding the ongoing challenging conditions in US 
defence/security, its primary market.
Organic revenue was impacted by reduced revenue from a 
number of mature production programmes, including for 
legacy electronic warfare and space related programmes, 
and lower revenue from foreign military sales. These were 
mostly offset by growing revenue from next generation 
electronic warfare and radar programmes such as the 
Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Programme  
and Joint Strike Fighter.
Trading profit
The Sector’s trading profit increased by £1m, largely due to 
the contribution from Aeroflex, although there was also an 
adverse impact from foreign currency translation. Trading 
profit was also impacted by the lower volumes from mature 
production programmes, which tend to offer the Sector 
some of its highest margins. The margin decreased to 15.6%, 
also reflecting the factors above. 
Developments impacting the future
 − Cobham was part of the winning Raytheon team on  
the US Navy AMDR programme, with work already

Highlights
In 2014 Cobham secured the Australian 
Maritime Safety Authority contract with  
the Australian government to provide 
an airborne search and rescue capability 
for 12 years from 2016, with aircraft 
modification and mobilisation activity 
commencing in December 2014.
Delivers outsourced aviation services for military and civil 
customers worldwide through military training, special 
mission flight operations, outsourced commercial  
aviation and aircraft engineering.
Revenue
Total revenue increased by £47m, due to strong organic 
growth of 8% and the full year impact of the FBH 
acquisition. Partially offsetting these was a significant 
adverse foreign currency translation impact of £27m from 
the Australian dollar.
There was good organic growth in the commercial business, 
particularly driven by increased revenue from Qantas, as the 
expanded contract which commenced in the second half  
of 2013 became fully operational. In addition, there was 
increased flight frequency in the Australian natural resources 
market. This included a short term contract expansion with 
Chevron to operate a jet shuttle between Karratha and 
Barrow Island, and a new contract with Goldfields Australia 
to provide fly-in fly-out (FIFO) services using jet aircraft 
equipped with Cobham’s unique gravel kit capability for 
unsealed runways.
In defence/security markets, the Sector also showed good 
organic revenue growth, including a new contract to provide 
maintenance support to the Qatar Emiri Air Force fleet of 
AW139 helicopters and an initial deployment undertaken 
relating to the new operational readiness and training 
contract with the Royal Saudi Air Force.
Trading profit
The Sector’s trading profit increased by £7m, due to the 
incremental contribution from FBH and from organic 
growth. This was partially offset by an adverse impact from 
foreign currency translation. The trading margin was broadly 
unchanged at 13.2%.
Developments impacting the future
 − Cobham has been selected to provide search and rescue 
services to the Australian government, under a base  
1 2-year AUS$640m contract using long range jet aircraft 
that will be specially modified for the role at Cobham’s 
Adelaide facility. Flying operations will begin in the second 
half of 201 6;
 − The Chevron FIFO contract in Australia was extended 
until 2020, and will include the introduction of the new 
Embraer 190 jet aircraft type, the first of its type to be 
used in this market. Cobham plc

Total revenue increased 3% to £1,852m (2013: £1,790m), 
driven by acquisitions. This was partially offset by an  
adverse foreign currency translation impact. Organic 
revenue was down 2%.
The Group’s trading profit was £287m (2013: £318m),  
which included the significant adverse impact from foreign 
currency translation. In addition, there was the impact from 
a shift in revenue mix, with lower volumes in some of the 
more profitable shorter cycle businesses and an increase in 
lower margin engineering and development revenue. There 
was also a one-off provision of £15m against aerial refuelling 
development programmes. The Group’s trading margin 
was 15.5% (2013: 17.7%).
Total R&D investment was £198m (2013: £186m), with 
higher PV investment which included an initial contribution 
from the Aeroflex acquisition. There was also higher 
customer funded R&D investment, primarily driven by 
ongoing aerial refuelling development programmes.
Underlying EPS was 18.5p (2013: 21.6p), 14%, lower than the 
prior year, primarily reflecting the Group’s lower trading profit 
and the higher share count following the May 2014 equity 
placing. At constant translation exchange, underlying EPS 
was 11% lower.
Operating cash flow was £208m (2013: £269m). Operating 
cash conversion was 73% (2013: 85%), which was lower 
principally due to a significant cash outflow from an 
increase in working capital. This included the impact from 
strong year end trading, an increase in debtors in Aviation 
Services due to the timing of receipts from customers on 
new contracts secured, and an increase associated with the 
Group’s development contracts, including its aerial refuelling 
programmes.
At the year end, net debt had increased to £1,223m 
(2013: £453m), principally due to the acquisition of 
Aeroflex. Net debt/EBITDA was 2.6x.
Orders
The Group’s book-to-bill ratio in the year was 1.03x, with all 
the Sectors having a book-to-bill ratio above 1x, except for 
the Advanced Electronic Solutions Sector which saw some

business also saw a book-to-bill ratio above 1x.
Order intake in the year was £1,908m (2013: £1,670m), being 
20% higher at constant translation exchange. Excluding the 
impact of acquisitions and divestments, order intake was 
10% higher than the prior year at constant currency. STRATEGIC REPORT

£1,790m (£85m) £173m (£26m) £1,852m
Total Group revenue increased by 3% to £1,852m 
(2013: £1,790m), including an initial contribution from 
Aeroflex and the full year contributions from Axell and FBH. 
There was a significant adverse foreign currency translation 
impact of £85m, primarily due to a year-on-year strengthening 
in the average rate of sterling against each of the Group’s 
principal foreign currencies. The applicable exchange rates 
for each of these foreign currencies are set out on page 32.
The Group’s organic revenue increased by 1% year-on-year 
in the second half, with full year organic revenue being 
down 2%. Full year Group organic revenue was underpinned 
by good growth in commercial markets of 5%. This was 
driven, in part by a strong performance from the SA TCOM 
business, which delivered good growth in marine and 
aerospace markets. The Group’s Aviation Services business 
also showed good growth during the year in Australia from 
its outsourced airline services business and its regional 
services business, although commercial growth moderated, 
as anticipated, in the second half.
In US defence/security, there was a significant sequential 
organic revenue improvement in the second half. In part 
this was due to increased engineering and development 
revenue from the KC-46 aerial refuelling programme and 
also to an increase in revenue from some of the Group’s 
shorter cycle businesses, including its surveillance business. 
Full year organic revenue in US defence/security fell by 
4%, driven by a decline in demand in shorter cycle 
businesses which are exposed to land related markets. 
This included lower revenue from counter-improvised 
explosive device products, antennas, composites 
and surveillance products. There were also lower volumes 
from aerial refuelling production in the year.
Demand conditions also improved in the Group’s non-US 
defence/security markets in the second half of the year. 
This was primarily driven by Aviation Services’ rotary wing 
and Special Mission businesses. These delivered strong 
second half growth, including from the new contract to 
provide maintenance support to the Qatar Emiri Air Force 
fleet of AW139 helicopters and an initial contribution from 
the new operational readiness and training contract with  
the Royal Saudi Air Force. In the full year, non-US defence/
security organic revenue was 6% lower. In part this was  
due to lower aerial refuelling aftermarket revenue, although 
this was partially offset by higher engineering and 
development revenue from the Airbus A400M and Embraer 
KC-390 tanker programmes. There was also a reduction  
in volumes from shorter cycle land related revenue, in 
particular counter-improvised explosive device and 
surveillance products.
Technology investment
Consistent with the Group’s strategy, Cobham further 
increased its PV investment in the year to £97m 
(2013: £88m), representing 6.7% (2013: 6.2%) of revenue. 
This included an initial contribution from Aeroflex.
Total Group R&D investment, including customer funded 
projects, was £198m (2013: £186m). The increase in 
customer funded R&D was primarily driven by the Group’s 
ongoing major development activity on aerial refuelling 
programmes. The overall level of the Group’s development 
activity on these programmes is anticipated to moderate 
in 2015, as the KC-46 and A400M programmes transition 
into low rate initial production. These programmes are 
underpinned by a significant stream of long term 
production and aftermarket revenue. 
Trading profit
The Group’s trading profit of £287m (2013: £318m), included 
a contribution from acquisitions but also included a significant 
adverse impact from foreign currency translation of £13m. 
As the Group’s business has evolved there has been a shift in 
the business mix which has adversely impacted trading profit. 
The lower shorter cycle volumes in defence/security, 
particularly relating to land markets, include businesses 
which typically offer the Group some of its highest margins. 
In the aerial refuelling business, the change in revenue was 
from lower production and aftermarket volume partially 
offset by lower margin engineering and development 
revenue. This business also recognised a provision of £15m 
on its aerial refuelling development programmes. In the 
Advanced Electronic Solutions Sector there was lower 
revenue from mature production contracts. 
The Group’s trading margin was 15.5% (2013: 17.7%) and was 
adversely impacted by the change in revenue mix and the 
provision against aerial refuelling development programmes 
which are outlined above. In addition, there was also an 
adverse mix impact on the Group’s trading margin from some 
of the businesses which delivered good organic revenue 
growth in the year, including Aviation Services and SA TCOM, as 
these have lower than average margins for the Group. 
Group statutory operating profit was £57m (2013: £159m). 
The most significant additional items not included in the 
underlying figure were an unrealised loss of £22m (2013: 
£2m gain) in non-hedge accounted derivative financial 
instruments, amortisation expense on intangible assets 
arising on business combinations of £114m (2013: £104m), 
other business acquisition and divestment related items of 
£41m (2013: £nil) and business restructuring relating to EiD 
of £28m (2013: £56m) and to the Aeroflex integration of 
£24m (2013: £nil).
Underlying net finance expense and underlying 
profit before tax
The Group’s net underlying finance charge for the year was 
£30m (2013: £30m). The underlying net interest expense 
on cash and debt holdings was largely stable at £26m 
(2013: £27m). This reflected additional interest expense from 
the Aeroflex acquisition, offset by a favourable impact from 
foreign currency translation and the full year impact from a 
change in the mix of fixed and floating rate debt, which was 
implemented in 2013. As expected, there was a non-cash net 
finance charge from pension schemes of £4m (2013: £3m). 
In 2015, the Group’s non-cash net finance charge from 
pension schemes is also expected to be £4m.

Financial Review continued
The Group’s underlying profit before taxation was £257m 
(2013: £288m).
Taxation
The Group’s underlying tax rate increased to 20.3%  
(2013: 20.0%), from an underlying tax charge of £52m 
(2013: £57m). The rate is calculated by taking the underlying 
tax charge and dividing it by the underlying profit of £257m 
(2013: £288m), excluding the share of post-tax results of 
joint ventures of £nil (2013: £3m).
The Group’s underlying tax rate increased due to the 
impact of the Aeroflex transaction. For 2015, it is estimated 
that the full year impact of Aeroflex will result in the Group’s 
underlying tax rate increasing to 21.0%-21.5%.
Earnings per share (EPS)
Underlying EPS was 18.5p (2013: 21.6p), 14%, lower than  
the prior year, primarily reflecting the Group’s lower trading 
profit and the higher share count in the year following the 
issuance of new shares in the May 2014 equity placing.  
At constant translation exchange, underlying EPS was  
11% lower.
Basic EPS was 2.6p (2013: 10.7p), principally due to the 
impact of the items set out in the paragraphs on trading 
profit, statutory operating profit and underlying EPS above. 
Cash flow and net debt
Operating cash flow, which is stated after net capital 
expenditure but before interest and tax payments, was 
£208m (2013: £269m). Operating cash conversion was 
73% (2013: 85%). 
The Group’s operating cash conversion was lower than 
the prior year principally due to a cash outflow of £71m 
(2013: £32m) from working capital, driven by an increase 
in debtors and inventory. The working capital outflow 
included an impact from strong year end trading, an 
increase in debtors in Aviation Services due to the timing 
of receipts from customers on new contracts secured, 
and an increase associated with the Group’s development 
contracts, including its aerial refuelling programmes.
In addition, net capital expenditure increased to £74m 
(2013: £61m) largely due to Aviation Services, where there 
has been increased investment. This has been primarily in 
the aircraft fleet as a result of its recent success in winning 
multi-year contract awards.
Free cash flow was £114m (2013: £155m), which is stated 
after £32m (2013: £51m – EiD only) of EiD restructuring and 
Aeroflex integration costs, underlying net interest payments 
of £25m (2013: £29m) and tax payments of £37m (2013: 
£38m). Following the Group taking full control of the FBH 
joint venture in 2013, there were £nil (2013: £4m) dividends 
received from joint ventures.
Out of free cash flow the Group paid a dividend of £108m 
(2013: £97m). The higher dividend payment reflects the 
Group’s progressive dividend policy and the impact of the 
additional 60 million shares issued in the placing, with these 
additional shares issued qualifying for the Group’s 
November interim dividend payment.
Acquisition payments of £897m principally reflected the 
acquisition of Aeroflex, together with smaller contingent 
payments relating to acquisitions completed in prior years.  
The prior year cash outflow of £152m principally related  
to the acquisition of Axell and FBH and an investment 
in the FST A consortium.

In addition, the Group received £180m (2013: paid £2m),  
principally related to the issuance of 60 million new Cobham 
shares, which in part funded the Aeroflex acquisition.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend for 2014  
of 7.746p (2013: 7.04p). This, together with the interim 
dividend of 2.904p (2013: 2.64p), will result in a total 
dividend per share for 2014 of 10.65p (2013: 9.68p),  
an increase of 10%, in line with the Group’s progressive 
dividend policy. 
Treasury 
The Group’s treasury activities are managed centrally by  
the Group Treasury function, which reports to the Chief 
Financial Officer. The Treasury function operates within 
written policies and delegation levels that have been 
approved by the Board. It is the Group’s policy that  
trading in financial instruments is used for financial  
risk management purposes only.
Debt and financing 
At the year end, the Group’s net debt had increased to 
£1,223m (2013: £453m). The increase in net debt was 
principally due to the acquisition of Aeroflex. There were 
also adverse exchange movements of £59m (2013: £3m 
favourable), which were in large part driven by the 
strengthening US dollar. It is the Group’s policy to hold a 
significant proportion of its borrowings in foreign currency, 
as a natural hedge against assets and earnings denominated 
in that currency. At the year end, net debt/EBITDA was 2.6x.
Included within net debt are cash deposits, which are 
primarily denominated in UK pounds and US dollars, 
as well as borrowings. At 31 December 2014, the Group 
held total cash and short term bank deposits, all with an 
original maturity of three months or less, of £225m 
(31 December 2013: £201m). 
Under the terms of its borrowing facilities, the Group is 
required to maintain its ratio of net debt/EBITDA at or 
below 3.5 times and its interest cover ratio at or above  
3.0 times. For covenant purposes, net debt is typically 
expressed at average foreign currency translation rates. 
EBIT A, EBITDA and net interest numbers include proforma 
adjustments related to joint venture interests, acquisitions 
and divestments and restructuring.

Financial Review continued
In May 2014 the Group agreed a US$1,300m acquisition 
finance facility to partially finance the acquisition of Aeroflex. 
The Group subsequently successfully refinanced the bulk of 
this bridge loan facility, securing long term funding facilities 
for its core debt in October 2014 from the proceeds of a 
US$930m senior note issue. The amount and maturity of 
the senior notes raised are as follows:
New private placement amount and maturity
Duration (years) Amount (US$m)
3 75
5 180
7 250
10 425
Total 930
At the year end, a summary of the Group’s other principal 
borrowings included the following: 
 − A US$360m multi-currency credit agreement, of which 
US$90m expires in October 2016 and US$270m expires 
in October 2018. Interest is payable at the applicable 
benchmark rate of the drawn currencies plus margin. 
US$286m had been utilised at the year end;
 − A EUR70m multi-currency credit agreement expiring  
in June 201 7 . Interest is payable at the applicable 
benchmark rate of the drawn currencies plus margin. 
EUR67m had been utilised at the year end;
 − A DKK525m multi-currency credit agreement expiring  
in October 2018. Interest is payable at the applicable 
benchmark rate of the drawn currencies plus margin. 
DKK1 74m had been utilised at the year end;
 − An AUS$90m multi-currency credit agreement expiring  
in October 2018. Interest is payable at the applicable 
benchmark rate of the drawn currencies plus margin. 
AUS$59m had been utilised at the year end;
 − A US$370m acquisition finance facility expiring  
in May 2016. Interest is payable at the applicable 
benchmark rate plus margin. The facility was fully  
drawn at the year end;
 − US$1,21 3m of senior notes maturing in tranches in  
2016, 201 7 , 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2024, with an average 
coupon of 4.4%; 
 − US$155m of senior notes maturing in 201 7 and 2018, 
with an interest rate at the applicable LIBOR rate plus 
margin; and
 − A US$75m fixed rate agreement which expires in 2031 
and under which the lender has a series of put options 
exercisable every three years from December 2016.
In addition, the Group also undertook an equity placing in 
the year, raising gross proceeds of £180m from the issuance 
of 60 million ordinary shares of 2.5p each at a price of 300p 
per share. The shares issued represented approximately 
5.6% of Cobham’s issued ordinary share capital prior to  
the placing. 
Foreign currency translation 
The following are the average and closing rates for those 
foreign currencies that have most impact on the translation 
of the Group’s income statement and balance sheet: 
2014 2013
Income statement – average rate
US$/£ 1.65 1.57
AUS$/£ 1.83 1.62
EUR/£ 1.24 1.18
DKK/£ 9.25 8.79
Balance sheet – closing rate
US$/£ 1.56 1.66
AUS$/£ 1.91 1.85
EUR/£ 1.29 1.20
DKK/£ 9.60 8.97
Foreign exchange translation exposure arises on the earnings 
of operating companies largely based in the US, Europe and 
Australia. These are partially offset by foreign currency 
denominated interest costs due to the Group’s policy, set 
out above, of generally funding acquisitions with borrowings 
denominated in the same currency. This provides a partial 
hedging of currency denominated profits for the Group.
After taking into account the partial hedging of the Group’s 
foreign exchange translation exposure within the income 
statement, a combined 1 cent movement against the 
pound sterling in the average rate over one year for those 
currencies above would have a £0.9m impact on Group 
profit before tax in 2014. The Group estimates that the  
US dollar would account for approximately half of this 
movement. Including a proforma full year contribution from 
Aeroflex, a 1 cent movement in the average rate over one 
year for all these currencies would have an estimated £1.2m 
impact on Group profit before tax. The change is principally 
related to Aeroflex’s US dollar denominated earnings.
Foreign currency transaction
The Group’s aim is to reduce, or eliminate whenever 
practical, foreign exchange transaction risk, of which  
the pound sterling/US dollar exchange rate is the  
most significant. 
The chart following summarises the Group’s foreign 
currency transaction exposure and the hedging in place  
to mitigate it.
All foreign exchange hedging transactions are approved 
under delegated authority from the Board. A number of 
financial instruments are used to manage transactional 
foreign exchange exposure, such as forward rate contracts. 
The Group has a policy of hedging at least 80% of estimated 
transactional exposure for the next 12 months, a proportion 
of exposures between 12 and 36 months and firm

exposures on long term contracts. Details of the most 
significant of these instruments are described in notes 
22 and 24 of the notes to the Group Financial Statements. 
Some 91% of the Group’s anticipated transaction exposure 
to the pound sterling/US dollar exchange rate is hedged for 
2015 at an average rate of US$1.60, with additional hedging 
in place to partially cover anticipated exposure in 
subsequent years.
Interest rates
The Group has various long and short term borrowings 
at both fixed and floating rates of interest. The Group 
monitors its exposure to movements in interest rates to 
bring greater stability and certainty to borrowing cost,  
with the policy being to assess the proportion of borrowings 
that are fixed and floating in the context of prevailing 
market conditions.
Retirement obligations
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension 
schemes, with the largest being the Cobham Pension Plan in 
the UK. At the year end, the estimated deficit for accounting 
purposes, which is the difference between the value of the 
schemes’ assets and the present value of the future liabilities 
was £102m before deferred tax (2013: £87m). 
£m
Pension deficit at 1 January 2014 (87)
Interest charge (4)
Net employer funding 17
Actuarial losses (28)
Pension deficit at 31 December 2014 (102)
Significant movements within the actuarial losses of  
£28m were:
 − Higher discount rate assumptions, driven by a decrease 
in corporate bond rates, resulting in increased pension 
liabilities; and
 − Partially offset by investment returns on scheme assets 
in excess of expectations.
The £17m reduction in the deficit from net employer 
funding relates to employer contributions made in the  
year in excess of scheme service costs and administration 
expenses.
The Group’s defined benefit pension schemes have been 
closed to new entrants since 2003, with alternative defined 
contribution schemes offered in all cases. Cobham remains 
committed to the support of the legacy defined benefit 
pension schemes within the Group and continues to work 
with the trustees of those schemes to ensure that net 
deficit issues are managed appropriately. This has included 
the undertaking of a significant buy-in transaction in 2013 
which eliminated the Group’s exposure to interest rate, 
inflation and longevity risks associated with the pension 
population at the time of the transaction and in 2014 there 
was an investment in liability driven investments to provide 
further cover against interest and inflation volatility.
Further details on the Group’s retirement benefit schemes 
in the year, including the primary assumptions, the amounts 
recognised in operating profit and the changes in value of 
defined benefit schemes are given in note 23 of the notes 
to the Group Financial Statements.
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position, 
are set out in the Business overview on pages 1 to 27 and 
the principal risks on pages 34 to 39. In addition, notes 1, 15, 
22 and 24 of the notes to the Group Financial Statements 
include the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, financial risk management, details of 
financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposure 
to credit, liquidity and other risks. 
The Group has considerable financial resources together 
with long term contracts with a number of customers across 
different geographic areas. As a consequence, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully. Accordingly, after making enquiries, the 
Directors have formed a judgement at the time of 
approving the financial statements that it is their 
expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole 
have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Group and Parent Company Financial Statements.

BEST PRACTICE ENTERPRISE 
RISK MANAGEMENT HAS 
FURTHER ENHANCED 
OUR PROCESSES
The Board sets the policy for managing risk in the business. 
It recognises the importance of having effective processes 
and procedures for identifying, actively monitoring, 
mitigating and managing the financial and non-financial 
risks facing the Group. By regularly reviewing the risk 
appetite of the business within the COSO ERM framework 
(see glossary on page 126 for full definition), and satisfying 
itself that the Group’s principal risks are managed within this 
appetite, the Board ensures that the Group’s risk exposure 
remains appropriate and links into effective delivery of its 
strategic objectives. The Board has ultimate accountability 
for the execution of risk management systems and controls, 
with the Risk Committee, composed of members of the 
Group Executive, responsible for overseeing execution of 
risk management throughout the Group. The Board has 
delegated responsibility for monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and risk 
managements systems to the Audit Committee. See 
pages 52 to 55 for more information.
The process for monitoring and controlling risk, illustrated 
below, emphasises continuous evaluation and monitoring 
by the Group’s management teams at each appropriate 
entity level; business unit, Sector, specialist function or 
Group level. The Group’s ERM framework is structured to 
ensure that risks are identified promptly by management 
teams, to support the achievement of their strategic 
objectives and ensure that they are mitigated and  
managed appropriately to support the delivery of the 
Group’s strategic plan.
The Group manages risk by operating a ‘three lines of 
assurance’ risk and control model. The first line consists of 
operational management implementing and maintaining 
effective internal controls and risk management procedures. 
They are supported by a number of horizontally and 
vertically integrated Group functions which, together with 
their performance management procedures, form the 
second line. Internal Audit serves as the third line, entrusted 
with reviewing certain controls and risk management 
processes and procedures, identifying areas for 
improvement and reporting to senior management and the 
Audit Committee due to its independence and objectivity. 
In addition, the Audit Committee takes account of the 
views of the external auditors.
Under the sponsorship of the Chief Financial Officer, a 
project was commenced during 2014 to further enhance 
the Group’s Governance, Risk and Assurance Framework. 
The objective of the project is to update this in line with

How we manage risk
in the context of the Group’s strategic objectives. The risks 
identified during this process have been captured in a 
system that is used to track, monitor and document 
ownership and management. Data from this system  
has been aggregated and themed, reviewed under the 
Governance structure outlined above and has been used  
as the basis for the Group Principal Risk disclosures on 
pages 36 to 39.
The next phase of the project will build on the work 
completed to date to review the control and assurance 
measures in place to ensure that they are aligned in the 
most efficient manner with the Group’s risk appetite.
industry best practice ERM principles, and embed these 
into day-to-day operational decision making. An additional 
objective is to assist the Group’s compliance with the 
updated Financial Reporting Council guidance on risk 
management, internal control and related financial 
and business reporting. 
Building on the ‘three lines of assurance’ model, the Group 
has drawn on the COSO ERM Framework to set a rigorous 
baseline which has revised the Group’s risk appetite. This  
will facilitate effective risk management with appropriate 
controls and assurance measures.
Each of the Group’s business units, as well as each 
Sector and Group function, has undertaken a review 
of their respective Principal Risks using the updated risk 
management framework. This exercise has been performed  Cobham plc

1.  Deterioration in the macroeconomic environment 
adversely impacting our markets
2.  Failure to execute strategy for a return to  
organic growth, supported by effective value 
creating M&A activity
3.  Failure to comply with laws and regulations 4.  Failure to embed organisational design  
within an effective Governance Framework,  
with appropriate skills and talented employees 
recruited/retained
Risk
The Group’s revenue is derived from global defence/security and commercial 
markets. The level and type of customer spending is dependent on a complex 
mix of macroeconomic, fiscal and strategic defence and security imperatives.
Changes in government/customer spending or other external factors could lead 
to programme/contract terminations or delays, or changes in market growth.
Risk
The Group’s ability to generate profitable organic growth consistently is a  
key driver of value creation. Insightful, complementary and well executed  
M&A activity in line with the Group’s strategic objectives will supplement 
this value creation.
Failure to define and execute the Group’s growth strategy will lead to impaired 
business performance.
Risk
Cobham operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to the laws, 
regulations and restrictions of many jurisdictions, including those of the US,  
the UK and other countries. 
These include anti-bribery provisions, import and export controls; government 
contracting rules and health and safety. 
A lack of understanding of legal and regulatory restrictions in force in the 
jurisdictions that we operate in could lead to us being in contravention of 
a particular law or regulation.
Risk
Key to the execution of the Group’s strategic plan is the effective 
implementation and embedding of the organisation design (OD) 
project within an enhanced governance framework.
Failure to deliver the OD project, resulting in an appropriately skilled workforce 
and management team will see the Group’s ability to deliver against its strategic 
plan to return to growth impaired.
Impact
Deterioration in demand affecting shorter cycle businesses or a fundamental 
shift in how customers procure products or services could have an adverse 
effect on the Group’s future results leading to:
 − Missed growth targets
 − Reduced earnings
 − Failure to win new business, leading to adverse results against strategic plan
Impact
Failure to grow leads to an impaired competitive position, reduced trading 
margins and a declining return on invested capital.
The Group will experience an impact on employee recruitment and retention, 
potential reputational damage and a reduced ability to invest for future growth. 
Impact
Sanctions for failure by the Group, its sales intermediaries, or others acting on  
its behalf to comply with laws, regulations and restrictions could include fines, 
penalties, legal claims, suspension or debarment of the Group from future 
government contracts for a period of time as well as having an impact on the 
Group’s reputation. Such sanctions could have an impact on the Group’s 
financial position and future operations. 
Impact
This will lead to sub-optimal financial performance, loss of investor confidence 
and a failure to deliver shareholder value.
Mitigation
A review of near and long term market trends is conducted as part of the 
Group’s annual strategic planning process to ensure that actual and anticipated  
impacts from macroeconomic environment risks are minimised and  
managed effectively. 
Regular review of externally sourced market demand data, with the 
re-forecasting and adjusting of internal planning in line with market demand.
Increased emphasis is being placed on identifying adjacent markets in which  
the Group’s proven and transferable technologies can be applied.
The Group is creating more balance in its portfolio towards commercial markets, 
with the aim to grow through all economic cycles.
A culture of continuous improvement will enable Cobham to have market 
leading operating performance, while reducing costs. This will enable Cobham 
to grow market share and also remain competitive in the face of volume 
declines or price pressures and retain flexibility to adjust the cost base 
appropriately to changing market conditions.

Carry out effective strategic planning – maintain robust and dynamic strategic 
thinking processes to ensure the Group is exposed to growth markets through 
the business cycles.
A continued focus on and investment in programme management to ensure 
customer expectations are met, which underpins the Group’s ability to grow.
Continued appropriate investment in future technologies with alignment to 
identified market growth areas.
The implementation of rigorous M&A disciplines (both pre- and post- 
transaction), aligned with the Group’s strategic planning process, improves  
the ability to successfully execute and deliver value from transactions.

integrity are embodied in all that it does. 
Policies and procedures are included in the Group’s corporate framework which 
is regularly reviewed and audited, including procedures related to the use of 
sales and marketing representatives, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, gifts  
and hospitality, whistleblowing and investigation of ethics and compliance 
concerns, along with Cobham’s Code of Business Conduct.
Mandatory training is undertaken by all employees on a variety of  
compliance related subjects including US government contracting,  
anti-bribery and corruption.

STRATEGIC REPORT
1.  Deterioration in the macroeconomic environment 
adversely impacting our markets
2.  Failure to execute strategy for a return to  
organic growth, supported by effective value 
creating M&A activity
3.  Failure to comply with laws and regulations 4.  Failure to embed organisational design  
within an effective Governance Framework,  
with appropriate skills and talented employees 
recruited/retained
Risk
The Group’s revenue is derived from global defence/security and commercial 
markets. The level and type of customer spending is dependent on a complex 
mix of macroeconomic, fiscal and strategic defence and security imperatives.
Changes in government/customer spending or other external factors could lead 
to programme/contract terminations or delays, or changes in market growth.
Risk
The Group’s ability to generate profitable organic growth consistently is a  
key driver of value creation. Insightful, complementary and well executed  
M&A activity in line with the Group’s strategic objectives will supplement 
this value creation.
Failure to define and execute the Group’s growth strategy will lead to impaired 
business performance.
Risk
Cobham operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to the laws, 
regulations and restrictions of many jurisdictions, including those of the US,  
the UK and other countries. 
These include anti-bribery provisions, import and export controls; government 
contracting rules and health and safety. 
A lack of understanding of legal and regulatory restrictions in force in the 
jurisdictions that we operate in could lead to us being in contravention of 
a particular law or regulation.
Risk
Key to the execution of the Group’s strategic plan is the effective 
implementation and embedding of the organisation design (OD) 
project within an enhanced governance framework.
Failure to deliver the OD project, resulting in an appropriately skilled workforce 
and management team will see the Group’s ability to deliver against its strategic 
plan to return to growth impaired.
Impact
Deterioration in demand affecting shorter cycle businesses or a fundamental 
shift in how customers procure products or services could have an adverse 
effect on the Group’s future results leading to:
 − Missed growth targets
 − Reduced earnings
 − Failure to win new business, leading to adverse results against strategic plan
Impact
Failure to grow leads to an impaired competitive position, reduced trading 
margins and a declining return on invested capital.
The Group will experience an impact on employee recruitment and retention, 
potential reputational damage and a reduced ability to invest for future growth. 
Impact
Sanctions for failure by the Group, its sales intermediaries, or others acting on  
its behalf to comply with laws, regulations and restrictions could include fines, 
penalties, legal claims, suspension or debarment of the Group from future 
government contracts for a period of time as well as having an impact on the 
Group’s reputation. Such sanctions could have an impact on the Group’s 
financial position and future operations. 
Impact
This will lead to sub-optimal financial performance, loss of investor confidence 
and a failure to deliver shareholder value.
Mitigation
A review of near and long term market trends is conducted as part of the 
Group’s annual strategic planning process to ensure that actual and anticipated  
impacts from macroeconomic environment risks are minimised and  
managed effectively. 
Regular review of externally sourced market demand data, with the 
re-forecasting and adjusting of internal planning in line with market demand.

the Aeroflex acquisition
7.  Significant business interruption risk 8.  Failure to successfully execute continuous 
improvement (CI) programmes, including the 
implementation of the IT enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) system, across the portfolio
Risk
The Group designs, develops and delivers products and services that are often 
customised, utilising complex technologies, under fixed price contracts that are 
sometimes long term in nature. This gives rise to the risks of failure to execute 
contracts profitably, the supply of defective or delayed product, the occurrence 
of other contractually related liabilities, or damages to reputation and 
commercial relationships.
Risk
Failure to deliver the planned synergies and growth from the Aeroflex 
acquisition will have a detrimental impact on the Group’s financial performance. 
Risk
The Group’s business could be impacted by natural disasters or fire events 
affecting its operational locations or suppliers, by other significant events in the 
supply chain or by IT systems failures (including from cyber attack), rendering 
critical systems or manufacturing locations unable to function. 
Risk
Failure to deliver sustainable growth and efficient, reliable and sustainable 
improvements in operational performance.
Linked to this is the effective deployment of an enterprise resource planning 
system across the Group, which underpins the Group’s CI initiatives. 
Impact
Failure by Cobham to execute or deliver a project or programme gives rise to 
the risk of increased programme costs, contract penalties, litigation and other 
financial liabilities, reduced future profitability and reputational risk.
Poor operational performance could also lead to customers withholding new 
and existing business from the Group.
Impact
The Aeroflex transaction is important to the achievement of the Group’s 
strategic plan. 
Failure to deliver the business case will lead to poor financial results and will 
adversely impact the Group’s reputation.
Impact
Unscheduled interruption to business activities would result in reduced profits, 
loss of customer satisfaction, potential cost outlays, and reputational impact. 
Impact
Project, programme, production and service delivery will be adversely affected 
increasing costs and reducing customer satisfaction.
Mitigation
Through the new business win process, a thorough review of the business  
case and terms and conditions and subsequent variations, prior to signing, 
ensures contract provisions and risks are fairly allocated between parties,  
while still customer focused.
Life cycle management (LCM) and programme management procedures are 
intended to ensure that the Group’s key contract and programme management 
policies and procedures are applied consistently and appropriately across all 
areas of the business. These procedures also provide increased focus on 
improvements to its LCM and programme management capabilities.
There is monthly reporting of progress against agreed LCM improvement 
actions to the Group Executive, and semi-annually to the Audit Committee.
Mitigation
A comprehensive due diligence process was undertaken throughout the 
pre-acquisition process.
Post-acquisition, detailed assessments have been undertaken against the 
due diligence findings and comprehensive integration plans established.
Aeroflex performance is monitored continuously against the due diligence 
plan with regular oversight from the Group’s M&A Committee.
Retention plans are in place for key individuals and the integration programme 
is subject to the comprehensive LCM review process.
Mitigation
The Group maintains major incident/IT failure business continuity plans. 
Employees are trained in relevant procedures, as appropriate.
IT security and capability are continually monitored and strengthened  
when needed.
The Group works closely with insurers and other third party experts to  
ensure operating infrastructure and processes include robust risk  
improvement activities.

WE AIM TO ENGENDER TRUST 
WITH OUR ST AKEHOLDERS AND 
ENSURE THE COMP ANY THRIVES
Approach
Corporate responsibility and sustainability (CR&S) strategy 
is developed and implemented through the CR&S function 
which is overseen by the CR&S Committee chaired by the 
CEO. The role of the function is to engage key stakeholders 
to identify current and emerging social and environmental 
threats and opportunities to the Group’s business objectives 
and strategic plans, monitor and measure CR&S performance 
to drive continuous improvement and ensure compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations as well as voluntary 
requirements (e.g. codes of conduct).
Material environmental, social and governance risks and 
opportunities are included in the CEO’s papers to the Board 
as well as through various executive committees such as the 
Business Ethics and Compliance Committee and the Safety, 
Health and Environment Committee.
Cobham’s CR&S Strategy is designed to align with the 
Group’s business model, through four key areas of focus:
 − Striving for the highest ethical standards through 
our business ethics and compliance programmes;
 − Attracting, retaining and developing highly talented 
and engaged employees;
 − Providing a safe and healthy working environment; and 
 − Managing environmental impacts. 
Highest ethical standards
Cobham complies with relevant laws and regulatory 
requirements while also acting ethically and with integrity. 
This approach is enshrined in the Cobham Code of Business 
Conduct (COBC), on which all employees receive training. 
Cobham sees acting ethically as a source of potential 
competitive advantage. It is a key contributor to a high 
performance culture, helps meet key stakeholder 
expectations, protects the Group’s reputation and supports 
its financial performance. 
In addition, Cobham is in the process of adopting best 
practice in managing its supply chain responsibly on a risk 
prioritised basis. It prefers those suppliers that support 
responsible and sustainable business practices, including 
human rights (e.g. through the potential for conflict minerals 
usage in purchased parts and components, preventing child 
labour and preventing discrimination). Cobham’s approach 
is set out in its Responsible Supply Chain Management 
Policy (RSCM) which is contained within the COBC.
Further details on Cobham’s approach to human rights can 
also be found in the COBC, and the RSCM can be found at 
www.cobhamsustainability.com/at-a-glance/
downloads.aspx.
Training all employees on the COBC is considered to be an 
effective leading measure which ensures that employees 
understand the Group’s expectations and requirements.  
The incidence of material compliance breaches is 
considered to be a measure of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s approach.
Captured in our Principal Risks
Risk 3 –  Failure to comply with laws and regulations  
(see page 37) 
Risk 4 –  Failure to embed organisational design within an 
effective governance framework, with 
appropriate skills and talented employees 
recruited/retained (see page 37)
2014 performance
The Company achieved its target of 100% employee 
training on the COBC. 
In February 2014 the Group voluntarily contacted the 
United States Department of Justice (DoJ) to inform it that 
Cobham had undertaken an initial internal investigation 
into potentially irregular sales practices concerning sales 
to Asia of certain commercial, non-classified products 
manufactured by TracStar Systems Inc., a US-based 
operating location. The matter has been fully investigated 
and concluded with the DoJ during the year, with no 
material cost or sanction for the Group. 
As part of the integration of the Aeroflex acquisition, 
Cobham is undertaking an exercise to ensure that the 
best of the Aeroflex and Cobham ethics and compliance 
programmes are adopted across the Group. 
The use of agents, distributors and value added resellers 
continued to be subject to due diligence and approvals, 
subject to well defined criteria and including appropriate 
legal review. 
Cobham has voluntarily engaged with Transparency 
International (TI), an international movement dedicated 
to working with government and business, to put in place 
measures to tackle corruption. This will enable the Group 
to benchmark its policies and practices against the TI 
Defence Companies Anti-Corruption Index, which is due 
to be published in 2015.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Training on the Company’s RSCM policy was also rolled out 
across its principal locations during 2014. An initial review 
has identified the categories of hazardous materials, conflict 
minerals, resource efficiency and environmental protection 
as the most significant risk areas in the supply chain. 
Cobham in action
Cobham has transitioned the manufacture of make-to-print 
refuelling pod structures from a UK provider to a provider in 
India. The Cobham Mission Systems Sector (CMS) utilised 
the RSCM policy and approach to identify key risks for 
supplier selection, and included mitigation actions within 
sourcing documents, business agreements and 
management governance protocols. All vendors were 
researched and audited prior to the bid process. The 
selected supplier is required to comply with Cobham’s 
RSCM policy and CMS retains full audit rights to ensure  
the supplier’s obligations are being fulfilled. CMS continues 
to actively manage the supplier through quarterly business 
reviews and audits to ensure compliance requirements  
are met.
The Airbus A330 MRTT features two Cobham wing mounted 905E 
aerial refuelling pods, with the manufacture of pod structures now 
outsourced to India.
Looking forward 
The Group will continue training on the implementation  
of the COBC and will complete the roll out of the Group’s 
Corporate Framework to integrate it with existing 
governance policies and procedures in the former  
Aeroflex business.
Talented and engaged employees
Having talented and engaged employees supports 
Cobham’s ability to execute and deliver on key programmes 
and on its growth objectives. Cobham’s approach is to 
attract and retain employees with the right skills and 
capabilities through strategic workforce planning, 
competitive reward practices, diversity and inclusion 
and development of a high performance culture. It is 
now utilising a streamlined management and reporting 
structure, aligned with the Group’s growth objectives. 
Cobham sees voluntary staff turnover as a key metric for 
determining the effectiveness of its talent management  
and employee engagement approach.
Captured in our Principal Risks
Risk 3 –  Failure to comply with laws and regulations  
(see page 37) 
Risk 4 –  Failure to embed organisational design within 
an effective governance framework, with 
appropriate skills and talented employees 
recruited/retained (see page 37)
2014 Performance
Cobham’s voluntary employee turnover has remained 
below its target of 10% or less. However, the Group intends 
to further improve this performance by regularly measuring 
its employee engagement, commencing with a Group 
wide employee engagement project designed to enhance 
performance and support for the Group’s integrated 
operating company model. The initial steps have involved 
an employee survey from Great Place to Work
®
, which was 
completed in the second half of the year. For further details 
see ‘Cobham in action’ below.
Cobham also believes that embracing diversity brings 
business benefits as it deepens the Group’s talent pool 
for skills and capabilities and broadens its perspectives. 
Cobham’s overall gender diversity profile increased from 
27% female in 2013 to 28% female in 2014. Using the 
statutory definition, which is Directors of a legal entity, 
female senior managers increased from 13% (2013) to 
16% (2014). Under the Cobham definition, which is 
employees of Vice President grade and above, female 
Senior Managers increased from 9% (2013) to 15% (2014). 
Female representation on the Board increased from 
11% (2013) to 22% (2014).
The Group has focused on the implementation of its new 
organisational design with the strengthening of its senior 
management and reporting structure, and with certain key 
support functions now reporting into the centre. Some 70% 
of the leadership roles created through the organisational 
design programme were sourced internally from alumni of 
Cobham’s senior management development programme. 
Cobham has continued to build on its development 
programmes with further expansion of the Cobham 
high potential, graduate and apprenticeship programmes. 
Cobham also signed up to the 5% club, a UK initiative 
which commits employers to hiring 5% of their intake as 
graduates or apprentices within five years. 
In addition, Cobham has also developed and piloted 
its Institute of Leadership & Management accredited 
programme which is designed to enhance the Group’s 
management skills and capabilities. 
Cobham in action
Cobham has partnered with the Great Place to Work
®
 
Institute to train over 300 Executives and Senior Managers 
in building the key components of high trust and high 
performance teams; to assess the Group’s human resources 
policies and practices and to conduct a Group wide 
employee survey. Over 80% of Cobham employees 
responded to the survey and the results were reported 
back to all employees. Work will continue on this initiative 
through 2015 to build on and sustain engagement 
with employees.

Looking forward
Cobham will focus on embedding its approach to 
strategic workforce planning to ensure it has the right skills 
and capabilities in place. Looking further ahead, the Group 
is aiming to drive functional excellence further through 
development of competency frameworks, established 
career path development and the building of strong 
partnerships with academia and subject matter experts. 
Over time, the Company will identify its changing 
requirements for core capabilities and build a pipeline of 
talent able to respond to current and future needs. Cobham 
will also continue to invest in its development programmes, 
providing all of its line managers with the opportunity 
to participate in an accredited, in-house certificate 
in management.
Initially the Group intends to focus its diversity and inclusion 
approach on establishing geographic councils, setting 
policies and associated metrics.
Safe working environment
Cobham strives to provide a safe working environment for 
employees, contractors, and visitors. Cobham recognises 
that a good health and safety record drives an enhanced 
production performance and excellence in other areas of 
its operations. 
The Group’s approach is to promote a safety culture  
that strives to minimise injuries and illnesses in the 
workplace and to promote employee wellbeing. The  
Group consistently applies a set of ten Safety, Health  
and Environment (SHE) management standards that  
are mapped directly to OHSAS18001, an international 
health and safety standard, and to ISO14001, an 
international environmental standard, and a set of 12 
technical standards that address common SHE 
management processes and risks. 
Aviation safety is Cobham’s most significant safety risk. In 
terms of workplace risks, manual handling, repetitive strain 
and slip and trip injuries are the most common safety risks. 
Cobham captures numerous leading and lagging workplace 
safety indicators to measure its safety performance. 
Management is focused on driving the correct behaviours 
through its lagging indicators while safety performance 
such as fatalities and the major accident incidence rate 
(the number of cases with three or more lost work days 
per 100,000 full time employee equivalents) demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the Group’s approach.

2014 performance
Cobham had no fatalities during 2014. However, there has 
been an increase in the major accident incident rate in 2014 
to 423 per 100,000 employee equivalents, representing a 
total of 45 work place injuries and illnesses. Of these, 21 
occurred in the Aviation Services Sector, which represents 
a higher work place safety risk environment than the other 
Sectors. The Group will continue to review the controls in 
place and to ensure that health and safety issues are being 
fully addressed. 
33 of 38 of the Group’s business units achieved the internal 
SHE management standard targets set for them and the 
remainder are expected to achieve these in 2015, with 
management systems at all principal locations expected to 
be of an equivalent standard to OHSAS18001 by the end  
of 2015. This excludes the recently acquired Aeroflex sites, 
where work is commencing to assess and improve their  
SHE performance. 
An organisational design project was undertaken for 
the SHE function across the Group. As part of this, SHE 
professionals have commenced being assessed and 
development plans initiated to close gaps identified.
Cobham in action
Several principal sites have undertaken live emergency 
response simulations to ensure that their response standards 
are in line with best practice in business continuity. Exercises 
have been undertaken in conjunction with local fire 
authorities with positive results and good feedback. 
There are also live simulations planned for 2015. 
SHE best practice is more generally being shared across the 
Group, with health and safety events held in North America, 
Europe and Australia. These have involved over 100 SHE 
practitioners from across the Group. 
Cobham strives for excellence in safety, health and environment
Looking forward
The objective for 2015 is to close all gaps in meeting 2014 
SHE management standard targets. 
Over the medium to longer term, the Group’s intention is for 
all its principal and aviation locations to mature their safety 
management systems and certify them to the OHSAS 
18001 international standard.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Managing environmental impacts
Cobham recognises that its operations, activities, products 
and services have an impact on the environment and that 
the environment also impacts the business. The Group 
promotes an environmentally responsible culture, to comply 
with increasing environmental legislation and customer 
requirements, to reduce operating costs and to minimise 
business interruption in its operations and those of its 
critical suppliers. 
In addition to aviation fuel use, energy consumption 
and greenhouse gas emissions are Cobham’s most 
significant environmental impacts. The Group seeks to 
manage its environmental impact by using a series of 
measures including:
 − Transitioning to fuel efficient aircraft where it is 
appropriate to do so. For example, the Aviation 
Services business in Australia has introduced the 
Embraer 190, a next generation aircraft, and the first 
of its type to be engaged in the closed charter fly-in, 
fly-out market there; 
 − Investing in technology to reduce the size, weight and 
power consumption of products e.g. satellite ASICs. 
For further details see the CEO’s Statement on page 10;
 − Reducing facility level greenhouse gas emissions through 
energy efficiency measures, including: lighting, heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning upgrades, sensor lighting 
and destratification fan installations at various sites 
across the world;
 − Building business continuity and effective emergency 
response planning, to be prepared for adverse weather 
events and natural disasters.
The Group measures a number of environmental metrics 
(further information can be found at http://www.
cobhamsustainability.com/environment.aspx). 
However, the Group’s most significant environmental 
impacts stem from its greenhouse gas emissions in 
operating contract aviation services and 
in its manufacturing operations. The Group measures its 
aviation and non-aviation greenhouse gas emissions and 
obtains third party limited assurance on this data.
 
Captured in our Principal Risks
Risk 3 –  Failure to comply with laws and regulations  
(see page 37) 
Risk 4 –  Failure to implement organisational design within 
an effective governance framework, with 
appropriate skills and talented employees 
recruited/retained (see page 37)
Risk 7 – Significant business interruption risk (see page 39)
2014 performance
Cobham’s overall energy and carbon footprint grew in 2014 
due to Aviation Services’ success in winning new contracts, 
leading to additional flying activity over which Cobham may 
have no direct control to influence aircraft type or flight 
plans e.g. QantasLink. The Aeroflex acquisition has also 
increased the size of the Group and so added to its 
footprint. Overall, the energy intensity of the Group’s 
facilities increased by 1%. However, it decreased by 8% 
if Aeroflex sites are excluded, slightly short of the annual 
energy intensity (Mwh/£m) reduction target, which the 
Group set for itself, at 10%. Further details on the Group’s 
emissions and energy usage are provided in the Directors’ 
Report (see pages 66 and 67).
Management systems at most principal locations, but 
excluding the recently acquired Aeroflex sites, are now 
of an equivalent standard to ISO14001. All principal 
manufacturing locations have maintained the highly 
protected risk status through compliance with insurers’ 
standards, which enables Cobham to mitigate risks 
associated with extreme weather events such as flooding.
Cobham in action
Cobham participates in the CDP climate change survey. 
CDP is backed by over 800 institutional investors 
representing in excess of US$95 trillion in assets, giving 
investors access to a global source of year-on-year 
information that supports long term objective analysis, 
evidence and insight into companies’ greenhouse gas 
emissions and strategies for managing climate change risks. 
This survey ranks companies in relation to both their 
disclosure and performance in carbon management. 
Cobham has steadily improved its rating since 2009. 
In 2014 it was placed in the top 10% of nearly 2,000 
participating companies worldwide.
Cobham achieved the title of CDP Climate Performance 
Leader in 2014
Looking forward
Cobham is focused on its foundation of operational 
excellence by driving a continuous improvement culture. 
It will also be making operational efficiency improvements 
at former Aeroflex locations, with a number of integrations 
also planned. These actions should contribute to a 
decreasing energy intensity from its facilities over the 
coming years.

Dear Shareholder
During the past 12 months we have made real progress on our strategic 
objectives, in particular, the key objective to position the Company to  
return to sustainable organic growth in 2015. 
The Group has been restructured, creating a more simplified and  
streamlined organisation. We have completed our largest ever acquisition:  
we welcome the employees of Aeroflex into the Cobham family. We have  
made great progress integrating the two companies together and it is  
already having a positive impact. The combination broadens our footprint  
in the exciting and growing connectivity space, and is helping us to make 
considerable headway in rebalancing the portfolio away from defence and 
towards the commercial markets.
We launched the Great Place to Work process, so that all of our employees  
can work together to achieve Cobham’s full potential and truly become, a  
great place to work. 
The Board has overseen the appointment of two new Non-executive Directors: 
Birgit Nørgaard, who brings with her experience of the Continental European 
markets, along with extensive commercial and business expertise; and  
Alan Semple, whose appointment, with his financial and engineering experience, 
strengthens the depth of knowledge on the Audit Committee.
Our markets in 2015 will continue to challenge and we will continue to work  
hard to respond to those challenges. I trust we can rely on your continued 
support for the foreseeable future.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board composition
The Board comprises a Non-executive Chairman (John Devaney), a CEO (Bob 
Murphy), a CFO (Simon Nicholls) and seven other Non-executive Directors of 
whom Mike Wareing is the Senior Independent Director. All Non-executive 
Directors are considered to be independent and the Chairman was considered to 
be independent on appointment. They all held office throughout the year except 
Birgit Nørgaard and Alan Semple, who joined the Board on 24 April 2014 and  
25 February 2015 respectively. John Patterson stood down from the Board, 
having completed nine years as a Non-executive Director and Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee, at the conclusion of the 2014 AGM.
Biographies of the Directors, giving details of their experience and other 
significant commitments, are set out on pages 44 and 45. The wide ranging 
experience and backgrounds of the Non-executive Directors enable them to 
support, debate and constructively challenge management in relation to both  
the development of strategy and the performance of the Group. The attendance 
of Directors at Board meetings is set out across the page and attendance at 
principal Board Committee meetings as members of such committees during  
the year is set out in the reports from each committee on pages 50, 53 and 57. 
The rules for the appointment and replacement of Directors are set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles), copies of which can be obtained 
from Companies House in the UK or by contacting the Company Secretary. 
Changes to the Articles must be approved by shareholders passing a special 
resolution. The Directors and the Company (in the latter case by ordinary 
resolution) may appoint a person who is willing to act as a Director, either to  
fill a vacancy or as an additional Director. 
All the Non-executive Directors have confirmed that they have sufficient time to 
meet their time commitments to the Group. Copies of their appointment letters 
are available on request to the Company Secretary and will be available for 
inspection at the AGM. 
In accordance with the Code, which recommends that all Directors of FTSE350 
companies seek re-election by shareholders on an annual basis, all Directors 
currently in office will retire and seek re-election at the AGM. In addition, Birgit 
Nørgaard, and Alan Semple, are seeking election by shareholders at the 2015 
AGM for the first time. The Board has set out in the circular, a resolution to elect 
Birgit Nørgaard and Alan Semple as Non-executive Directors and explains why it 
believes they should be elected. The Chairman confirms to shareholders when 
proposing re-appointment that the individual’s performance continues to be 
effective and that the individual continues to demonstrate commitment to the 
role. Non-executive Directors are subject to Companies Act provisions relating  
to the removal of a Director.
The Chairman is, among other things, responsible for chairing Board meetings 
and leading the Board. The CEO’s responsibilities include operational 
performance, corporate social responsibility and the development and 
implementation of the Group’s strategy. He also focuses on long-term growth 
and development of the Group, its people and customer relationships. The 
Board’s policy is that the roles of Chairman and CEO should be performed  
by different people. 
The Senior Independent Director’s responsibilities include the provision of  
an additional channel of communication between the Chairman and the 
Non-executive Directors. He also provides another point of contact for 
shareholders if they have concerns which communication through the  
normal channels of Chairman, CEO or CFO has failed to resolve, or where  
these contacts are inappropriate.
Role and focus
The Board’s main duties are to: 
 − Lead the Group with a view to the creation of strong, sustainable financial 
performance and long term shareholder value;
 − Review and agree Group strategy;
 − Ensure that the necessary resources are in place;
 − Monitor management performance; and
 − Supervise the conduct of the Group’s activities within a framework of 
prudent and effective internal controls.
Highlights of 2014 
 − The Board, in conjunction with senior management, devoted additional time 
to the further development of the Group’s strategy and specifically agreed a 
new connectivity strategy;
 − The acquisition of Aeroflex, a significant transaction for both groups, 
including the completion of a placing and bank financing. This acquisition 
was borne out of the new connectivity strategy;
 − Structural redesign for the business, creating a more simplified and 
streamlined organisation; 
 − The reconstitution of the senior management team has been completed  
and new team members are now in post and already contributing to the 
achievement of our Strategic Plan; 
 − Oversight of the restructuring of the portfolio with planned disposals of 
businesses which no longer fit our strategy;
 − Oversight of the search and appointment of two new Non-executive 
Directors, Birgit Nørgaard and Alan Semple; and
 − Evaluated and approved two large bid submissions above authority  
limits delegated to the Executive Directors outside of the regular Board 
meeting agenda.
Priorities for 2015
 − Oversight of the return to growth agenda;
 − Continue to review performance against agreed strategic enablers;
 − Oversight of the Aeroflex integration, including delivery of targeted synergies;
 − Continue to focus on market evaluation and strategic development; and
 − Continue to rebalance the portfolio in line with strategy and towards  
our commercial markets.

Board proceedings 
Board meetings, scheduled in accordance with the annual timetable, took  
place seven times during the year on a face to face basis and twice by telephone. 
There is contact between meetings to progress the Group’s business as required. 
Meetings are held in London and at an international operational location. In 2014, 
the site visited was Lyngby, in Denmark. In addition, the Senior Independent 
Director held a meeting with the Non-executives in the absence of the Chairman 
to appraise the Chairman’s performance. The Chairman has also held meetings 
with the Non-executives in the absence of the Executive Directors. 
The Board has adopted a schedule of matters reserved for its specific approval. 
The schedule provides the framework for those decisions which can be made by 
the Board and those which can be delegated either to committees or otherwise. 
Among the key matters on which the Board alone may make decisions are the 
Group’s business strategy, its five year plan, its consolidated budget, Group 
policies, dividends, acquisitions and disposals, and all appointments to and 
removals from the Board. Authority is delegated to management on a structured 
basis in accordance with the provisions of the Corporate Framework ensuring 
that proper management oversight exists at the appropriate level. Matters 
delegated in this way include, within defined parameters: the approval of bids 
and contracts, capital expenditures and financing arrangements. 
The Board has adopted procedures relating to the conduct of its business, 
including the timely provision of information, and the Company Secretary is 
responsible for ensuring that these are observed and for advising the Board  
on corporate governance matters. The Company Secretary is appointed, and  
can only be removed, by the Board.
If a Director were to have a concern which cannot be resolved this would be 
recorded in the Board minutes. On resignation, Non-executive Directors are 
invited to provide a written statement to the Chairman for circulation to the 
Board if they have concerns. No such statements were made during 2014.
All potential situational and transactional conflicts of interest are disclosed, noted 
and authorised. Procedures are in place and operating effectively to keep such 
disclosures up to date.
Performance evaluation
The Board conducts an evaluation of its activities on an annual basis. During 
2014, the Board and its committees undertook an internal evaluation. The 
evaluation included the circulation of a questionnaire, with a focus on 
governance around the Aeroflex transaction and the Board site visit. The  
Board considered the output at their December meeting and has approved  
an action plan to address issues arising. A table of actions instigated by  
this and the previous performance evaluation is included below. In 2015,  
the Board is planning to undertake an external evaluation. 
Board committees
The Board is supported in its work by a number of committees. The Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to all Board committees. Committee chairs provide 
oral reports on the work undertaken by their committees at the following Board 
meeting. Information relating to the activities of each committee may be found 
on the pages that follow. All Board committees are provided with sufficient 
resources to undertake their duties.
The other principal Board committee is the Executive Directors Committee.  
The Executive Directors are members of this Committee under the chairmanship 
of the CEO. The purpose is to assist the CEO in the performance of his duties  
and its terms of reference include: establishing and implementing internal 
policies, systems and controls, to ensure that potential inside information is 
communicated to it, considered, verified and released to the market where 
required; the discharge of obligations arising under the Company’s share plans; 
the determination of the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors; the 
approval of banking facilities; and the approval of bids and contracts. This 
Committee met on 17 occasions during the year and, in addition, as required  
to respond to business needs and market conditions.
Management committees
The Group Executive Committee and the other principal management 
committees are shown in the table below.
All of the below is in addition to quarterly business reviews, business development 
reviews and function reviews, supporting the new organisational design.

2013 Members of the Group Executive should be 
provided with opportunities to present to the 
Board on their areas of the business to provide 
more exposure to the Board members.
Presentations from the Group Executive were built in to the Board Work Plan for 2014 (and 
going forward). Various opportunities have also been taken for the Board to meet members  
of the senior management team both professionally and socially.
Continued development of the strategic 
planning process.
The connectivity strategy was agreed during the first part of the year during a scheduled  
Board meeting, following which the Aeroflex transaction was identified. A Board meeting 
dedicated to strategic discussion was held during late 2014. Although this was delayed by the 
acquisition of the Aeroflex Group, the Board felt there had been a big improvement in strategic 
materials and subsequent Board discussions. Ongoing strategic updates form part of the rolling 
Board agenda.
2014 PV investment. The continued investment in the products of the business to ensure currency of technology is 
recognised as key and more emphasis should be placed on pursuing (and monitoring) strategic 
opportunities through such investment.
Continued development of the strategic 
planning process.
The Board identified a number of additional pieces of work they would like to see as part of the 
2015 Strategic Review. These have now been scheduled into the work cycle for the Strategic 
team and the business, where appropriate, for delivery during 2015 Board strategy discussions.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Shareholder relations
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining an effective two-way 
communication programme with shareholders and potential shareholders.  
This assists investors’ understanding of the Group’s strategy, business model  
and remuneration structure and allows the Board to understand shareholder 
views when formulating its strategy and policies, ensuring the interests of the 
Company and investors are aligned. Cobham’s programme of shareholder 
interaction is intended to meet these aims.
During the year presentations were given to investors on the morning of the 
announcement of the interim and preliminary results. The presentations were 
accompanied by a live webcast and conference call for investors unable to  
attend in person. Copies of the associated presentation materials, together  
with webcasts, can be accessed on Cobham’s website. The Group also hosted  
a presentation, which was also webcast, for shareholders on the day of the 
announcement of the Aeroflex acquisition in May 2014.
Cobham’s AGM is attended by all Board Directors and shareholders have the 
opportunity to question the Board on its stewardship of the Group and to  
meet the Directors informally. 
In addition, a full programme of engagement with investors and analysts, both in 
the UK and overseas, was undertaken through the year, which is led by the CEO 
and CFO. In total there were some 194 meetings in the year with 185 investors.  
A summary of the timing of this activity is set out in the table above.  
This engagement included one-to-one and group meetings with shareholders, 
participation in investor conferences, investor participation in industry exhibitions 
and shareholder visits to Cobham operating locations. Site visits and industry 
exhibitions are hosted by senior members of management within the business 
units and are intended to give investors detailed insight and access to the 
business’ products and operations. 
There is also a section of the main Cobham website that is maintained 
specifically for investors. This is updated regularly and contains a variety  
of information including company summaries and overviews, background 
information and company history, news and events, reports and presentations, 
financial tools and charts and corporate governance information. During the  
year, a major project was undertaken to further develop the look and feel  
of the investor website and increase the amount of information available  
to shareholders.
The Board receives a report from the CFO at each of its meetings on investor 
relations, including significant changes to shareholdings, meetings with and 
feedback from shareholders and research recently published on the Group. 
I write to major shareholders annually, informing them that I am available to 
meet them if they have concerns.

CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE
KNOWLEDGE, EXPERTISE AND
DIVERSITY IN OUR BOARD ROOM
Dear Shareholder
A key focus for the year has been the appointment of two Non-executive 
Directors. Both of these appointments were managed in conjunction with 
Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann, recruitment consultants who have signed up  
to the voluntary Code of Conduct for executive search firms. Korn/Ferry  
provided a short list of candidates for these roles. The shortlisted candidates 
were interviewed by myself and separately by other Board members, including 
the Executive Directors. It was pleasing to note that we had a number of  
female candidates for our NED roles and that we were able to secure another 
female NED who had all the right attributes to add to and complement our  
Board expertise.
Role and focus
The Nomination Committee’s main duties are to: 
 − Review the structure, size and composition of the Board; and
 − Consider succession planning for Directors and other senior executives.
Highlights of 2014
 − Continued to refresh and renew non-executive tenure and skill set to ensure 
an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board;
 − Conducted a thorough and comprehensive search for two new  
Non-executive Directors; 
 − Completed the appointment of two Non-executive Directors. Birgit has 
extensive experience of the Danish market in which Thrane & Thrane 
operates, a company we acquired in 2012, and Alan has extensive  
financial experience;
 − Considered external appointments to the boards of our subsidiaries; and
 − Oversight of the new organisation design exercise.
Priorities for 2015
 − Continue to review succession plans for the Board members and key roles 
across the business; and
 − Continue to review Board composition to ensure competencies remain 
aligned to the Strategic Plan and that the Board continues to be  
appropriately balanced.
The Committee’s terms of reference, which were reviewed during the year, are 
available on Cobham’s website or on application to the Company Secretary.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Diversity and inclusion
The Committee is cognisant of the need for diversity when considering the 
composition of the Board. In recruiting for Board roles, targets have been set 
around ensuring a proportion of female applicants are included in the candidate 
pool for Non-executive Director positions. The representation of women on the 
Board increased from 11% in 2013, to 22% in 2014. For recent recruitment, the 
profile has also included the requirement for a diverse geographical background 
and commercial market experience. 
Directors’ professional development
On appointment, Directors undertake a structured induction programme in the 
course of which they receive information about:
 − The operations and activities of the Group; 
 − The role of the Board and the matters reserved for its decision; 
 − The Group’s corporate governance practices and procedures; 
 − Their duties, responsibilities and obligations as Directors of a listed  
public limited company; and
 − Specific duties as a member of one of the Board committees. 
This is supplemented by visits to key locations and meetings with, and 
presentations by, members of the senior management team.
Development for Directors is available as required and is provided mainly by 
means of internal briefing from senior management or advisers and external 
courses. In addition, Directors’ knowledge of the legal and regulatory 
environment is updated through the provision of information by the Group’s 
advisers and by means of regular updates from the Company Secretary and  
the legal team.
Site visits are considered critical to ensure that the Directors remain close to  
the business of the Group. These visits are arranged informally for each Board 
member, as necessary, and supplemented by one formal site visit per year  
which is attended by all members of the Board.
Succession planning
Succession planning takes place on a regular basis to ensure that the Group is 
managed by executives with the necessary skills, experience and knowledge.  
The Board has a role to play in overseeing the development of management 
resources in the Group. Specifically, the Board wants to see depth and quality  
in management, and robust processes are in place to help them in this task. 
Succession planning for Non-executive Directors is based on maintaining a  
depth of knowledge and experience on the Board. The Nomination Committee 
actively manages Non-executive Director succession having regard to anticipated 
retirement dates for existing Directors and initiates focused searches for 
Non-executive Directors as positions are required. 
The current Board composition in relation to the Non-executive Directors in 
terms of length of service and current term is shown diagrammatically above.

CONTINUOUS MONITORING
OF FINANCIAL REPORTING 
AND DISCLOSURE PROCESSES
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for 2014. At the 
conclusion of the 2015 AGM, I will be stepping down as Chair of the Committee, 
and handing over the responsibilities of my role as Chair to Alan Semple. I will, 
however, remain a member of the Audit Committee. Alan has been CFO,  
and a Director, of John Wood Group plc since 2000. Alan’s wealth of financial 
experience complements the substantial knowledge already provided by existing 
Committee members and further strengthens the level of financial expertise of 
the Committee. 
2014 has been a busy year for the Audit Committee: we have developed our 
future plans for the external audit tender, and continued to carefully assess the 
Company’s relationship with the current external auditor; we have provided vital 
oversight of the controls in relation to Cobham’s acquisition of Aeroflex; and  
we have extensively reviewed programme management, and assisted in the 
evolution of the Group’s governance, risk and assurance system. 
At the 2015 AGM, both Alan and I will be available to respond to any questions 
shareholders may raise on this report or the Committee’s activities.
Highlights of 2014
 − Oversight of controls in relation to the Aeroflex acquisition; 
 − Developed the audit tender plans for 2015; 
 − Strengthened review of the policy on the provision of non-audit services  
for the external auditors; 
 − Greater scrutiny given to programme management; 
 − Enhanced review of Safety, Health and Compliance (SHE) compliance  
and controls; 
 − Increased analysis of the Group’s governance framework, including Life  
Cycle Management (LCM), Continuous Improvement, and IT controls 
(including cyber security); and 
 − Supported the development and initial implementation of the new 
governance, risk and assurance initiative. 
Priorities for 2015 
 − Monitoring of the integration of the Aeroflex business into the Group;
 − Implementation of the audit tender plans; 
 − Continued oversight of the CFO led governance, risk and assurance initiative; 
 − Ensuring the Group is compliant with the revised UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the updated FRC guidance on risk management; and
 − Continued focus on the Group’s governance framework including LCM  
and IT controls.
“ The key focus for 201 4 has been 
expanding oversight of the Group’s 
governance, risk and assurance 
system, developing audit tender plans, 
and ensuring the controls in relation 
to the Aeroflex acquisition were fit  
for purpose.” 
Alan Semple
“I am delighted to be taking on 
the Audit Committee Chair role 
in 2015, and look forward to 
working with Mike, other 
members of the Committee,  
and management.”
Alan joined the Board in February 2015, and will assume the role of Audit 
Committee Chair in April 2015. He is a member of the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of Scotland, and has been the Chief Financial Officer of John 
Wood Group plc since 2000. Alan brings with him a wealth of financial and 
commercial experience in an engineering environment, which will be an 
invaluable asset to the work of the Committee.

Fair, balanced and understandable report and accounts
At the request of the Board, the Committee considered whether the 2014 
Annual Report and Accounts was fair, balanced and understandable, to enable 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.  
It was satisfied that, taken as a whole, the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts  
is fair, balanced and understandable. This assessment was underpinned by  
the following:
 − The Committee’s own knowledge of the Group, its strategy and  
performance in the year;
 − Comprehensive guidance issued to contributors at operational level;
 − Thorough internal verification of the factual content;
 − Comprehensive reviews undertaken at different levels of the Group  
to ensure consistency and overall balance; 
 − Comprehensive review by the senior management team; and
 − Comprehensive review by the independent external auditors. 
External audit processes
During the year, PwC undertook external audit and certain non-audit work. The 
lead audit partner, Pauline Campbell, attended each Audit Committee meeting, 
and the 2014 AGM. PwC provided the Committee with information and advice 
as well as relevant reports on the financial statements and controls.
In July and November 2014, the Committee reviewed and approved the terms, 
areas of responsibility and scope of the December 2014 year-end audit as set out 
in the external auditors’ engagement letter. During the year, PwC provided audit 
related services such as regulatory and statutory reporting. PwC is expected to 
report to the Committee any material departures from Group accounting policies 
and procedures that they identify during the course of their audit work. None 
were found or reported in 2014. The Independent Auditors’ report to the 
members of the Company can be found on pages 70 and 118.
External auditor independence and objectivity 
The Committee and the external auditors have safeguards to avoid the possible 
compromise of the auditors’ objectivity and independence. These include a 
policy regarding the supply of audit and non-audit services and a policy on the 
employment of external audit staff. Non-audit services, as defined from time to 
time in the policy, can be provided subject to pre-approval by the Committee 
where the cost of any individual engagement exceeds a pre-defined limit and the 
cost does not exceed the overall limit set out in the policy. Prohibited services 
include: actuarial services; legal services provided in the resolution of a dispute; 
and appraisal or valuation services. All PwC’s fees for non-audit work were 
approved in accordance with the Group’s policy covering non-audit services. 
In conjunction with the CFO, the Committee Chair, in accordance with the policy 
regarding the supply of audit and non-audit services, approved the services of 
PwC to undertake and support management’s due diligence work for the 
acquisition of Aeroflex. As a result the level of non-audit fees awarded was 
greater than the level of audit fees awarded to PwC in 2014. The decision to 
appoint PwC to undertake this work was considered by the Committee to be in 
the best interests of shareholders. PwC has a deep understanding of Cobham, 
placing them at a distinct advantage to support the Board in this regard. The 
Committee does not believe that PwC’s independence has been compromised 
because of this additional work on behalf of the Company. 
The total fees paid to PwC in the year ended 31 December 2014 equal £5.4m, 
with non-audit fees of £3.2m representing 59% of the total. The chart below 
details the fees paid in 2014, together with a comparison to fees paid in the year 
ended 31 December 2013. Further disclosure of the type of work undertaken, 
and the amount of the non-audit fees paid during the year can be found in note 
4 to the Group Financial Statements.
PwC also provides specific assurance to the Committee on the arrangements and 
safeguards it has in place to maintain its independence and objectivity, including 
an internal process to pre-approve provision of non-audit services and the use of 
separate teams where non-audit services are being provided to the Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The external auditors follow regulatory requirements to maintain the objectivity 
of the audit process, which stipulate in relation to the senior engagement auditor, 
a five year rotation policy. Pauline Campbell replaced Stuart Watson as lead audit 
partner in 2014. 
The Committee is satisfied that the external auditors remain independent. 
External auditor effectiveness and reappointment
The Committee conducts an annual review of the performance of the external 
auditors, including feedback from the finance teams at each of the operating 
companies. The 2014 review was conducted in February 2015 and overall, the 
feedback was positive. Having undertaken its review, in the opinion of the 
Committee, the relationship with the external auditors works well, and the 
Committee remains satisfied with their effectiveness. 
The Committee has recommended that a resolution be proposed at the AGM  
to re-appoint the external auditors and to allow the Audit Committee to set their 
remuneration. There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s 
choice of external auditor.
External auditor tendering
PwC have been the auditors of Cobham plc for many years. Following regulatory 
clarity, during 2014 the Committee discussed and developed its plans for the 
tender of the Group’s external audit. The Committee has decided to conduct a 
tender exercise in 2015, for the 2016 year end. Following a rigorous tender 
process, the Committee shall provide the Board with their recommendation, 
before putting the appointment of the external auditors to a shareholder vote  
at the 2016 AGM. 
Internal audit
The Head of Internal Audit formally reports to the Committee Chair, and was 
present in each of the five scheduled Committee meetings. The findings of each 
internal audit review are summarised and the Committee focuses its discussions 
on unsatisfactory findings and on the action plans in place to address them. 
Particular areas of focus during 2014 included IT security and the amalgamation 
of the acquired Aeroflex sites. 
The Committee approved the Internal Audit Work Plan for 2015, including the 
proposed audit approach, coverage and allocation of resources. The Committee 
also received updates against the 2014 internal audit programme throughout  
the year. 
In February 2015, the Committee conducted an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function, taking into account the  
views of Directors and senior management on matters such as independence, 
proficiency, resourcing, and audit strategy, planning and methodology. The 
review confirmed that the internal audit function was independent and 
objective and remained an effective element of the Group’s corporate 
governance framework.
Risk management and internal controls 
The Board is responsible for the oversight and application of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems, the aim of which is to manage risks 
that are significant to the fulfilment of the Group’s business objectives and to 
contribute to the safeguarding of shareholders’ investment and the Group’s 
assets. The Board receives reports on a regular basis from the Audit Committee  
in relation to the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls. The Committee’s 
review covered all material controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management systems and is designed to give 
assurance that the day to day risk management and internal control policies  
and procedures, which are embedded in the business, have operated effectively 
in the review period. The principal elements, the three lines of assurance, are 
outlined in the diagram shown on page 35. Such a system is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and  
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Risk management is an integral part of the system of internal control. Sector 
Presidents are required to ensure that appropriate processes, including the 
maintenance of business unit and sector risk registers, exist to identify and 
manage risks and to regularly carry out formal risk assessments. The Risk 
Committee undertakes a top level review of significant risks and the CEO  
reports regularly to the Board on their mitigation. 
In 2014, a significant project was commenced to further enhance the Group’s 
governance, risk and assurance framework. The Committee provided oversight 
throughout the project’s development, and has been greatly encouraged by 
progress to date. The Committee will continue to monitor the initiative 
throughout 2015. 
The Principal Risks and the enhanced risk management process are highlighted 
on pages 34 to 39.
The Group operates under a system of internal controls which have been 
developed and refined over time to meet its needs and the risks and 
opportunities to which it is exposed. This includes a strategic planning  
process involving:
 − The preparation of the Strategic Plan; 
 − A comprehensive budgeting system with an annual budget which is 
approved by the Board;
 − The regular revision of financial forecasts for the year;
 − The monitoring of financial performance; and 
 − The appropriate delegation of authorities to operational management. 
Delegations and other operational controls are contained in the Corporate 
Framework and the Group Finance Manual. Specifically with regard to the 
financial reporting process and the preparation of the Group Financial 
Statements, the system includes a semi-annual representation letter from all 
business units. Included in those letters are written acknowledgements that 
financial reporting is based upon reliable data and that the results are properly 
stated in accordance with Group policies. 
The Committee believes that the current arrangements consisting of the  
half yearly risk assessment process, a rotational programme of internal financial 
and other control reviews by the internal audit function, other experienced 
internal teams, external experts and business reviews carried out by the CEO  
and CFO and a process of self-assessment of internal financial controls by all 
business units, provides appropriate coverage of the Group’s activities. Where 
weaknesses have been identified, plans for remedying them are developed and 
progress monitored. 
Cobham Code of Business Conduct violations and fraud
Details of the Cobham Code of Business Conduct and the mechanisms,  
including those maintained by independent third parties, by which suspected 
violations of the Code are raised and independently investigated, are provided  
in the CR&S section of this report, on pages 40 to 43. The Committee regularly 
received reports providing details of these cases, their outcome, and the 
corrective actions taken. In addition, the Committee received reports providing 
details of any fraud losses.

ALIGNING REMUNERA TION 
TO THE DELIVERY 
OF STRA TEGIC GOALS
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to deliver my first report as Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
and would like to thank John Patterson for his Chairmanship of the Committee 
over the last nine years.
There are no proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy so no binding vote 
will be put forward at the 2015 AGM. The current policy, as approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM, can be accessed on Cobham’s website.
Remuneration philosophy underpinning decisions 
 − The overall remuneration philosophy is linked to the long term success of the 
Company. This is achieved by aiming to be market competitive to attract and 
retain executives of the quality required to deliver the Group’s strategy, whilst 
taking into account an individual’s experience and personal contribution to 
the Group’s Strategic Plan.
 − Paying for performance is the guiding principle of Cobham’s Total 
Compensation Philosophy. Compensation decisions are closely linked to 
Cobham’s performance development system. 
 − Cobham’s intent is to deliver premium actual total compensation comparable 
to the upper quartile of our aerospace and defence peer competitors if 
sustained upper quartile performance is achieved. For strong performance, 
actual total compensation delivered is targeted at the market median. 
How company performance during the year is reflected in the 
remuneration outcome
 − The Company has been operating in a challenging market environment over 
the last 12 months. We operate a diverse portfolio of businesses and while 
some of the businesses performed well, those exposed to defence in general 
and the US defence market in particular, had another difficult year. 
 − Despite the challenges, the Company has made good strategic progress 
during the course of 2014, shifting the balance of the business away from 
defence and towards commercial end markets and customers.  
 
 − This included the acquisition of Aeroflex, which was widely regarded as an 
appropriate and astute move by investors, and other recent acquisitions,  
such as Axell Wireless, have been successfully integrated into the business. 
 − With a book to bill ratio of 1.03x and order intake 10% higher before M&A  
the Group is now positioned to return to growth from 2015 as anticipated. 
 − 2014 has seen excellent returns to shareholders with TSR increasing 22%  
over the period in comparison to FTSE250 growth of 4%.
 − Despite the good progress outlined above, the financial targets set at the 
start of the year upon which the remuneration arrangements are based have 
not been met. Both operating profit and cash flow targets under the annual 
bonus have not been met resulting in zero pay out under the Annual 
Incentive Plan (AIP). In addition, the threshold level of EPS was not met and 
TSR performance was below median over the three year performance period 
for the 2012 Performance Share Plan (PSP), resulting in awards lapsing. 
The key challenges and issues that the Remuneration Committee 
addressed during the year
 − First year of implementing the new Remuneration Policy which was approved 
by over 98% of shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
 − 2014 was a year of organisational change for the Group: First full year for the 
new CFO; and stable Executive Director population but Group Executive and 
the business radically changed due to organisation redesign.
 − During the year, the AIP has been redesigned, in line with the policy, to 
simplify the short term bonus arrangements and to further align with the 
developing strategy. The AIP for 2015 will adopt an additive rather than a 
multiplicative approach.
 − Reviewed mechanisms to target retention of key staff including future 
potential leaders. 
 − Aligned remuneration to support retention of key staff as part of the 
Aeroflex integration.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The intended remuneration arrangements for the current year  
and the key future issues to be addressed by the Remuneration 
Committee
 − Remuneration arrangements for 2015 have been developed in line with  
the Remuneration Policy.
 − Base salary increases for the CEO and CFO, to be effective from 1 March 
2015, have been set at 5.0% and 6.8% respectively. These salary increases are 
above the average increase provided to the wider workforce of c.3.0% but are 
considered to be appropriate in the context of: the successful acquisition of 
Aeroflex, which has resulted in an increase to the size and complexity of the 
Group, and subsequently the scope of the two executive’s roles; the strategic 
progress during the course of 2014; and the performance and contribution  
of the two Executive Directors in driving the business forward.
 − From 2015 onwards, the Bonus Co-investment Plan (BCP) is to be removed 
from the CEO’s remuneration package in order to simplify the overall 
remuneration package and align the CEO’s remuneration structure with the 
rest of the senior management team. The CEO will therefore no longer be 
entitled to receive a matching award on any bonus deferred. However, he  
will still be required to defer 25% of any bonus earned into shares for a period 
of three years. This will reduce the maximum opportunity of the CEO’s 
remuneration package by 60% of salary. 
 − In recognition of the changes outlined above, the maximum annual bonus 
opportunity for the CEO is to be increased from 120% of salary to 150%  
of salary which remains within the Remuneration Policy approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM. This provides partial compensation for the 
loss of opportunity under the BCP and also recognises the increase in the  
size and complexity of the business following the largest acquisition in the 
Company’s history. The annual bonus opportunity for the CFO is to be 
increased from 100% of salary to 120% of salary to reflect the increase  
in the size and complexity of the Group. The changes to the annual bonus 
opportunities also reflect the continued contribution of the Executive 
Directors to the business and the Board’s confidence in the executive’s ability 
to build on the solid progress made during 2014 and deliver further growth, 
strong financial performance and value to shareholders in 2015 and beyond. 
 − We have noted changes to the Code (e.g. on malus and clawback), which are 
already in place in all incentive plans.
 − We are proposing to do a review of our LTI arrangements during 2015 for 
awards to be made in 2016.
A summary of any discretion applied by the Remuneration 
Committee during the year
 − There has been no discretion applied during the year.
Comment on any stakeholder engagement conducted during  
the year
 − No material consultation has been undertaken during the year but we do 
consider shareholder views and feedback to be important and will consult  
on any proposed changes to the LTI strategy during the year.
Role and focus
The Remuneration Committee’s main duties are to: 
 − Make recommendations to the Board on the Group’s policies on  
Executive Directors’ remuneration and ensure alignment to the  
Group’s Strategic Plan; and
 − Determine, on the Board’s behalf, the specific remuneration packages of the 
Chairman, Executive Directors, Group Executive and Company Secretary.

was implemented during the year, are summarised below:
Introduction
Aligning remuneration with strategy
We continue to take a disciplined approach to ensure that our remuneration 
strategy supports the seven strategic priorities which are set out on pages  
14 to 1 7 . Our incentive framework is designed to underpin the delivery of 
sustainable growth in earnings and shareholder value together with the 
generation of free cash flow. 
The 2014 AIP framework supports our priorities of driving continuous 
improvement in operational excellence and programme execution with 
inclusion of operational KPIs and by directly targeting growth in trading profit 
and free cash flow. In addition, individual objectives were set as part of the 
2014 AIP to specifically address the strategic development of the Group’s 
portfolio, particularly seeking to promote M&A and leveraging our technology 
across the Group to access more commercial end markets. 
In 2015, the AIP will continue to focus on delivering superior operational 
performance. As described on page 56, we have redesigned and simplified the 
AIP framework and have increased the weighting given to achieving key strategic 
execution measures whilst retaining the discipline of aligning with Group and 
Sector operating financial metrics. 
The LTI plans are designed to encourage the necessary actions and leadership 
behaviours to promote investment in innovation, development of required 
technical skills and leadership capabilities and accelerating the adoption of our 
technologies to underpin the delivery of long term sustainable growth in 
shareholder value.

 Annual Incentive Plan
The 2014 AIP is designed to drive and reward annual performance against 
financial and operational KPIs as well as individual objectives, which are directly 
linked to the Group’s strategic plan. In setting the performance levels for the 
2014 AIP, the Committee considered the budget/forecast approved by the Board 
for the relevant year, and set threshold and maximum targets at appropriately 
stretching levels either side of the budget. 
Details of the AIP measures, weightings and targets as well as performance against 
each of the targets is provided in the table below:
Metric Weighting Performance
Full year
 £m
Actual
£m
Trading profit 70% Threshold 310
The threshold level 
of performance 
was not met under 
either metric and 
so the bonus 
payment was zero
Target 320
Maximum 330
Free cash flow  
(before restructuring)
30% Threshold 256
Target 288
Maximum 320
T rading profit and cash flow metrics are adjusted for the impact of acquisitions  
and disposals during the year. Performance conditions are set at fixed translation 
exchange rates. The actual results are normalised to these rates for assessment 
purposes. T rading profit and free cash flow are discussed in more detail at note  
2 to the Group Financial Statements and in the KPI definitions on page 17.
For 2014, the AIP adopted a multiplicative formula whereby performance  
against the financial metrics is converted into a Business Performance Factor 
(BPF), which is then multiplied by an Individual Performance Factor (IPF) based 
on an assessment of an individual’s achievement against personal objectives  
to provide an overall bonus outcome. 
As the threshold financial performance targets were not met, this resulted  
in a zero BPF . As the bonus is multiplicative this results in a zero bonus  
payment overall regardless of an individual’s performance against their  
personal objectives. 
As mentioned earlier, the structure of the bonus for 2015 has been redesigned 
and further details are provided on page 64.

Esterline Meggitt  T eledyne T echnologies
Finnmeccanica Northrop Grumman  Thales
FLIR Systems QinetiQ Ultra Electronics
Harris Raytheon  
ITT Industries Rockwell Collins  
There has been no change in the composition of the TSR Peer Group during  
the year.
The graph above illustrates the TSR performance (share price growth plus 
dividends) of Cobham against the FTSE350 Index over the past six years.  
The graph shows the value of £100 invested over the six year period ending  
31 December 2014. The FTSE350 Index was chosen as it is a recognised  
broad equity market index of which Cobham was a member during 2014  
and is currently, as at 4 March 2015, ranked at 103rd. 
The performance targets for the PSP were not met for the three performance 
years ended on 31 December 2014 therefore no awards made in 2012 will result 
in any payout and will lapse.
The LTI plans are an important element of our remuneration strategy with their 
focus on driving the longer term strategic priorities and underpinning the 
sustainable growth of the Group’s portfolio. We will be reviewing the design of 
the LTI plans in 2015, seeking opportunities to both simplify the arrangements 
and to ensure these continue to be effective in both driving shareholder value 
and enabling Cobham to attract, retain and develop the leadership talent 
essential to its future success. 
Buy-out Awards vesting in 2014
Bob Murphy’s long term incentives figure covers the vesting of one award made

Share ownership requirements
Ownership guidelines require the Executive Directors to maintain ordinary shares. 
These guidelines state that the CEO retain the value of at least two years’ salary, 
and the CFO retain the value of at least one year’s salary. In addition, the CEO and 
CFO are to retain a minimum of 50% of net vested PSP and BCP matching shares 
until the relevant shareholding level is met. There is no time frame over which the 
guidelines are required to be met and there is no requirement for directors to 
hold these shares after leaving the Company. Both Directors have retained the 
required shares resulting from LTI vests and have complied with the guidelines in 
this respect, but have yet to meet their targets due to the length of their tenure.
Shares held by Executive Directors as at 31 December 2014  
against share ownership
Interests at 4 March 2015, being a date no more than one month prior to the 
date of the Notice convening the AGM, were the same as at 31 December 2014.
The market price of the ordinary shares as at 31 December 2014 was 323.9 
pence per share and the closing price range during the year was 263.7 pence  
to 327.8 pence.

Dilution
The Company’s share schemes are currently funded through shares purchased  
in the market and have been since November 2010, prior to which they were 
funded through new issue shares. Funding of awards through new issue shares  
is subject to an overall dilution limit of 10% of issued share capital in any ten year 
period. Of this, 5% may be used in connection with the Company’s discretionary 
share schemes. As of 31 December 2014, 7.8m (0.69%) and 5.8m (0.51%)  
shares have been issued pursuant to awards made in the previous ten years  
in connection with all share schemes and discretionary schemes respectively. 
Awards that are made, but then lapse or are forfeit, are excluded from  
the calculations.
Payments to past Directors (audited information)
There were no payments made to past Directors during the year.
Payments for loss of office (audited information)

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in the  
current financial year
Set out below is an explanation of the way the approved policy will be 
implemented in the current year.
Element of 
Directors' 
Remuneration 
Policy Change Rationale for any change
Base Pay Current salaries for the CEO 
and the CFO, effective from 
1 March 2015, are £742,665 
(US$1,158,600) and £440,000 
respectively.
These represent a 5% increase 
for the CEO and a 6.8% 
increase for the CFO. These 
above average increases are in 
recognition of the increase in 
the size and complexity of the 
Group, and subsequently the 
increase in scope of the two 
executive’s roles and their 
continued strategic progress  
of the business. 
Other benefits/
retirement 
benefits
No change. Not applicable.
AIP The maximum opportunity  
for the CEO has increased  
from 120% of salary to 150%  
of salary. The maximum 
opportunity for the CFO has 
increased from 100% of salary  
to 120% of salary. 
The structure of the plan has  
also been redesigned and will 
be operated on an additive  
basis. Awards will be assessed 
against the following metrics, 
each with a 25% weighting: 
 − Group Revenue
 − Underlying Operating Profit
 − Group Cash Conversion
 − Key strategic measures linked 
to personal objectives
As in 2014, 25% of any bonus 
earned will be required to be 
deferred into shares for a 
period of three years. 
The maximum bonus 
opportunity for the CEO  
has been increased to  
partially compensate him  
for the removal of the BCP  
(see below).
The increase for the CEO  
and CFO also recognises  
the increase in the size and 
complexity of the Group 
following the acquisition of 
Aeroflex and the impact this 
has had on the two executive 
roles. In addition, the increases 
reflect the Board’s confidence 
in the executive’s ability to 
build on the progress made 
during 2014 and deliver  
further growth, strong  
financial performance  
and value to shareholders  
in 2015 and beyond. 
BCP Removed from the  
remuneration structure. 
The BCP has been removed  
for the CEO to simplify 
remuneration arrangements 
and align his remuneration 
structure with the rest of the 
executive team. 
PSP No change. Awards to the 
value of 150% of salary will  
be made in March 2015. 
Performance will be equally 
weighted between EPS 
growth, relative TSR against  
a comparator group, see 
page 60, and cash conversion. 
Not applicable.
Non-executive Director fees are reviewed annually. There has been no change 
to Non-executive Director fees during the year. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee received advice during the year from Deloitte LLP. The 
Committee is satisfied that the advice they have received has been objective  
and independent due to Deloitte’s compliance with the Code of Conduct of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and the external experience of Committee 
members. Deloitte’s performance is considered by the Committee as part of their 
performance evaluation. Total fees for advice provided to the Committee during 
the year amounted to £96,050 and were provided on a time/cost basis.

Cobham plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
www.cobham.com 
The Directors present their report and the audited Group and Parent Company 
Financial Statements of Cobham plc for the year ended 31 December 2014.  
The Company is registered in England and Wales under company number 30470. 
The Company’s registered office is Brook Road, Wimborne, Dorset, BH21 2BJ, UK. 
Dividends
An interim dividend of 2.904 pence per ordinary share of 2.50 pence each in the 
capital of the Company (ordinary shares) (2013: 2.64 pence) was paid in November 
2014. The Directors are recommending a final dividend of 7.746 pence per ordinary 
share (2013: 7.04 pence) payable on 29 May 2015 to ordinary shareholders on the 
register as at 1 May 2015, making a total ordinary dividend for the year of 10.65 
pence (2013: 9.68 pence). Details of the total dividend paid out is covered in note 7.
Directors’ indemnity arrangements
The Directors have the benefit of a Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
policy and the Company has entered into qualifying third party indemnity 
arrangements with them, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006. The policy 
was in force at the year end and continues in force at the date of this report.  
The Directors are permitted to take independent legal advice at the Company’s 
expense within set limits in furtherance of their duties.
Directors’ interests
None of the Directors are or were materially interested in any significant contract 
during or at the end of the financial year, particulars of which are required to be 
disclosed by the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. Details of Directors’ 
share interests and of their rights to subscribe for shares are shown in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 62.
Share capital
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed 
income, representing 99.9% of the total issued share capital. 
In addition, 19,700 non-redeemable 6% second cumulative preference shares 
have been issued which represent 0.1% of total issued share capital. 
At the AGM held on 24 April 2014, the Company was authorised to purchase  
up to 107,857,590 ordinary shares. This authority will expire at the conclusion  
of the 2015 AGM. A special resolution will be put to shareholders at the AGM  
to renew the authority to make market purchases of the Company’s shares up  
to a maximum of 10% of the share capital of the Company. 
The Directors have been authorised to allot and issue ordinary shares. These 
powers are exercised under authority of resolutions passed at the Company’s 
AGM. On 20 May 2014, 60,000,000 ordinary shares of the Company were 
created as the result of a private placing.
Subject to applicable statutes, and to the rights conferred on the holders of  
any other shares, shares may be issued with such rights and restrictions as the 
Company may by ordinary resolution decide or (if there is no such resolution  
or so far as the resolution does not make specific provision) as the Board may 
decide. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and speak at general 
meetings of the Company, to appoint one or more proxies and, if they are 
corporations, corporate representatives and to exercise voting rights. Holders  
of ordinary shares may receive a dividend and, on a liquidation, may share in  
the assets of the Company. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the 
Company’s Annual Report and Accounts. Subject to meeting certain thresholds, 
holders of ordinary shares may requisition a general meeting of the Company  
or the proposal of a resolution at an AGM.
The shareholders of the 6% second cumulative preference shares are entitled  
to receive a fixed cumulative preference dividend at the rate of 6% per annum  
in priority to the payment of dividends on the ordinary shares. In addition, on  
a return of assets on the liquidation or otherwise of the Company, the assets 
available for distribution are to be applied first in repaying to the holders of the 
6% second cumulative preference shares the amounts paid up on their shares. 
Voting rights and restrictions on transfer of shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares and 6% second 
cumulative preference shares of £1 each in the capital of the Company are  
set out in the Articles. 
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company, every holder of shares 
present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll 
every member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote 
for every £1 in nominal value of the shares of which he is the holder. None of the 
ordinary shares carry any special rights with regard to control of the Company.
There are no restrictions on transfers of shares other than:
 − Certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by laws  
or regulations;
 − Pursuant to the Company’s Code for Securities Transactions including  
the requirement on the Directors and designated employees to obtain 
approval to deal in the Company’s shares; and
 − Where a person with an interest in the Company’s shares has been  
served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company  
with information concerning interests in those shares.
The Company is not aware of any arrangements between shareholders that  
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.
Significant arrangements – change of control
Individual operating companies in the Group have contractual arrangements  
with third parties in support of the Group’s business activities which may take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following  
a takeover bid. Such contractual arrangements include supply of equipment, 
goods and services to third parties, including research, design and production. 
Such contracts and arrangements may be deemed to be essential to one or 
more of the operating companies but there are no contracts or arrangements 
considered to be essential to the operation of the business of the Group as a 
whole, apart from the following:
 − The Company has entered into a number of credit agreements with banks, 
and has issued senior notes under private placements. The total amount 
owing under such agreements at the year end date is shown in note 18 to  
the Group Financial Statements. All agreements contain clauses such that,  
in the event of a change of control, the Company can offer to or must repay 
all such borrowings together with accrued interest, fees and other sums 
owing as required by the individual agreements.
 − Under the Sentinel contract, entered into in March 2006, the Company must 
seek approval for any material change in the shareholding of the Company. 
There is an ancillary aircraft lease agreement under which a change of control 
may result in the termination of the lease if such event is likely to have a 
material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to perform its obligations 
under the lease.
 − Under the FSTA shareholders agreement entered into in June 2008, a  
change of control of the Company may result in a required sale of the 
Company’s shares in FSTA to the other shareholders.
Further information relating to change of control under the LTI arrangements 
appears within the remuneration policy table available on the Company’s website. 
Employee share schemes – rights of control
If required to do so by the Company, the trustee of the Cobham Share  
Incentive Plan (SIP) will, on receipt of notice from the Company of any  
offer, compromise arrangement or scheme which affects shares held in the  
SIP, invite participants to direct the trustee on the exercise of any voting rights 
attaching to the shares held by the trustee on their behalf and/or direct how  
the trustee shall act in relation to those shares. 
The trustee will not vote in respect of any shares held in the SIP in respect of 
which it has received no directions nor will the trustee vote in respect of any 
shares which are unallocated under the SIP. 
The trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust (which, as at 31 December 2014,  
hold 6,279,557 2.50 pence ordinary shares to be used for settlement of option 
and share awards under the Company’s long term incentive schemes and all 
employee share option schemes) waive all rights to vote in respect of any  
shares they hold within the Trust.

Greenhouse gas emissions
The majority of Cobham’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (86%) come 
from its aviation activity (figure 1), primarily being from the aviation services 
business. Growth in this business inflates Cobham’s scope 1 and 3 emissions 
which yields an increase in Cobham’s absolute emissions (figure 1) and emissions 
intensity (figure 2).

Cobham’s scope 2 emissions, generated from electricity consumption, increased 
by 4% despite implemented energy efficiency measures rolled out during 2014. 
The increase relates to the recent acquisition of Aeroflex whose Q4 scope 2 
emissions accounted for 17% of the Group’s scope 2 emissions for the year 
(figure 3). This is expected as the nature of the Aeroflex business is energy 
intensive. 
Excluding Aeroflex, total electricity consumption decreased by 13%. Cobham’s 
target of reducing its energy consumption per £m by 10% year on year was 
narrowly missed with a reduction of 8%. 2015 will therefore become a new 
baseline for energy targets.

non-renewable electricity.
Scope 3 comprises indirect emissions from non-Cobham owned and

Methodology and data verification
Cobham collects data annually, as per our financial year, on greenhouse gas 
emissions from its wholly-owned operational subsidiaries. Cobham uses the 
World Business Council for Sustainable Development, World Resources Institute 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol method as of 31 December 2014 and the Carbon 
Disclosure Standards Board to report its greenhouse gas emissions and defines  
its emissions boundary as those under its direct operational control. 
Reported data excludes joint ventures not under Cobham’s operational control, 
sites with less than five people, sites leased to tenants, vacant properties being 
disposed of, and any business units that have been closed or divested during  
the course of the year for which there is less than six months of reported data. 
Further information is provided at www.cobhamsustainability.com. 
100% of Cobham’s wholly-owned operations have been reviewed internally to 
identify omissions and significant variations from the prior year.
Data assurance
As per last year, we engaged KPMG LLP to undertake a limited assurance 
engagement, reporting to Cobham plc, using the assurance standards ISAE 3000 
and ISAE 3410 over selected information included in The Cobham Performance 
Summary 2014 report for the year ended 31 December 2014, available at  
www.cobhamsustainability.com/at-a-glance/downloads.aspx. Some of 
that selected information has been included in this report, identified with “*”.

aspx, and they have provided an unqualified opinion on the selected information 
within their scope of work. The level of assurance provided for a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than a reasonable assurance engagement.  
In order to reach their opinion they performed a range of procedures which 
included interviews with management, examination of reporting systems, four  
site visits to our operations in the UK, Australia, and US, as well as specific data 
testing at Head Office. A summary of the work they performed is included within 
their assurance opinion. 67

Statement of Directors’ Responsibility
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
(IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and the Parent Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards) and applicable law. Under company  
law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group  
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and the Company for 
that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 − Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 − Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
 − State whether IFRS, as adopted by the EU, and applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements 
respectively; and
 − Prepare the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the 
Group and to enable them to ensure that the Group Financial Statements and 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole,  
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 44 and 45, 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 − The Group Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with the IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
 − The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, together  
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
Directors’ declaration in relation to relevant audit information
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ Report is 
approved, that:
 − So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information  
of which the Group’s auditors were unaware; and
 − He or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken  
as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant  
audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware  
of that information.
The responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on  
4 March 2015 and signed on its behalf by:
Bob Murphy
Chief Executive Officer

reviewed annually and are available on the Company website. 
D. Remuneration
D1. Levels and components of remuneration
The Board believes that the Group’s remuneration policy is appropriately 
designed to promote the long-term success of the Company, while enabling  
the Group to attract, retain and motivate the executive talent required for  
the delivery of its business strategy. For further information, see the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, and summarised Remuneration Policy, on pages 56 to 64. 
D2. Development of remuneration policy and packages
The membership of the Remuneration Committee is made up of Non-executive 
Directors only. The Terms of Reference for the Remuneration Committee are 
reviewed annually and are available on the Company website. The Remuneration 
Committee has delegated authority for setting the remuneration of Executive 
Directors and the Chairman. The fees payable to the Non-executive Directors  
are determined by the Board, on recommendation from the Executive Directors 
Committee.
E. Relations with shareholders
E1. Shareholder engagement and dialogue
Effective communication and engagement with investors is of paramount 
importance to the continued success of the Company. The Company maintains  
a relationship with shareholders through a series of road shows completed 
through the year, which are usually attended by the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Chief Financial Officer. In 2014, the Chairman also invited the largest of the 
Company’s shareholders to meet with him independently. Further details can be 
found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 49. 
E2 Constructive use of general meetings
The Board values all general meetings as an important opportunity to engage 
with investors. Attendees at general meetings have the opportunity to ask 
questions to the Board and to speak to individual Directors following the formal 
business of the meeting. 
A. Leadership
A 1. The Board’s role
In 2014, the Board met nine times, in order to review the Company’s 
performance and strategy against set objectives. The Board’s role is to lead the 
Group with a view to the creation of strong, sustainable financial performance 
and long-term shareholder value, to approve the Group’s Strategic Plan and to 
monitor management performance against plan. The Board also sets the Group’s 
risk appetite, and monitors the Company’s risk management processes. The 
Board has adopted a clear schedule of matters reserved for its specific approval, 
including a framework for those decisions which can be delegated to committees 
or otherwise. Further details can be found in the Corporate Governance Report 
on page 48.
A2. A clear division of responsibilities 
The Board’s policy is that the roles of Chairman and CEO should be performed  
by different people. The division of responsibilities is documented and clearly 
understood. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness  
of the Board, and the CEO is responsible for leading the day-to-day management 
of the Company within the strategy set by the Board.
A3. Role of the Chairman
The Chairman sets the agendas for meetings, manages the meeting timetable 
and facilitates open and constructive dialogue during the meetings. 
A4. Role of the Non-executive Directors

board for the Chairman and to serve as an intermediary for the other Directors 
where necessary. The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders, 
should they have concerns which contact through the normal channels of 
communication has failed to resolve. 
The Chairman has held regular meetings with the Non-executives in the  
absence of Executive Directors, providing an opportunity for any concerns  
to be discussed. 
B. Effectiveness
B1. The Board’s composition
The Board currently consists of ten individuals, the Chairman, two Executive 
Directors, and seven independent Non-executive Directors. The composition  
of the Board is reviewed regularly by the Nomination Committee to ensure  
that there is an appropriate mix of skills, and a range of diverse experience.  
Board members’ biographies are provided on pages 44 and 45 and identify  
the experience each Director brings to the Board. A table identifying the  
skills and experience of the Board members may also be found on page 51.  
The Board determines, through the Nomination Committee, the independence  
of its members. Conflicts of interest are also monitored and updated at least 
annually and more frequently as and when required. 
B2. Board appointments
The appointment of new directors to the Board is led by the Nomination 
Committee. The Nomination Committee’s T erms of Reference, as published  
on the Company website, document their responsibility regarding Board 
appointments. The Committee consists of all the Non-executive Directors  
and the Chairman. Further details of the appointments undertaken during  
the year and succession planning, including the Board’s policy on diversity, 
including gender, can be found on page 51.

Our audit approach
Overview
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK and Ireland)).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks  
of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked  
at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect  
of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, 
we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, 
including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors  
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, 
including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as areas  
of focus in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit  
to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our 
procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all  
risks identified by our audit.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Revenue and profit recognition on contracts
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report) and page 81 (note 1, Accounting 
policies, management judgement and estimation uncertainty – contract risk  
and programme execution).
For revenue from the sale of goods, we focused on cut-off around  
the year end because material revenue transactions can occur close  
to that date. 
The Group also has a number of significant contracts which span more than  
one accounting period. In particular, we focused on complex development  
and production contracts on aerial refuelling aircraft (including KC-46, KC-390, 
A400M and A330MRTT). The nature of much of the contracting work done by 
the Group means that there are reasonably frequent contractual issues, variations 
and renegotiations that arise in the ordinary course of business, whose resolution 
is uncertain. Costs incurred can significantly exceed amounts estimated at 
inception as a result of material enhancements to the specifications originally 
assumed under the contracts. For these contracts, we focused on: 
 – The recognition of significant revenue milestones which often involve 
judgement surrounding the achievement of those milestones;
 – The amount of revenue assumed as recoverable from customer claims 
which are subject to commercial negotiation;
 – Whether contracts with the same customer should be accounted for as 
separate or linked;
 – Whether the profit recognised on revenue in the year is appropriate; and 
 – Whether associated assets held on the balance sheet (work in progress  
and accrued income) are recoverable or whether a contract loss provision 
should be recorded.
 
We tested the recognition of revenue transactions close to the period  
end to establish whether they were recorded in the correct period.  
This included agreement to signed goods despatch notes or authorised  
milestone documentation, with customer acceptance where appropriate.  
No material misstatements were identified. 
We assessed the basis of profit recognition on the Group’s significant contracts, 
together with whether it is appropriate to account for them as separate or linked 
contracts. We evaluated the accounting in the context of the Group accounting 
policies and contract terms. We found the accounting, in all material respects,  
to be in accordance with the policies and contract terms.
We examined the assumptions behind estimated costs to complete, challenging 
the reasonableness of these in light of supporting evidence such as purchase orders 
for material or subcontractor costs and engineering estimates for labour hours.  
We found the assumptions to be supported by the evidence we examined.
We agreed total contracted revenue to the original signed customer contracts  
and approved change orders. We evaluated the reasonableness of estimated 
revenue for customer claims submitted to recover additional costs incurred, 
including considering correspondence with the customer and legal advice  
received where appropriate.
We assessed the contract loss provisions recorded through a combination  
of the procedures above in respect of the overall margin anticipated on the 
contract and validating that fixed overheads had been appropriately excluded. 
No material misstatements were identified.
Goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments 
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 81 (note 1, Accounting 
policies, management judgement and estimation uncertainty – impairment  
of goodwill) and pages 93 to 94 (note 10, Intangible assets).
Management conduct an annual impairment test of goodwill balances and 
intangibles are reviewed whenever there is an indicator that an asset may be 
impaired. The Group has goodwill of £1,220m and intangibles of £777m on its 
Balance Sheet. Of this, the majority relates to businesses that have substantial 
headroom through a combination of growth since acquisition and the 
amortisation of intangibles acquired which has reduced the carrying value being 
considered for impairment. The risk that we focused on in the audit was whether 
the remaining businesses that have less substantial headroom could be impaired. 
In particular, following the goodwill impairment charge recognised in 2013,  
we focused on the estimated values in use of the Tactical Communications and 
Surveillance (TCS) businesses to assess whether the remaining goodwill balance 
of £45m is recoverable. As TCS was written down to its recoverable value in 2013, 
there is now minimal headroom such that any reduction in the future estimated 
cash flows could result in further impairment. 
 
We evaluated the Directors’ future cash flow forecasts and tested the underlying 
value in use calculations. We compared the Directors’ forecast to the latest Board 
approved five year strategic plan and no inconsistencies were noted. 
We challenged: 
 – The Directors’ key assumptions for long term growth rates in the forecasts  
by comparing them to economic forecasts; and
 – The discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the Company and 
comparable organisations.
No material inconsistencies were identified between these specific assumptions 
and external data examined.
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions above to ascertain 
the extent of change in those assumptions that either individually or collectively 
would be required for goodwill or intangibles to be impaired. In particular this 
focused on the growth rates assumed in the first five years of the cash flow 
forecasts and included a comparison between the 2015 forecast cash flow  
and 2014 actual results. No material misstatements were identified. 
For TCS, the key assumption we focused on was the anticipated recovery of sales 
to the US market (the speed at which it would return to the pre-recession levels).  
We also considered the movement between the 2014 actual results and the 
forecast 2015 cash flows and we obtained explanations for the movements  
and agreed to supporting documentation, such as the closing order book.  
No material issues were identified in this respect.  Cobham plc

Accounting for the Aeroflex acquisition 
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 81 (note 1, Accounting 
policies, management judgement and estimation uncertainty – business 
combinations) and pages 113 to 114 (note 28, Business combinations).
The Group completed the acquisition of Aeroflex in September 2014 at a  
cost of £573m. The cost of the acquisition is accounted for by determining  
the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets,  
with the balance being allocated to goodwill. This acquisition resulted in  
the recognition of goodwill of £387m and intangible assets of £51 7m in  
the Balance Sheet. The fair values of net assets acquired are provisional  
and subject to potential adjustment
The Directors determined that there were five separate business streams 
acquired, valuing each separately and then allocating the purchase price 
between them. 
The process of determining the value of intangible assets requires the use  
of multiple estimates. The risk we focused on during the audit is whether  
the valuation of the intangible assets was misstated. 
In particular, we focused on:
 – The allocation of the purchase price between the five business  
streams acquired;
 – The opening balance sheet, considering fair value adjustments recognised;
 – The identification of intangibles; 
 – The cash flow forecasts and discount rate used in the intangibles’  
valuation process; and
 – The useful economic lives used in amortising intangibles.
We tested the methodology and mechanics of the underlying models used to 
calculate the acquisition related balances, including intangible assets and other fair 
value adjustments to assets and liabilities acquired. This included a comparison  
of the forecasts used in these calculations to the projections used by the Board 
before approving the acquisition. No material inconsistencies were identified.
We have utilised our industry knowledge to compare the intangibles assets 
identified by management and consider whether there were any other types  
of intangibles we would expect to see. We did not identify any material omissions.
We examined the key assumptions used in the calculation of the value allocated  
to intangible assets including cash flow forecasts and discount rates, challenging  
the reasonableness of these in light of supporting evidence. The main assumptions 
challenged were: 
 – Discount rate – we calculated our own independent rate using both internal 
rate of return and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) methodologies and 
found that management’s rate was within an acceptable range; 
 – Technology rates – we assessed management’s rate against independent 
expectations based on the margins in each business and the relevant 
PV spend with no material differences identified; and
 – Customer retention and technology decay rates – we have determined that 
assumptions within the model were reasonable through discussions with 
operational staff within the businesses.
We assessed the useful economic lives determined by management through 
comparison to the life cycle of the asset under consideration and benchmarking 
against similar acquisitions. No material inconsistencies were identified.
We visited the three largest sites acquired to perform year end audit procedures, 
focusing in particular on inventory existence and valuation. No material 
misstatements were identified.
We inspected the predecessor auditor working papers for the five largest 
components of the acquired group and examined the reconciliation from  
US GAAP to IFRSs performed by management to provide support for the  
opening balance sheet.
Based on the information available to date, no material misstatements  
were identified.
Inventory obsolescence provisions 
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 81 (note 1, Accounting 
policies, management judgement and estimation uncertainty – inventory 
provisions) and page 96 (note 14, Inventories).
The nature of much of the Group’s business means that the products developed 
can become technically obsolete. It is also necessary to hold additional spare 
parts in order to support key customers and programmes should the products 
require replacement or servicing. The Group had gross inventory of £480m and 
provisions for obsolescence of £48m on its Balance Sheet. 
We focused on this area because inventory provisions include subjective  
estimates and are influenced by assumptions concerning future revenue.  
In addition, the methods used for this estimate vary between reporting  
units depending on the nature of the business and inventory.
We assessed the process, methods and assumptions used to develop the 
provision for slow moving, excess or obsolete items. This included comparing 
management’s calculations for consistency against those used in the prior year 
and considering whether there was any indication of management bias such  
as manual overrides to the established methodology. Manual overrides are 
typically in respect of spares held for the servicing of products on aircraft  
which have a long service life. Where overrides were material, we considered  
the appropriateness of management’s judgement based on historical usage  
and future usage expectations.
We tested the reliability of the underlying data used by management to  
calculate the inventory obsolescence provisions, typically an aged inventory 
analysis showing last movements, by re-performing the ageing calculation  
driven by the system. We also tested the accuracy of the resultant calculation  
by assessing the calculation criteria and recalculating the provision for a sample  
of products.
No material misstatements were identified.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Accounting for uncertain tax positions 
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 81 (note 1, Accounting 
policies, management judgement and estimation uncertainty – taxation).
The Group has a wide geographic footprint and is subject to tax laws in a  
number of jurisdictions. The Group has a number of open tax enquiries and  
has recognised provisions against uncertain tax positions, the valuation of  
which is a highly judgemental area. Where tax positions are not settled with  
the tax authorities, the Directors take into account precedent and the advice  
of experts. 
 
We discussed with management the known uncertain tax positions and, where 
appropriate, read communications from taxation authorities on open tax enquiries. 
We assessed the adequacy of the Directors’ taxation provisions by considering 
factors such as the risk profile of each matter and whether the provision addresses 
possible penalties and interest. We met with senior management and challenged 
the judgements and evaluated the appropriateness of the provisions made. 
We formed our own views on the key judgements with respect to open tax 
positions and found the judgements made by management were reasonable. 
Business restructuring costs 
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 87 (note 2, Underlying 
measures).
The financial statements include business restructuring costs of £52m which  
are disclosed as non-underlying and are excluded from underlying operating 
profit. We focused on this area because IFRSs do not define which items  
may be excluded from underlying operating profit and it therefore requires 
judgement around the justification for such exclusion. Consistency in identifying 
and disclosing items to be excluded from underlying operating profit is important 
to maintain comparability of the results year on year.
In addition, for reporting units where closure and integration had been 
announced by the year end, such as the closure of Lowell (within Cobham 
Advanced Electronic Solutions), we focused on the provisions and asset write 
downs recognised to ensure that they were complete and not misstated. 
We tested the presentation of the business restructuring costs as non-underlying 
by assessing whether the classification was in line with the Group’s accounting 
policy on such items on page 82 of the financial statements. This included testing 
the costs incurred to supporting evidence such as external purchase invoices and 
redundancy agreements. We also assessed the appropriateness of this policy and 
no material issues were identified.
For reporting units which were in the process of integrating at the year end,  
we tested the associated closure costs to supporting evidence. Redundancy 
provisions were assessed against communications with employees and payroll 
data. Onerous lease provisions were compared to rentals payable under the 
original lease agreements. No material misstatements were identified. 
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work 
to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into 
account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group is structured along four reported Sectors, being Advanced Electronic 
Solutions, Aviation Services, Communications and Connectivity, and Mission 
Systems. The Group Financial Statements are a consolidation of 75 reporting units 
within these Sectors, comprising the Group’s operating businesses and centralised 
functions. Accordingly, of the Group’s 75 reporting units, we identified 1 7 which,  
in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, either due  
to their size, their risk characteristics or because some are covered on a rotational 
basis over a two or three year cycle. Specific audit procedures on certain balances 
and transactions (typically including at least revenue and inventory) were 
performed at a further 1 9 reporting units. Audit procedures were performed at all 
principal manufacturing locations, all significant Aviation Services reporting units 
and at the three largest components of the Aeroflex acquisition in the year. 
The reporting units in scope covered 73% of the Group’s underlying profit 
before taxation and 76% of the Group’s revenue. This, together with additional 
procedures performed at Group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our 
opinion on the financial statements as a whole. For reporting units which were 
not in scope, we performed a high level risk analytic on each to understand key 
balances and transactions in the year and performed additional procedures on 
any unusual balances identified. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the 
type of work that needed to be performed at the reporting units by us, as the 
Group engagement team, or subsidiary audit teams from other PwC network 
firms operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by 
subsidiary audit teams, we determined the level of involvement we needed  
to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude 
whether sufficient appropriate evidence had been obtained as a basis for  
our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. This included attending  
the audit close meetings at which the outcome of each subsidiary audit was 
discussed and visiting a number of larger subsidiary audit teams during their 
fieldwork including the two key reporting units with the aerial refuelling 
development and production contracts. 
Where subsidiary audit teams performed work at the reporting unit level  
on behalf of the Group team, this work was performed to lower materiality 
levels appropriate to the individual units. These materiality levels ranged  
from £0.7m to £5m. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.  
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit  
and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate  
the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements 
as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality 
for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £13m (2013: £14m).
How we determined it 5% of underlying profit before taxation.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
Underlying profit before taxation is defined in  
the Annual Report on page 82. We believe that 
underlying profit before taxation represents an 
appropriate metric for assessing the performance 
of the Group and provides us with a consistent 
year on year basis for determining materiality.  
It is the amount reported by management both 
internally and externally to the market. We also 
considered our overall Group materiality in the 
context of the Group’s revenue, noting that it 
represents less than 0.8%.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £0.5m (201 3: £0.5m)  
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement,  
set out on page 33, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review. As noted in the Directors’ statement, the 
Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern  Cobham plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014

www.cobham.com 
basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, 
and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the 
financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that 
the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because 
not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not  
a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinions
In our opinion:
 – The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report  
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – The information given in the Corporate Governance Statement  
set out on pages 46 to 55 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems and about share capital structures is consistent  
with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
Information in the Annual Report is:
 – Materially inconsistent with the information in the 
audited financial statements; or
 – Apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or
 – Otherwise misleading.
We have no 
exceptions to 
report arising from 
this responsibility.
The statement given by the Directors on page 46, in 
accordance with provision C. 1. 1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code), that they consider the 
Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for members to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit.
We have no 
exceptions to 
report arising from 
this responsibility.
The section of the Annual Report on page 53, as required 
by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no 
exceptions to 
report arising from 
this responsibility.
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are  
not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in  
our opinion, a corporate governance statement has not been prepared  
by the Parent Company. We have no exceptions to report arising from  
this responsibility.
 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the Parent Company’s compliance with  
ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to 
report having performed our review. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set  
out on page 68, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only  
for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3  
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not,  
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures  
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused  
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 – Whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 – The reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and 
 – The overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and 
evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. We test and examine 
information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we 
consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.  
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired  
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company Financial Statements of 
Cobham plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 and on the information in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

1. Accounting Policies
General information
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of 
Cobham plc (the Company), a public company limited by shares, registered  
and domiciled in the United Kingdom and its subsidiaries (the Group). 
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, 
interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee and those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  
under the historical cost convention, unless otherwise stated.
Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied  
unless otherwise stated, are as set out below. 
Accounting developments
New standards and amendments to standards which have been adopted  
with effect from 1 January 2014 are: 
 – IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements;
 – IFRS 1 1, Joint Arrangements;
 – IFRS 12, Disclosures of Interests in other Entities;
 – IAS 27 (revised 201 1), Separate Financial Statements;
 – IAS 28 (revised 201 1), Associates and Joint Ventures;
 – Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 1 1 and IFRS 12: transition guidance;
 – Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27: Investment Entities; 
 – Amendment to IAS 32, Financial instruments: Presentation on offsetting 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities;
 – Amendments to IAS 36, Recoverable amount disclosures for  
Non-financial Assets;
 – Amendments to IAS 39, Novation of Derivatives and Continuation  
of Hedge Accounting ; and
 – IFRIC 21, Levies. 
No changes to previously published accounting policies or other adjustments 
were required on their adoption. 
Management judgement and estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the 
use of estimates and judgements that affect the application of accounting 
policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
These estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based  
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of  
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  
The current economic conditions have been considered when evaluating 
accounting estimates and judgements, including the application of the going 
concern basis of preparation. Although estimates are based on management’s 
best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may 
differ from those estimates.
The Board considers that the key assumptions concerning the future and other 
key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, which have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the next financial year, are as follows:
Contract risk and programme execution
Where appropriate, the consolidated financial statements include provisions  
for the estimated outcome of commercial disputes and other claims, including 
those with long term contract partners. In addition, the nature of much of the 
contracting work done by the Group means that there are reasonably frequent 
contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise in the ordinary 
course of business, whose resolution is uncertain and could materially impact 
the Group’s future reported earnings. 
Failure by Cobham to execute or deliver a project or programme gives rise  
to the risk of increased programme costs, contract penalties, litigation and 
other financial liabilities, reduced future profitability and reputational risk. 
Judgement is therefore required as regards the final costs of technical solutions, 
the outcome of negotiations with customers, the amounts recoverable under 
these contracts and any provisions required. 
The Directors take account of the advice of experts in quantifying  
the expected costs of future adverse outcomes. Due to the inherent  
uncertainty associated with such matters, the timing and determination  
of the total costs or amount of any payments under any claims could  
differ from the amounts provided.
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition (note 28)
On completion of a business combination, the cost is allocated by  
recognising the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities  
acquired at fair value. Intangible assets are recognised where they  
are separable or arise from contractual or legal rights, and have a fair  
value that can be measured reliably. For the Group, these intangible  
assets usually comprise contractual arrangements, customer relationships  
and technology based assets, but can also include acquired patents,  
software rights and licences and development costs. 
In establishing the fair value for intangible assets recognised on acquisition  
and their estimated useful lives, the Group takes account of the individual 
circumstances of the entity acquired. Factors considered include trading data, 
the value and duration of contracts acquired and the strength, duration and 
degree of exclusivity of relationships with customers. Valuation estimates  
are also used, including the estimation of likely external royalty rates that  
could be associated with technology and branding assets and attributable  
future cash flows. 
Impairment of goodwill (note 10)
A review of the carrying value of goodwill is completed at least once a year to 
ensure that it is not impaired. This requires estimation of the value in use of the 
cash generating units (CGUs) to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the 
value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future 
cash flows from the CGUs and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order 
to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
Inventory provisions (note 14)
The nature of much of the Group’s business means that inventory held  
can become technically obsolete. It is also necessary to hold additional  
spare parts in order to support key customers and programmes. Judgement is 
required in assessing the level of provision required for obsolete, slow moving 
and defective items of inventory, reflecting assumptions concerning future 
orders and revenue streams.
Taxation (notes 6 and 21)
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement 
is required in determining the worldwide provision for tax. There are many 
transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises 
liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where  
the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that  
were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred 
tax provisions and the income statement in the period in which such 
determination is made.
Retirement benefits (note 23)
The Group Financial Statements include costs and liabilities in relation  
to retirement benefit obligations. A number of assumptions are made in  
assessing the costs and present value of the pension assets and liabilities,  
which include the long term rate of increase of salary costs, discount  
rate, inflation and mortality rates. The Group uses published indices and 
independent actuarial advice to select the values of critical assumptions.

Definitions
Underlying measures (note 2)
To assist with the understanding of earnings trends, the Group has included 
within its published financial statements non-GAAP measures including trading 
profit and underlying earnings results. These are considered by the Board to  
be the most meaningful measures under which to assess the true operating 
performance of the Group.
All underlying measures include the operational results of all businesses 
including those available for sale until the point of sale. 
Trading profit (note 2)
This has been defined as operating profit from continuing operations  
excluding the impacts of business acquisition and divestment related  
activity and business restructuring costs as detailed below. Also excluded  
are changes in the marking to market of non-hedge accounted derivative 
financial instruments, impairments of intangible assets, and items deemed  
by the Directors to be of an exceptional nature.
Business acquisition and divestment related items excluded from trading  
profit and underlying earnings include the amortisation of intangible assets 
recognised on acquisition, revaluation gains and losses arising on the original 
equity interests on stepped acquisitions, adjustments to businesses held for 
sale, the writing off of the pre-acquisition profit element of inventory written 
up on acquisition, other direct costs associated with business combinations  
and terminated divestments, and adjustments to contingent consideration 
related to previously acquired businesses.
Business restructuring costs relate to the restructuring of the Group’s 
portfolio which are incremental to normal operations. These relate to  
the integration of the Aeroflex businesses acquired in 2014 and the EiD 
programme. The EiD programme, to be completed by the end of 2015,  
relates to the design and implementation of Standard Operating Frameworks 
within the principal locations, development costs of a new ERP computer 
system, together with site consolidation, consequential asset write downs 
and workforce reduction costs.
Underlying earnings (note 2) 
Underlying earnings are defined as trading profit less net underlying finance 
costs, which excludes acquisition related items, and after deducting associated 
taxation and non-controlling interests. 
Net debt (note 9) 
Net debt is defined as the net of borrowings less cash and cash equivalents  
at the balance sheet date.
Free cash flow (note 2) 
Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities plus dividends 
received from joint ventures, less cash flows related to the purchase or disposal 
of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets but excluding payments 
relating to acquisition related activities.
Operating segments (note 3)
The chief operating decision making body for the Group has been identified  
as the Board. It reviews the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess 
performance and allocate resources. Details of the composition and purpose  
of the Board can be found on pages 44 to 49.
The Group reports four operating segments whose revenue and results  
are reported to the Board. These are Communications and Connectivity, 
Mission Systems, Advanced Electronic Solutions and Aviation Services.  
All operating segments meet the definition of reportable segments as  
defined in IFRS 8. The principal activities of these segments are described  
on pages 20 to 27 . 
The Board assesses the trading performance of operating segments based  
on revenue and trading profit as defined above. Finance income, finance  
costs and taxation are not segmented and are reviewed by the Board on  
a consolidated basis. 
Segment net assets are disclosed voluntarily in note 3 and include intangible 
assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, inventory, trade 
and other receivables, trade and other payables and provisions. They do not 
include tax, net debt, derivative financial instruments, contingent consideration 
payable or retirement benefit obligations. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group Financial Statements include the financial statements of the  
Parent Company, Cobham plc, and of all its subsidiaries made up to the  
end of the financial period. 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has control, which is 
defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of  
an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company 
until the date that control ceases. On derecognition, any amounts previously 
recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in respect of that entity  
are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets  
or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in OCI are 
reclassified to profit or loss.
Joint ventures are entities where the parties that have joint control have rights 
to the net assets of the arrangement. Associates are entities where the Group 
has significant influence. Joint ventures and associates are not consolidated but 
are accounted for using the equity method. The Group Financial Statements 
include the Group’s share of the post-acquisition change in net assets and the 
post-tax profit or loss of jointly controlled entities and associates from the date 
that joint control or significant influence commences until the date this ceases. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated  
on consolidation. 
Foreign currencies
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling. Most Group companies, 
including the Parent Company, use their local currency as their functional 
currency. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency  
are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies  
are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and any 
exchange differences arising are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement. 
For consolidation purposes, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations  
are translated at the closing exchange rates. Income statements of such 
undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange as an 
approximation for actual rates during the year. Exchange differences arising  
on these translations are accounted for in OCI and the translation reserve.
Business combinations (note 28)
Businesses acquired are accounted for using the acquisition method  
of accounting with effect from the date control passes. The cost of an  
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred.  
This is the fair value of the assets transferred (typically cash), the liabilities 
assumed and any equity interests issued by the Group, including contingent  
or deferred amounts. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the exchange rates at the date of business combination.
Where a business combination is completed in stages, any previously held 
interests are remeasured to fair value at the date at which control is achieved. 
Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the 
consideration transferred over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Contingent consideration includes amounts which may become payable in 
connection with completed acquisitions, based upon future operating results 
of the businesses acquired. It is accounted for as a financial liability measured  
at fair value on a recurring basis and changes in the fair value are accounted

for as gains or losses recognised through profit or loss and excluded from 
trading profit and underlying earnings. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration, net of 
returns and other allowances.
Revenue from the sale of goods not under a long term contract is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership and effective control of 
the goods have been passed to the customer, recovery of the consideration  
is probable, and the amount of revenue and costs can be measured reliably.  
In the case of contracts with a long duration, including contracts with a funded 
development phase, revenue is recognised based upon the fair value of work 
performed to date assessed with reference to completed contract milestones 
which have been accepted by the customer. 
Long term contract accounting as described in IAS 1 1, Construction Contracts 
is not generally applicable to the longer term contracts for sales of goods 
entered into by Group companies. Where long term contract accounting  
is applicable, revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis 
whereby a portion of the contract revenue is recognised based on contract 
costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs at completion. 
Revenue for services is recognised as the services are rendered with reference 
to the proportion of the service delivered to date. For ‘cost-plus’ contracts 
(typically with government departments and agencies), revenue is recognised 
to the extent of reimbursable costs incurred, plus a proportionate amount of 
the estimated fee earned. For contracts where revenue is determined on a  
unit activity basis, revenue is recognised on the basis of activity undertaken  
in the period.
Revenue excludes intercompany sales, value added tax and other sales taxes. 
 
Taxation including deferred taxation (note 6 and 21)
The tax expense is the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year, which differs from profit 
before taxation as reported in the income statement. Taxable profit excludes 
items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and 
also excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability  
for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in 
respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying values in the consolidated financial statements. 
Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. Tax is 
charged or credited to the income statement except when it relates to items 
recognised in OCI or directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in OCI or in equity respectively. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can  
be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable  
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets  
to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments  
in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred 
taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
Dividends (note 7)
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are  
fully authorised. 
Intangible assets (note 10)
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a business  
at the date of acquisition. Goodwill acquired is allocated at acquisition to  
the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.  
CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is 
monitored for internal management purposes. 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is capitalised and reviewed for 
impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately  
in the income statement and cannot be subsequently reversed.
On divestment of a business the attributable amount of goodwill is  
included in the determination of the profit or loss on divestment.  
This includes any exchange differences reclassified to the income  
statement from the translation reserve.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill which are acquired by the Group  
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.  
These include customer relationships, technology and software, trademarks, 
licences and patents. The only internally generated intangible assets are 
development costs which are capitalised as described below and internally 
developed software where asset recognition criteria are met. 
These intangible assets are amortised over the asset’s estimated useful life  
on a straight-line basis as follows:
Customer relationships 5 to 15 years 
Technology based assets 5 to 15 years
Development costs 2 to 10 years
Order book and trade names 6 months to 10 years
Software and other intangible assets 2 to 10 years
Useful lives are assessed for each asset on an individual basis, taking into 
account the specific characteristics of the asset. 
Research and development
Development costs are capitalised when it can be demonstrated that  
the conditions for capitalisation as described in IAS 38, Intangible Assets  
are met, paying particular attention to the requirements for the product to  
be technically feasible and capable of generating a financial return. At that 
point, further costs are capitalised as an intangible asset until the intangible 
asset is readily available for use and is then amortised as described above.  
All development costs not capitalised are written off as incurred together  
with all research costs.
Property, plant and equipment (note 11)
Freehold and leasehold land and buildings, plant and machinery, and fixtures, 
fittings, tools and equipment are held at historic cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the asset.
All property, plant and equipment other than land and assets under 
construction is depreciated on a straight-line basis to the estimated residual 
values over the estimated useful lives. These lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold properties Period to next break clause
Plant and machinery 3 to 15 years
Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 15 years Cobham plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
84
www.cobham.com 
Estimated residual values and the estimated useful lives are reviewed annually 
and adjusted where necessary. Freehold land is not depreciated, but is reviewed 
for impairment at least annually.
Assets under construction are held at cost and transferred to the appropriate 
category of property, plant and equipment once construction is complete and 
they enter into service. They are depreciated from this point in accordance with 
the policies described above.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful 
lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the 
relevant lease. 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognised in the income statement. 
Aircraft overhaul expenditure
Major overhaul expenditure on owned aircraft is capitalised when incurred  
and the resultant property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful 
economic life. Major overhaul costs that are contractually required on aircraft 
held under operating leases are provided for over the period between the 
scheduled maintenance events. 
Investment properties (note 12)
Investment properties, which are properties held to earn rentals or for capital 
appreciation, are stated at cost in the balance sheet. They are depreciated  
on a straight-line basis to their estimated residual value over their estimated 
useful lives of up to 50 years. 
Rental income is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis.
Impairments
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at  
least annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  
In addition, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill,  
are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication  
that the asset may be impaired.
Where there is an indication of impairment, the asset’s recoverable amount  
is estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of 
disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not  
been adjusted.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount of an asset  
is lower than its carrying amount. All impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement. 
An impairment loss (other than arising on goodwill) is reversed only after  
a change in the estimates used to assess recoverable amount is identified  
and only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or 
amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Any reversal is 
recognised in the income statement.
Leasing (notes 11 and 29)
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases 
are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their 
fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments,  
each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to 
the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease 
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance 
of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Benefits receivable 
as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
Inventories (note 14)
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and  
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the first-in, first-out 
method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling 
and distribution. Provision is made where necessary for obsolete, slow moving  
and defective items.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale (note 17)
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are stated at the 
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. No depreciation  
is charged in respect of non-current assets classified as held for sale. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their 
carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale  
is highly probable and expected to be completed within a year of the balance 
sheet date. The asset or disposal group should be available for immediate sale 
in its present condition and actively marketed at a price that is reasonable in 
relation to its current fair value. 
Fair values
The fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell  
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the balance sheet date. Fair value measurements are used on a 
recurring basis except where used in the measurement of net assets classified 
as held for sale, where accounting standards require the use of fair values only 
in certain circumstances. Non-recurring fair values are also used in the valuation 
of assets and liabilities in a business combination. 
The fair values of derivative financial instruments have been determined  
by the use of valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, based  
on assumptions that are supported by observable market prices or rates. 
The fair value of contingent consideration is determined based on the 
estimated payment, discounted to present value and using the entity’s own 
data and unobservable inputs such as the anticipated rate of annual revenue 
growth, profit margins and discount rates. The estimated payment is calculated 
using the income approach, considering different scenarios of the relevant 
measure (commonly EBITDA). 
For financial assets and liabilities which are not held at fair value in the balance 
sheet, the carrying values of these items are assumed to approximate to fair 
value due to their short term nature.
Non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value include net assets 
classified as held for sale. Fair values are also used in assessing the assets and 
liabilities acquired in a business combination. These fair value measurements 
are based on observable market prices or rates. For non-financial assets, the  
fair value takes into account the highest and best use of the asset.
There have been no changes to the valuation techniques used during the 
period. The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers in and transfers out of fair 
value hierarchy levels as at the date of the event or change in circumstances 
that caused the transfer, although there have been no such transfers during  
the current or comparative periods.
Financial instruments (note 15)
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance 
sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value  
at trade date.

Financial assets 
The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the 
assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of an asset  
at initial recognition and re-evaluates the designation at each reporting date.
Assets held at fair value through profit or loss are those categorised as held  
for trading under IAS 39 and are classified as current assets or non-current 
assets dependent upon maturity. Such financial assets are subsequently  
carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments which are not quoted in an active market. These  
are classified as current or non-current assets dependent upon maturity  
and included within trade and other receivables. Loans and receivables also 
includes cash and cash equivalents. The fair value of these financial assets is 
adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition  
or issue of the asset. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables  
are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Available for sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets either 
designated by management as available for sale or not falling into any other 
category. Financial assets so categorised include equity instruments which do 
not have a quoted price in an active market and hence are measured at cost. 
None of the Group’s material financial assets fall into the held to maturity 
category, which is defined as non-derivative financial assets with fixed  
maturity dates that the Group intends to hold to maturity.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are categorised on initial recognition as held for trading 
under IAS 39 and are held at fair value through profit or loss, or other liabilities, 
which are held at amortised cost. All financial liabilities are classified as current 
or non-current liabilities dependent upon the maturity date of the instruments. 
Derivative financial instruments are categorised as held for trading unless  
they are designated as hedges. 
The fair value of financial liabilities held at cost (not at fair value through 
profit or loss) is adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable  
to the acquisition or issue of the liability. Financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Financial liabilities 
not at fair value through profit or loss are stated at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. 
Financial assets and liabilities are presented on an offset basis when there  
is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there  
is an intention to settle on a net basis. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their amortised cost, reduced by 
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Allowances for irrecoverable amounts are made when there is evidence that 
the Group may not be able to collect the amount due. All trade receivables 
which are more than six months overdue are provided for based on estimated 
irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience. 
Amounts which are less than six months overdue are provided where recovery 
of the balance due is considered to be doubtful. 
The impairment recorded is the difference between the carrying value of  
the receivables and the present value of the estimated future cash flows.  
Any impairment required is recorded in the income statement in administrative 
expenses. The balance may be written off in full generally where receivables  
are in excess of 12 months old. At that time, any amounts previously provided 
for impairment are released. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and bank deposits with  
an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable 
on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of  
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. 
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the amount of 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Borrowing costs, net of amounts 
capitalised, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct 
issue costs, are charged to the income statement and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period  
in which they arise. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to relevant 
property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Trade payables
Trade payables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
As explained in note 24, the Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks  
of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group 
uses foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to reduce 
these exposures and does not use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes. Other derivative financial instruments may be used  
from time to time to hedge other exposures such as inflation risks. 
The Group has documented its risk management objectives and strategy  
for undertaking various hedge transactions, and utilises hedge accounting 
principles in relation to interest rate swaps and a limited number of specific 
foreign exchange contracts. These are designated as cash flow hedges which 
mitigate the Group’s exposure to changes in interest rates arising on floating 
rate debt. From time to time, the Group may also use interest rate swaps to 
manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings; 
however there are no such contracts outstanding at the present time. 
Foreign exchange contracts entered into to mitigate foreign exchange impacts 
of trading in non-functional currencies, and inflation swaps entered into to 
mitigate inflation risks, are generally not accounted for using hedge accounting. 
Foreign currency borrowings are used to hedge the effects of changes in the 
Group’s net investment in foreign operations. These borrowings either provide 
a natural economic hedge through the use of intercompany debt or are 
designated as fair value hedges of the foreign currency risk attributable to  
the foreign equity investment and are treated as net investment hedges. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. 
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the 
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the 
item being hedged.
Where hedge accounting is applied, the relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items is documented at the inception of the 
transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives used in  
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash  
flows (or fair values if appropriate) of hedged items.
Where interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are designated  
and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in fair value  
is recognised in OCI through the hedge reserve. The gain or loss relating to  
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to finance income or finance 
costs in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects 
profit or loss.
When a cash flow hedging derivative expires or is sold, or when a hedge  
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in the hedge reserve in equity at that time remains in equity and  
is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement. If a hedged transaction is  
no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised  
in the hedge reserve in equity is immediately transferred to the income 
statement in that period. Cobham plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
86
www.cobham.com 
Where net investment hedging applies, the exchange differences arising on the 
borrowings designated as fair value hedges are recognised in OCI and through 
profit and loss on disposal of the foreign operation. 
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a current asset or 
liability except when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more  
than 12 months. 
Where hedge accounting is not applied, the movements in fair value of  
the derivative instruments are included in the income statement as part of 
operating profit. The fair value of such derivatives is classified as a current  
or non-current asset or liability dependent upon the expected realisation  
of the assets or settlement of the liabilities.
Provisions (note 20)
A provision is required when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that settlement will  
be required and where the amount can be reliably measured. No provision  
is recognised where the existence of an obligation is possible but will only  
be confirmed by uncertain future events. 
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant 
products, at management’s best estimates of the expenditure required to  
settle the Group’s liabilities, based on past experience and industry averages  
for defective products. 
Contract loss provisions are recognised for onerous contracts when the 
expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower  
than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. 
Aircraft maintenance provisions are established in respect of significant  
periodic maintenance costs, where maintenance activity is required on  
leased operational aircraft or engines on a cycle greater than 12 months.  
Costs are charged to the income statement on the basis of utilisation of the 
aircraft and are credited to the provision. The provision is then utilised by 
absorbing the actual costs incurred in carrying out the maintenance activity. 
Maintenance carried out on a cycle of 12 months or less is charged to the 
income statement as incurred.
Provisions also arise in connection with leased aircraft, where contracts contain 
specific conditions regarding the configuration of the aircraft on its return to  
the lessor at the end of the lease. The estimated cost associated with fulfilling 
these requirements is charged to the income statement on an aircraft utilisation 
basis. The provision is utilised on actual return of the aircraft or on incurring the 
expenditure required to return the aircraft to the state of maintenance required 
by the lease before return of the aircraft to the lessor.
Provisions for claims made against the Group and commitments made  
under performance guarantees are recognised at management’s best  
estimates of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s liabilities. 
Provisions are discounted at an appropriate risk free rate when the impact  
is material.
Pensions (note 23)
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined  
contribution schemes. 
For defined benefit schemes, current service costs and costs related  
to the administration of the schemes are charged to operating profit.  
Gains and losses on settlements and curtailments arising on a business 
divestment are included in profit on divestment. Past service costs are 
recognised immediately in the income statement. The interest on net  
assets or liabilities is shown within finance income and costs. Actuarial 
remeasurements are recognised immediately in OCI.
Defined benefit schemes are funded, with the assets of the scheme held 
separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee administered funds. 
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured 
on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate 
equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of 
equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities. The actuarial valuations 
are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date. 
The resulting net defined benefit asset or liability is presented separately  
on the face of the balance sheet.
For defined contribution schemes, the amounts charged to the income 
statement in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits  
are the contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions 
payable in the year and contributions actually paid are recorded as either 
accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Share capital (note 25)
Ordinary share capital is classified as equity. Financial liabilities and equity 
instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Preference share capital is classified as a liability if it is redeemable on a specific 
date or at the option of the preference shareholders or if dividend payments 
are not discretionary. Dividends on preference share capital classified as 
liabilities are recognised in the income statement as finance costs.
Treasury shares (note 25)
When ordinary share capital recognised as equity is acquired by the Company, 
the shares are held as treasury shares. The consideration paid, including 
commissions and taxes, is deducted from retained earnings and total equity. 
The proceeds of any treasury shares subsequently sold or re-issued, net of 
commission and taxes, are recognised as an increase in retained earnings and 
total equity.
Share based payments (note 27)
For grants made under the Group’s equity settled share based payment 
schemes, amounts which reflect the fair value of awards as at the time  
of grant are charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting 
periods, taking into account the Directors’ best estimate of the number of 
awards expected to vest. The Group reviews and updates the vesting estimate, 
which includes progress against non-market related performance conditions,  
at each balance sheet date. 
The valuation methodology for all schemes is based on the Black-Scholes 
model, modified where required to allow for the impact of market related 
performance criteria and taking into account all non-vesting conditions.
 
Future accounting developments
A number of new standards, amendments to existing standards and 
interpretations have been published that are mandatory for future accounting 
periods. Those endorsed by the EU for use from 1 January 2015 are as follows:
 – Amendment to IAS 19, Defined Benefit Plans;
 – Annual Improvements 2012;
 – Annual Improvements 201 3.
None of these have been adopted early by the Group and none are expected 
to have an impact on the Group’s financial reporting.
There are also a number of new standards and amendments to existing 
standards including Annual Improvements which, once endorsed by the EU,  
will be effective from 1 January 2016 or later years. These include:
 – IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers; 
 – IFRS 9, Financial Instruments. 
Based on an initial review, IFRS 9 is not expected to have a material impact on 
the results of the Group. IFRS 15 is under review to determine the potential 
impact on the Group.

Business restructuring costs relate to the restructuring of the Group’s portfolio, under its EiD and Aeroflex integration programmes, which are incremental to  
normal operations. The EiD programme relates exclusively to the design and implementation of Standard Operating Frameworks within the principal locations,  
initial development costs of a new ERP computer system, together with site consolidation, consequential asset write downs and workforce reduction costs  
arising from additional streamlining under the two year extension of the programme, which continues into 2015. Costs in respect of the Aeroflex integration  
are consequential to the acquisition of the Aeroflex group in September 2014 and are in line with the Company’s plans announced in the shareholder circular  
of 16 June 2014, which set out the synergies and cost savings expected to be derived by the integration of Aeroflex with the existing Cobham businesses.
On 15 July 2013 an agreement was reached to acquire the 50% shareholding that the Group did not already own in FBH. The proceeds of the deemed disposal  
of the 50% interest previously held were valued at £74.2m which generated the revaluation gain arising on equity interests in FBH of £62.1m.

Goodwill and annual impairment review
Goodwill represents the premium paid in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately 
recognised, such as the value of the workforce, and is the only indefinite life intangible asset held by the Group. 
The Group reviews goodwill for potential impairment of each cash generating unit (CGU) annually, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might  
be impaired. As a result of the site integrations and other EiD activity, CGUs are typically considered to be Business Units.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations unless specific conditions at a CGU dictate otherwise. Businesses held for sale 
are assessed for impairment using expected net proceeds of divestment. In 2013 an impairment loss of £63.0m was recognised in respect of the Cobham Tactical 
Communications and Surveillance business. 
The calculation of recoverable value for CGUs based on value in use includes the following key assumptions:
 – Cash flow forecasts for the following five years prepared as part of the annual strategic planning process and approved by management. These forecasts take 
into account the current and expected economic environment including factors such as the softening of the US defence market in the near term. The growth 
rates (which range from - 1% to 10% and at a Group level are consistent with mid-single digit revenue growth) assume that demand for the Group’s products  
in the US and in the UK remains broadly in line with the underlying economic environment. Taking into account the expectation of future market conditions, 
management believe that the evolution of selling prices and direct costs will reflect past practices; 
 – Growth rates assumed after this five year period are based on long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU. The long term projections  
used are in the range 1.5% to 2.0% (201 3: 2.0% to 2.5%);
 – Cash flows are discounted using the Group’s WACC, adjusted for country and currency risks in the principal territories in which the Group operates.  
These pre-tax discount rates are within the range 8.3% to 10.5% (201 3: 8. 1% to 10.7%);
 – Cash flows include the impact of working capital requirements, typically assuming a 90% cash conversion rate; and
 – Cash flows include management charges which allocate central overheads to the CGUs.
If the goodwill allocated to a CGU represents more than 10% of the Group’s total goodwill carrying value, then the CGU is considered to be individually significant. 
These CGUs are as follows: 
CGU Operating segment
Goodwill  
carrying value  
£m
Headroom 
£m
Pre-tax  
discount rate
Projected 5 year 
growth rate
Projected GDP  
growth rate
SATCOM Communications and Connectivity 197 322 8.5% 4.4% 1.5%
Integrated Electronic Solutions Advanced Electronic Solutions 147 273 8.9% 1.0% 2.0%
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on these CGUs and no impairment losses would arise if the discount rate increased by 20%, if the growth rate was zero  
or if cash flows reduced by 20%. The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions that would cause the carrying value  
of recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
The allocation of goodwill arising on the acquisition of Aeroflex is disclosed as provisional and subject to potential adjustment. A detailed impairment review of the 
carrying value of this goodwill will be performed in the year ended 31 December 2015 and sensitivity disclosures will be made for individually significant CGUs.

The total fair value of the Group’s investment properties has been assessed to be £13.9m (2013: £14.2m). For 2014, these values are based on Directors’ estimates 
using observable market data, taking into account current lease terms. In 2013 estimated market prices for UK properties were provided by external valuers and the 
fair value of the US property was a Directors’ estimate; both were based on observable market data.
Property rental income earned by the Group from its investment properties amounted to £1.4m (2013: £1.9m), which is net of all direct costs associated with the 
leasing of the properties except depreciation. The buildings are leased to commercial users on operating leases with terms of between 5 and 25 years, commencing 
between 1998 and 2013.

Country of 
incorporation  
or registration
Aviation Défense Service SA 45% Joint venture Aviation Services France
Northrop Grumman Cobham Intercoms LLC 50% Joint venture Communications and Connectivity USA
Philtech Co., Ltd 30% Associate Communications and Connectivity South Korea
The Company’s joint ventures and associates all have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares, which are indirectly held, and the country of incorporation or 
registration is also their principal place of operation. 
The 45% investment in Aviation Défense Service SA is treated as a joint venture because the governance structure means that the Group has joint control with  
its partner.
The assets and results of the associated undertaking are not separately disclosed on the basis of materiality. The address of the principal place of business of  
Philtech Co., Ltd is Sujeong-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.

Work in progress includes £59.9m (2013: £72.2m) which relates to customer funded engineering development contracts. 
During the year £17.4m (2013: £15.2m) was provided, £9.3m (2013: £6.1m) was utilised and £8.1m (2013: £6.4m) of the allowance for obsolescence was reversed.  
This allowance is reviewed by management on a regular basis and further amounts are provided or released as considered necessary. The amounts are generally 
determined based on factors which include ageing and known demand. Subsequent events may give rise to these estimates being revised and, consequently,  
to the reversal of amounts previously provided. 
Inventory will be realised within the normal operating cycle of the businesses. Within the Mission Systems segment, inventory relating to long term contracts 
expected to be realised after more than 12 months amounts to £18.1m (2013: £39.0m).

Borrowings are held at amortised cost which equates to fair value except for the Group’s fixed rate borrowings. At 31 December 2014 the fair value of those 
borrowings was £926.5m (2013: £299.8m) compared to their book value of £825.7m (2013: £262.0m). The fair value of the fixed rate borrowings and derivative 
financial instruments have been determined by reference to observable market prices and rates. 
Cash and cash equivalents include term deposits in Australia equivalent to £6.2m (2013: £6.4m) which are held to provide security over the residual value of leased 
assets under an agreement which expires in 2020. 
Other financial assets relate to Cobham plc’s investments in connection with the Voyager (FST A) project which are held at cost, totalling £6.1m (2013: £6.1m). 
Gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are shown in notes 19 and 22. The total interest income and expense for 
financial assets and liabilities not held at fair value through profit or loss is as shown in note 5.  Cobham plc

Offsetting financial assets and liabilities
Cash and cash equivalents as shown in the Balance Sheet include overdraft balances on currency cash pooling accounts which have been offset as the accounts  
will be settled on a net basis as described in note 24. Master netting agreements also cover all bank balances and derivative balances with the same counterparty. 
These do not meet the criteria for offsetting because the right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events such as a default and amounts 
presented in the Balance Sheet are therefore presented on a gross basis.  
If full offsetting by counterparty were to be applied, the resulting net amounts would be as follows:

These are generally expected to be utilised within one year.
Provisions for warranty claims and contract losses are generally expected to be utilised within one year. 
Aircraft maintenance provisions relate to significant periodic maintenance costs as well as return conditions for leased aircraft. These conditions may relate  
to the number of operational hours to be available before a major maintenance check, the physical configuration of the aircraft or direct costs to be incurred  
by the lessee in the physical return of the aircraft to the lessor. While there is uncertainty over the future level of flying hours, aircraft maintenance provisions  
are anticipated to crystallise in the next seven years. 
Other provisions include amounts provided in respect of legal claims and environmental obligations and are mostly expected to be settled within one year.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused capital losses of £66.0m (2013: £65.7m) potentially available for offset against future capital profits in certain 
circumstances. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams. These losses 
can be carried forward indefinitely.

deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £301.7m (2013: £369.2m).

Interest rate swaps and a small number of specific foreign exchange derivatives with a fair value at 31 December 2014 of £2.7m (2013: £nil) are designated as cash 
flow hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied. There is no material ineffectiveness in cash flow hedges to be reported through the income statement. 
The majority of foreign exchange and inflation derivatives are not accounted for using hedge accounting and movements in fair values are recorded in the income 
statement as part of operating profit. Where currency swaps offset movements in currency balances held, the movement in the fair value of these swaps is set against 
the income statement exchange movements arising on those balances. 
Full details of the Group’s financial instrument accounting policies and risk management strategies, objectives and policies are set out in the accounting policies in 
note 1 and in note 24, financial risk management.

23. Retirement benefit schemes
Retirement benefit obligations per the Balance Sheet consist of:
£m 2014 2013
Defined benefit scheme assets 670.6 577.6
Defined benefit obligations (772.6) (664.9)
(102.0) (87.3)
Pension expense included in employment costs in note 4 are as follows:
£m 2014 2013
Defined benefit schemes 5.5 5.2
Defined contribution schemes 25.5 24.4
31.0 29.6
The Group operates a number of funded defined benefit schemes (where benefits are based on employees’ length of service and average final salary), the most 
significant being the Cobham Pension Plan (CPP). The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of 
trustees. All defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members since 2003. The Group also manages a number of defined contribution pension 
arrangements, where the Group’s contribution is fixed at a set percentage of employees’ pay.
Actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries;  
the most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2012. Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable  
country regulations. The actuarial valuations were updated by qualified independent actuaries for accounting purposes to 31 December 2014. In the UK, within  
15 months of each triennial valuation, the employer and the trustees are required to agree a schedule of contributions to ensure that the Plan is fully funded over  
time on a suitably prudent basis. The Group expects to contribute £23.5m to its defined benefit pension schemes in 2015 and £23.1m in 2016. This includes  
£18.4m (2016: £17.6m) related to deficit funding.
On 1 July 2013 the liabilities related to past service of pensioners of the CPP on that date were subject to a buy-in arrangement. Under the terms of this  
arrangement, the CPP transferred assets to an insurance company in return for a qualifying insurance policy which provides an income stream to the Plan  
equivalent to the Plan’s obligations to pensioners covered by the arrangement. This eliminated the Group’s exposure to the interest, inflation and longevity  
risks associated with these liabilities. The liabilities covered by this buy-in amounted to £242m, which had the impact of generating an actuarial loss of £39m.  
This follows similar buy-in arrangements completed in 2011 related to past service of pensioner and deferred members of some of the smaller defined  
benefit schemes. The insurance contract assets are measured at a value equal to the related liabilities. In 2014 the CPP has made liability driven investments  
to provide further cover against interest and inflation volatility.
There were no significant contributions outstanding at the end of 2014 or 2013 for the defined benefit schemes. £1.3m (2013: £1.2m) was outstanding in respect  
of defined contribution schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 2014. 
The principal financial assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows:
2014 2013
UK  
schemes
USA  
scheme
UK  
schemes
USA  
scheme
Rate of increase in salary costs 3.45% 3.45% 3.80% 3.80%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment unless overridden by specific scheme rules 3.20% 3.20% 3.55% 3.55%
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.20% 3.20% 2.55% 3.55%
Discount rate 3.50% 3.50% 4.50% 4.50%
Inflation assumption 3.20% 3.20% 3.55% 3.55%
The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actuarial tables which reflect actual recent mortality experience and also allow for future mortality 
improvements. The mortality tables used to estimate life expectancy are known as ‘SAPS CMI 13’. In practical terms, this is demonstrated in the table below:
Year of birth Year age 65
Further life 
expectancy
Male 1949 2014 22.6 years
Female 1949 2014 24.9 years
Male 1980 2045 25.5 years
Female 1980 2045 27.9 years
At 31 December 2014 it has been assumed that members will commute on average 20% (2013: 20%) of their pension for cash at retirement. This implies a full 
take-up of the permitted 25% (2013: 25%) commutation by approximately 80% (2013: 80%) of eligible members on retirement. Cobham plc

The sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in certain key assumptions, after adjusting for liabilities covered by insurance contracts, is provided below:
Change in assumption Change in liabilities
Discount rate Increase by 0.5% -4%
Inflation rate Increase by 0.5% +3%
Life expectancy Increase by 1 year +2%
The impact of increases and decreases in assumptions are approximately symmetrical.

Total employer contributions exceeded current service cost, past service cost and scheme administration expenses by £16.9m (2013: £14.5m).
The present value of funded obligations relating to the US scheme is US$42.7m (2013: US$35.5m) and the fair value of scheme assets relating to the US scheme  
is US$27.0m (2013: US$26.2m).
The cumulative amount of actuarial losses recognised in the OCI since transition to IFRS is £235.8m (2013: £208.1m). Of the actuarial losses recognised in the year, 
the changes in financial assumptions are primarily driven by the movements in the discount rate and inflation assumption.
The actual return on scheme assets was £91.1m (2013: £48.0m before accounting for the actuarial loss of £39.0m generated on the buy-in transaction).  
The weighted average duration of the scheme liabilities is estimated to be 19 years.

24. Financial risk management
The Group’s multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates, interest rates, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial 
performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt and other instruments, including interest rate swaps. Other derivative financial 
instruments may be used from time to time to manage other exposures such as inflation risks. The financial risk management policies agreed by the Board have  
not changed during the year and are summarised below. The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is based in the UK, reports in sterling and has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, Australia and other European countries.  
As a result, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries’ exchange rates. The Group’s policy is to reduce, or eliminate where  
practical, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk and, consequently, the net foreign exchange gains and losses included in the Income Statement 
amounted to a gain of £5.8m (2013: £3.2m loss). All currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by 
Cobham plc management.
The Group has the following exposure to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Balance Sheet, translated into sterling at the 
relevant year-end exchange rates:

Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange differences arising from the Group’s overseas net assets. The Group 
typically borrows in the currency of the acquisition and uses intercompany debt to create a natural economic hedge. Monetary liabilities in the table above include  
US dollar borrowings of £1,305.4m (2013: £482.4m) and Danish krone borrowings of £71.0m (2013: £75.9m) which match exposures arising from currency 
denominated net assets. Foreign currency contracts are also used to manage exposure to currency risks.  
On consolidation, the net assets of overseas subsidiaries (which include the monetary assets and liabilities shown in the tables above) are translated at closing 
exchange rates and exchange differences arising are accounted for in OCI and in the translation reserve (note 26). 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in the income statement where individual subsidiaries hold non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities  
and when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency. The Group undertakes a formal process to actively 
manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of matching non-functional currency revenues and costs, matching non-functional currency monetary 
assets and liabilities and through the use of forward contracts. 
During 2014 forward contracts have been placed to sell US dollars for Danish kroner to mitigate the impact of US dollar sales now being made by the Group’s  
Danish subsidiaries. 
The sterling/US dollar and Danish kroner/US dollar exchange rates are the most important for the Group. The Group has the following forward foreign currency 
contracts outstanding for net sales of US dollars for sterling and Danish kroner:

Expiring after two years 28.3 – 5.34 –
US$/DKK contracts outstanding at 31 December 291.5 9.6 5.49 5.55
The latest expiry date of forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars is July 2022 and it is the Group’s current belief that the net dollar receipts by its 
subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitments.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currencies, with a negative number indicating a reduction  
in profit after taxation or total equity. The sensitivities below represent management’s assessment of the possible changes in foreign exchange rates, based on 
experience over the previous five years. 
2014 2013
£m Sensitivity Profit or loss Total equity Sensitivity Profit or loss Total equity
US dollars to sterling 9% (8.0) (8.0) 11% (13.8) (13.8)

Euros to sterling 8% (4.2) (4.2) 9% (3.3) (3.3)
This sensitivity analysis has been based on the assumption that the change is effective throughout the financial year and that all other variables, including interest 
rates, remain constant. It includes the effect of derivative financial instruments. 
In order to provide comparable information, sensitivity has also been assessed based on a 10% weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currency,  
as follows:

Interest rate risk
The Group has long and short term borrowings at both fixed and floating rates of interest. In managing its borrowing costs, the Group monitors its exposure  
to movements in interest rates, having regard to prevailing market conditions and, where necessary, uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk.

All floating rate borrowings have regular repricing dates.
Floating to fixed interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, have been used to mitigate the interest rate exposure arising on selected floating rate debt. 
Interest rate swaps outstanding at the year end are as follows:

30.8 37.1
The Group does not currently hold any fair value hedging instruments such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit and as such also give rise to interest rate exposure. There was no material sensitivity to changes in interest 
rates at the year end.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on managing liquidity risk throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings with lenders.  
Overdraft and revolving credit facilities provide short term flexibility whilst the revolving credit facilities provide longer term committed funding. 
As shown in note 18, at 31 December 2014 undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £102.7m (2013: £37.7m) were available to the Group in various currencies.
At an operating level, the Group has a positive cash flow from operating activities and where practical the funds generated by business units are managed on  
a regional basis. In the UK and US, most business units utilise local bank facilities within a UK or US group arrangement. This allows a balance to be maintained  
between continuity of funding, security and flexibility. 
The table below summarises the remaining contractual maturity for the Group’s borrowings and other financial liabilities, including derivative financial liabilities. The 
amounts shown are the contractual undiscounted cash flows which include interest, analysed by contractual maturity. The difference between the contractual cash 
flows and the carrying amount of these liabilities reflects the effects of interest not included in the carrying amount and discounting applied in assessing fair value.

Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk. 
The Group has a conservative policy towards the credit risk related to liquid funds and derivative financial instruments with balances currently spread across a  
range of reputable financial institutions. The levels of credit risk are monitored through the Group’s ongoing risk management processes, which include a regular 
review of the banks’ credit ratings. Risk in this area is limited further by setting a maximum level for term deposits with any one counterparty. 
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and unrelated. Customers are typically  
large global companies or government agencies with long-term trading relationships. The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks  
on potential customers before sales are made. Existing customer accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to 
minimise any credit risk. The Directors therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for impaired receivables shown 
in note 16.  
Group management monitor the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue and debtor days on a regular basis. At 31 December 2014, 9.2% 
(2013: 8.2%) of gross trade receivables were overdue by one month or more. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2014 is the fair value of each class of receivable as disclosed in note 17. Letters of credit are the only collateral 
held as security against trade receivables. These are obtained in a limited number of cases in accordance with good business practice and secure £5.8m of receivables.  
Bank term balances totalling £6.2m (2013: £6.4m) have been pledged against the residual value of leased assets as described in note 15.
In the UK and the USA, the Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances. In the normal course of business, these bank accounts are settled  
on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented net in the Balance Sheet as shown in note 15. In the event of an automatic enforcement event,  
the bank balances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
Derivatives can also be offset by counterparties in the event of a default; net amounts that result on this basis are shown in note 15. 
Inflation risk
The Group’s exposure to inflation is considered to be a general business risk which is mitigated through normal commercial activity. The Group has one swap contract 
which was designed to manage the inherent inflation risk in a specific operational contract. The fair value of this swap contract is included in derivative financial 
instruments shown in note 22.
Capital risk management
Group policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain stakeholder confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Capital is defined as 
total equity excluding non-controlling interests and amounted to £1,111.4m at 31 December 2014 (2013: £1,043.4m). Within this overall policy, the Group seeks to 
maintain an appropriate finance structure through a mixture of debt and retained earnings. Funding needs are reviewed periodically and also each time a significant 
acquisition or business divestment is made. A number of factors are considered which include the net debt/EBITDA ratio, future funding needs (usually potential 
acquisitions) and proposed dividend levels. Group banking arrangements are also considered; these include financial covenants which are based on adjusted IFRS 
results as outlined on page 31. This policy has been reviewed by the Board on a regular basis during the year and, given the current economic climate, continues to  
be considered appropriate.

The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising on the results and financial position of subsidiaries whose functional currencies differ from 
the Group’s reporting currency. Foreign exchange movements arising on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are also included here and, following the 
settlement of the financial instrument, any balances remaining are transferred to retained earnings.
The hedge reserve reflects movements in fair values on cash flow hedging derivatives as detailed in notes 22 and 24.
The share based payment reserve includes the cost of share awards as assessed under IFRS 2 and detailed in note 27, together with deferred tax provided under  
IAS 12. The appropriate proportion of the share options reserve is transferred to retained earnings following vesting or exercise.  Cobham plc

27. Share based payments
The total amount included in the Income Statement arising from the Group’s equity settled share based payment schemes is as follows:
£m 2014 2013
PSP 6.8 4.7
Other schemes 1.4 1.2
Release of amounts charged in previous years (2.1) (7.6)
6.1 (1.7)
During the year ended 31 December 2014, £2.1m (2013: £7.6m) charged to the Income Statement in previous years has been released, reflecting actual  
vesting experience and a reassessment of the expected future vesting of outstanding awards, based on non-market related performance conditions. 
The PSP scheme is offered to senior executives across the Group and allows for annual grants of conditional shares with vesting conditions based on the  
Group’s financial performance, taking into account both market based conditions such as TSR growth and non-market based measures such as EPS growth  
or cash conversion respectively. The scheme includes buy-out awards granted in 2013 and 2014 to the Group’s CEO and CFO. 
The PSP scheme also includes retention awards granted during 2014 which mainly vest in equal amounts after two or three years, conditional only upon  
continued employment within the Group. 
Other schemes include ESOS, RSP, BCP and ShareSave elements. In previous years, share options were awarded to senior executives under the ESOS scheme,  
with exercise conditional upon the Group’s underlying EPS growth over a three year period. This scheme included a ‘time-only’ section for US employees whereby 
options were granted with 25% vesting on each annual anniversary, conditional only on continued employment within the Group. No new awards have been  
made under this scheme since 2013. Restricted Share Plan awards (RSPs) have been granted for the first time during 2014. This scheme gives the rights to acquire 
shares for nil consideration over a four year period, with 25% vesting on each annual anniversary, conditional only upon continued employment within the Group.  
The Bonus Co-investment Plan (BCP) is offered to a small number of senior executives and provides matching shares where bonus awards are invested in shares. 
Finally, the Group operates a ShareSave scheme which is open to all UK employees. 
Further details of all the schemes can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 64.
The number of awards outstanding at 31 December are as follows:
Number of awards (thousands of shares) 2014 2013
PSP 10,380 8,544
ESOS 5,914 10,161
RSP 543 –
BCP 118 190
ShareSave 5,908 5,447
At 31 December 22,863 24,342
Details of movements in the awards under the PSP scheme are as follows:
Number of awards (thousands of shares) 2014 2013
At 1 January 8,544 7,794
Awards granted 5,171 3,531
Awards forfeited or cancelled (2,491) (2,315)
Exercised (802) (466)
Expired (42) –
At 31 December 10,380 8,544
Weighted average remaining contractual life of PSP awards outstanding 1.46 years 1.38 years
Number of PSP awards exercisable at 31 December (thousands) 40 669
Awards under the PSP schemes have been granted at various dates throughout the year, with main tranches in March, May and September 2014.  
The average fair value of PSP awards granted during 2014 was £2.833 (2013 awards: £2.223), calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model  
modified by a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the likely impact of market related performance conditions. The weighted average inputs into the  
models were as follows:
2014 2013
Weighted average share price £3.065 £2.472
Expected life 2.82 years 2.96 years
Expected employee cancellation rate 4.1% 1.8%
Risk free rate 0.9% 0.3%
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cobham plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
11 3
www.cobham.com 
The expected lives used in the models have been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability and behavioural 
considerations. The expected employee cancellation rates are based on assessments of historic rates of voluntary cancellations of contracts by employees. 
Most participants of the PSP schemes receive the benefit of dividend payments and therefore dividend yields are not taken into consideration in the  
valuation models.
The fair values of ESOS and ShareSave awards are significantly lower than for PSP, RSP and BCP awards due to the effect of the exercise price which is set  
based upon the market value of the Company’s ordinary shares around the date of grant.
28. Business combinations 
Businesses acquired during the year
On 12 September 2014 Aeroflex Holding Corp. (Aeroflex) was acquired following a public offer and the purchase of 92% of the share capital. The remaining shares 
have been purchased in 2015. 
Approximately 70% of Aeroflex’s revenue is focused on commercial markets with exposure to wireless, space, microelectronics, industrial, energy and other  
sectors, increasing the proportion of Cobham’s commercial revenue and building on Cobham’s focus on connectivity capabilities, customers and characteristics. 
Aeroflex operations are being integrated into Cobham’s Advanced Electronic Solutions and Communications and Connectivity Sectors. The scale and complementary 
nature of this acquisition is expected to enable Cobham to unlock significant synergy benefits, generating increased shareholder value, whilst supporting customers 
more effectively. Further details can be found on pages 18 and 19. 
Fair value information
The fair value of the business combination can be analysed as follows:
£m Total
Cash consideration paid 523.5
Cash consideration to be paid for remaining shares 49.3
572.8
A summary of the fair values of the net assets acquired is as follows: 
£m Total

Trade and other receivables 12.8
Non-current assets 579.6

Goodwill 386.5
572.8
The fair values of net assets acquired are provisional and subject to potential adjustment.  Cobham plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014

www.cobham.com 
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The residual excess of the total cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill in the financial statements. Goodwill represents the premium paid in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are  
not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised, such as the value of the workforce. Synergies are expected to arise from cross-selling 
revenue benefits, site consolidation, supply chain efficiency, implementation of the Cobham Standard Operating Framework and elimination of duplicate 
corporate overheads. Goodwill is not anticipated to be deductible for tax purposes. 
The gross value of acquired trade and other receivables is £73.9m. These are included in the table above at their fair value of £68.7m. Contingent liabilities 
recognised as provisions and included in the table above include amounts relating to outstanding legal settlements and environmental remediation provisions 
in respect of a number of Aeroflex’s sites. The majority of these are expected to be settled within one year although some are longer term provisions.
Results of business combinations
Third party revenue of Aeroflex, since the date of acquisition, was £123.7m. The post-acquisition loss after tax was £5.7m including the impacts of amortisation  
of the intangible assets which are recognised as a result of the business combination and writing off the pre-acquisition profit element of inventory written up  
on acquisition. Trading profit was £24.5m.
If this business combination had taken effect on 1 January 2014, it is estimated that Group total revenues would have been £2,110.0m and profit after  
tax £31.5m. This information is not necessarily indicative of the results had the operations been acquired at the start of the year, nor of future results of  
the combined operations.
The net cash flows resulting from business combinations are as follows:
£m Total
Cash consideration paid – Aeroflex and Axell 523.2
Net debt acquired 322.9
846.1
Costs of £21.4m were incurred in relation to business combinations. These costs are recognised within administrative expenses in the Income Statement and 
included within other acquisition related costs excluded from underlying profit as shown in note 2.
In the Group consolidated financial statements for the year to 31 December 2013, the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired for FBH were marked as provisional. 
Following further review the opening balance sheet has been amended to reflect an increase in trade and other payables of £1.8m, a decrease in current tax liabilities 
of £2.5m and an increase in deferred tax assets of £0.4m. Goodwill has therefore been adjusted accordingly.
29. Operating lease arrangements
At the balance sheet date the Group had outstanding commitments for minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating leases as follows:
£m 2014 2013
Within one year 41.8 26.0
Between one and two years 24.0 23.4
Between two and three years 23.3 21.0
Between three and four years 20.1 18.8
Between four and five years 16.2 16.3
After five years 53.6 63.4
179.0 168.9
Operating lease payments during the year totalled £27.3m (2013: £30.4m) including rental costs of £6.9m (2013: £7.1m) relating to operational aircraft used in  
the Group’s service businesses; the remainder primarily relates to the rental of office and operating facilities.
Operating lease commitments include £12.0m related to onerous leases which have been provided for at the balance sheet date.

30. Contingent liabilities
At 31 December 2014, the Company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising  
in the ordinary course of business. Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group 
consolidated financial statements.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to various legal proceedings and claims. Management do not anticipate that the outcome 
of these, either individually or in aggregate, would have a material adverse effect upon the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2014.
As notified in prior years, the Group has previously identified one, more significant, contractual breach dating back some years. The contract was in respect of goods 
provided into a geographic market which represents only a small amount of revenue for the Group. The circumstances surrounding this remain under review and 
neither the outcome nor timing of resolution can be estimated. No further information is disclosed as it could be prejudicial.
The nature of much of the contracting work done by the Group means that there are reasonably frequent contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that  
arise in the ordinary course of business, whose resolution is uncertain and could materially impact the Group’s future reported earnings. In particular, on fixed  
price development contracts, costs incurred and anticipated can significantly exceed amounts estimated at inception as a result of material enhancements to the 
specifications originally agreed under the contracts. Judgement is therefore required as regards the final costs of technical solutions, the outcome of negotiations 
with customers and the amounts recoverable under these contracts. . The Directors take account of the advice of experts in making these judgements and believe 
that the outcome of negotiations will result in an appropriate recovery of costs incurred in excess of original baselines.
On 24 February 2014 the Group voluntarily contacted the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) to inform it that Cobham had undertaken an initial internal 
investigation into potentially irregular sales practices concerning sales to Asia of certain commercial, non-classified products manufactured by TracStar Systems 
Inc..  This matter was satisfactorily concluded with the DoJ during the year with no material cost to the Group.
31. Related party transactions
Sales of goods to related parties were made on an arms length basis. No guarantees have been given to, or received from, related parties. No expense has been 
recognised for bad or doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties. Transactions between Group entities and joint ventures and associates  
during the year were as follows:
£m 2014 2013
Sales of goods – 0.4
Purchases of goods 1.0 0.3
Dividends received from joint ventures – (3.7)
Loan repayments and interest received from joint ventures – (3.0)
Compensation of key management personnel
Details of the compensation of key management personnel can be found in note 4. 
The Directors of Cobham plc had no material transactions with the Company during the year, other than as a result of service agreements.

Report on the Parent Company Financial Statements
Our opinion  
In our opinion, Cobham plc’s Parent Company Financial Statements  
(the financial statements):
 – Give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs  
as at 31 December 2014;
 – Have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom  
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 – Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the  
Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
Cobham plc’s financial statements comprise:
 – The Parent Company Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2014;
 – The Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders’ Funds for the year  
then ended; and
 – The notes to the financial statements, which include a summary  
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual 
Report and Accounts (the Annual Report), rather than in the notes to the 
financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements 
and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation  
of the financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Other required reporting 
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland)  
(ISAs (UK and Ireland)) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
 – Materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
 – Apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with,  
our knowledge of the Company acquired in the course of performing  
our audit; or
 – Otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and  
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – We have not received all the information and explanations we require for  
our audit; or
 – Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company,  
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches  
not visited by us; or
 – The financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration report – Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are  
not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out 
on page 68, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards  
for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to  
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK and Ireland). An audit 
involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the  
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud  
or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 – Whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 – The reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and 
 – The overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements,  
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis 
for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the 
effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the  
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired  
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group Financial Statements of Cobham plc

1. Parent Company accounting policies
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared on the going concern  
basis, under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation  
of derivative contracts which are held at fair value, and in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards in the  
United Kingdom (UK GAAP). 
The principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied,  
are as set out below.
Dividends 
Dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are 
fully authorised. Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders’ right  
to receive payment has been established.
Pensions
The Company operates and contributes to multi-employer defined benefit 
pension schemes. Contributions and pension costs are apportioned across the 
schemes as a whole and assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified 
actuaries. The schemes are closed to new members and have a high proportion 
of deferred and pensioner members from businesses that no longer participate 
in the schemes. The Company is therefore not able to identify its share of 
underlying assets and liabilities of the schemes on a reasonable and consistent 
basis and in accordance with the multi-employer exemption contained in  
FRS 1 7 Retirement Benefits, the schemes have been accounted for as if they 
were defined contribution schemes. The charge to the profit and loss account 
therefore reflects payments for the year. 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and 
loss account in the period the contributions are payable. 
The Company also makes contributions for certain employees to individual 
personal pension and stakeholder schemes. Contributions are charged to the 
profit and loss account in the year to which they relate.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have 
originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions  
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right  
to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable when, on the basis of all 
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be 
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on  
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date. Deferred tax has not been discounted.
Tangible fixed assets
Fixed assets are initially recognised at cost and depreciated on a straight-line 
basis to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives, which 
range from three to six years. 
Investments in Group and other undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision  
for impairment in value and include the fair value at the date of grant of share 
based payment awards for employees of subsidiary undertakings, net of 
amounts recovered as management charges.
Other investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that settlement will be 
required of an amount that can be reliably estimated.
Share capital
Ordinary share capital is classified as equity. Financial liabilities and equity 
instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
agreements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a 
residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Preference share capital is classified as a liability if it is redeemable on a specific 
date or at the option of the preference shareholders or if dividend payments 
are not discretionary. Dividends on preference share capital classified as 
liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account as interest expense. 
Treasury shares
When ordinary share capital recognised as equity is acquired by the Company, 
the shares are held as treasury shares. The consideration paid, including 
commissions and taxes, is deducted from retained earnings and total 
shareholders’ equity.
 
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company is sterling. 
Transactions in currencies other than sterling are translated at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in non-functional currencies are retranslated at the exchange 
rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
denominated in foreign currencies which are financed by foreign currency 
borrowings are translated at the year end exchange rate. Investments 
denominated in foreign currencies not financed by foreign currency 
borrowings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of  
the original transaction.
All exchange differences arising are taken to the profit and loss account. 
In order to manage the Company’s exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, 
the Company enters into forward contracts and options which are accounted 
for as derivative financial instruments. 
 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Company’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in  
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses  
foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to reduce these 
exposures and does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes. Other derivative financial instruments may be used from time to  
time to hedge other exposures such as inflation risks. 
The Company has documented its risk management objectives and strategy 
for undertaking various hedge transactions and utilises hedge accounting 
principles in relation to interest rate swaps. These are designated as cash flow 
hedges which mitigate the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates 
arising on floating rate debt. 
Foreign exchange contracts entered into to mitigate foreign exchange impacts 
of trading in non-functional currencies and inflation swaps entered into to 
mitigate inflation risks are not accounted for using hedge accounting. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the  
date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured  
at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends  
on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so,  
the nature of the item being hedged.
Where hedge accounting is applied, the relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items is documented at the inception of the 
transaction. The Company also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives used in hedging 
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows (or fair 
values if appropriate) of hedged items.
Where interest rate swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges,  
the effective portion of changes in fair values of derivatives that are designated 
and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in reserves. The gain or loss 
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements PARENT COMPANY 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cobham plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
121
www.cobham.com 
relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and 
loss account. Amounts accumulated in reserves are recycled to the profit and 
loss account in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a cash flow hedging derivative expires or is sold, or when a hedge no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in reserves at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the 
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the profit and loss account.  
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative  
gain or loss recognised in reserves is immediately transferred to the profit  
and loss account in that period.
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a current asset or  
liability except when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more  
than 12 months. 
Where hedge accounting is not applied, the movements in fair value of  
the derivative instruments are included in the profit and loss account.  
The fair value of such derivatives is classified as a current or non-current  
asset or liability dependent upon the maturity of the contracts.
Other financial instruments 
Amounts receivable from and owed to subsidiaries are recognised at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method and are reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently held at amortised cost. 
Interest is accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account 
using the effective interest rate method and is added to the carrying amount 
of the instrument to the extent that the expenses are not settled in the period 
in which they arise.
Share based payments
For grants made to employees of Cobham plc under the Group’s share based 
payment schemes, amounts which reflect the fair value of awards as at the 
time of grant are charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period. 
The vesting estimates are reviewed and updated at each balance sheet date; 
this includes progress against non-market related performance conditions.  
The fair value of share based payments awarded to employees of subsidiary 
undertakings, net of amounts recovered as management charges, is recognised 
as a capital contribution and recorded in investments.
The valuation of the awards utilises a methodology based on the Black-Scholes 
model, modified where required to allow for the impact of market related 
performance criteria and taking into account all non-vesting conditions.

3. Directors’ emoluments and pension costs
Disclosures in respect of Directors’ emoluments can be found in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 64 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Company operates and participates in the Cobham Pension Plan (CPP) 
and the Cobham Executive Pension Plan (CEPP). The pension schemes are of 
the defined benefit type and assets are held in separate trustee administered 
funds. The funds are valued every three years by a professionally qualified 
independent actuary and the rates of contribution payable are determined 
by the actuary. The latest effective dates of the actuarial assessments of  
the CPP and CEPP were 1 April 2012 and 1 April 2013 respectively. The 
assessments were updated to 31 December 2014, at which date the total  
net liabilities of the schemes were assessed to be £92.3m. The Directors will 
continue to monitor the pension deficits and take advice from independent 
actuaries as appropriate. 
The schemes have been accounted for as if they were defined contribution 
schemes and the charge to the profit and loss account therefore reflects 
payments for the year.
Contributions to the Group schemes for 2014 were £0.2m (2013: £0.3m) of 
normal funding and £9.1m (2013: £9.4m) of deficit funding. No contributions 
were outstanding at the end of 2014 or 2013.
Defined contribution pension schemes
The Company also operates and participates in the Cobham plc money 
purchase pension arrangements. The assets of the schemes are held separately 
from those of the Company in independently administered funds. The pension 
cost charged represents contributions payable by the Company to the funds 
and amounted to £0.9m (201 3: £1.0m). No contributions were outstanding  
at the end of 2014 or 201 3.
4. Share based payments
Employees of Cobham plc participate in the following equity settled share 
based payment schemes which are operated by the Group for certain  
senior executives:
 – the Cobham Performance Share Plan (PSP);
 – the Cobham Restricted Share Plan (RSP);
 – the Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS); and
 – the Cobham Bonus Co-investment Plan (BCP).
Employees also participate in the Cobham Savings Related Share Option 
Scheme (ShareSave) operated by the Group, which is open to all UK employees.  
The Company recognised a total charge of £1.5m (201 3: £2.2m credit) related  
to equity settled share based payment transactions during the year (excluding 
national insurance). This includes charges of £2.4m less a reversal of £0.9m  
of amounts charged in previous years due to the reassessment of assumptions 
during the year (201 3: £2.3m less £4.5m reversal). As shown in note 5, 
investments in Group and other undertakings have been adjusted by £0.4m, 
comprising £4.6m for awards granted to employees of the Company’s 
subsidiaries less £5.0m recharged during the year. 
At 31 December, the following awards were outstanding under each  
of the schemes:
Number of awards (thousands of shares) 2014 2013

The share based payment reserve relates to provisions made in accordance 
with FRS 20 for awards made to the Company’s employees under the Group’s

13. Contingent liabilities and commitments
The Company has contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual 
performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course  
of business entered into for, or on behalf of, certain Group undertakings. 
As the conditions of the above guarantees are currently being met,  
no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no provision has been  
made at the year end.
The Company had no capital commitments at 31 December 2014 (201 3: £nil).
14. Related party transactions
The Directors of Cobham plc had no material transactions with the  
Company during the year, other than as a result of service agreements.  
Details of the Directors’ remuneration are disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 64. 
Exemption has been taken under FRS 8 (revised) from disclosing related party 
transactions with wholly owned group companies. The only transactions with 
non-wholly owned subsidiaries relate to the receipt of management and brand 
charges totalling £1.2m (201 3: £1. 1m) from TEAM SA which is 98.7% owned.  
No amounts were outstanding at the current or prior year end.  Cobham plc

Further financial definitions
The following notes apply throughout the Annual Report and Accounts: 
To assist with the understanding of earnings trends, the Group has  
included within its published financial statements, non-GAAP measures 
including trading profit and underlying earnings results. Trading profit has  
been defined as operating profit from continuing operations excluding the 
impacts of business acquisition and divestment related activity and business 
restructuring costs as detailed below. Also excluded are changes in the  
marking to market of non-hedge accounted derivative financial instruments, 
impairments of intangible assets, and items deemed by the Directors to be  
of an exceptional nature. 
Business acquisition and divestment related items excluded from trading  
profit and underlying earnings include the amortisation of intangible assets 
recognised on acquisition, revaluation gains and losses arising on the original 
equity interests on stepped acquisitions, adjustments to businesses held for 
sale, the writing off of the pre-acquisition profit element of inventory written 
up on acquisition, other direct costs associated with business combinations  
and terminated divestments and adjustments to contingent consideration 
related to previously acquired businesses. Business restructuring costs relate  
to the restructuring of the Group’s portfolio which are incremental to normal 
operations. These relate to the integration of the Aeroflex businesses acquired 
in 2014 and the EiD programme.
Underlying earnings are defined as trading profit less net underlying finance 
costs, which excludes acquisition related items, and after deducting associated 
taxation and non-controlling interests.
Operating cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities before 
payment of tax, interest, restructuring costs and M&A related costs but after 
cash flows from the purchase or disposal of property, plant, equipment and 
intangible assets. Operating cash conversion is defined as operating cash flow 
as a percentage of trading profit, excluding profit from joint ventures.
Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities plus dividends 
received from joint ventures, less cash flows related to the purchase or disposal 
of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets but excluding payments 
relating to M&A related activities.
Net debt is defined as the net of borrowings less cash and cash equivalents at 
the balance sheet date. 
When providing sectoral analysis by geography, US revenue includes revenue 
to US based customers on programmes that could be designated as export  
and is therefore non-US defence/security from a market analysis perspective.
KPI definitions
Group organic revenue growth
Revenue growth stated at constant translation exchange rates, excluding  
the incremental effect of acquisitions and divestments.
Underlying EPS growth at constant translation exchange rates
The year-on-year increase in underlying profit after taxation, stated at  
constant translation exchange rates, divided by the weighted average  
number of ordinary shares.
Operating cash conversion
Operating cash flow as a percentage of trading profit, excluding profit  
from joint ventures.
Return on invested capital
Trading profit as a percentage of the average invested capital during the year.
Invested capital comprises net assets adjusted to exclude net debt, retirement 
benefit obligations, derivative financial instruments, current and deferred tax, 
provisions and other financial assets. Intangible assets recognised on business 
combinations are grossed up to their original cost before amortisation and an 
adjustment is also made to reinstate the historic goodwill previously written off 
directly to reserves.
PV investment
Private Venture (PV) or company funded Research and Development (R&D) 
measures exclude Aviation Services, where there is no R&D activity.
Staff safety – major accident incident rate
The number of accidents resulting in more than three days absence per 
100,000 employees.
Voluntary staff turnover

Grainger is currently the UK’s largest quoted
residential property owner and manager. We 
have, over many years, acquired a substantial
portfolio of property assets of varying types and
tenures. We are a long-term business and trade
our properties throughout market cycles. 
Established in Newcastle in 1912 to acquire and manage
tenanted residential properties, Grainger now owns 
over 14,000 homes in the UK and 4,000 in Germany. 
Our business has grown steadily over the years, most
signiﬁcantly in the 1970s and 80s when several large
industrial companies deregulated or denationalised 
and released their tenanted housing stocks. In 1983
Grainger ﬂoated on the London Stock Exchange.
Grainger has been a signiﬁcant player in residential
property for many years. While acquiring, managing and
selling properties remains fundamental to our business,
we have been actively developing complementary areas
which are now signiﬁcant contributors to our cash ﬂows
and proﬁts. Grainger today is a much broader-based 
and more dynamic business.
Teamwork is vital to our success. Only by working
closely across all our divisions to share our skills 
and experiences can we derive the best returns 
from our assets.
Grainger is a company that 
puts passion and energy
into everything we do. Our
people work together as 
a team. We have a culture
which encourages the 
sharing of information 
and a vision for the future.

WORKING TOGETHER
Our strategy We now hold a unique position in the 
UK residential market; that of being an owner, property
manager, trader, asset and fund manager. As a result, few
people understand the complexities and opportunities
of residential property as well as Grainger.
Acquiring, managing and selling residential tenanted
properties has always been at the heart of our business.
While the increase in property values over the long term 
has inevitably contributed to our growth, this builds on
astute buying founded on our local expertise. 
As well as growing this core business, we have developed
new income streams through exposure to other areas 
of the residential property market. For instance, Grainger
is now an emerging force in the development of
residential-led, mixed-use schemes; we are leaders in the
UK’s home reversion market, providing equity release for
elderly homeowners; we have launched and continue to
manage the largest UK market-let residential property fund;
and we have successfully replicated our business model 
in Germany, spreading the risk of our UK-based portfolio.
Our experience gives us a unique perspective that enables
us to see opportunities where others only see challenges.
Our ambition is to become one of Europe’s leading
quoted, integrated residential property companies. 
To achieve this, we aim to:
� provide superior risk-adjusted returns;
� maximise the efﬁciency of our capital structure 
by introducing third-party equity and debt through
residential property funds;
� enter new residential sectors where we can use 
our management skills and resources to build 
large portfolios;
� diversify income streams to include fund 
management fees alongside co-investment growth;
� continue to build on our unique position as 
a long-term holder, asset manager, trader and 
developer of residential property;
� use our skills and property network reputation 
to integrate developing, managing and funding; and
� encourage and capitalise on the growing recognition 
of residential property as an investment class. 
These aims are underpinned by our group-wide 
ethical way of doing business. This includes commitment
to integrity in all business relationships, employee
development, tenant care, environmental responsibility
and community service.

We are completely attuned to the markets 
in which we operate and how government 
policy could effect residential property. 
In addition, Grainger’s unique geographic 
coverage, owner/manager reputation and 
ability to innovate enables us to compete 
where others can’t.
We are determined to achieve our ambitious plans 
for growth, though in the current climate this will no
doubt prove more challenging and may take longer than
hoped. We will be guided by the overarching values that
have brought us success to date:
PASSION We approach every challenge with energy,
enthusiasm and an open mind. Our creative approach
helps us to see new ideas and opportunities where
others may only see obstacles.
PERFORMANCE We aim to continuously improve 
every aspect of our business, and appreciate that 
our investors and colleagues should expect nothing 
less. First-class performance demands hard work,
professionalism, teamwork and high-quality processes.
PRINCIPLES Our business is not in commodities 
but in people’s homes and aspirations. So we never
forget we have a responsibility to individuals, to the
environment and to society as a whole. We have 
a proud reputation to maintain and a strong legacy 
to leave behind.
what makes Grainger successful?  9
We are eager to achieve our vision through careful
evolution of our business model. We stand by the values
that have made us successful. Ours is a transparent
approach and we believe that meaningful relationships
with all of our stakeholders are essential. Teamwork is
also vital to our cause, working across our divisions to
ensure we derive the maximum returns from all of our
assets and interests.

what we do...
We have a well ﬁnanced, 
unique portfolio of residential
properties and investments 
and a rare, skilled workforce 
to be proud of. This effective
combination delivers value 
from our assets.
Our portfolio We own, either directly or with co-investors,
a substantial value of residential property assets, in the
UK and Germany. Our portfolio of properties subject 
to regulated tenancies in itself is worth over £1.2bn.
Most of our assets are reversionary in nature. This means
that there is an inherent gain outside of normal capital
appreciation or rent which will be delivered through
vacancy or from work that we do, for example, obtaining
planning permission.
Our assets and interests are efﬁciently ﬁnanced using
both debt and equity to give investors one of relatively
few current opportunities to invest in a geared 
residential company.
More recently we have broadened our business to
include management fee income. We do this by applying
our honed skills and experiences, to manage property 
on behalf of other people – generally funds and ventures
in which we hold a signiﬁcant stake. Annualised income 
is now running at some £7m per annum and has been
generated with very little incremental cost due to the
sheer scalability of our platform.

Core portfolio 
REGULATED We currently own some 7,600 regulated residential properties
valued at over £1.2bn, and these remain central to our portfolio. These assets
provide signiﬁcant and predictable cash ﬂows of over £100m per annum –
from rents and from proceeds received when they are sold.
A regulated tenancy gives security of tenure – the right for the tenant to stay
in the property for the rest of their lives. The rent is set independently and 
is less than the market rate for similar properties. Due to changes in the law,
no regulated tenancies have been created since 1989. This gives us predictable
vacancies and therefore sales, as our tenants get older. While inevitably this
portfolio will decline, it will continue to be a major contributor to our business
for some time. We do aim to buy as many of these assets as returns and
availability allow. Properties subject to regulated tenancies can be acquired at
a discount to the ordinary property value (known as vacant possession value).
On vacancy, we sell the properties to realise both the discount (which we 
call the reversion) and any house price inﬂation from the date we originally
bought them. We therefore realise high margins on sale. 
We are protected against some of the risks associated with the residential
market, such as short-term or localised falls in house prices, by the size 
and geographical spread of our portfolio, and the fact that we buy and 
sell properties over long periods of time. The regulated portfolio also has 
low exposure to top-end volatility. Currently the average vacant possession
value of our regulated stock is £205,000 per unit (£182,000 in 2006) with
60% of our properties valued below £250,000. Further, these properties are
typically unmodernised and appeal to ﬁrst-time buyers and those hoping to
create value on renovation. This keeps them in demand.
ASSURED These are residential properties let at market rates on assured
shorthold tenancy (‘AST’) agreements, typically of six months to a year. 
In the year to September 2006 we transferred a large number of our ASTs 
to G:res1, the fund we subsequently launched this year. Increasingly we are
purchasing regulated tenancies in portfolios which also contain ASTs. We will
either hold these for ongoing capital growth, or trade them over a relatively
short period, depending on how we believe returns can be maximised.

WORKING TOGETHER
Joint ventures continued
The portfolio now consists of 1,641 units in eight blocks in central London.
Grainger provides asset management services while Genesis handles day-to-
day property management. Over the coming year we aim to identify strategic
opportunities to increase returns through appropriate refurbishment and
individual sales.
Funds
Fund management is an integral part of Grainger’s evolving business model. 
It adds another layer of leverage to our operations, allowing us to generate
fees from the skills of the people we employ. In this way our returns are no
longer derived only from the properties directly and our return on capital is
enhanced. We believe that by following this model our group will be worth
more than the sum of its parts. 
G:res1 Established in November 2006, the G:res1 fund is a Jersey-based
company that invests primarily in market-let residential properties in the 
UK. Grainger is a co-investor in the fund, which is independently managed 
and controlled. The fund was set up to capitalise on the growing
attractiveness of residential property as an investment class. Investors are
currently a broad mix of UK and overseas institutions. The fund’s initial
portfolio included 1,480 units in 38 blocks across the UK. 
In March 2007, acting on our advice, the fund acquired a 700-unit portfolio
consisting of properties predominately located to the east of the City of
London. The fund now holds 2,155 individual units in 56 unbroken clusters 
of property, with a market value totalling £435m. 90% of these are in London
and the South East. The fund is aiming to acquire further assets over the
coming year, and make strategic sales, while refurbishing other properties.
As adviser and asset and property manager, we earn fees for delivering
returns. As a co-investor, we beneﬁt from the resulting dividends and growth.
ResPUT (The Schroders Residential Property Unit Trust) ResPUT is a
specialist residential fund which provides investors with almost ungeared
exposure to the UK residential market. The fund is managed by Schroders
Property Managers (Jersey) Limited and advised by Grainger. We also manage
the property on a day-to-day basis. The fund aims to combine a high-quality
income yield with above average prospects for capital growth. It has gross
assets of just under £100m, and Grainger currently owns a 22% stake 
valued at approximately £20m. Capital is recycled through strategic sales 
and astute acquisitions.

Retirement solutions
Our retirement solutions business has more than doubled in size over the
year. We have recognised that not all people will choose to release equity 
in their homes in retirement, but some will prefer other housing solutions. 
As a result we have begun to broaden our offering and now own in excess 
of 1,000 retirement apartments. 
We have maintained our 40% share of the home reversion market. Under a
home reversion plan, an individual or couple sells Grainger part or all of their
home in return for a cash lump sum which is dependent upon the value of
the property, the proportion being sold and the age(s) of the homeowner(s). 
The occupiers are then able to remain in their property rent-free for the
remainder of their lives. Bridgewater, Grainger’s own brand, offers a ﬂexible
reversion plan which as an alternative to a single lump sum, offers an
escalating release or a series of cash payments. 
The property is purchased at a discount to the vacant possession value of 
the property (the selling price without a tenant in situ). Similarly to regulated
property, this provides a reversion, which is realised on ultimate sale of the
property, when the tenant vacates. The reversion is greater on a home
reversion than on a regulated property since there is typically no rent at 
all on a home reversion.
The home reversion market became regulated by the FSA in April 2007.
Against demanding deadlines we achieved regulation from the outset, a hurdle
not achieved by some. We believe that regulation is a catalyst for growth in
the industry, placing it on a level footing with lifetime mortgages, the most
popular method of equity release.
As well as using the Bridgewater brand, we source home reversions through 
a distribution agreement with Norwich Union and many ﬁnancial advisors. 
We also aim to acquire more mature portfolios through our extensive
property network.
We expect continued growth in this market as more people seek to release
cash to supplement their pensions, improve their lifestyles or realise their dreams.
The ﬁnal major constituent of our retirement solutions business is the
CHARM portfolio which we acquired early in 2007 for £135m. This is a
portfolio of equity mortgages, where the mortgage is repaid as a proportion
of the sales proceeds rather than as the amount of the loan originally
borrowed. Interest, which grows with rpi, is also received.

German market-let
We entered Germany, Europe’s largest residential market, in 2006, in order 
to replicate our business model in a market that was behind the UK in levels
of home ownership. As Germany continues to deregulate its housing, major
portfolios of reversionary property are becoming available. This has made 
the market very attractive to investors and since 2002, €25bn has been
invested in 600,000 units. The tenant-friendly laws and controlled rents attract
professional landlords. The relatively low price per unit provides potential for
signiﬁcant capital growth.
As single occupancy continues to grow and the supply of new housing is
diminishing, we believe there will be a growing demand for quality housing.
We have targeted the more afﬂuent regions and concentrated on higher
quality properties that suit owner occupation, rather than only focusing on
yield. Our background as a long-term residential property owner differentiates
us from the many purely ﬁnancial purchasers in this market.
We now own approximately 4,500 homes in Germany, worth £242m. 
The tenants have security of tenure similar to regulated tenancies in the UK.
We will continue to work with local partners, looking for strategic expansion
opportunities. We also intend to seek third-party equity so we can apply our
co-investment fund management model.
Our Mannheim ofﬁce currently employs seven staff who advise on
acquisitions and asset management. We currently outsource the day-to-day
management of the portfolio to local agents.

Development
This business aims to create mixed-use developments with a signiﬁcant
residential element. Current programmes consist of nearly 7,000 residential
homes with 2 million sq. ft. of commercial space, including healthcare facilities,
schools and nurseries, sports and recreational facilities, a community theatre
and a cemetery. 
Our philosophy is simple and responsible. We take a long-term interest in 
the communities we create and are committed to their sustainability. We 
also promote the beneﬁts of good design, with schemes that really take into
account the way people actually live, which of course, ensures a demand for
the homes. 
We are not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom. We also aim to
maintain an open and straightforward relationship with all parties involved. 
We have recently strengthened the management team with bases in both
London and Newcastle to ensure good geographical coverage. Our strategy 
is to reduce our development risk by focusing on larger long-term residential-
led schemes, in project-speciﬁc joint venture partnership with others. Current
projects in the pipeline, valued by their expected end development value,
include £324m with planning consent and £485m without. 
Joint venture with Development Securities
CURZON PARK Curzon Park is a 10-acre site in central Birmingham, acquired
for £33.5m in December 2006 through a collaborative (50/50) agreement
with Development Securities plc. The site will be developed over six to 
eight years to create up to 800,000 sq. ft. of ofﬁces, 400,000 sq. ft. of homes,
a 180-bed hotel, 20,000 sq. ft. of retail space and parking for 1,500 cars. 
The development will cost over £300m which will be appropriately ﬁnanced.
A planning application was submitted in summer 2007 and it is expected 
that work will begin on-site in early 2008.

how we do it...
Working together is
fundamental to our success.
When our people direct their
varied skills, experiences 
and professionalisms to
supplement those of others, 
the consequent lateral 
creativity and inspiration
delivers results.
Our people We pride ourselves on recruiting and
retaining outstanding people who are individual experts
and great team players. We encourage an entrepreneurial
culture where everyone feels they can make a signiﬁcant
contribution to the business, as well as be rewarded by it. 
59% of our staff are shareholders in Grainger and 
our permanent staff retention for the year October
2006 to September 2007 was 90.1% against a national
average of 84.3%.
For Grainger, investing in people means giving staff 
the opportunity to develop both as employees and
individuals. We believe in building the business with 
them, and our people development activities are guided
by a mix of business objectives and individual needs.
Twice-yearly reviews ensure everyone understands 
their role, and the impact they can make on the 
overall business.
During 2008, we intend to introduce a number of
learning and development initiatives for our employees.
These will include a management development
programme, tailored to relevant individuals. We aim 
to become the employer of choice in our market 
by connecting our people strategy, values and HR 
policies to reinforce and promote our distinctive culture.
We aim to be a high-performance team of like-minded
experts who share a common vision for growth.

WORKING TOGETHER
We restructured our management and teams 
during the year. The key change made was to
create a ‘residential’ team, separate from ‘property
services’. The division of their responsibilities 
is described below, alongside those of our 
other teams.
FINANCING The success of our group is not only
dependent upon the performance of our assets, but 
also how effectively we fund them. 
The bulk of our funding comes from the debt markets
but during the year, we introduced £159m of third-party
equity (through G:res1) and entered the capital markets
with the launch of a seven-year convertible bond. This
raised c. £110m at a rate of 3.625% and a conversion
price of £8.64. Our expansion into Germany has been
funded by new euro facilities, to ensure a natural hedge.
We believe it is necessary to refresh and update our
borrowings and take innovative opportunities as they arise. 
Our traditional bank debt is made up of a combination
of term loans and revolving facilities with varying maturity
dates, currently all in excess of two years. We have a
‘club’ of banks, most of whom we have had relationships
with for a number of years. Our covenants, which include
a loan to value test and a cash cover over interest are
relatively generous. Our core business in particular, is
very cash generative, and this gives us the ability to pay
down debt quickly if necessary. Further, the loan to value
calculation uses the current market value of our assets.
This has an in-built reversion, so there is an additional layer
of comfort not immediately apparent. We have a policy
of hedging the interest rate on at least two thirds of our
debt, keeping our hedging instruments separate from 
the facilities. We use a combination of swaps and caps.
RESIDENTIAL This team has two key responsibilities:
Portfolio, corporate and individual acquisitions both 
in our established markets and also to capitalise on
potential growth areas by deﬁning residential in a wider
sense, e.g. caravan parks, serviced apartments. This requires
astute awareness of changing markets, a wide network 
of contacts and high-calibre, creative thinking; and
Strategy-setting/decision-making at a portfolio/fund
level including buy and sell decisions for capital recycling
and on refurbishment programmes intended to increase
rental yield and/or capital values.
PROPERTY SERVICES In total there are just over 
100 people working in this team, in six of our seven 
UK ofﬁces. Their work falls into two major categories:
Property management covers the day-to-day 
operational running of the properties including rent
reviews and renewals, reducing voids, repairs and
maintenance, refurbishment, block management,
commercial, lettings and customer care. With more 
than 19,000 UK properties belonging to ﬁve different
owners, it is essential that not only their operational work
is of a high standard, but that they also give value-added
recommendations based on their local knowledge; and
Sales and valuations includes completing day-to-day sales
of 12 properties every week, valuing properties which
have been identiﬁed by the residential team for potential
purchase and also carrying out our year-end valuation of
every property that Grainger owns directly.
RETIREMENT SOLUTIONS The roles in our retirement
solutions team vary from that of actuarial to customer
relations. In particular, success within the home reversion
market depends on the following three factors:
Product innovation Our own Bridgewater brand includes
a ﬂexible reversion alternative. Our team monitors the
success of this by reference to, for example, the number
of enquiries which result in the purchase of a property.
We seek to be at the forefront of any emerging products; 23

WORKING TOGETHER
Distribution It is critical to reach as many potential
customers as possible and marketing is key. We have
individual relationships with ﬁnancial advisers and an
online system that allows those advisers to access cases
and pricing day or night. We also have an important
agreement with Norwich Union who offer our home
reversions alongside its own lifetime mortgages. As a
group, we price the plan, acquire the property, manage
the property and undertake the sale on vacancy. We 
also acquire existing portfolios of home reversion assets,
which are actuarially priced based on market valuations
of the properties; and 
Regulation Since April 2007 home reversions have 
been regulated by the FSA. We employ compliance
and education staff who ensure that our operations 
are of the exacting standards required and all reporting 
is completed on time. 
We are very proud to have been recently awarded 
‘Best Home Reversion Provider’ for the second year
running at the prestigious Mortgage Solutions Awards.
Our staff are also involved in setting up lifetime leases 
on our new retirement properties and monitoring the
performance of our CHARM investment.
DEVELOPMENT Our development team works closely
with local authorities, communities, joint venture partners
and all other relevant stakeholders. It also makes the
most of the knowledge and expertise within our other
divisions to design buildings that can be managed
efﬁciently. Our people are strong negotiators and 
their speciﬁc responsibilities include:
� acquisition of land suitable for regeneration, 
often through tender;
� ﬁnancial modelling of possible design variations;
� gaining planning permission;
� project management;
� selling developments, wholesale or individual 
units; and
� hand-over for ongoing management.
SUPPORT SERVICES Our support services cover all 
the areas expected in a FTSE 250 company. Above all
they strive to constantly improve the ways they work, 
by increased automation as well as better methods.
Finance look after our management accounting and
ﬁnancial reporting, treasury, tax, internal audit, credit
control, invoice processing, service charge accounting 
and insurance. The requirements for efﬁcient funding, 
tax management and meaningful and timely ﬁnancial
information are rightly demanding; 
IT supports a vast array of applications and systems. 
Our systems and communications are vital to the running
of our operations and our team have both proactive
development and reactive support responsibilities;
HR helps us to attract and retain the very best people.
Our team ensures that our policies and practices, and
salaries and beneﬁts are competitive. In addition, they 
are responsible for learning and development, ensuring 
it is aligned to our business objectives; and
Corporate affairs is responsible for internal and external
communications (except investor relations) as well as
corporate responsibility (see page 45). Their aim is to
build a stronger brand and ensure our public relations
activity is controlled and focussed. 
GROUP There are some functions which are operated
centrally within the business, which we describe as group
functions. These include:
Investor relations which is predominantly carried out by
the executive directors and includes many meetings with
shareholders and analysts;
Company secretarial is responsible for compliance with
the Companies Act and the Listing Rules, as well as value-
added activities such as board evaluation and share plan
administration; and
Governance describes the board’s strategy setting as well
as monitoring and control. 26 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007

Overview Conditions over the ﬁnancial year have generally been favourable
and we have increased our gross property asset base to £2.5bn from £2.0bn
in 2006. The increase has come from both revaluation uplifts (our UK portfolio
has shown an uplift of 9.8%) and from acquisitions. In total we spent £614m
on property assets in the year, including the major corporate and portfolio
acquisitions of CHARM, The Capital Appreciation Trust and The Tilt Estate. 
The year-end value of our retirement solutions business has grown to £542m
and we are pleased with our progress in Germany where we now own over
4,500 units worth £242m. Capital recycling through the successful launch of
our G:res1 fund and prudent debt raising in the early part of the year have
meant that this growth has been achieved at sensible loan to value ratios
(53% at 30 September 2007) whilst maintaining a valuable liquidity position –
our headroom on our lending facilities at the year end amounted to £226m.
Results In the light of evolving practice of accounts presentation under IFRS,
we have conducted a review of the classiﬁcation of our property assets. This
has involved reclassifying a small proportion of those assets (4%) from trading
stock to investment property or vice versa. The main impact has been that
the revaluation surplus of £23.5m taken through the 2006 income statement
on the transfer of assets to the Jersey Property Unit Trust (‘JPUT’) (that 
forms part of G:res1) has instead been taken through retained earnings at 
the beginning of that year net of tax of £7.0m. There is no change to market
value net asset value measures or to business cash ﬂows. Our 2006 ﬁgures
have been restated accordingly and further details are given in the ﬁnancial
review section of this report.
Proﬁt before tax has increased by 62% to £77.5m from £47.7m (restated),
the principal driver of this being an improved contribution from our associates
and joint ventures (up to £40.6m from £0.4m). 
Operating proﬁt (before fair value movements and goodwill impairment) 
has increased to £89.0m from £81.5m, largely due to improvements in trading
proﬁts from our core business. 
Gross net asset value per share (‘Gross NAV’) has increased by 22.3% 
to 828p from 677p and there are similar improvements in our other NAV
measures: Triple net asset value (‘NNNAV’) up 25.8% to 613p from 487p 
and base case Grainger NAV up 23.0% to 732p from 595p. Details of the
calculations of these are given in the ﬁnancial review. 
Return on shareholders’ equity has increased to 27.1% from 26.5%.
chairman’s statement In my ﬁrst year as chairman of Grainger, 
I am pleased to report another year of strong progress and
signiﬁcant achievement in our three emerging business lines that
complement our core residential regulated tenancy business.
STRATEGY
ROBIN BROADHURST
Chairman 30 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
We are again increasing our dividend by 10% (our 13th consecutive year of
increased dividends) with the result that the board are recommending a ﬁnal
dividend of 4.12p per share. Together with the interim dividend of 2.06p per
share paid on 16 July 2007, this will produce a total dividend for the year of
6.18p per share (2006: 5.62p). At this level the dividend is covered 7.7 times
(2006: 4.6 times). If approved the ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 18 February
2008, to shareholders on the register on 18 January 2008.
Strategy The group’s goal is to maintain and consolidate its position as the
UK’s leading quoted residential property company. It is proud of its core
property management services model which is at the heart of the business
and seeks to deliver a personal and caring service to its many tenants.
Expanding and continuing the successful delivery of this service model will
allow the group to expand and diversify its offerings, particularly in the ﬁelds
of fund management and development, but operating within the residential
arena utilising the experience gained over its long history.
We believe this goal will continue to deliver consistent long-term growth 
in results and in dividends to our shareholders. We are developing a mix of
residential businesses away from our previous heavy reliance on regulated
tenancies. Following the Housing Act 1988, the number of these tenancies will
reduce over the next 10 years as this type of structure gradually disappears.
Historically the business has been largely centred on the ownership and
trading of these large-scale residential portfolios of regulated tenancies.
Returns have been generated through rental income and, more signiﬁcantly,
from capturing reversionary surpluses on sales when the properties fall
vacant. These returns have been enhanced by a cautious approach to
acquisition, the application of rigorous management, growth in house prices
and by appropriate levels of ﬁnancial gearing. In recent years we have used
our cash generation and property management platform in the residential
sector to enable us to capture a wider range of assets.
This expansion and diversiﬁcation has enabled us to become market leaders
in three residential sectors; the ownership of properties subject to regulated
tenancies, providers of home reversions and residential fund management. 
This latter activity, in particular, produces an income stream not reliant on 
the direct ownership of property and at low incremental cost. We have 
also widened our risk and return exposure by increasing our involvement 
in residential development and by entering the German residential market.
Board changes At the beginning of May, we welcomed Henry Pitman as a
non-executive director. He was previously chief executive of Tribal Group Plc
and his experience, which includes both property and government-related
housing business, will be of great assistance to the board.

My personal thanks go to Robert Dickinson from whom I took over as
chairman at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in February. 
His long service and contribution to the growth of the group has been
previously recorded, but his help and guidance in the handover of the
chairmanship was hugely appreciated.
Outlook Whilst residential house prices continued to rise through this
ﬁnancial year, the listed property sector (including real estate investment
trusts) fell by more than 20%, largely fuelled by the sentiment that the rapid
rises of recent years are unsustainable. This has now proved to be the case
and there is little doubt that the next year will be a challenging one both for
the sector and for Grainger. Notwithstanding this, recent evidence suggests
that properties in our portfolio are continuing to sell at or slightly above
current valuation levels. Grainger’s average house price in its core portfolio 
is £205,000 and the portfolio is geographically diverse. In light of this and 
our limited exposure to new build ﬂats in city centres (the area we expect 
to be the most difﬁcult in the coming months), we believe that we are
relatively well protected from the slowdown in the current market. 
Going forward, we see good opportunities in continuing to apply our 
own variety and blend of skills to different residential asset classes. Where
appropriate, we will introduce third-party capital to enhance our returns 
and reduce our direct balance sheet exposure. This may be in the form 
of joint ventures (for example, along the lines of Grainger GenInvest 
and Curzon Park) or in co-investing funds (G:res1). 
This will not be the ﬁrst period of more challenging market conditions 
that the company has weathered in its long history. Our experience,
combined with the more diversiﬁed business model we now have in place,
gives us conﬁdence in our positioning and prospects. We plan to continue 
our long-standing prudent approach towards acquisitions and liquidity and
believe that our spread of activities will give us resilience and increase our
long-term growth prospects to create shareholder value.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Grainger for 
the welcome and help that they have given me in my ﬁrst nine months as
chairman. Their commitment and enthusiasm will serve the company and 
its shareholders well in the future.
ROBIN BROADHURST Chairman 18 December 2007
STRATEGY
We see good opportunities 
in continuing to apply our

to different residential asset
classes. Widening our spread 
of activities will give us both
resilience as well as increase 
our long-term growth
prospects. 32 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
Market review There has been much recent debate over the state of the 
UK housing market and the impact that recent events in the world credit
markets, triggered by events in the US subprime sectors, will have in the
future. Many indicators point to a slowdown in the rate of house price
growth – in particular, falling levels of mortgage approvals, falls in certain
house price indices and slowing sales volumes from house builders.
Commentators vary between predictions of a severe fall in actual house
prices (as was the case in the early 1990s) and a soft landing where price
growth slows and possibly stagnates for a period.
Our view is that rates of house price growth are fundamentally determined by
two factors: the balance between supply and demand and levels of affordability. 
The UK is currently suffering from long-term imbalance between the supply
of housing stock and the amount required to support the increasing number
of households. In the ﬁrst seven years of this century, UK housing completions
averaged 166,000 per annum. Government initiatives have been announced 
to increase this level of supply to 240,000 (recently increased from 200,000)
per annum by 2016. Set against this are population forecasts indicating that
the UK population will rise from 60.6 million in 2006 to 65 million in 2016.
More importantly, the trends of immigration, an ageing population and an
increasing number of single person households will lead to an additional
requirement of 209,000 households per year to 2026. This is a continuation 
of the trend that has seen the numbers of households increase by 30% in 
the last three decades of the 20th Century – matched by a fall in the level 
of new housing built over the same period of 50%. It remains to be seen
whether, given the current planning environment, increased availability will 
be able to absorb both existing and future demand. 
As well as the imbalance at a total stock level, of equal importance is the
limited supply for the right type of dwelling at the right price in the right
location. For example, London and the South East has limited availability and
great levels of wealth generation. This has produced some of the largest price
increases we have seen over the last few years which, we believe, will help 
to sustain the market in this area for some time to come. We have some 
55% by value of our portfolio in this region.
Conversely, there appears to be oversupply in certain provincial cities of, 
in particular, recently built one- or two-bedroom city centre apartments
primarily built for the buy to let market. We have kept out of these more
speculative markets and therefore have virtually no exposure to this sector. 
RUPERT DICKINSON Chief executive
chief executive’s review 
STRATEGY 33
The second key factor is the level of affordability, with many commentators pointing to the impact
this had on the housing market in the early 1990s. There are two main differences between that
period and now. Firstly, base rates between mid-1988 and mid-1992 did not drop below 10% 
and, at their peak, mortgage rates were approaching 17%. Current base rates are at 5.5%, having
fallen 0.25% since the time of our preliminary announcement. Secondly, the economic situation 
is far more robust – GDP at 3.3% in Q3 2007 (above the average long-term rate of 2.5%) and
employment levels are at a record high (in 1992 unemployment approached three million). 
One of the key measures of affordability is the ability of households to meet their normal
expenditure once they have paid all their housing costs. Research indicates that, whilst income net
of housing costs still exceeds household spend, the surplus is narrowing as a result of increased
mortgage costs arising from rate rises. The unwinding of relatively cheap ﬁxed rate loans may 
well reduce it further in the coming months but not to levels that would be likely to precipitate 
a severe correction in house prices. 
Consequently, whilst we are planning for a period of slower house price growth and are therefore
being more cautious in our acquisitions, we do not expect a wholesale and signiﬁcant fall in prices
in the short term. However, our long-term model can withstand short-term price ﬂuctuations and
we believe that the wide geographic spread, low average price and reversionary potential in our
portfolio will enable it to continue to deliver enhanced returns. 
Although the volume of transactions is relatively small, since the year-end sales values achieved 
on vacancy have exceeded our September vacant possession values by 4.0%.
Risk review The key risks to the Grainger business are:
• a severe long-term downturn in the UK housing market;
• signiﬁcant increases in interest rates; and
• a lack of availability of ﬁnance.
Dealing with each of these in turn:
Housing market We have assembled our unique residential portfolio over a signiﬁcant period 
of time and its current market value is substantially greater than cost. Moreover, much of the
portfolio is reversionary and the value that we will obtain by selling on vacancy currently exceeds
market value by over £600m (the ‘reversionary surplus’). 
The nature of our portfolio is inherently defensive in times of house price slowdown. It is
geographically diverse and, whilst one of its long-term strengths is a signiﬁcant exposure to the
high demand areas of London and the South East, we are not overly exposed to cluster risk. 
In other areas, house price growth tends to follow the South East but, coming from a lower base,
can show dramatic levels of increase. 
STRATEGY 34 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
The majority of our properties are unrefurbished and of relatively low value. This level of
affordability is a key element of continued and sustained demand for our properties when they
become available for sale. Our average vacant possession value is £205,000 (the UK average 
is £198,000) and 60% of the portfolio is below £250,000. Our exposure to the higher end 
of the market (>£500,000) which traditionally shows greater volatility is restricted to some 
279 properties out of our total UK-owned portfolio of over 14,000 units. We have found that
demand for our typical properties (affordable and offering potential for value appreciation 
through refurbishment) is resilient even in times of market slowdown. 
Operationally we manage our exposure to house price inﬂation by constant reviews of the
portfolio to ensure that we crystallise gains to maximise returns at the right time. We are also
diversifying our income streams (for example, fund management income) and our geographic
spread (investment in Germany) to spread risk.
Interest rates Our exposure to adverse interest rate movements is limited by adopting a prudent
hedging policy. At 30 September 2007, over 70% of group debt was hedged by being either ﬁxed
or subject to caps or swaps. The hedging instruments used and the ﬁxed rate debt have a variety
of maturity dates giving protection over the medium term.
Availability of ﬁnance At 30 September the group’s headroom amounted to £226m and the
average maturity of our debt was six years. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant maturity (a revolving facility of
£400m) is not until June 2010.
We guard against lack of liquidity by constantly recycling capital; for example, we raised £282m 
of third-party funding through equity and debt raising in the G:res1 fund during the course of 
the year.
The core business in particular is very cash generative – gross rents and property sales amounted
to £165m in the year. Whilst we spent £151m on new acquisitions, the vast majority of this can 
be stopped in adverse market conditions. Consequently we are able to reduce gearing levels and
improve liquidity quickly by cutting back on purchases if necessary. 
As explained above, the low value, unrefurbished nature of our portfolio means that it is very
liquid and easily realisable.
Operating review
General Despite the repercussions of the credit crunch in the banking markets in late summer, the
UK residential market showed strong levels of growth to the end of September – the Nationwide
and Halifax House Price indices recording gains of 9.0% and 10.7% respectively. Several regions
showed growth of over 15%, in particular Greater London at 18.6%.
Our own portfolio, with some 55% by value in London and the South East, showed an average
increase of 9.8%.

Development 4% Focused on relatively large scale residential or residential-led

Trading performance in this division has been strong. Although the number of units sold has
declined from 787 to 661, as explained below, sales proceeds have increased marginally from
£126m to £128m, reﬂecting higher average values achieved (£193,000 compared to £160,000).
Margins on normal sales (i.e. when a property is sold on vacancy) have also improved from 
48.6% to 50.7%.
The number of sales has declined because we have made fewer investment sales (when a 
property is sold with a tenant in situ), down to 86 at a gross sales value of £17.2m and proﬁt 
of £9.7m, from 224 at a value of £31.3m and a proﬁt of £13.0m in 2006.
STRATEGY 36 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
This is a trading portfolio and, as such, we make a number of these sales as a result of active
portfolio management where we feel that returns would not be signiﬁcantly enhanced by waiting
for vacancy in the usual way. The level of investment sales has been relatively high in recent years
as we have worked through assets acquired in major portfolios. We would expect the volumes 
to continue to decline in the future as this process is completed. 
We have been pleased with the levels of acquisitions in the year, enhanced by two major corporate
transactions. Firstly, The Tilt Estate Company Limited, bought for £48m and comprising a mixed

We have retained our market leadership in the writing of home reversion plans, with a 40% market
share at 30 September 2007*. Of particular note has been our achievement in obtaining regulated
status from the Financial Services Authority in April of this year. This puts home reversion plans 
on a level footing with other equity release products which were regulated by virtue of being
mortgages. Although there was some market disruption during the period approaching the
regulation deadline, leading to a slowdown in acquisitions, we believe that, in the long term,
regulation will be a key factor in the continuing success of not only our business, but the home
reversion market in general. 
In the period, we sold interests in 139 home reversion property assets for £14.9m and recorded 
a proﬁt of £7.4m (2006: 110 assets for £12.5m and a proﬁt of £5.7m).
We have made signiﬁcant progress in building this business in the year, investing a total of £252m
on 2,899 assets (2006: £29m on 432 assets). These included the major acquisitions of the CHARM
portfolio (a ﬁnancial interest in some 1,287 equity mortgages from the Church Commissioners 
for £135m) and The Capital Appreciation Trust (Isle of Man) plc (‘CAT’) which comprises 911
sheltered housing units for £72m. This latter acquisition is signiﬁcant in that it enhances our product
offering in this sector, giving us the opportunity to provide more ﬂexible tenure alternatives from
rental and lifetime lease through to shared equity. 
Operating contribution from this division amounted to £8m (2006: £3m).

STRATEGY 37
This division has made signiﬁcant progress in the year, the highlight being the close of G:res1, our
market-rented fund. Total third-party investment in the fund stands at £159m, representing 78.4%
and investors include Mitsubishi Corporation, Achmea, APP , British Airways Pensions Fund, FF&P ,
LGPI, Nomura, Norsk Hydro, Storebrand, Swiss Re and the Universities Superannuation Scheme.
The fund itself grew considerably in the year with the acquisition of the Ability Portfolio (700 units
in East London for £205m) and NAV grew by 14% in the period from launch in November 2006
to the end of June 2007. 
Grainger GenInvest, our joint venture with Genesis Housing Group, has also shown strong growth
on the back of the London house price market – average increases in the value of the portfolio
amount to 24.7% and the value of our total investment has increased from £10m to £40m.
Including amounts lent by Grainger to the joint venture of £68m (2006: £58m) our total
investment is £108m (2006: £68m). 
Annualised fee income from our fund and property management activities now stands at £7m.
The contribution from this division (being share of proﬁts, dividends received, fee income and
share of revaluation surpluses in the year) amounted to £40m (2006: £5m).
We hope that current market conditions alongside political and social imperatives will mean that
the government and local authorities have to look more favourably towards the professional
private rented sector as a potential partner in providing some of the new housing supply to 2016.
We are engaged in this debate and are conﬁdent that the model we are creating will be well
placed to respond to any initiatives that are introduced.
Property services This division carries out the asset and day-to-day property management of 
our core portfolios and those of our co-invested funds. The division also now includes our lettings
team and regional sales and valuations. In this way we can provide a consistent level of service 
to each of the portfolios we manage.

We have been building our team and reﬁning our strategy for development so that it is more
aligned to the long-term ownership model of the group. We intend to continue to sell assets to
the open market to assist in generating cash ﬂows for the group, whilst also retaining some stock.
Good progress has been achieved on all major development sites during 2007. 
In particular, at Newlands (West Waterlooville) we obtained a resolution to grant planning for the
development of 100,000 sq. metres of commercial space and 1,550 new homes. In addition the
adopted Hampshire County Structure plan includes a reserve allocation for a further 1,000 units.
We are currently in the process of agreeing the Section 106 agreement and hope to start on
infrastructure work in the latter part of 2008. This is an exemplar scheme where we will be
directly involved in some of the construction and in the long-term management of the estate. 
We expect the ﬁrst house sales to commence in the ﬁnancial year ending 2009.

We have made signiﬁcant advances in our European operation, in particular the opening of our
Mannheim asset and property management business, which now employs seven members of staff.
Whilst increasing interest costs have narrowed the spread between yields and funding costs we
remain optimistic for the prospects of our German residential business. This is based on our long-
term strategy which includes buying good quality assets with favourable tenant structures in areas
where residential demand is likely to remain high. The results of this have been reﬂected in the
valuation of our portfolio which shows an uplift of 4.0%. We focus on smaller value portfolios
(below €20m) and do not rely on overly aggressive privatisation rates to deliver the required 
level of returns. 
We continue to investigate alternative funding structures for our German business and, in particular,
the possibility of introducing third-party equity. 
The operating contribution from our German portfolio in the year was £5m, primarily from 
net rental yield on the properties which is running at 4.5% (2006: 5.0%). We have two further
European interests, one of which was sold in the year, delivering proﬁt of £1.2m on an original
investment of £2m. The other, a subsidiary company in which we own an 81.6% stake, holds a
development site in Zizkov, Prague and is going through the planning process. Our investment
amounts to £3.5m and the gross development value may amount to as much as £170m on 
phase I with a second phase of similar size to follow.
Prospects We have been building each of our businesses in a prudent way, without assuming 
the relatively high levels of house price growth that we have beneﬁted from in recent years.
However, we believe that we now have in place a market-leading platform that can acquire,
develop, fund, manage and sell a diverse range of residential products on a national basis. 
We are also conﬁdent that we can still produce good long-term returns from our specialist
portfolios which rely on active management, development and trading of reversionary surpluses
and will continue to concentrate our resources in these areas.

STRATEGY 40 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
Evolution of the application of IFRS and a review of our accounts by the
Financial Reporting Review Panel has caused us to reconsider the suitability 
of certain of our accounting policies, in particular the classiﬁcation of market-
rented residential assets which were transferred to G:res1 during the year
ended 30 September 2006. In full agreement with our auditors, these assets
have been reclassiﬁed as investment assets rather than trading assets with
effect from 1 October 2005 and a prior year adjustment has been made
accordingly. The effect has been to remove a revaluation surplus of £23.5m
taken through the income statement in 2006 and instead take it through
retained earnings at 1 October 2005 net of tax of £7.0m. This adjustment 
has no effect on the key indicator of market value, namely net asset value, 
and has no implications for the economics or cash generation of the business.
An added beneﬁt is that by removing the one-off revaluation surplus taken 
to proﬁt in 2006, the disclosed income statements for 2006 and 2007 are far
more directly comparable. We have also taken this opportunity to reclassify
an immaterial balance of equity release home reversion assets to ensure
consistent presentation. Full details of the adjustment are given in note 1(b) 
to the ﬁnancial statements on pages 81 and 82.

The European Public Real Estate Association (‘EPRA’) Best Practices Committee has recommended the calculation and
use of a diluted EPRA NAV and a diluted EPRA net net assets value (NNNAV). The deﬁnitions of these measures are
consistent with Gross NAV and Triple NAV as described and shown in the table above.
This deﬁnition of Gross NAV requires us to take out any adjustments for deferred tax and changes in the fair value 
of derivatives as calculated under IFRS. NNNAV requires certain of these adjustments to be reinstated and in addition
a deduction is made for contingent tax which is calculated by applying the expected rate of tax to the full inherent
gains at the balance sheet date.

Net asset value Measurements of net asset value are key
performance indicators for the group. We set out three
measurements to better enable shareholders to compare
our performance year-on-year and with our peers, whilst
reﬂecting the unique nature of our business:
Gross net assets per share up 22.3% to 828p from
677p (market value of net assets per share before
deduction for deferred tax on property assets and
before adjustments for fair value of derivatives).
Triple net assets per share NNNAV up 25.8% to 613p
from 487p (gross NAV per share adjusted for deferred
tax on revaluation gains and for mark to market
adjustments).
Grainger NAV up 23.0% to 732p from 595p (NNNAV
adjusted for the discounted and taxed reversionary surplus
in our long-term regulated and home reversion portfolios).

As in previous years, we set out below the major
assumptions we have used in calculating the base case
Grainger NAV and how it might change by amending
those assumptions:
• house price inﬂation is taken as zero over the entire
reversionary period;
• a discount rate of 9.38% has been used (weighted
average cost of capital plus 3%);
• no discounting of contingent tax on the revaluation
surpluses; and
• reversionary periods taken as 13 years for regulated
properties and 11 years for home reversions.

Financial performance in the year Operating proﬁt
before fair value movements and goodwill impairment
increased to £89.0m from £81.5m as shown below:
The major movement in operating proﬁt derives from an
increase in trading proﬁts from our core residential and
home reversion portfolios. As expected, development
proﬁts have decreased in line with the fall in the number
of projects coming through for completion in the year. 
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have
increased by 71.5% to 47.3p from 26.0p (restated) 
as shown below:
As well as an improvement in operating proﬁt, this year’s
result has been enhanced by the signiﬁcant contribution
from our joint ventures and associates. In particular,
Grainger GenInvest which is an exclusively London-based
portfolio, has shown large revaluation gains, our share of
which amounts to some £35m.

Interest and tax Our net interest charge has increased
by £7.9m to £65.0m with interest payable increasing 
by £11.5m. The increase has arisen from a combination 
of higher debt levels used to ﬁnance the growth in our
asset base (particularly home reversions and Germany)
and higher underlying interest rate costs. On average
monthly debt levels have exceeded 2006 ﬁgures by
£208m and we have seen three-month LIBOR and
Euribor rates rise by 123 basis points and 137 basis
points respectively in the year.

Financial resources The business continues to be highly
cash generative producing £497m (2006: £208m) from
operating activities and sales of investment property. 
Major cash outﬂows relate to interest £66.1m, tax 
£8.5m and dividends £7.6m. Furthermore we spent a
total of £723m on acquiring new properties, funding
development and investing in joint ventures. To assist 
in funding this we raised additional net debt of £336m. 
During the year we revised the terms of our core
borrowing facility, extending the average maturity by 
two years and reducing the overall borrowing margin 
by 13 basis points. The ﬁrst major repayment of £400m
under this facility is not due until June 2010. We also
issued a seven-year convertible bond producing net
proceeds of £110m. The bond has a coupon of 3.625%, 
a post-tax cash cost of approximately 1.5% and a
conversion share price of 864p. Subsequent to this 
issue we bought 1,525,000 shares back in the market 
for cancellation at an average price per share of 
£5.12. The average maturity of our debt is 5.9 years
(2006: 4.1 years). At 30 September 2007 we had total
headroom of £226m and the loan to value ratio stood 
at 53% (2006: 52%).
Our all-in cost of debt in the year was 6.1% (2006: 5.8%)
and our weighted average cost of capital has moved out
to 6.38% from 5.67%. Net borrowings of £1,332m were
74% hedged (2006: £1,051m and 66%). We put in place
a signiﬁcant level of new hedging early in the year
including a 15-year £100m swap, at 4.98%. In total our
ﬁnancial instruments were ‘in the money’ by £12.3m at
30 September 2007 (2006: out of the money £(2.1)m)

This has been an exciting year for Grainger’s Corporate Responsibility

Our commitment to sustainability has had a signiﬁcant impact on Grainger’s
developments. At our Hornsey Road site all homes are being built to the
EcoHomes Very Good standard and all future developments will now be 
built to Code for Sustainable Homes level three. 
We have also conducted a baseline review to establish signiﬁcant environmental
impacts across the business. A two-year action plan is being drawn up to
deliver against these recommendations. 
Social considerations are also being taken into account at our development
sites. At Hornesy Road we are working with the school neighbouring the site
on a number of different projects. On our other planned developments, all
local communities impacted by our work are extensively consulted before
works on site begin.
Regarding our existing homes, we have been very successful in helping tenants
access funds through the Warm Front initiative

. Not only does this provide
greater support for our more vulnerable tenants, but it also improves the
energy efﬁciency of our portfolio. 
I am very proud of our work with Business in the Community where we
welcomed three people who have been affected by homelessness to join 
us on two-week work placements. This has been an enriching experience for
all concerned – not least our own staff. In the year ahead we will be taking
our commitment to our people further with a strengthened programme of
training and additional investment in Human Resources.
This year we are pleased to have launched a dedicated Corporate

in 2005 and has shown great personal
initiative and drive in this role. Recognising
where data management systems could
be improved, Holly devised a new method
of storing, sharing and tracking information.
This was implemented across our

technical training was available for all.
Holly was a clear candidate for promotion
to trainee property manager (‘PM’) and
enrolled on our six month PM training
programme. After successfully completing
this, we were delighted to promote Holly
to property manager in September 2007.

As our business is based around providing and managing homes, reducing
homelessness is particularly relevant to Grainger. We were therefore 
delighted to welcome three people into the business through the Business
Action on Homelessness work placement scheme. In addition, we have also
hosted a Ready to Go Training and Action Day, which prepares clients affected
by homelessness for work placements, and hosted a CV workshop.
As our development activities have grown, we have been mindful of the
potential impact that we could have on local communities and have worked
with specialist organisations to deliver effective community consultation. By
engaging actively with the community and key stakeholders pre-application,
we not only produce a better scheme which meets the needs of the
community that surround it, but also increase our chances of success in
planning. At our Hornsey Road development, we have enjoyed working 
with the local school and getting to know those in the community through 
a fun day held in conjunction with Tollington Community Association.

SUPPORTING OUR STAFF
Ian Lawson, senior property manager, set up his own under 9’s football team this
summer, the Hebburn Wanderers. Grainger’s sponsorship of his team enabled them to
purchase new equipment and it has given them the necessary ﬁnancial stability to offer
season awards and man of the match medals. 
“This sponsorship money has been warmly received by all at Hebburn Wanderers, 
it has allowed my team to train and compete in brand new quality kit, and provided 
the required training equipment to give the kids all the chance of success in the league.
The setting up of a team and all that comes with the running of a junior football season
takes a lot of my time and effort and the fact that Grainger provided such excellent
support has delighted me.” IAN LAWSON

Engage proactively with
prioritised suppliers.
Grainger has embarked on a programme of supplier engagement this year.
This has involved circulating a Code of Good Practice which has a focus 
on community awareness and respect for the environment. 
We are also working with KPMG to review our supply chain which will
incorporate sustainability issues. We spend a signiﬁcant amount of money 
on property expenses and capital expenditure, and development projects. 
During the year we completed a tender process and are pleased to have
appointed an environmentally preferable stationery supplier across our ofﬁces.
TARGETS 2007/08
Request supplier environmental information as part of future tender processes 
and actively consider this information when awarding signiﬁcant supplier contracts.
Grainger continues to engage with investors wherever we see an opportunity
to do so. This year we undertook a corporate benchmarking exercise, learning
more about both our investors’ and our peers’ public CR commitments. This
has given us a better understanding of the sustainability goals of these groups.
We held an internal workshop with staff to discuss the results and brainstorm
CR target ideas for the future. The outcomes of this workshop were fed
directly into the development of our targets for 2007/08.
TARGETS 2007/08
Formally respond to requests for information sent by our major investors 
(owners of at least 2% of shares) on sustainability and CR in general.
Proactively engage with the CR committee of at least one major investor

STRATEGY
Upstream has assessed Grainger’s achievement against the 2006/07 targets
based on:
• meetings and telephone interviews with Grainger individuals responsible 
for speciﬁc CR areas and for target delivery; and
• detailed review of documentation and information submitted as evidence
against the targets.
On this basis we can provide assurance that Grainger plc has made some
progress on 86% of its 22 applicable CR targets, with eight of these being 
fully achieved by the year end. A number became not applicable due to
circumstances beyond Grainger’s control, a change in responsibility for other
targets unfortunately slowed progress. Nevertheless, Upstream believes that
Grainger retains a genuine commitment to improving its CSR credentials, and
we note that several of the targets that were not fully achieved in the past
year have been carried forward for completion during the 2007/08 period.
Grainger’s successes this year include:
• a baseline review of environmental aspects and impacts to prioritise 
those that pose the most signiﬁcant risk to Grainger’s business; 
• an initiative to engage with contractors requiring them to provide
environmental performance data for individual construction sites for
monitoring purposes; and 
• Grainger’s work with the homeless, along with its commitment to staff,
should be celebrated as particular areas of success.
Grainger has set some challenging targets for the year ahead and, for the ﬁrst
time, the company has committed to a number of longer-term goals. This
demonstrates a more strategic approach to CR. The gathering of environmental
performance data across key business activities will represent a real challenge
in the coming year, but internal monitoring systems are already being developed
and work is under way with a number of external organisations to facilitate
this important task.
At Upstream, we look forward to continuing to work with Grainger as it
continues to address its material impacts and further develops its CR strategy.

GOVERNANCE
Andrew Cunningham Robin Broadhurst Robert R S Hiscox Henry Pitman 56 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
Robin Broadhurst, appointed chairman in February 2007, has
continued to uphold the highest standards of governance which
were maintained under the previous chairman. He has, inevitably,
made some changes to the operation of the board in line with
the increasing complexity of the business and these are
described in this report.
The board believes that corporate governance is fundamentally
about the way a company operates and should not be an
automatic response to a check list. However, it is also mindful
that The Combined Code 2003 and the modifications to it 
in 2006 are generally accepted to describe best practice in
governance and seeks to comply as far as possible where this 
is in the best interests of the company. The statement of
compliance refers to The Combined Code 2003, which was
applicable to Grainger.
This report fulfils the requirements of the Listing Rules and
should be read in conjunction with the reports of the individual
committees which follow.
The directors
A company is only as good as the people who work for it and
the directors are committed to ensuring that the board itself
includes people who have all of the necessary skills, knowledge
and experience to successfully lead the organisation. The
composition of the board, which is relatively small, changed 
at two points during the year as follows:
On 28 February 2007, Robert Dickinson retired as chairman
and was succeeded by Robin Broadhurst, previously the senior
independent director. Up until that date, in the board’s view, the
board consisted of the chairman, deputy chairman, two executive
directors and four independent non-executive directors. There
were no new additions to the board at that date. 
On 1 May 2007, Henry Pitman was appointed to the board as
an independent non-executive director, re-establishing the same
balance of non-executives as previously.
The directors therefore believe that, excluding the chairman, 
the board consisted of at least half independent non-executive
directors for the entire reporting period.
Roles
There is a written, approved statement of the separation 
of duties of the chairman, who reports to the board and the
chief executive, who reports to the chairman. Other key
differentiating factors are as follows:
The chairman
Responsible for running the board
Only the chief executive and the company secretary 
(for corporate governance matters) report to him
Guardian of the board’s decision making
The chief executive
Responsible for running the business
All executive management report to him, directly or indirectly
Responsible for implementing the board’s decisions
Other key roles include the senior independent director and the
chairmen of the committees. Robin Broadhurst held the position
of senior independent director until his appointment as chairman
following the Annual General Meeting in February 2007 and was
replaced by Bill Tudor John. The committees’ compositions and
work are described in detail in their own reports which follow.
Independence
With the retirement of Robert Dickinson as chairman and
subsequent appointment of Henry Pitman, an independent 
non-executive director, the board has again demonstrated its
commitment to increasing the independence on the board. 
It will no doubt still be of concern to some that the chief
executive is a cousin of the deputy chairman, however this is 
the only lasting family tie which remains on the Grainger board
following many years of greater links. As intimated in The
Combined Code, the criteria of A.3.1 are only a guideline and 
it is the directors’ view of the independence of a particular
director that is ultimately important. In forming their opinion, 
the directors consider, amongst other things, the individual’s
professional characteristics, their behaviour at board meetings,
their contribution to the debate and unbiased judgement.
The following analysis explains the board’s duly considered 
view of the independence of the directors.

Robert R S Hiscox Independent � although a trustee for a trust holding a material shareholding 
(7% at 30 September), the board is of the opinion that this position
does not interfere with or influence his character or judgement 
in any way. As chairman of Hiscox plc, and past deputy chairman 
of Lloyds, Mr Hiscox brings extensive skills and experience in his
own right, which can only be beneficial to Grainger’s board;
� the trust has reduced its shareholding over the past three years, 
from 12.5 million shares to 9 million shares.
Henry Pitman Independent � independent under A.3.1 criteria;
(Appointed 1 May 2007) � note that as explained at the time of his appointment Mr Pitman 
is related to the Dickinson family, there are no close ties between
him and the current or former directors of Grainger.
Robert Dickinson Not independent � close family ties;
(Retired 28 February 2007) � more than nine years’ service.
Full biographical details of all current directors are given on pages 54 and 55.
Retirement by rotation and re-election
The board recognises that it is important to adhere to good
governance principles and all board members are, as such,
required to stand for re-election upon appointment and at
intervals of no more than three years. However, the board 
is also of the view that long-term stability in the board is an
important factor, given the long-term nature of the business.
Continuation of leadership throughout, for example, the period
of a significant development, is considered particularly beneficial.
The board therefore continues to consider itself fortunate 
that the deputy chairman, being willing and able, will again offer
himself for re-election, despite having passed the age of 70 and
having stood for re-election for each of the past three years. 
The chairman has satisfied himself that, following evaluation, 
all directors offering themselves for re-election continue to 
show the required commitment and effective performance. 
GOVERNANCE 58 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
Meetings
There were four ordinary meetings of the board in the year,
where the board met to review the business and to consider 
the items reserved specifically for it which have been documented
and approved by the board. These include setting the overall
strategy, approving major transactions, setting debt/gearing limits
and associated hedging strategy and agreeing accounting policies.
No changes were made to this schedule during the year.
Decisions regarding more minor transactions are delegated 
to management.
Each meeting was preceded, the evening before, with an
informal meeting allowing more time for debate and also a
dinner, giving an opportunity for the directors to enhance their
relationships with each other. All directors attended all meetings
during their relevant periods of office except for Robert Hiscox,
who was not present at two of the meetings. On one occasion
when unable to attend the formal board meeting, Mr Hiscox
attended the previous evening meeting and dinner to ensure
that his views could be taken to the board meeting. It is intended
that there will be six ordinary board meetings in the next
reporting period. 
As in previous years, at the June meeting, the board met for an
extended period in order to debate and reflect fully on strategy.
This event also provides an ideal opportunity for the board to
spend time with the senior executives.
As well as the ordinary meetings, ad hoc meetings are arranged
as necessary in order to consider major transactions or events.
Due to the short notice, which is unavoidable, all directors are
not always able to attend, or to join by teleconference. Wherever
possible the chairman will take on views of the non-attending
director prior to the meeting. 
Board papers are produced and distributed in a timely manner
for each meeting. They contain sufficient financial and non-
financial information to allow the board to properly monitor the
group and understand the challenges facing it and opportunities
open to it. The format of the papers has recently been amended
to specifically highlight items for decision and for discussion. In
this way the board can be sure that it concentrates its efforts
and allocates sufficient time to those items which are most
important.
Each director is given an opportunity to raise an item to the
agenda and any request for further information from a director
is treated as a high priority. The directors also have direct 
access to the services of the company secretary, who reports 
to the chairman regarding matters of corporate governance. 
The appointment and removal of the company secretary is 
a matter for the board as a whole. Procedures also exist for
directors to take independent professional advice as required, 
at the group’s expense.
The chairman met once during the year with the non-
executives, without the executives present. It was the joint view
of the chairman and the non-executives that this was indeed
useful and two such meetings have been planned for the next
reporting period.
Induction, evaluation, training and development
Henry Pitman was appointed in the year and received a
comprehensive, tailored induction to the company. This consisted
of the provision of a ‘bible’ of information covering such items as
the most recent risk review, recent minutes, terms of reference
of the committees etc. as well as sessions with each member 
of the senior management team. These meetings were arranged
in small groups so that as well as the divisional leaders each
giving a presentation of their business area, discussion and
debate was encouraged.
Mr Pitman was also taken on two property tours, to enable him
to see some of the company’s properties – ranging from the
core regulated portfolio through to the development activities.
Mr Pitman was fortunate to join the board in time to participate
in the June extended strategy meeting described above, which
gave him an ideal opportunity to understand the strategy at 
a very early opportunity.
Directors and Officers insurance is held by the company and
details of the policy are given to new directors on appointment.
The evaluation process this year again built on the success 
of the previous year, extending the work involved and in turn
enhancing the outcomes. The process was conducted internally
and consisted of a written questionnaire followed by an
interview with the chairman. Rather than a box ticking or simple
rating scheme, the response required from directors this year
was an ‘in their own words’ approach. This allowed for more
corporate governance report continued
GOVERNANCE 59
than just the standard areas of performance to be recognised.
The questionnaire covered all of the board as a whole, the
committees and the individual directors and all of these areas
were picked up as relevant in the subsequent interviews. 
Notes of the interviews are held only by the chairman and the
company secretary since it has been proven in recent years that
this allows the directors to be more open in their discussions. 
The chairman was pleased with the commitment shown by 
the directors to the process and felt that it was very useful for
him in his first year of chairmanship. The whole process and its
outcomes were reviewed formally at a board meeting. As a
result of the evaluation process it has been agreed that more
communication between the executives and the non-executives
could be beneficial. This will be in part achieved through a
planned increase in number of board meetings to be held 
each year. 
The senior independent director met firstly with the executives
and then immediately after with the non-executives in order to
evaluate the performance of the chairman. The board’s written
document for the separation of the roles of the chairman and
the chief executive was used as a basis for the evaluation,
bearing in mind that the chairman had only very recently 
been appointed.
The board is provided with regular written updates which are
relevant to a listed property company. In the year this included
further information on the REIT regime and the Companies 
Act 2006. Directors are able to request specific training, through
the chairman or company secretary. If any development areas
are identified for the board as a whole, its committees or for
directors as individuals, then they would be appropriately
addressed on appointment or thereafter.
Relations with stakeholders 
The primary contacts with shareholders, analysts and potential
investors are the chief executive and deputy chief executive/
finance director. The usual half yearly results announcements and
briefings were also attended by some of the company’s most
senior management and this was welcomed by shareholders.
Apart from these meetings, there have again been circa. 100
meetings and presentations by the executive directors, to
maintain an appropriate dialogue. They also participated either
together or individually in several roadshows throughout Europe
and in the USA. In particular this year, more meetings have taken
place with private client brokers. Feedback is always sought
following such events and is presented to the board as a whole.
The board is briefed on the views of major shareholders.
Further, all directors, including the chairman and non-executives,
are available for meetings with shareholders. There were no
requests in the year from shareholders to meet Henry Pitman,
the newly appointed non-executive director. He, along with 
all other directors, will be in attendance at the Annual General
Meeting and available to answer questions.
The group’s website includes a specific and comprehensive
Investor Relations section, containing all RNS announcements,
share price information and annual documents available for
download etc. All shareholders have the opportunity to attend
the Annual General Meeting, which continues as a route for
communication with smaller/private shareholders. 
The notice of meeting and annual report and accounts are sent
out at least 20 working days before the meeting. Separate votes
are held for each proposed resolution, including the approval of
the remuneration committee report, and a proxy count is given
in each case after the voting on a show of hands. At the Annual
General Meeting in February 2007, Grainger included a ‘vote
withheld’ category for the third year, in line with best practice.
Shareholders were also able again to lodge their votes through
the CREST system.
Internal control
The group has a cyclical process for identifying, assessing and
managing its internal control, which has been in place for the 
full year under review and up to the date of this report. The
process is designed to enable the board to be confident that
such risks are mitigated, or controlled as far as possible. It should
be noted however that no system can eliminate the risk of failure
to achieve business objectives entirely and can only provide
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. The audit committee is delegated the 
task of reviewing all identified risks, with the absolute key risks
retained for full board review. The audit committee reports 
to the board at every board meeting. Risks and controls are
reviewed to ensure effective management of appropriate
GOVERNANCE 60 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. The audit
committee also reviews the half year and full year financial
statements and holds discussions with the group’s auditors. In
addition, the group has an internal audit function which performs
relevant reviews as part of a programme approved by the audit
committee. The committee considers any issues or risks arising
from internal audit in order that appropriate actions can be
undertaken for their satisfactory resolution. The internal audit
manager has a direct reporting line to the chairman of the 
audit committee.
An annual budget is produced, together with longer-term
projections in accordance with the agreed strategy, which are
presented to the board for approval. A fundamental part of the
control process is the diligent monitoring of actual performance
against this budget by the board. Where applicable, revisions are
made to expected outturn against which further progress can
be monitored.
The board also discusses in detail the projected financial impact
of major proposed acquisitions and disposals, including their
financing. All such proposed substantial investments are
considered by all directors. Where meetings are required
between board meetings and a full complement of directors
cannot be achieved, a committee of directors considers the
necessary formalities. The board is also responsible for the
discussion and approval of the group’s treasury strategy, 
including mitigation against changes in interest rates. 
Going concern
After making diligent enquiries, including the review of future
anticipated cash flows and compliance with banking covenants,
the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and
company have adequate resources to continue in existence for
the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Compliance statement
Independence of non-executive directors is explained in detail
above. In the board’s view it is their assessment of independence
which determines compliance with the Code and therefore no
non-compliance on grounds of independence has been recorded.
Except as noted below, the board considers that it has 
complied with the Combined Code 2003 during the year 
ended 30 September 2007.
B.1.6 The company complied with this requirement at the 
year end, however as explained in detail in the directors’
remuneration report, Rupert Dickinson and Andrew
Cunningham held service contracts during the year with 
notice periods in excess of one year. The notice periods were
being reduced from two years to one year on a straight-line
basis over a period of five years from 1 October 2002 to 
30 September 2007. 
Nomination committee report
The nomination committee composition changed during the
year due to the retirement of Robert Dickinson, the previous
chairman, but at all times consisted of the chairman of the board
(who is the chairman of the committee) and two independent
non-executive directors as follows:
Until 28 February 2007
Robert Dickinson Chairman
Robert R S Hiscox Member
Robin Broadhurst Member
From 28 February 2007
Robin Broadhurst Chairman
Robert R S Hiscox Member
Bill T udor John Member
Due to the relatively small size of the board, matters which are
included within the nomination committee’s terms of reference
are often discussed by the board as a whole. As a result, this
year, the committee met only informally and communicated 
on other occasions by email or by telephone.
The terms of reference of the nomination committee are
available on the group’s website and principally relate to filling
vacancies on the board, whether arising through resignation,
retirement or desired expansion and succession planning.
Following some restructuring of the senior management team 
it is expected that succession planning will be high on the
nomination committee’s agenda next year.
The retirement of the previous chairman and appointment 
of the new chairman had been announced prior to last year’s
report and as reported in last year’s nomination report, the
recruitment of a further independent non-executive was in
progress. This involved the use of an agency.
corporate governance report continued
GOVERNANCE 61
GOVERNANCE
The nomination committee is also responsible for reviewing the
desirability of the continuation of service of directors required
to retire by rotation. In this regard each of the directors
required to retire by rotation this year has continued to
demonstrate full, capable and committed participation in setting
and monitoring strategy for the group. Details of those directors
standing for re-election in the February 2008 Annual General
Meeting are given in the notice of meeting which accompanies
this report and biographies are displayed on pages 54 and 55.
Audit committee report
The audit committee meets four times each year and reports 
on its work at every subsequent board meeting. This is a critical
part of the internal control process. Meetings of the committee
invariably last two hours or more. 
As a result of Robin Broadhurst being appointed chairman of
the board on 28 February 2007, he resigned from the committee
on that date. The board therefore comprised only two members
for the two months until 1 May 2007 when Henry Pitman was
appointed to the board and the audit committee. However,
since there were no meetings of the committee during that
period, there were three independent members available for all
meetings. As a result, this minor non-compliance with provision
C.3.1 has not been formally raised to the compliance statement. 
Attendance of the individual directors is shown below.

experience required by The Combined Code.

The audit committee adheres to particularly strict and detailed
terms of reference, which are available for inspection on the
group’s website. In addition to the work described within the
‘internal control’ section of the main report above, the audit
committee is also responsible for reviewing the independence 
of the external auditor, which includes the approval of any 
non-audit service fees above a relatively nominal level. The audit
committee is responsible for the appointment of the external
auditor and for agreeing the audit fee.
The deputy chief executive/finance director and external 
audit partner as well as other senior management are invited 
to attend meetings of the committee. In particular this year, 
the audit committee has started to receive presentations from
members of staff such as the treasury director, tax director 
and IT director (all non-statutory directors), to ensure that they
feel sufficiently close to these important individuals who have
significant levels of control to maintain. Once each year the audit
committee meet with management without the auditors present
and also with the auditors without management present.
During the year the committee received 26 internal audit
reports covering both control and value for money matters. 
By order of the board 
MARIE GLANVILLE ACA ACIS
Company secretary 18 December 2007 62 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
report of the remuneration committee 
and directors’ remuneration report
GOVERNANCE
This report meets the disclosure requirements of the
Companies Act and the Listing Rules and in accordance with
usual practice will be put to shareholders for approval at the
Annual General Meeting.
The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consisted throughout the period
of Bill Tudor John (chairman), with Robert Hiscox and John
Barnsley as members.
In the opinion of the directors the committee therefore
comprised three independent non-executives throughout the
year. Certain shareholder pressure groups raised concerns again
last year that Mr Hiscox, as trustee of an unconnected family
trust owning a material shareholding (7% as at 30 September
2007), should not be regarded as independent. The board
maintains their view that Mr Hiscox is independent and a 
valued contributor to the remuneration committee. 
The remuneration committee met formally twice during the
year and all members attended except for Robert Hiscox, who
was unable to attend one of those meetings. The committee
have also communicated informally during the year, in particular
with regard to the finalisation of the new LTIS, which had been
substantially agreed at the September 2006 committee meeting
and was approved by shareholders at the February 2007 Annual
General Meeting. They also exchanged correspondence
regarding uplifts in salaries and bonuses for all staff, including 
the executive directors and share awards made in accordance
with the new LTIS in March 2007.
This year New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (‘NBSC’) continued
to be involved in the set up and implementation of the new
LTIS, as approved at the February Annual General Meeting.
NBSC have no other connection with the company or its
directors as individuals.
The chairman and committee have also had access to advice
from the director of HR. This position was vacated during the year
and a new director of HR was appointed in November 2007.
The committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
group’s website.
Remuneration policy
Grainger’s remuneration policy is designed to attract, motivate
and retain high calibre individuals to enable the group to operate
strategically for the continued benefit of shareholders, over the
long term. In order to operate this policy, the remuneration
committee receives information on remuneration packages
awarded to directors in comparable organisations and aims 
to ensure that the rewards paid by Grainger are competitive.
The policy is also designed to align the directors’ interests with
those of shareholders. This is principally achieved through the
use of share-based incentives and by encouraging executive
directors to maintain a reasonable shareholding in the group. 
As a guideline, executive directors (and senior executives) are
expected to hold the equivalent value of at least one year’s
salary in Grainger shares. Details of executive directors’
shareholdings are shown on page 70. Share awards are generally
satisfied by the acquisition of shares in the market, so are not
dilutive to shareholders. Share options are satisfied by the issue
of new share capital.
Remuneration packages balance both short- and long-term
rewards, as well as performance-related pay and non-
performance-related. They include salary, bonus and defined
contribution pension elements as well as long-term share
incentive and option schemes. Usual benefits are also afforded.
No executive director is involved in the determination of his
own remuneration. Fees of the non-executive directors, which
include increments where a committee chairmanship or senior
independent position is held, are determined by the board 
as a whole. 
Following his appointment as chairman, Robin Broadhurst
recommended to the board as a whole that John Barnsley, as
chairman of the audit committee, should receive an interim rise
in fees to £50,000 per annum. This was in recognition of the
significant and increasing amount of work involved in this role.
Usually, non-executive directors’ fees are only reviewed biennially
and as such would not fall to be reviewed in the current
reporting year.
The salaries and bonuses of senior management are determined
by the executive directors and reported to the remuneration
committee. Senior management also participate in long-term
incentive scheme arrangements described below.  63
GOVERNANCE
Usual benefits are also afforded to these individuals. In this context, senior management are those employees who are members of
the ‘executive team’ which was restructured in the year. In addition to this, specific bonus schemes were negotiated with certain key
senior management during the year, based on their specific business areas, in order to drive performance.
The remuneration committee also review the total level of salaries and bonuses paid to the group as a whole. This includes reviewing
the details of any employee earning over £100,000, or earning a bonus in excess of £50,000 or a bonus in excess of 25% of salary.
Service contracts
As explained in prior years, Rupert Dickinson and Andrew Cunningham each hold service contracts with notice periods which 
were decreasing on a straight-line basis from two years to one year, over a period of five years which ended on 30 September 2007. 
At the year end and as at the date of this report therefore the notice periods were reduced to one year and are now in full
compliance with the Combined Code.
Contract dates and unexpired terms for the directors are as follows:
Contract date Unexpired term* Notice period
Rupert Dickinson 19 July 1996 No fixed term 12 months
Andrew Cunningham 26 July 2000 No fixed term 12 months
Robin Broadhurst 26 February 2004 5 months None
Stephen Dickinson 28 February 2000 5 months None
Bill T udor John 24 February 2005 5 months None
John Barnsley 27 February 2003 5 months None
Robert Hiscox 6 March 2002 5 months None
Henry Pitman 1 May 2007 7 months None
* calculated as at 30 September 2007 and rounded to the nearest whole month
Apart from salary and benefits in relation to the notice period
described above, there are no other terms in any of the contracts
which would give rise to compensation payable for early
termination, or any other liability of the company.
Each non-executive director has specific terms of reference.
Their letters of appointment state an initial one-year period, 
with a continuation subject to review at that time. The letters 
of appointment contain no entitlement to compensation for
early termination.
Other directorships
Rupert Dickinson has served as a non-executive director of
Workspace Group plc throughout the period under review.
Grainger’s board were satisfied that the appointment would be
of mutual benefit, with Rupert gaining invaluable experience of
another plc. On 2 May 2007 it was announced that Andrew
Cunningham joined the board of The Local Shopping REIT plc. 
After full consideration it was agreed by the remuneration
committee that both executive directors should retain the fees
paid to them by the respective organisations. In the year under
review, Rupert Dickinson and Andrew Cunningham retained
£16,500 and £12,385 respectively. 
Non-performance-related remuneration
Basic salaries and benefits
Basic salaries are reviewed by the remuneration committee
annually. Uplifts are by reference to cost of living, responsibilities
and market rates, as for all employees and are performed at the
same time of year. Executive directors and the deputy chairman,
Stephen Dickinson, who has part-time executive responsibilities,
along with other senior members of staff, receive a fully expensed
company car, or a car allowance. All members of staff, including
the executive directors and Stephen Dickinson, benefit from
health and life insurances. 64 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
report of the remuneration committee and directors’ remuneration report continued
GOVERNANCE
The chairman’s and non-executive directors’ fees, which is the
only remuneration received, are reviewed on a biennial basis by
the whole board. 
Pensions
The group contributes 15% of basic salary to the money purchase
pension schemes of Rupert Dickinson and Andrew Cunningham.
No other elements of remuneration are pensionable.
Share schemes open to all employees
Executive directors, and Stephen Dickinson, deputy chairman, 
are eligible to participate in two share schemes which are open
to all employees with relevant service, subject to the rules of 
the schemes.
The first is a save as you earn (‘SAYE’) scheme, and the second 
a share incentive plan (‘SIP’). Both are Inland Revenue approved
and therefore subject to the limits prescribed.
Amounts relating to directors’ participation in the SIP and share
options under the SAYE scheme are shown on pages 67 and 
68 respectively. 
Performance-related remuneration
As should be expected and in accordance with the Combined
Code, a significant element of executive directors’ and senior
management’s potential remuneration is performance-related.
The combination of short- and long-term incentives attempt 
to align the interests of executives and senior management 
with the interests of shareholders, and to reward significant
outperformance of expectations.
Non-executive directors do not receive performance-related
remuneration.
Annual discretionary bonus
Each year the remuneration committee considers the award 
of a bonus to the executive directors, which is at their ultimate
discretion. The chief and deputy chief executive officers, 
Rupert Dickinson and Andrew Cunningham participate in an
arrangement introduced in 2003 whereby the provisional bonus
is calculated over a three-year period, by reference to the
enhancement of the triple net asset value of Grainger, relative 
to a theoretical market comparator. The comparator movement
is calculated with regard to the Nationwide and Halifax house
price indices and also interest rates – using five year swap rates.
Bonuses remain capped at 150% of salary which would only be
achieved under exceptional performance conditions. Subject
always to the committee’s discretion, one third of the calculated
amount is approved for payment and the provisional balance is
taken into account over the next two years. The award payable
for the year ended 30 September 2007 represents 107% of
salary for that year (2006: 90%). 
Long-term incentives
Grainger’s policy in relation to long-term incentive schemes 
has evolved over time to more closely align the long-term
interests of executives and senior management with those of
shareholders, to reward sustained performance over a number
of financial years and to encourage these employees to grow
their shareholdings.
In order to maintain best practice and more closely align
performance with reward, a resolution to adopt a new long-
term incentive scheme (‘LTIS’) was put to and approved by
shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting, convened
immediately after the Annual General Meeting in February 2007.
Current long-term incentive scheme
This scheme makes conditional awards of shares to reward
performance and retain key staff over rolling three-year periods.
The potential award is split into two, with two thirds of the
awards being dependent upon the absolute level of increase in
NNNAV (triple net asset value – i.e. net assets after adjusting
for contingent tax and mark to market adjustments) and one
third dependent upon the increase in absolute total shareholder
return (‘TSR’) (increase in value of shares plus dividends which
are assumed to be reinvested) as follows:
Percentage of the 
Average annual growth NNNAV proportion of an 
in NNNAV award which will vest
Less than or equal to 
average WACC 0%
Equal to average WACC +3% 100%
Between average WACC Pro rata on a straight-line 
and average WACC +3% basis between 0% and 100% 65
GOVERNANCE
TSR of the company over the Percentage of the TSR proportion 
TSR performance period of an award which will vest
TSR being less than or equal 
to 8% compounded per annum
(25.98% growth in total over 
the TSR performance period) 0%
TSR being equal to or greater 
than 16% compounded per annum
(56.09% growth in total over 
the TSR performance period) 100%
Between 8% compounded 
per annum and 16% Between 0% and 100% pro
compounded per annum rata on a straight-line basis
There is also a matching awards element to the scheme, to
encourage executives to develop and maintain a shareholding 
in the company. Participants may pledge or buy shares of
equivalent value to 30% of their relevant salary and to the
extent that performance criteria are met, these shares will be
matched one for one at the end of the three-year period.
Full explanation of why the board considered absolute rather than
relative measures to be appropriate was given in the previous
notice of general meeting. Fundamentally it was considered that
Grainger was unusual in nature and has no natural comparator
group. Grainger is the only listed company of its size to invest,
trade and manage primarily in residential property assets. All other
comparably sized property companies are principally commercial
or development focussed.
Awards were made under this current scheme in March 2007
and are quantified below.
These performance criteria are believed to be stretching, but
realistic and reward executives if Grainger’s return to shareholders
is significant in absolute terms.
Previous long-term incentive scheme
There are two previous years of awards outstanding which
operate under the previous long-term incentive scheme year 
so the details of that scheme are also included here. Participants
were eligible to receive annual conditional awards of shares
worth up to 50% of salary under the long-term incentive
scheme and of share options up to a maximum of 125% of
salary under the executive share option scheme. The awards
under both schemes will become unconditional if challenging
performance criteria are satisfied over a single three-year
performance period following grant. The criteria for the awards
were based on TSR – dependent upon where Grainger’s TSR lies
with respect to a pre-determined comparator group as follows:
Performance condition Vesting of option
If Grainger’s TSR is equal to or 
greater than the upper quartile 
TSR of the comparator companies 100%
If Grainger’s TSR is equal 
to the median TSR of the 
comparator companies 40%
If Grainger’s TSR is above the median 
but below the upper quartile TSR of 
the comparator companies Pro rata vesting
If Grainger’s TSR is below the median 
TSR of the comparator companies 0%
As shown in the table above, no award vests unless Grainger’s
TSR is higher than the median TSR of the comparator group.
It should be noted that during its period of operation, it has
been necessary to change the comparator group due to
companies being taken over. The comparator group for the
awards made in January 2006 comprised A & J Mucklow Group
plc, Big Yellow Group plc, Brixton plc, Capital and Regional plc,
CLS Holdings plc, Daejan Holdings plc, Derwent Valley Holdings
plc, Freeport plc, Great Portland Estates plc, Helical Bar plc,
London Merchant Securities plc, Mapeley Limited, Minerva plc,
Mountview Estates plc, Quintain Estates and Development plc,
Shaftesbury plc, St Mowden Properties plc, The Unite Group plc,
Warner Estate Holdings plc and Workspace Group plc. 66 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007

As required by legislation covering the directors’ remuneration
report, the graph below shows TSR (based upon share price
growth with dividends reinvested) for Grainger, compared to the
2005/06 LTIP comparator group, the FTSE 250 and the FTSE
Real Estate Index. These comparators have been chosen on the
basis that they are the markets within which Grainger operates,
abeit that the Real Estate Index comprises mainly commercial
property companies. 67

Directors’ interests in significant contracts
No directors were materially interested in any contract 
of significance.
Insurance of directors
The group maintains insurance for Grainger plc’s directors 
in respect of their duties as director.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are required by UK Company law to prepare
financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the affairs of the company and the group as at the
end of the financial year and of the profit or loss for that period
and comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors must ensure that the group financial statements
are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union and the parent company financial statements
and the directors’ remuneration report in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(UK GAAP), and that a statement of this is made. Further, 
that suitable accounting policies have been selected, consistently
applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements
and estimates. 
The directors must also prepare the financial statements on the
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the company and the group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company and the group and to enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with
applicable laws and regulations. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the company and of the group, 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are 
also responsible for maintaining the system of internal control
and reviewing its effectiveness.
Creditor payment policy
It is the group’s policy to pay suppliers in accordance with their
normal terms and conditions of trading. Payment in respect of
the purchase of property is subject to and will comply with
contractual terms. Trade creditors existing at 30 September
2007 relating to purchases of property stock generally complete
28 days after exchange of contracts. Trade creditor days relating
to other trade creditors of the company and group were
calculated as 18 days (2006: 30 days).
Financial risk management
Details of this are included in note 26 to the financial statements.
Charitable donations
During the year the group made charitable donations amounting
to £71,283 (2006: £58,747). More information is provided in the
corporate responsibility report.
Health and safety
The company seeks to achieve the highest standards in respect
of health and safety of employees, and the safety of tenants.
Consultants are employed to ensure that the company complies
with health and safety regulations and each year the gas supply
and appliances within all of the group’s relevant residential
properties are independently inspected under the Gas Safety
(Installation and Use) Amended Regulations 1996 and certificates
of compliance issued. The group employs a full-time health and
safety manager. 72 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
directors’ report continued
GOVERNANCE
Employment of disabled persons
The company gives full and fair consideration to applications for
employment made by disabled persons, having regard to their
particular aptitudes and abilities. In the event of an employee
becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure that their
employment within the company continues and that appropriate
training is arranged where necessary. It is the policy of the
company that the training, career development and promotion
of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to 
that of other employees.
Employee involvement
The group places considerable value on the involvement of 
its employees and has continued its practice of keeping them
informed on matters affecting them as employees, for example,
eligibility to join company share schemes, and on the various
factors affecting the performance of the group. Communication
is made using the intranet, ‘The Source’, and through regular
meetings with, and presentations by senior management.
Auditors
As far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the company’s auditors are unaware. 
Each director has taken all steps that he ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant

FINANCIALS 74 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
We have audited the group financial statements of Grainger plc
for the year ended 30 September 2007 which comprise the
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of
recognised income and expense, the consolidated balance sheet,
the statement of consolidated cash flows and the related notes.
These group financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of Grainger plc for the year ended 30 September
2007 and on the information in the report of the remuneration
committee and directors’ remuneration report that is described
as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report
and the group financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as
adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement 
of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This
report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for
the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section
235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We
do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the group
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the directors’ report is consistent with 
the group financial statements.
The information given in the directors’ report includes that
specific information presented in the chairman’s statement and
the chief executive’s review that is cross-referenced from the
review of business development and prospects section of 
the directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance report reflects
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
Combined Code (2003) specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does
not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the annual report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited group financial
statements. The other information comprises only the chairman’s
statement, the chief executive’s review, the financial review, the
corporate governance report, the directors’ report, the corporate
responsibility report and the unaudited part of the report of the
remuneration committee and directors’ remuneration report and
the other items listed on the contents page. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the group financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
group financial statements. It also includes an assessment of 
the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors 
in the preparation of the group financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the group financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
group financial statements.

FINANCIALS 81
(a) Basis of preparation
Grainger plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the
UK. It is a public limited liability company listed on the London
Stock Exchange and the address of the registered office is
given on page 148. The group financial statements consolidate
those of the company and its subsidiaries, together referred 
to as the ‘group’, and equity account the group’s interest in
joint ventures and associates. The parent company financial
statements present information about the company and not
about its group.
The group financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRS’), IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the
Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under
IFRS. The company has elected to prepare its company financial
statements in accordance with UK GAAP . These are presented
on pages 141 to 146.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise
stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in 
the group financial statements. 
The group financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention except for the following assets
and liabilities which are stated at their fair value; investment
property, derivative financial instruments, financial interest 
in property assets and at fair value through profit or loss 
financial assets.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting
policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
income and expenses. Although these estimates are based 
on management’s best knowledge of the events and 
amounts involved, actual results ultimately may differ 
from those estimates.
(b) Prior year adjustment
Evolution of the application of IFRS and a review of our
accounts by the Financial Reporting Review Panel has 
caused us to reconsider the treatment of certain items in our
accounts. We have reviewed the treatment and classification 
in our balance sheet of our residential assets and, in particular,
the transfer of assets to the JPUT (that forms part of G:res1
Limited) in the 2006 financial year.
Classification of property assets
After a considered and detailed review we have concluded
that all of our property assets are correctly classified with 
the exception of some of our equity release home reversion
assets and assets transferred to the JPUT (see below). The
equity release home reversion assets had been shown in the
balance sheet as investment property but, as the most likely
outcome will be the sale of these assets on vacancy, the more
appropriate classification is as trading stock. This has been
corrected retrospectively through a prior year adjustment.
There is no impact on the accounts for the year ended 
30 September 2005 and prior but the accounts for the 
year ended 30 September 2006 have been restated. The 
assets have been reduced from market value to historical 
cost by deducting £0.5m both from the 2006 revaluation 
gain in the 2006 income statement and from the value of
investment property.
The assets have then been correctly shown as trading stock
rather than as investment property with the result that trading
stock in the 30 September 2006 balance sheet has increased
by £32.8m and investment property has decreased by the
same amount. Sales of assets of £0.5m and the related cost 
of sales of £0.2m have been moved from profit on disposal 
of investment property and added to profit on disposal of
trading property. The additional profit arising is insignificant.
Transfer of assets to the JPUT
Included within the assets transferred to the JPUT on 
1 December 2005 were properties with a carrying amount, 
at cost, of £43.5m that had been classified as trading stock. 
On transfer, these assets were reclassified as investment
properties and a revaluation gain of £23.5m to take their 
value up to market value was recognised in the 2006 income
statement. A tax charge of £7.0m arose in respect of this
transfer. However, this reclassification did not comply with 
the requirements of IAS 40 paragraph 57 which explains the
circumstances which provide evidence of a change in use of 
1 Accounting policies
notes to the financial statements
FINANCIALS 82 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
a property asset allowing a transfer between categories 
to be made. These assets were originally acquired for 
the purpose of long-term capital appreciation and rental
growth and, consequently, should always have been shown 
as investment property rather than trading stock. Indeed 
one of the main reasons why these assets were chosen to be
transferred to the JPUT was that they had always been held
for that purpose. Properties similar to these and retained by
Grainger are shown in the accounts as investment properties.
The error has been corrected by a prior year adjustment
restating the opening 2006 balance sheet (i.e. at 1 October
2005) and the income statement for the year ended 
30 September 2006. Retained earnings at 1 October 2005
have been increased by the revaluation gain of £23.5m and 
a provision for deferred tax of £7.0m has been made 
(see note 35).
The gain has been eliminated from the 2006 income
statement. The tax charge for 2006 is reduced by £7.0m as 
the deferred tax provision is released against the current tax
charge arising as a result of the transfer to the JPUT. Costs 
of £2.5m relating to the cost of raising equity investment in
the JPUT offset against this revaluation gain in 2006 have 
been transferred to interest expense. This transfer has no
impact on 2006 profit before tax.
The above changes have no effect on the market value net
asset value of the business or on its cash flows. Basic earnings
per share for the year ended 30 September 2006 are reduced
from 39.1p as previously stated to 26.0p and diluted earnings
per share from 38.9p to 25.8p.
(c) Basis of consolidation
i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purposes entities)
over which the group has the power to govern the financial
and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding
of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and
effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or
convertible are considered when assessing whether the group
controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from
the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are
de-consolidated from the date control ceases.
ii) Goodwill and impairment
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for 
the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group. The cost of the
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given,
equity instruments issued plus costs directly attributable to 
the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition
over the fair value of the group’s share of net identifiable assets
including intangible assets of the acquired entity at the date 
of acquisition. If the cost of the acquisition is less than the 
fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the
difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in 
intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures 
and associates is included in investment in joint ventures 
and associates. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose
of impairment testing and is tested annually for impairment
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains
and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
iii) Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the
group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Associates are all entities over which the group has significant
influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding
of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. 
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for
by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised
at cost. The group’s investment in joint ventures and associates
includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment loss)
identified on acquisition.
The group’s share of its joint ventures’ and associates’ post-
acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income
statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in
reserves is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-
acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying
amount of the investment. 
notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
FINANCIALS
1 Accounting policies continued 83
Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its
joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent 
of the group’s interest in joint ventures and associates. The
accounting policies of joint ventures and associates have been
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the
policies adopted by the group.
(d) Segmental reporting
A business segment is a distinguishable group of assets and
operations, reflected in the way that the group manages its
business, that are subject to risks and returns that are different
from those of other business segments.
The group has identified six such segments as follows:
� UK core portfolio;
� Retirement solutions;
� Fund management/residential investments;
� UK development;
� European tenanted residential; and
� European development.
More detail is given relating to each of the above segments,
and their geographical split in the chief executive’s review on
pages 32 to 39 and in note 3. 
(e) Foreign currency translation
i) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the
group’s entities are measured using the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the entity operates
(‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial
statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the
company’s functional and presentation currency.
ii) Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
transactions are recognised in the income statement.
iii) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including
goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation,
are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling 
at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses of foreign
operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates 
for the relevant period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net
investment in foreign operations are taken to the translation
reserve.
(f) Investment property
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for 
capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by 
the companies in the consolidated group, is classified as
investment property.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including
related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, investment property is carried 
at fair value. Fair value is based on active market prices,
adjusted, if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location
or condition of the specified asset. If this information is not
available, the group uses alternative valuation methods such 
as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash 
flow projections. 
Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount 
of the property when it is probable that future economic
benefit associated with the item will flow to the group and 
the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs
and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement
during the financial period in which they are incurred. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the
group’s investment properties are included in the income
statement of the period in which they arise.
(g) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost 
less subsequent depreciation and impairment. Cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition 
of the items.
FINANCIALS
1 Accounting policies continued 84 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amount
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when 
it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with
the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can
be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs
are charged to the income statement during the financial
period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on property, plant 
and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method 
to allocate their cost less residual values over their estimated
useful lives, as follows:
Land Nil
Fixtures, fittings and equipment Five years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, 
and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
(h) Financial interest in property assets
Financial interest in property assets is initially recognised at 
fair value plus transaction costs and is subsequently carried 
at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in 
value are recorded through the income statement based on
revised cash flows using the effective interest rate applicable 
at acquisition. Differences based on revised cash flows using
the effective interest rate applicable at acquisition compared 
to revised cash flows using a year-end effective interest rate,
assessed as the rate available in the market for an instrument
with a similar maturity and credit risk, are taken through 
equity. When gains or losses in the assets are realised, the
accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are
included in the income statement as gains and losses from
financial interest in property assets. Income received from 
the mortgages is recognised in the income statement on an
accruals basis. The amount credited to the income statement 
is shown on the line ‘interest income from financial assets’. 
(i) Inventories – trading properties
Tenanted residential properties held for sale in the normal
course of business are shown in the financial statements at 
the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes legal
and surveying charges incurred during acquisition together
with improvement costs. Net realisable value is the net sale
proceeds which the group expects on sale of a property 
with vacant possession.
Land and property held within the development segments 
of the business, including house-building sites, are shown in 
the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost represents the acquisition price including legal 
and other professional costs associated with the acquisition
together with subsequent development cost net of amounts
transferred to costs of sale. Net realisable value is the current
market value which the group expects to receive on sale net
of associated selling costs.
(j) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits 
held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months 
or less, and bank overdrafts.
(k) Income tax
Income tax on the profit for the periods presented comprises
both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected 
tax payable on the taxable income for the year using rates
applicable at the balance sheet date. Tax payable upon the
realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods 
is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the
associated deferred taxation.
Deferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet
liability method. Provision is made for temporary differences
between the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the
consolidated financial statements and the values used for 
tax purposes. Deferred income tax is calculated after taking
account of any indexation allowances and capital losses. The
amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities and is calculated using rates enacted 
or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date in the tax
jurisdiction in which the temporary differences arise.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the assets can be used. The deferred income 
tax assets and liabilities are only offset if there is a legally
enforceable right of set off.

(l) Employee benefits
i) Defined contribution pension scheme
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution 
pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the 
income statement in the period to which they relate.
ii) Defined benefit pension scheme
The group currently contributes to a defined benefit pension
scheme that was closed to new members and employee
contributions in 2003. The full deficit in the scheme was
recognised in the balance sheet as at 1 October 2004.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every 
three years. However, the valuation is updated annually by 
a qualified actuary for the purpose of determining the
amounts to be reflected in the group’s financial statements
under IAS 19.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet
date less the fair value of scheme assets.
There are no current or past service costs as the scheme 
is closed to new members and employee contributions.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities and the expected 
return on pension scheme assets will be reflected in the
income statement each year. Actuarial gains and losses will 
be reflected in the consolidated statement of recognised
income and expense each year.
iii) Share-based compensation 
The group operates an equity-settled, share-based
compensation plan comprising awards under a Long-Term
Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and a save as you earn (‘SAYE’)
scheme. The fair value of the employee services received in
exchange for the grant of shares and options is recognised as
an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The total amount to be expensed is spread over the vesting
period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to the shares and options. 
Awards that are subject to a market-based performance
condition are fair valued using the Monte Carlo simulation
model. Awards not subject to a market-based performance
condition are fair valued using the Black-Scholes valuation
model.
When options are exercised, the proceeds received net 
of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited 
to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
(m) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable and is stated net of sales taxes and
value added taxes. Revenue is recognised as follows:
i) Rental and similar income
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a
straight-line basis over the lease term on an accruals basis. 
ii) Service charge and management fee income
Service charge and management fee income is recognised 
in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. 
Other income is accounted for as follows:
i) Income from property trading
Profits or losses arising from the sale of trading and 
investment property are included in the income statement
where contract completion has taken place. Profits or losses
arising from the sale of trading and investment property are
calculated by reference to their carrying value and are included
in operating profit.
ii) Income from investments
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
(n) Leases
i) Group as lessor
The net present value of ground rents receivable is, in the
opinion of the directors, immaterial. Accordingly, ground rents
receivable are taken to the income statement on a straight-line
basis over the period of the lease. Properties leased out to
tenants are included in the balance sheet as either investment
property or as trading property under inventories. 
Where the group grants a lifetime lease on an investment
property and receives from the lessee an upfront payment 
in respect of the grant of the lease, the upfront payment is
treated as deferred rent in the balance sheet. This deferred
rent is released to the income statement on a straight-line
basis over the projected term of the lease. At each year 
end the projected term of the lease is reassessed and the
FINANCIALS
1 Accounting policies continued 86 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
remaining deferred rent is released to the income statement
on a straight-line basis over this reassessed lease term.
ii) Group as lessee
The group occupies a number of its offices as a lessee. After 
a review of all of its occupational leases, the directors have
concluded that all such leases are operating leases. Payments,
including prepayments, made under operating leases (net of
any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period 
the lease.
The net present value of ground rents payable is, in the
opinion of the directors, immaterial. Accordingly, ground rent
expenses are taken to the income statement on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. 
(o) Financial instruments 
Derivatives
The group uses derivative instruments to help manage its
interest rate risk. In accordance with its treasury policy, the
group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
The derivatives are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequently, the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair 
value is recognised immediately in the income statement,
unless the derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
in which case any gain or loss is taken to equity in a cash flow
hedge reserve. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required
to document in advance the relationship between the item
being hedged and the hedging instrument. The group is also
required to demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective
on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is reperformed
at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly
effective.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a
hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains
in equity and is recognised when the forecasted transaction 
is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a
forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the
cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is
immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on a discounted
cash flow model using quoted market information.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Derecognition is the point at which the group removes an
asset or a liability from its balance sheet. The group’s policy 
is to derecognise financial assets only when the contractual
right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires. The
group also derecognises financial assets that it transfers to
another party provided the transfer of the assets also transfers
the right to receive cash flows from the financial asset. When
the transfer does not result in the group transferring the right
to receive cash flows from the financial asset but it does result
in the group assuming a corresponding obligation to pay cash
flows to another recipient, the financial asset is derecognised.
The group derecognises financial liabilities only when its
obligation is discharged, is cancelled or expires.
(p) At fair value through profit or loss financial assets
At fair value through profit or loss financial assets are 
included in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in 
fair value taken through the income statement. At fair value
through profit or loss financial assets are managed, and their
performance is evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance
with the group’s documented investment policy.
(q) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair 
value of consideration received, net of transaction costs
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised
cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction
costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income
statement over the period of the borrowings using the
effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability
for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
(r) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for
notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
FINANCIALS
1 Accounting policies continued 87
impairment in trade receivables is established when there is
objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due. The amount of the provision is the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of
estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest
rate. The movement in the provision is recognised in the
income statement.
(s) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when a) the group has a present
obligation as a result of a past event and b) it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation and c) a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation.
(t) Dividends
Dividend distributions to the company’s shareholders are
recognised as a liability in the group financial statements in 
the period in which the dividends are approved by the
company’s shareholders.
(u) Assets held for sale
Where a group of assets are to be disposed of by sale
together or as a single group, they are classified as a disposal
group. The disposal group is classified as held for sale as
defined by IFRS 5 when they are available for sale in their
present condition and the sale is highly probable and 
expected to be completed within one year from the 
date of classification.
(v) Acquisition of and investment in own shares
The group acquires its own shares to enable it to meet 
its obligations under the LTIS. No gain or loss is recognised 
in proﬁt or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation 
of the company’s own shares. The acquisition cost of the
shares is debited to an investment in own shares reserve
within retained earnings. When shares are issued to employees
under the LTIS, a transfer is made at the average cost of the
shares issued between the investment in own shares reserve
and the share-based payments reserve all within retained
earnings (see note 35).
Where the group buys back its own shares as treasury 
shares it adopts the accounting as described above. Where 
it subsequently cancels them, issued share capital is reduced 
by the nominal value of the shares cancelled and this same
amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve.
(w) Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not 
yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements there
are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations
that have been published but which are not yet effective. All 
of these have been endorsed by the EU with the exception 
of IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession
Arrangements’, IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’ and
IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset,
Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’ and are
therefore likely to be mandatory for the group’s accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 October 2007. The group has
not early adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation.
The standards, amendments and interpretations that are
expected to impact upon the group are:
� IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. IFRS 7 introduces
new disclosures on quantitative and qualitative risks arising
from financial instruments. This standard will apply to the
group from 1 October 2007 and is expected to impact
upon the group by requiring additional disclosures in the
annual financial statements;
� IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. IFRS 8 amends the current
segmental reporting requirements of IAS 14 and requires 
a ‘management approach’ to be adopted so that segment
information is presented on the same basis as that used for
internal reporting purposes. This standard will apply to the
group from 1 October 2009 and is expected to impact
upon the group by requiring additional disclosures in the
annual financial statements;
� Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements
Capital Disclosures’. This amendment introduces new
disclosures about an entity’s management of its capital
resources. This amendment will apply to the group from 
1 October 2007 and is expected to impact upon the group
FINANCIALS
1 Accounting policies continued 88 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
by requiring additional disclosures in the annual financial
statements; and
� Amendment to IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’. This amendment
requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
a qualifying asset as part of the cost of the asset. A qualifying
asset is one that takes a substantial period of time to get
ready for use or sale. The option of immediately expensing
these borrowing costs is removed. This amendment will apply
to the group from 1 October 2009 and its impact is currently
being assessed.
The adoption of the following standards, amendments and
interpretations are not expected to have any material impact
on the financial statements of the group:
� IFRIC 10 ‘Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment’. IFRIC
10 prohibits the reversal of impairment losses recognised in
previous interim periods on goodwill, investments in equity
instruments or financial assets;
� IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions’.
IFRIC 11 requires all share-based payment transactions for
which services are received in exchange for shares in the
company to be treated as equity-settled. It also requires 
that where the parent grants share-based payment
transactions to the employees of a subsidiary that they 
be treated as equity-settled, whereas if the subsidiary 
grants shares to its employees the transactions are treated 
as cash-settled. This interpretation will apply to the group 
from 1 October 2007;
� IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’. IFRIC 12
provides guidance upon the accounting for public-to-private
infrastructure service concession arrangements. This
interpretation will apply to the group from 1 October 2008;
� IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’. IFRIC 13 requires
the credits given as part of customer loyalty schemes to be
recognised at their fair value as a separate component of
revenue. The revenue related to these schemes should 
only be recognised when the entity’s obligations are fulfilled.
This interpretation will apply to the group from 1 October
2008; and
� IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset,
Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’. IFRIC
14 states when refunds or reductions in future contributions
can be treated as available under IAS 19 and how a
minimum funding requirement affects future contributions 
or may give rise to a liability. This interpretation will apply 
to the group from 1 October 2008.

1 Accounting policies continued
2 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The group’s significant accounting policies are stated in note 1
above. Not all of these accounting policies require management
to make subjective or complex judgements or estimates. The
following is intended to provide further detail relating to those
accounting policies that management consider critical because
of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in
their application and their impact on the consolidated financial
statements. 
Investment property valuations
The group, after review by the directors, uses the valuations
performed by its own in-house surveying team to value 
its own UK-based residential investment property as at 
30 September 2007. A structured sample of approximately
25% of these valuations is checked by an external independent
valuer. Investment property in Germany has been valued 
by an external independent valuer as at 30 September 2007
except for acquisitions since 1 June 2007 where the fair value
as at 30 September 2007 has been assessed by the directors.
Investment property in the group’s joint ventures and associates
is valued by external independent valuers. In the UK the
majority of the portfolio is invested in the type of properties
where demand is high. Accordingly, the valuers generally are
well informed and have good recent information on current
market values for properties similar to our own. Valuers also
make reference to discounted cash flow projections based
upon estimates of future rental income, property expenses
and an appropriate discount rate in order to value properties. 89
Trading property valuations
The group’s residential trading properties are carried in the
balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In
assessing net realisable value the group uses valuations carried
out by its own in-house surveying team. A structured sample
of approximately 25% of these valuations is checked by an
external independent valuer. Valuing the significant number 
of properties in our portfolio is a significant task and there 
are some subjectivities involved in the process. In particular, 
in relation to our regulated tenancies, we have no right to
know the age of the tenant and, other than for specific limited
purposes, for example, the annual gas safety check, we have 
no right of access to the property. Invariably, when our 
in-house valuations are compared to those of the external 
valuer, over 95% of the valuations are within a small acceptable
tolerance. Where the difference is more significant we 
discuss this with the valuer to determine the reasons for 
the difference. Typically the reasons vary but it could be, for
example, a different number of bedrooms, the possibility of
planning permission or the wrong flat in the block having been
valued. Once such reasons have been identified we and the
valuer agree the appropriate valuation that should be adopted.
Development trading properties are included in the 
balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Development projects with a cost of £86.0m out of a total
cost as at 30 September 2007 of £104.6m have been valued
by an external independent valuer. Of the remaining book 
cost of £18.6m, £12.2m relates to the group’s housebuilding
sites and £6.4m to the group’s development in Prague. These
have been valued as at 30 September 2007 by the directors.
Provision is made on a project-by-project basis to reduce costs
to net realisable value to the extent that total projected costs
exceed total projected revenues.
Valuation of financial interest in property assets
The valuation is based on an assessment of the future 
cash flows that will arise from our financial interest and on 
the effective interest rate used to discount those cash flows.
The valuation methodology adopted is set out in note 1(h)
above. Key assumptions are house price inflation (‘HPI’) and
the effective interest rate. The valuation utilised in the accounts
assumes HPI of zero for the next two years followed by 3.75%
per annum thereafter. A reduction in HPI to 3.50% per annum
from year three onwards reduces the valuation by £2.1m.
Distinction between investment and trading property
The group considers the intention at the outset when each
property is acquired in order to classify the property as either
an investment or a trading property. Where the intention is 
to either trade the property or where the property is held 
for immediate sale upon receiving vacant possession within 
the ordinary course of business, the property is classified as
trading property. Where the intention is to hold the property
for its long-term rental yield and/or capital appreciation, the
property is classified as an investment property.
Income taxes
There are some transactions and calculations that involve 
a degree of estimation and judgement and whose tax
treatment can not be determined until a formal resolution has
been reached with the relevant tax authorities. In such cases,
the group’s policy is to be prudent in its assessment of the tax
benefit that may accrue in line with the contingent asset rules
set out in IAS 37. Where the final outcome of these matters is
different from the amounts initially recorded, such differences
will impact on the income and deferred tax amounts reflected
in subsequent accounting periods (see note 14). 
Goodwill impairment
Goodwill primarily arises from the difference between how
deferred tax is calculated for accounting purposes and the
value ascribed to it in the acquisition negotiations. Generally,
the value of goodwill is supported by the fact that the taxation
cash flows will arise in future years and the discounted value 
of these cash flows is significantly less than the tax actually
provided. However, this position needs to be carefully
monitored and goodwill is tested annually for impairment.

As detailed in note 31, deferred tax has been taken direct to equity in relation to the actuarial surplus on the BPT Limited pension
scheme and the fair value movement in cash flow hedges.
The 2007 Finance Act gained Royal Assent during 2007. This Act reduced the corporation tax rate to 28% from 1 April 2008. As the
Act is substantially enacted as at 30 September 2007,  deferred tax has been calculated at this lower rate. This has resulted in a
reduction in deferred tax of £6.0m which has been taken through the income statement.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
The group has not taken all of the benefit in relation to capital losses brought forward and available for offset against subsequent
capital gains arising as this has yet to be formally agreed with the relevant tax authorities. If it is found that all the capital losses are
available for offset against capital gains, then provisions of up to £26m would be released over the coming years.
15 Dividends
Under IAS 10, final dividends are excluded from the balance sheet until they are approved by the company in general meeting.
Dividends paid in the year are shown below:

Ordinary dividends on equity shares:
Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2006 – 3.75p per share 4.9 –

Interim dividend for the year ended 30 September 2006 – 1.87p per share – 2.5
7.6 6.9
A final dividend relating to 2007 of 4.12p per share has been proposed by the board. If approved, this will result in a further
distribution of £5.3m and it will be paid on 18 February 2008 to shareholders on the register on 18 January 2008. The 2007 interim
dividend of 2.06p per share was paid in July 2007. This gives a total dividend for 2007 of 6.18p per share compared to 5.62p per
share in 2006, an increase of 10%.

16 Earnings per share
Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the group and held both in trust and 
as treasury shares.
Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding by the dilutive effect of
ordinary shares that the company may potentially issue relating to its convertible bond and its share option schemes and contingent
share awards under the LTIS, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2007 was the end of the
contingency period. The profit for the year is adjusted to add back the after tax interest cost on the liability component of the
convertible bond.

The group has valued all of its investment property as at 30 September 2007 at fair value. 
Investment property held in the core residential and equity release portfolios with a value of £236.9m was valued as at 
30 September 2007 at fair value by our in-house chartered surveyors. These valuations have been reviewed and approved by the
directors. A structured sample of approximately 25% of the in-house valuations was reviewed by Allsop LLP , Chartered Surveyors,
independently of the group. Based on the results of that review, Allsop LLP concluded that they have a high degree of confidence 
in the directors’ valuations.
As at 30 September 2007, investment property in our German portfolio had a fair value of £241.7m. All of the properties 
acquired prior to 1 June 2007 were valued at their fair value as at 30 September 2007 by Cushman & Wakefield, Chartered
Surveyors, Frankfurt. This valuation amounted to £163.7m. Investment properties acquired after 1 June 2007 were valued 
at fair value on 30 September 2007 by the directors. The value of these properties was £78m.
The assumptions relevant to the valuation of investment property are outlined in note 2 above.
A revaluation gain of £9.9m has arisen on valuation of investment property to fair value as at 30 September 2007 and this has 
been taken to the income statement.
The historical cost of the group’s investment property as at 30 September 2007 is £420.6m (2006: £370.4m).
Rental income from investment property during the year was £16.1m (2006: £17.4m).
Direct property repair and maintenance costs arising from investment property that generated rental income during the year 
was £4.2m (2006: £3.9m).
Direct operating expenses arising from investment property that did not generate rental income during the year amounted 
to £0.4m (2006: £nil).

being its value in use. The value in use has been calculated by reference to the cash flow projections for each business. The discount
rate used for the 2007 test was 6.87%.
In 2006 goodwill of £6.4m was impaired and an impairment loss for this amount was recognised in the 2006 income statement. 
Of this amount, the largest portion, £5.8m, related to goodwill that had arisen on acquisition of the City North Group in 2005.
Goodwill had arisen primarily from the difference between how deferred tax had been calculated for accounts purposes and the
value ascribed to it in the acquisition negotiations. The value of goodwill was supported by the fact that the taxation cash flows will
arise in future years and the discounted value of this cash flow is significantly less than the tax actually provided. During 2006, however,
when the assets from the City North acquisition were transferred to the JPUT, that tax was actually crystallised so that the carrying
value of the goodwill could be no longer justified by reference to future cash flows.
The gross amount of goodwill and accumulated impairment losses as at 30 September 2007 were £23.8m and £6.4m respectively.

annum above EURIBOR and is repayable within one year. The loan is secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets in the fund.
26 Financial risk management and derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Financial risk management
The group is subject to a number of ﬁnancial risks, in particular, interest rate, liquidity, foreign currency and credit risks.
Interest rate risk 
The group does not take trading positions in financial instruments but uses them to minimise the risk of exposure to fluctuating interest
rates. The majority of the group’s debt is subject to protective swaps, caps or collars or is maintained at fixed rates of interest (see
note 28). To protect itself against interest rate risk the group’s treasury policy is to maintain floating rate exposure of no greater than
35% of expected borrowings. As at 30 September 2007, 74% (2006: 66%) of the group’s net borrowings was economically hedged.
Liquidity risk
The group maintains a combination of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that it has sufﬁcient
available funds for ongoing operations and to meet planned future investments. In addition, the core business in particular is very cash
generative from its gross rents and sales of trading properties. In adverse trading conditions, new acquisitions can be stopped and,
consequently, we are able to reduce gearing levels and improve liquidity quickly.
Foreign currency risk
The group invests in property acquired in a currency other than pounds sterling. In such situations, it is the group’s policy to take out
loans in the same currency to act as a natural hedge against currency ﬂuctuations.

Credit risk
The group has signiﬁcant ﬁnancial assets held in cash and bank balances and in trade and other receivables. The group’s credit risk is
primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are shown net of provisions for impairment
(see note 25). Such provisions are made when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The group has no individually material risk as its exposure is spread over a large number of tenants.

27 Disposal group and assets held for sale
As at 30 September 2006 negotiations with investors were well advanced in relation to the sale of units in the JPUT and the
expectation at that time was that 80%, in total, of the units would be sold within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 
Accordingly, as at 30 September 2006, 80% of the net assets of the Trust, less an accrual for sales fees, were reclassiﬁed as a disposal
group under assets held for sale within current assets. The balance comprised the following:

A £112m 3.625% convertible bond due 2014 was issued in May 2007. Interest is payable semi-annually. Unless previously redeemed,
converted, purchased or cancelled the bond is convertible at any time up to 12 May 2014 into fully paid up ordinary shares at a
conversion price of £8.64. The convertible bond is a compound ﬁnancial instrument and the carrying amount has been allocated 
to its equity and liability components in the group balance sheet. The liability component has been determined by measuring the 
fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component. The discount rate used for this was a rate of 7.5%
compounded semi-annually. The liability component has been deducted from the fair value of the compound ﬁnancial instrument as 
a whole and the residual element has been assigned to the equity component. The liability element is subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The analysis of the loans and borrowings in the above tables is before deducting unamortised issue costs relating to the raising of the
loan ﬁnance.

Deﬁned contribution scheme
The group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme for its employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from
those of the group in independently administered funds. Pension arrangements for directors are disclosed in the report of the
remuneration committee and the directors’ remuneration report on page 67. The pension cost charge in these ﬁnancial statements
represents contributions payable by the group. This is shown in note 11.
Deﬁned beneﬁt scheme
In addition to the above, the group also operates a deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, the BPT Retirement Beneﬁts Scheme. The assets
of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by trustees and are invested with an independent investment manager. Costs
and funding are assessed with the advice of an independent qualiﬁed actuary using the attained age method. Actuarial valuations are
carried out every three years and the last full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 1 July 2004 with the valuation as at 1 July 2007
currently in progress. This scheme was operated by BPT Limited which became a subsidiary of Grainger plc in 2003. 
The actuarial valuation as at 1 July 2004 was based on the main actuarial assumptions of an investment return of 6.5% per annum,
salary increases of 5% per annum and inﬂation-linked increases to pensions in deferment of 2.5% per annum. The scheme assets were
valued at £10.5m and scheme liabilities at £13.3m, a funding level of 79%. 
The actuary has recommended an employer contribution rate of 28.5% in order to eliminate the deﬁciency over the expected
working lifetimes of the members. The actuary also undertook a Minimum Funding Requirement valuation as at 1 July 2004 in
accordance with the Pensions Act 1995. The value of assets of the scheme was determined at 101% of the liabilities of the scheme. 
The scheme was closed to new members and to employee contributions in 2003. Accordingly, there is no current service cost for 
the scheme.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the 1 July 2004 actuarial valuation but have been updated 
to 30 September 2007 by a qualified independent actuary.

The assets are held with AXA Sun Life in a managed fund. As the above table shows, the assets of the scheme are primarily held
within equities and bonds. The equity return of 7.6% in 2007 and 7.0% in 2006 is based on an equity risk premium of 2.6% above 
the 15-year ﬁxed rate on gilts. The directors consider this to be at the mid-point of the acceptable range. The return on bonds has
been determined by reference to actual yields.

The mortality table referred to above, PXA92c2025, is based on the latest commonly used study of pensioners carried out over 
the period 1991 to 1994 and includes updates for expected improvements in life expectancies up to 2025. For non-pensioners the
mortality assumption has been changed in 2007 to reflect the improvements in short cohort projections. The resulting life expectancy
for a future male pensioner is 86.2 years (2006: 84.8 years), and for a future female pensioner is 89.1 years (2006: 87.8 years). The life
expectancy for a current male pensioner is 85.9 years (2006: 85.9 years), and for a current female pensioner is 88.7 years

FINANCIALS
34 Share-based payments 
The group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan comprising awards under a long-term incentive scheme (‘LTIS’)
and a save as you earn (‘SAYE’) scheme. 
For awards under the 2007 LTIS, one third are subject to an absolute total shareholder return performance condition measured over
three years from the date of grant and two thirds are subject to annual growth in Net Net Net Asset value (‘NNNAV’) measured
over three years from the date of grant. One third of the awards, therefore, are subject to a market-based performance condition 
and these have been fair valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The remaining two thirds of the awards are subject to a 
non-market-based performance condition and have been fair valued using a Black-Scholes valuation model. 
Awards under the LTIS for 2006 and prior are subject to market performance conditions under which the total shareholder return
(‘TSR’) of the company is measured against a peer group. There is no vesting below median performance. If the company TSR equals
the median of the peer group 40% will vest. If the group’s TSR is equal to or greater than the upper quartile TSR of the peer group,
100% will vest. At points between the median and upper quartile of the peer group there is pro rata vesting between 40% and 100%.
Awards under the LTIS for 2006 and prior have been fair valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. 
Awards under the SAYE scheme have been fair valued using a Black Scholes model. 
The Monte Carlo simulation model takes into account the market-based performance conditions which effectively estimate the
number of shares or options expected to vest. No subsequent adjustment is made to the fair value charge for shares or options 
that do not vest in the event that these performance conditions are not met. Adjustments are, however, made for leavers and, 
once adjusted for leavers, the total expense for each equity-settled award is spread over the vesting period. 
For awards under the 2007 LTIS which are subject to a non-market-based performance condition, the number of shares or options
expected to vest is adjusted during the vesting period based on the best available estimate. On vesting, the estimate will be revised 
to equal the number of shares or options that will ultimately vest.
Options under the SAYE scheme are fair valued at the date of grant and are not adjusted thereafter. Adjustment is made, however, 
for assumptions about leavers. 
The tables below summarise the main assumptions used to fair value the awards made under the above schemes. For the LTIS, the
number of shares or options is shown for both the maximum number at award and the latest number as at 30 September 2007 
after adjustment for leavers. This same information is given for the SAYE schemes. FINANCIALS

The expected volatility ﬁgures used in the valuation were calculated based on the historic volatility over a period equal to the expected
term from the date of grant.
The share-based payments charge recognised in the income statement is £1.0m (2006: £0.9m). Of this amount, £0.7m (2006: £0.4m)
related to the LTIS share awards, £0.2 (2006: £0.4m) to the LTIS options and £0.1m (2006: £0.1m) to the SAYE options.
SAYE options awarded in August 2007 under the 2007 scheme have not been fair valued in the accounts to 30 September 2007 
as the cost to be charged to the income statement is very small in the context of materiality to the group results. Accordingly, the cost
of calculating the fair value exceeded the beneﬁt to be obtained. The 2007 SAYE awards will be valued in 2008 along with the 2008
LTIS awards.

40 Contingent liabilities
The properties in certain subsidiary companies forming a ‘guarantee group’ provide the security for the group’s MOF (see note 28).
The properties in certain of the group’s German subsidiaries provide security for the non-recourse finance raised in those subsidiary
undertakings.
The group has provided guarantees under performance bonds relating to its UK development division. As at 30 September 2007
these amounted to £11.4m (2006: £11.3m).
In addition, the group has an obligation, under the sale and purchase agreement for the land at West Waterlooville, to pay further
consideration should the site value exceed certain pre-agreed amounts. It is not possible to determine the amount or timing of any
such future payments due to the long-term nature of the site’s development and the associated uncertainties with respect to planning
applications. However, any future payments will not fall due until at least 2015 and will be spread over a number of years. 
41 Post-balance sheet events
In December 2007 the group’s €150m Euro credit facility was increased by €75m to €225m. This additional facility will be used 
to finance acquisitions in Germany, both those currently in the acquisition pipeline as well as future acquisitions. 
42 Business combinations

combined entity for the year assuming all business combinations effective at the beginning of the year 92.1
It is not possible to estimate the impact of valuation gains had the property assets been acquired at the beginning of the year and 
so the impact of the acquisitions on profit is shown at the level of operating profit before valuation gains on investment properties 
and change in fair value rather than at the level of profit after tax.
Goodwill in all of the acquisitions other than CAT, arises primarily from the difference between how deferred tax is calculated for
accounts purposes and the value ascribed to it in acquisition negotiations. Goodwill relating to CAT reflects the value ascribed to 
the associated market position and the distribution arrangements that were acquired with the portfolio.
The following fair value adjustments were made on acquisition:
For The Portland Group ‘Inventories – trading property’ was fair valued at the date of acquisition at £18.4m an increase of £8.6m 
over entity book value.
For The CAT Group and The ELM Group, an adjustment was made for properties held with lifetime leases to gross up the 
value of investment property to its vacant possession value with a corresponding adjustment to establish a deferred rent creditor
representing the lifetime lease payments received but not yet credited to the income statement. These adjustments were for 
£26.1m and £2.8m respectively.

statements and the part of the report of the remuneration
committee and directors’ remuneration report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the

not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent
company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part
of the report of the remuneration committee and directors’
remuneration report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in
the directors’ report is consistent with the parent company
ﬁnancial statements. 
The information given in the directors’ report includes that
specific information presented in the chairman’s statement and
the chief executive’s review that is cross-referenced from the

if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the report
of the remuneration committee and directors’ remuneration
report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the
preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent company ﬁnancial statements and 
the part of the report of the remuneration committee and
directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the report
of the remuneration committee and directors’ remuneration
report to be audited.

(a) Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis in accordance with the historical cost convention,
as modiﬁed by the revaluation of certain investments, in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable 
UK accounting standards.
The company has taken the exemption allowed under 
Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 from the
requirement to present its own proﬁt and loss account. 
The proﬁt for the year was £2.1m (2006: loss of £3.5m). 
On an historical cost basis, the proﬁt for the year would have
been £1.2m (2006: a loss of £3.9m). These ﬁnancial statements
present information about the company as an individual
undertaking and not about its group.
In accordance with the exemption in FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow
Statements’, the company has not prepared a cash ﬂow
statement because one is included in its own consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in 
FRS 8 ‘Related Party Transactions’, from the requirement 
to disclose such transactions on the grounds that it has
presented its own consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
(b) Accounting policies
The company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under
UK GAAP , rather than under IFRS which has been adopted 
for group reporting. 
The following accounting policies have been applied
consistently in dealing with items which are considered
material in relation to the company’s ﬁnancial statements.
(c) Tangible ﬁxed assets
These assets comprise ofﬁce ﬁxtures, ﬁttings and equipment
and are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation
and impairment. Subsequent costs are included in the assets
carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that the future economic
beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the company and
the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Depreciation is
provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life
of the assets which is assessed as ﬁve years.
(d) Investments
Investments in equity instruments that have a quoted market
price in an active market or whose fair value can be reliably
measured are fair valued under FRS 26. Fair value is measured
as the net asset value per unit held.
(e) Investment in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historical cost less
provision for impairment. 
(f) Taxation
Corporation tax is provided on taxable proﬁts at the 
current rate.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences
between the recognition of gains and losses in the accounts
and their recognition in a tax computation.
In accordance with FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax’, deferred tax 
is provided in respect of all timing differences that have
originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date that
may give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in 
future. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. 
 (g) Own shares including treasury shares
Transactions of The Grainger Trust Employee Trust Company
Limited and The Grainger Employee Beneﬁt Trust are included
in the company’s ﬁnancial statements. In particular, the
purchases of shares in the company by each trust and any
treasury shares bought back by the company are debited
directly to equity.

A £112m 3.625% convertible bond due 2014 was issued in May 2007. Interest is payable semi-annually. Unless previously redeemed,
converted, purchased or cancelled the bond is convertible at any time up to 12 May 2014 into fully paid up ordinary shares at a
conversion price of £8.64. The convertible bond is a compound ﬁnancial instrument and the carrying amount has been allocated to
its equity and liability components in the balance sheet. The liability component has been determined by measuring the fair value of 
a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component. The discount rate used for this was a rate of 7.5% compounded
semi-annually. The liability component has been deducted from the fair value of the compound ﬁnancial instrument as a whole and
the residual element has been assigned to the equity component. The liability element is subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest rate method.

The deferred tax balance relates to the tax on the unrealised gain relating to the revaluation of the investment in units in the
Schroder Residential Property Unit Trust. Deferred tax is provided at a rate of 28% (2006: 30%).
As the Finance Act 2007, which introduced a corporation tax rate of 28%, was substantially enacted as at 30 September 2007,

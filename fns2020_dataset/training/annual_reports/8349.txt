“Our 2003 results were broadly in line with expectations and reflect a satisfactory
performance in our core activities, achieved in conjunction with the implementation of
planned management changes and the withdrawal from non-core businesses. These actions,
taken under our new Chief Executive and Finance Director, will improve the quality of the
Group’s earnings and will do much to strengthen our platform for future growth. 
“We saw an increase in the pace at which contracts are being secured across the business.
With £1.7 billion of new work won in the period our future workload now stands at a record
level of £4.3 billion and firmly underpins our position going forward.”

Profile of operating divisions
Facilities Services
Through the Facilities Services division
Interserve is one of the leading players
in the growing UK facilities management
market. Our approach is to focus on 
key clients offering significant long-term
revenue streams, building a detailed
understanding of their operations and
adding value with an integrated suite 
of related services. These are tailored
through bespoke service-level agreements
and sustainable commercial relationships.
Our preference is for complex
outsourcing projects, where our 
change-management skills, integrated
management and direct-delivery
capabilities and our willingness to
structure risk and reward innovatively
set us apart from our competitors.
As the outsourcing market continues to
develop and grow we see a continuing
sophistication in service specification
and measurement and in transparency of
performance standards. By combining an
anticipation of these trends with our
broader-based service capabilities and
those of our supply chain partners, we
believe we are well positioned to deliver
on growing client expectation and to
maintain competitive advantage.
Industrial Services
Through the Industrial Services division
Interserve is a market leader in terms of
its breadth of service offering, its safety
record and its client relationships. The
UK market for outsourced industrial
maintenance services continues to grow
as more and more clients realise the
economic and managerial benefits
resulting from this approach to service
delivery that contributes to their own
competitive position in world markets.
Our approach is to provide an integrated
single-point relationship for our clients,
managing and controlling on their behalf
the interfaces between the various
services necessary to deliver effective
maintenance and successful project
solutions, as well as delivering those
services directly. Our clients benefit 
from this approach not only through 
a reduction in the direct cost of
maintenance services, but, critically,
from a reduction in plant downtime
achieved by improved efficiencies in 
the execution of planned and unplanned
tasks. As the range of services we 
deliver increases, Interserve becomes
increasingly integral to the infrastructure
support needs of our clients, which we
believe enhances the longevity of our
client relationships.
The division operates in markets where
safety and environmental concerns are
paramount and the ability to provide
effective safety and quality management
systems is a prerequisite. Our approach 
is to focus on continual improvement
from our already very high standards in
the knowledge that sustainable safety
and environmental performance is a 
key differentiator on which clients will
increasingly base their buying decisions.
As a reflection of our capability and of
our clients’ focus on this value added
area, we have, during 2003, established 
a safety training business unit within 
the division, which will provide services
into our existing contract base and 
also generate third party revenues.
Project Services
Through the Project Services division
Interserve specialises in delivering
building and infrastructure projects in
the UK and the Middle East through
framework agreements, PFI contracts
and negotiated relationships. In the UK
our approach is to work with our clients
in long-term relationships, delivering
our services from resources in both 
our strategic projects and regional
businesses, increasingly through open-
book arrangements providing supply
chain transparency and demonstrating
the added value of our co-ordination,
planning and management role. In 
the Middle East we work through our
associate companies almost entirely 
on negotiated and/or repeat business
contracts using our skills to deliver
business development and project
management in concert with our
partners’ market knowledge and 
access to the supply chain.
UK activities are focused mainly on public
service amenities and infrastructure,
where market conditions remain generally
favourable. Our involvement in the
private sector market in the UK is
predominantly through framework
agreements for ‘blue chip’ clients where
spend profiles are predictable and
relatively reliable. Overseas, market
conditions are driven by the macro-
economic environment in the Middle East,
which is seeing continued confidence and
was largely unaffected by the 2003 Iraq
conflict. In all instances our approach 
is characterised by partnering and
collaborative working with our clients
and our supply chain, founded on
excellent technical skills and a first 
class safety record. We believe that 
these attributes, together with our
pragmatism and consistent record in
delivering to time and budget provide
Interserve with a differentiated position
in our chosen markets. Equipment Services
Through the Equipment Services division
Interserve is a leading player in the
global system formwork and falsework
market, supplying a key service integral
to the delivery of complex infrastructure
and building projects in most parts of
the world. The use of system formwork
and falsework – the temporary support
equipment required in the creation of
substantial concrete structures – enables
construction processes to be designed
optimally and saves time and space
compared to traditional alternative
technologies. Trading globally as RMD
Kwikform, a well-respected and
established brand within its target
markets, the business operates around
two centres of excellence in the UK and
Australia from where design and
engineering support is provided to the
operating units in each country of
operation.
Equipment Services’ business model is
based on the hire and sale of its
equipment in meeting the challenges of
often demanding construction projects.
We offer engineering advice in the
application of the equipment as part of
each hire transaction and this, together
with our proprietary designs and the
ability to produce customised solutions,
differentiates us strongly in the market.
PFI Investments
Our approach is to invest only in PFI/PPP
projects where one or both of our principal
downstream activities of facilities
services and design/construction services
are involved. Therefore our investment
strategy is led by the growth needs of
our core businesses in sectors in which
we have appropriate skills and resources.
Where it is not desirable for Interserve
companies to fulfil all the downstream
delivery roles, we work with partners to
deliver the total PFI/PPP solution. We
also provide management and ‘back
office’ support services to a number of
special purpose companies. Our key
market sectors are health, education,
custodial and defence accommodation.

Chairman’s statement
Our 2003 results were broadly in
line with expectations and reflect a
satisfactory performance in our core
activities, achieved in conjunction
with the implementation of planned
management changes and the
withdrawal from non-core businesses.
Headline profit from continuing
operations* amounted to £30.7
million (2002: £47.9 million) which
was, in particular, impacted by
increased pension charges of £8.9
million (2002: £nil) and a provision
of £5.5 million in respect of the
Liverpool City Council contract for
the repair and maintenance of
council houses. 
Following a review of the activities
of the Group the decision was taken
to withdraw from businesses that
were unlikely to produce acceptable
future returns, thus facilitating the
concentration of resources and effort
on our core activities going forward.
Exceptional charges for the closure
of non-core, underperforming
businesses amounted to £24.9 million.
The restructuring has proceeded
largely to plan and is substantially
complete.
After exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation the Group
made a pre-tax loss of £2.9 million
(2002: £37.2 million profit).
As announced in February of this
year we transferred our contract
with Liverpool City Council to a third
party. This action was necessary 
due to reductions in the amount of
work available making the contract
unviable on a stand-alone basis.
Turnover from continuing
operations rose by 13 per cent to
£1.17 billion (2002: £1.03 billion) 
resulting from the refocusing that
has taken place over the last few
years and reflecting generally
improving market conditions. 
The public and privatised sectors
continued to provide the majority
of our workload and in the year
accounted for around two-thirds 
of the total turnover.
Improved working capital
management and cash received from
the disposal of assets in discontinued
businesses contributed to a reduced
net debt at the year end amounting
to £22.5 million (2002: £42.8 million).
Net interest payable of £3.2 million
was covered over 10 times by total
operating profit before exceptional
items and goodwill amortisation of
£32.1 million. 
Dividend
The Directors are recommending a
final dividend of 9.3p (2002: 9.0p)
bringing the total dividend for the
year to 13.5p (2002: 13.0p), an
increase of 3.8 per cent. Subject to
the approval of the shareholders at
the Annual General Meeting the final
dividend will be paid on 9 June 2004
to shareholders on the register at the
close of business on 19 March 2004.
People
I am delighted once again to thank
each and every one of our people
for their hard work, dedication 
and enthusiasm. They also deserve
particular thanks for their much-
valued support in a year in which
we have implemented significant
change in order to strengthen our
prospects for sustained growth. 
The necessary closures resulted in the
loss of approximately 500 jobs; I am
grateful for the professionalism shown
by those affected and wish them
every success in their future careers. Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003  9
The many talented people within
the Group possess a wealth of
professional and practical skills. 
The Interserve Training Trust, under
the guidance of John Jutson, has
done much to enhance this by
encouraging self-improvement
through training and qualifications.
I would like, on behalf of the Board,
to thank John, who retires from 
his position with Industrial Services
this year, for his sterling work 
in this regard.
Board
There have been a number of
planned changes to the Board
during the course of the year, 
most of which were reported at 
the Interim stage. They included 
the appointment of Adrian Ringrose
as Chief Executive on 1 July and 
Tim Jones as Group Finance Director
on 11 August. Since then Stuart Lee
and Clive Groom have retired from
the Board on 30 September and 
31 December respectively.
Stuart joined the Group in 1989 and
until 11 August was Group Financial
Director. I would like, on behalf of
the Board, to thank him for his
most valuable contribution to the
progress of the Group during his
tenure of office. 
Clive Groom was formerly 
Chief Executive of Building &
Property, a facilities services
business, which we acquired in 
2000 and at which time he joined
the Board. Again, on behalf of the
Board, I would like to thank him 
for his help and support in the
successful integration of Building &
Property into the Group and its
subsequent development as part of
our Facilities Services division. 
Strategy and outlook
In 2003 much has been done to
strengthen the Group’s platform for
future growth. Under our new Chief
Executive and Finance Director, a
review of the Group’s activities has
led to the closure of some small
businesses and withdrawal from
contracts that were not able to
offer the potential for appropriate
returns. The anticipated improvement
in the quality of the Group’s earnings,
combined with management’s
determination to drive growth in
our continuing businesses, bodes
well for the future. 
During 2003, the Group saw an
increase in the pace at which
contracts are being won across 
the business. The Group’s future
workload, now at a record level of
£4.3 billion, underpins our growth
potential and it is encouraging 
to see that our established track
record of achieving client retention
rates in excess of 90 per cent for
term contracts is continuing.
The markets in which the Group
undertakes its core activities
continue to be attractive, with an
encouraging flow of opportunities
for the short and long term in both
the public and private sectors.
Interserve is well placed to capitalise
on the considerable potential
available across the Group’s
continuing businesses.

Overview
During 2003 solid progress was made
in positioning the Group to deliver
increasing shareholder value from
sustained organic growth across 
its operations. Changes to the
business mix, achieved through
discontinuing four activities
1
, will
provide the Group with increased
focus and improved quality of
continuing revenue streams for 
the future.
Total operating profit from
continuing operations (excluding
exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation) was £33.9 million
(2002: £51.9 million), absorbed
within which was a pension charge
of £8.9 million (2002: nil), increased
National Insurance and general
insurance costs of over £4 million
and a provision of £5.5 million on
the contract with Liverpool City
Council, now transferred to a 
third party.
After exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation the Group
made a pre-tax loss of £2.9 million
(2002: £37.2 million profit).
Cash flow remained a priority during
the year. Year-end net debt was
reduced to £22.5 million (2002:
£42.8 million) through improved
cash management in the continuing
businesses and accelerated timing
on the disposal of assets from the
discontinued businesses. The resulting
average bank debt was £67.3 million
(2002: £82.1 million). Included within
this performance is the resumption
of cash contributions to the 
pension scheme of approximately
£10 million (2002: nil).
The Group reports operations 
under six main headings: Facilities
Services, Industrial Services, Project
Services, Equipment Services, PFI
Investments and Group Services.
Group Services’ operating costs
totalled £9.6 million (2002: £9.2
million) principally comprising the

The chart shows the turnover associated with Interserve's future workload for each of the years up to 2041
(when our longest contract – the PFI with Dudley Hospitals NHS Trust – expires). The chart is structured such
that it is possible to make a direct comparison between how the workload stood at the end of 2002 and the end
of 2003. For example, the workload at the end of 2002 for 2005 (i.e. three years ahead) should be compared
with the workload at the end of 2003 for 2006 (also three years ahead). These two bars are placed adjacent to
each other in the chart.
Future workload Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003  11
Facilities Services
The division traded in line with
expectations other than in respect of
the contract with Liverpool City
Council (LCC) where results were
affected by trading losses of £0.6
million (2002: £1.2 million profit) and
a provision of £5.5 million.
Significant volume reductions on this
contract led us to seek an exit,
which we effected shortly after the
year end. Excluding the LCC
contract, divisional operating profit*
grew by 14 per cent to £16.7 million
(2002: £14.6 million) as new
contracts came on line. Overall
turnover was £448 million (2002:
£396 million), within which MOD
works bills (which flow through our
accounts but carry no margin)
amounted to £128 million (2002:
£118 million).
During the year the division
achieved financial close on the £600
million Army Training Estate PPP
project and is now delivering full
services. The contract is for an initial
period of 10 years and includes
facilities management and firing
range operations at 130 sites in
England, Scotland and Wales
covering over 1 per cent of the UK
land mass. Other new work secured
during the period included contracts
with BT, City & Provincial, British
European Airways and the
universities of Birmingham, Aston
and Central England.
Our overall client retention rate
remained above 90 per cent. Among
contracts contributing to this was a
two-year extension, increased in
scope, to our existing five-year
contract with the Metropolitan
Police where we are now involved
in a range of managerial and
technical areas in addition to
providing services such as building
maintenance, security access
systems and special events support.
Other notable renewals and
extensions were secured from
Network Rail, Boots, Barclays Bank
and Royal & SunAlliance.
As the outsourcing market continues
to develop and grow we see an
increasing sophistication in service
specification and measurement and
in transparency of performance
standards. By combining an
anticipation of these trends with
our broader-based service capabilities
and those of our supply chain
partners, we believe we are well
positioned to deliver on growing
client expectation and to maintain
competitive advantage. As a reflection
of our performance in the market,
our future workload at the end of
2003 was £2.7 billion, an increase of
13 per cent on the position at the
end of 2002 (£2.4 billion).

Industrial Services
Divisional operating profit* from
continuing activities was ahead of
expectations at £11.6 million (2002:
£11.6 million) on turnover of £148
million (2002: £110 million).
Following an above-trend result in
2002 the operating margin of 7.8 per
cent  (2002: 10.5 per cent) is more
closely in line with that expected
from the new profile of the business
after the restructuring that has
taken place.
In addition to benefiting from the
improving market conditions within
our traditional petrochemical sector,
we have made good progress in
developing the balance of the
business across different market
sectors and in concentrating on
maintenance-led growth.
With regard to our client mix, 
the division has continued its
expansion into the marine
engineering defence sector 
through a growing relationship 
with BAe Systems in the Royal Navy
shipbuilding and refurbishment
programmes at Govan, Barrow and
Devonport. In the nuclear sector 
our term maintenance contracts
with BNFL have been expanded at
Sellafield and Dounreay and our
relationship with this client was
extended through recent contract
awards at Dungeness and, latterly,
Springfield. These developments have
enabled us to position ourselves well
for the substantial nuclear plant
decommissioning programme that is
expected to begin in earnest in the
coming years. 
High voltage overhead power
transmission work has also grown
and new relationships have been
formed with United Utilities,
Yorkshire Electricity Distribution and
Scottish Power. We now hold in
excess of 50 substantial term
maintenance contracts, with our
client retention rate remaining in
excess of 90 per cent.
During the year we accelerated our
plan for withdrawal from townwork
tube & fittings access scaffolding,
with the closure announced in July.
This, together with the exit from 
low voltage power distribution, is
enabling increased concentration on
developing the business in areas with
better long-term potential. The exit
programme has proceeded well,
yielding accelerated positive cash
flow from asset disposals and
working capital recovery.
2003 was the third year of our
approach to the industrial market 
as an integrated supplier of a broad
range of services and we believe 
that the benefits this approach
brings to both client and service
provider are proven. As a reflection
of this, our future workload has
risen to £571 million (2002: £544
million), representing both an overall
increase and greater certainty of
work during the year ahead, with
around 75 per cent of 2004’s
expected turnover secure at the 
year end. Looking further ahead,
there are opportunities available
both to expand our share of our
traditional market sectors and to
extend our offering progressively
into new growth areas.
Working in partnership
Chief Executive’s review continued Project Services
Following the exceptionally strong
UK performance in 2002 we
produced a satisfactory result,
reporting £15.8 million divisional
operating profit* from continuing
activities (2002: £17.7 million).
Within this result our international
operations contributed £3.6 million
(2002: £3.6 million), achieved despite
an adverse foreign exchange impact
of £0.3 million. The UK operating
margin returned to trend at 2.6 per
cent (2002: 3.3 per cent).
The business is now more clearly
focused following several years of
realignment and deliberate reduction
of traditional high-risk, low-margin
construction activities. As a result,
turnover from continuing operations
rose by 11.2 per cent to £476 million
(2002: £428 million).
Our Building operations made good
progress in all market sectors. We
completed and handed over the
buildings on the Hattersley and
Southampton schools PFI contracts
and began the construction of the
Defence Sixth Form College,
scheduled to open in 2005. In the
custodial sector we completed
framework projects at Hull and
Winson Green prisons and have
commenced new projects at
Wymott, Wealstun and Ranby
prisons. The key development in the
health sector was our selection as a
Principal Supply Chain Partner for
the national roll-out of the NHS
ProCure21 framework programme.
Having won the first contract to be
let under this programme, we now
have secured projects to date worth
in excess of £60 million with a
further £20 million in the development
stage. In addition to the examples
mentioned above, we have continued
to deliver substantial volumes of
work through our framework
agreements with clients such as BT,
Barclays Bank, British Energy,
Somerfield, Vodafone, Mapeley and
the Department of Work and Pensions.
The continuing Infrastructure
operations made excellent progress,
securing three Early Contractor
Involvement schemes for the
Highways Agency (the A5, A1 and
A30/38), which provide predictable
workflow from 2004 to 2009. The
programmes to exit rail cabling 
and signalling and foundation
engineering (Westpile) are well
advanced and have proceeded to
plan since their announcements in
July and November respectively.
Although Westpile made a small
positive contribution to operating
profit, the closures enable even
greater management attention to
developing the core operations and
remove significant risks and capital
expenditure requirements from the
Group going forward.
Internationally, the division operates
in the UAE, Qatar and Oman.
Performance was good during 2003,
with strong market demand driven
by increased US military presence in
Qatar compensating for a temporary
dip in confidence in Dubai associated
with the Iraq conflict. Towards the
end of the year significant contract
wins in both Dubai and Oman (the
Mall of the Emirates and Sohar
Refinery respectively) will provide a
sound platform for these operations
in 2004/05. Increasingly, cross-border
relationships in the region are an
effective channel for business
development and differentiation.
As a result of the division’s
concentration on framework
agreements and other long-term
sources of revenue, more than 90 per
cent of our expected turnover for
2004 is already secured, and we have
contracted revenues and framework
agreements extending out to 2009.
Overall, Project Services’ future
workload at the end of 2003 was
£1,025 million (2002: £764 million),
an increase of 34 per cent, with a
significant and growing proportion
comprising work from long-term
contracts.

Market conditions were mixed in 2003,
reflecting the stages of the underlying
economic cycle in each global region
and the lifecycle of key infrastructure
projects within specific countries.
We reorganised the division during
the year along functional lines. Business
and customer-base development are
now the key responsibilities of local
management in each country, with
design, fleet logistics, procurement,
marketing, systems and finance
organised and managed globally. A
new management information system
was successfully implemented in the
UK, with worldwide rollout planned
for 2004. This, combined with the new
management structure, will significantly
improve the visibility and management
of key business dynamics, supporting
margin recovery as we re-establish the
long-term profitability and growth
pattern of the division.
Overall, we achieved a divisional
operating profit* of £12.6 million
(2002: £13.6 million) on sales of £74.8
million (2002: £74.5 million). The full
year operating margin of 16.8 per
cent benefited from progressive
improvement through the second
half. Within this result profit from
hire revenue grew, compensating in
part for a sharp reduction in export
sales to the Far East during the year.
Strong performances were achieved
in Australasia, where record profits
were delivered in buoyant markets by
extending the customer base and
introducing a broader product range.
The UAE-based Middle East operation
increased operating profits over its
strong 2002 result despite a quiet first 
quarter associated with the Iraq
conflict. The operation made good
progress in developing cross-border
revenues in the region, with contribu-
tions achieved in Qatar, Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Syria and the Lebanon.
Our European operations experienced
quieter market conditions. In the UK
we achieved notable successes on a
number of major infrastructure
projects. Overall, though, the scale
and duration of these projects was
not comparable with those available
in 2002, affecting volume and
profitability accordingly. Management
changes in the UK operation, effected
towards the end of the year, are
expected to lead to operational
efficiencies and a broadening of the
client base in the future. 
In the Far East there was a slower
pick-up in the pace of activity than
we had hoped. However, design
activity and tendering on major
projects in Hong Kong improved in
the second half, with orders
beginning to be secured during
December and since the year end. 
Equipment Services’ future workload
is generated on a short lead-time, with
contract duration for hire usually being
less than 12 months. Nevertheless,
the projected infrastructure and
building programmes for a particular
country or region provide a basis for
establishing our expectations for
growth. Our current analysis indicates
the opportunity of substantial growth
and margin improvement in most of
our established operational locations,
with further prospects in due course
for expansion into new territories.

PFI Investments
The PFI Investments division, trading
as Interserve Investments, further
extended its portfolio during the
year taking our total of secured
PFI/PPP projects to 20 (2002: 15) with
two more at preferred bidder stage.
We achieved financial close on all
four projects for which we were
preferred bidder at the beginning of
the year, and one further project
progressed rapidly from preferred
bidder selection at the end of
January to financial close in May. 
At the year end our investment
commitment in the 20 secured
projects was £35 million (2002: 
£29 million).
In addition to the Army Training
Estate, three projects (Cornwall 
Fire Stations and Hattersley and
Southampton schools) became fully
operational during the year, while
the two major projects now in the
construction phase (the hospitals 
of University College London and
Dudley) are due for completion 
in 2004/05.
The five projects on which we
achieved financial close are:
• February – Peterborough Prison,
the first prison in the country
designed to house both male and
female prisoners, on which
construction is well advanced
• March – the £600 million Army
Training Estate project, which is
now fully operational
• May – the Defence Sixth Form
College, the project which
progressed from preferred bidder
selection to financial close in just
over three months
• September – the two Tyrone
colleges projects, where
construction is in progress and
interim services are due to
commence in 2004
Our investments in PFI/PPP special
purpose companies generated 
profit after interest of £0.3 million
(2002: £0.6 million). During the year
we injected £6.1 million cash in
equity and subordinated loan stock,
increasing the total already invested
to £20.4 million with a future
commitment, excluding projects 
at the preferred bidder stage, of
£14.9 million.
Our pipeline of opportunities
remains strong, with key bids in
progress in all our chosen sectors.
We continue to see PFI/PPP as an
attractive and important channel 
to market generating good quality
work for our Facilities and Project
Services divisions, and we will
continue to invest in projects as 
a means of helping to secure the
development of our core businesses.

In February 2003 the Interserve subsidiary,
Landmarc Support Services, won one of
the largest outsourcing contracts ever
awarded by the MOD. It was also one of
the largest Public Private Partnerships to
have been signed at the time.
The Army Training Estate (ATE) comprises
some 130 training areas and ranges in
England, Scotland and Wales and covers
approximately 1 per cent of the British
land mass. It is used by the armed forces
to train soldiers and give them experience
in a wide variety of terrains under diverse
operational conditions. Having brought
the management of all this land together
for the first time, the MOD recognised
that the skills required to control a large,
complex landholding are different from
those of running modern armed forces. It
therefore undertook an extensive
competition to find a long-term strategic
partner to assist in the management and
running of the ATE.
Landmarc’s selection for the £600 million
contract was the result of a number of
factors including Interserve’s experience
in working at a strategic level with the
MOD for many years, giving it a solid
understanding of the requirements of the
modern military environment. The
company also had a proven track record
of handling TUPE transfers effectively in
many other public-sector contracts and
maintains a philosophy of obtaining the
best from its staff by investing in training
and development.
The ATE contract mobilised in April 2003
and is now fully operational. The services
Landmarc provides include almost all
support activities not directly related to
the training itself. It runs the built estate,
camps and accommodation, the rural
training areas and training ranges and a
booking and management information
system. It also provides support to
Defence Estates on environmental and
other issues. In addition to the initial 10
years of the contract Landmarc will be
eligible for a five-year extension if it
maintains the successful performance
delivered so far.

Custodial/police 
Interserve Facilities Services’ contract
with the Metropolitan Police Service
(MPS) began in 1999. It is large, diverse
and complex, involving the delivery of a
number of related support functions
throughout the MPS’s operational territory
within the M25. This covers 350 separate
sites and more than 1,200 buildings
including New Scotland Yard, the police
training college at Hendon, offices,
garages, premises for housing and training
dogs and nearly 300 police stations.
The main services provided across this estate
under the initial five-year contract were:
• planned and reactive mechanical and
electrical maintenance, managed
through a dedicated help-desk
• security access systems and 
security services
• messenger services
• document reprographics
• mobile handyman force
•radio masts and towers (added during
the contract term)
• uninterruptible power supply systems
• special events
‘Special events’ covers a multitude of
planned and reactive activities such as
creating and setting up notices for events
such as Wimbledon, the London Marathon
and the Boat Race, providing and
deploying barriers, spotlights and other
temporary equipment at incidents and
making signage including witness appeal
boards. It even includes supplying and
using body bags and incident tents.
Interserve personnel can travel anywhere
in the country when the MPS’s expertise
is called upon by other forces.
As the five-year contract came to a close
the MPS awarded the company a two-year
extension worth approximately £60
million. Not only did this include all the
services originally provided, it was also
increased in scope through the addition
of several mainly managerial and
technical services such as statutory
inspections and surveys, traffic census
support and an extended help-desk
facility. These were previously supplied by
a third party and are worth in the region
of £5 million each year. As David Hill,
Director of Facilities Management for the
Metropolitan Police, commented, “We’ve
developed a partnership of trust with
Interserve over the last five years. The
company has shown its commitment and
its ability to deliver a high level of service
across our estate, which is why we’re
happy to award this extended contract.”
Metropolitan Police Service
Freeing the client to deliver its services 18 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003
Industry
With an annual production capacity of
over 1.5 million tonnes and covering 370
acres, BP’s Hull site is a strategic part of
the company’s worldwide operations. It
manufactures seven petrochemical
products on a global scale and is Europe’s
largest producer of acetic acid (700,000
tonnes a year) and the world’s second-
largest producer of vinyl acetate
monomer (250,000 tonnes a year).
Processing such volumes of chemicals
safely and efficiently requires an
extensive ongoing maintenance and
renewal regime of considerable scale.
Traditionally the diverse services
necessary to support the site would have
been provided by individual specialist
organisations such as instrument
technicians, pipefitters, welders,
electricians, scaffolders, painters, 
insulators, joiners and many others. 
Each of these would have had its own
interface with the company’s managers
and would have worked with its own
priorities and schedule in mind. BP
wanted a different approach and, in
Interserve Industrial Services, found its
ideal partner.
Interserve’s management approach, the
breadth of its service capabilities and its
exceptional safety record were critical
factors in BP’s choice. It won a three-
year contract for the provision of several
services in the highly complex, time-
critical environment and took on the
role of project co-ordinator, giving BP a
single point of contact instead of having
to manage multiple interfaces. The
relationship has since developed to
include more services and a deeper
integration with BP’s own managers,
such that the two companies now work
together as a single team.
In 2003 Interserve won a three-year
extension to its contract with two
further one-year options. Services
include project management, design 
and procurement, plant repair and
maintenance, mechanical and pipework
fabrication and installation, electrical
and instrumentation installation, civil
engineering and construction, building
services, scaffolding, thermal insulation
and industrial coatings.

Education
Having determined that three new
secondary schools were needed to 
replace and augment existing facilities,
Southampton City Council saw PFI as the
route which would deliver the schools
most efficiently and with the greatest
value for money. Interserve Investments
managed the Group’s bid and was
successful in securing the contract, worth
£37 million to Interserve Project Services
in design and construction turnover and
£25 million to Interserve Facilities Services
over the contract’s 28-year lifetime.
Financial close was reached in October
2001. The next month our Facilities
Services division began providing interim
services at the existing schools while our
Project Services division started the
construction of the new buildings
adjacent to these sites. 
The first school to be completed, on
schedule in April 2003, was the 900-place
Redbridge Community School, which has
been awarded specialist sports status. It 
offers state-of-the-art facilities and
equipment including a new sports hall
and gymnasium and first-class ICT rooms
and learning areas. The school also has 
a dedicated Hearing-Impaired Unit for
children with hearing difficulties.
The other two schools, Woodlands
Community School (shown in the 
picture, 1,050 places) and Cantell School
(1,300 places), also opened on schedule
for the Autumn term 2003. We created
classrooms, Learning Resource Centres,
laboratories for Science, Design &
Technology, Food Technology and
Languages, offices, kitchen and dining
facilities, gymnasia and sports halls, 
as well as outdoor sports facilities
including floodlit all-weather pitches. 
All three schools have a wing serving 
the local community, including nurseries
and crèches.
Once the new schools were open we
began demolition of the old buildings and
transferred operations from these 
to the new facilities, where we have
responsibility for a broad range of
services such as caretaking, cleaning,
catering, building maintenance, 
grounds maintenance, energy services
and security.

In 2002, aiming to improve efficiency and
value for money in capital procurement,
NHS Estates inaugurated the pilot of a
sophisticated framework programme
known as ProCure21. Interserve Project
Services won its place as one of only five
Principal Supply Chain Partners (PSCPs),
demonstrating the strength of its supply
chain and its ability to deliver good
quality projects reliably on time and to
budget – the fundamental drivers behind
the programme.
ProCure21, covering all publicly-funded
construction projects with a capital cost
greater than £1 million, has been
developed following comprehensive
consultation from within the NHS and
with experts from the private sector and
in academia. The partnering programme
not only removes duplication of effort in
the tendering process but also brings 
the best of the construction industry
together to deliver better value for
money and better clinical facilities 
for patients.
Interserve Project Services won the first
two projects to be released under the
pilot programme: the creation of
Withington Community Hospital and the
strategic redevelopment of St Helen’s
Hospital (shown in the picture). On the
strength of its performance here and in 
a number of further projects, and after
an exhaustive assessment process, the
company was selected as one of 
12 PSCPs in the national ProCure21 
roll-out announced in September 2003,
estimated to be worth an aggregate 
£7 billion over five years. Interserve’s
expertise in helping the NHS deliver
better patient care is now available to
over 600 NHS trusts without the need 
to tender in the traditional way.
South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust became
the first beneficiary when, just as it had
in the pilot, Interserve won the first
contract to be awarded in the national
programme: the construction of new
facilities and the refurbishment of
existing buildings at Friarage Hospital 
in Northallerton, North Yorkshire.

Commerce
In October 2000 Interserve Project
Services became one of only four Tier 1
Suppliers to be named in the framework
programme set up by BT to improve the
speed, predictability and value of the
property services provided to its
businesses. The programme, with an 
initial length of six years and the option
to extend for a further two, covers 
both high value, low volume capital
projects and high volume, lower value
maintenance projects throughout the UK.
Interserve’s culture, organisation and
structure have been developed to
cultivate partnering relationships with
suppliers and sub-contractors in order to
capture their capacity for creativity and
innovation. This, combined with our well-
established national network of offices
linked to a core team acting as a centre 
of excellence, led BT to select Interserve
for the framework agreement.
We have successfully completed many
projects under the programme and are
working on several others. Among those
completed are: the new headquarters for
BT Global Services in Watford – BT’s most
advanced office yet with future-proofed
IT systems and wireless data transfer
capabilities; high specification offices for
BT Retail in Leeds (shown in the picture);
lifecycle replacement works to the roofs
and other elements of a number of
telephone exchanges across the country
(25 in 2003 alone); and the upgrading of
six BT Call Centres to New Generation
Contact Centres.
The BT framework programme is
characterised by teamwork,
transparency and shared knowledge. 
A key tenet is that experience gained 
as projects are undertaken should be
applied to future work in a process of
continuous improvement. In addition 
to the positive customer feedback
received, one measure of this is that 
the Interserve partnership has succeeded
in reducing the construction cost per
square metre by 12 per cent over the
three-year life of the programme to date.

Infrastructure
When disaster struck the newly-
constructed Boadilla Tunnel outside
Madrid, Spain, the contractor, a joint
venture of the four biggest Spanish
construction companies, needed a fast,
high-quality and cost-effective way of
rebuilding it. Interserve’s Equipment
Services division provided the solution.
The M50 motorway will, when complete,
circle Madrid in much the same way as
the M25 circles London. A section of this
outer ring road passes through the
residential community of Boadilla, some
9 miles to the west of Madrid. In order 
to maintain the community’s integrity 
an artificial tunnel, 225 metres long and
designed to carry three lanes of traffic,
was constructed by excavating the
ground, creating a tunnel shell and
finally covering the shell with soil. It 
was during this last stage that things
went wrong: part of the tunnel collapsed
under the weight of the earth on top 
of it.
The contractor called in specialist
engineers from Interserve Equipment
Services to devise a method of rebuilding
the damaged section. Although
Interserve had not been involved in 
the original project, its design offered
significant savings in construction time
compared to the alternatives considered.
The design began with building a
falsework frame outside the tunnel then
placing curved formwork panels on top
on lengthways steel beams. The whole
structure was towed into the tunnel in
modules and the new section of tunnel
shell was then created by pouring
concrete around the form in three
carefully-controlled operations, the
equipment being moved along the
freshly-created tunnel between 
each pour.
This approach, using largely standard
materials and avoiding the need for 
a rail-mounted system, reduced the
amount of equipment needed and saved
the team valuable time on site – with 
the result that this section of the M50,
carrying approximately 80,000 cars a
day, will be open some two to three
months earlier than would otherwise
have been possible.

Central and local government
In the late 1990s the Inland Revenue and
the Department of Social Security (later
to become the Department for Work and
Pensions) decided to consolidate
operations at 12 sites in the north-east of
England into just four. They selected an
Interserve joint venture with AMEC to
deliver the PFI project.
The redevelopment of the Newcastle
Estate began in February 1998 with major
refurbishment and remedial works by
Interserve at two existing sites at Durham
House, Washington, and Tyne View Park,
Newcastle. Meanwhile AMEC undertook
two new developments at Benton Park,
Newcastle, and Waterview Park, 2 miles
from Washington town centre. In tandem
with this, Interserve managed the staged
transfer of over 12,000 staff and a variety
of equipment from their old locations to
temporary and permanent offices.
After the initial phase of works
Interserve Project Services negotiated
two supplementary design and build
projects as part of the NEDFAR
(Newcastle Estate Development Further
Accommodation Requirement)
programme. The first of these was the
creation of a fast-track office building
and associated facilities housing about
600 call-centre staff at Tyne View Park
(shown in the picture). The second,
worth £45 million and awarded on the
strength of its performance on the Tyne
View project, was the construction on
the Benton Park site of a stand-alone
restaurant and four three-storey office
buildings to accommodate 2,400 staff.
The four sites, when complete, will house
approximately 16,000 people and cover
over 1.5 million square feet. Interserve
Facilities Services is responsible for a
wide range of services across the
different sites until 2029. Valued at a
total of £135 million over the life of the
contract, these services include:
• Estate management
• Engineering & technical services
• Building fabric repair & maintenance
• Grounds maintenance
• Window cleaning
• Pest control
• Fire protection systems
• 24-hour help desk
• Project management

Environment
Interserve’s activities have an impact
on the environment both directly
and in the services we provide to
clients when building, maintaining
and managing their facilities. To help
us focus on reducing this impact we
have adopted the following policy:
Group Environmental Policy
Statement
The policy of the Group is to
conduct its operations in an
environmentally sustainable manner
in order to protect the environment
for future generations.
In implementing its policy the Group
will seek, through its operating
companies, to ensure:
• Compliance with relevant
environmental legislation and
regulation
• Prevention of pollution
• The efficient use of natural
resources
• The minimisation of waste and
emissions to air and water
• Environmental awareness of all
employees
• Effective monitoring of
environmental performance
• Continual improvement in
environmental performance
The Group will set targets and
objectives for the improvement of
environmental management and will
publish details of its environmental
performance.
All employees have a role to play 
in care of the environment. The
Group has appointed a director to
be responsible for environmental
issues, and environmental
responsibilities are allocated 
to line management throughout 
the organisation.
This policy will be subject to
periodic review to ensure it
continues to meet the Group’s
environmental requirements.
Environmental Management
Standard ISO 14001
Operating companies are responsible
for developing arrangements to
manage their environmental impact.
This is generally achieved through
adopting an Environmental
Management System (EMS) that
meets the requirements of ISO 14001.
ISO 14001 is the internationally
recognised standard for EMSs. It
specifies a process for controlling and
improving a company’s environmental
performance and consists of:
• General requirements 
• Environmental policy 
• Planning 
• Implementation and operation 
• Checking and corrective action 
• Management review
In the 2002 report and accounts 
we reported that we were working
towards ISO 14001 registration in
Interserve (Defence) Ltd, which is
part of the Facilities Services
division, and in the various area
offices of the Regional Services
section of Project Services’ Building
group. Interserve Defence achieved
accreditation in 2003 as did the
first of Building group’s regional
offices, South Wales. Our approach
with these offices is to progress 
in a sequential programme and the
remaining locations aim to receive
accreditation during 2004.
We continue to hold ISO 14001
registration in:
• our contracts with the Office 
for National Statistics and 
the Cumberland Infirmary 
(in Facilities Services)
• the Industrial Services office 
with responsibility for Safety,
Health and the Environment,
where the EMS was successfully
audited for re-registration and is
implemented company-wide
• the Infrastructure group (Civils
and Water) within Project Services
• the Strategic Projects group

Environmental impact
An overall assessment of the
environmental effect of the Group’s
operations identifies the following
main impacts:
• Carbon dioxide emissions from
direct and indirect energy
consumption
• Waste generation and disposal
from offices and sites
• Natural resource usage
• Potential for pollution incidents
Carbon dioxide emissions
Carbon dioxide emissions represent
the Group’s main environmental
impact. The key elements are:
• Fuel (diesel and petrol)
consumption in company cars,
vans and commercial vehicles
• Gas, oil and electricity
consumption for office and 
site heating
• Other transport used by employees
on company business (planes,
trains etc.) and transportation of
material to and from sites
Interserve is increasing its data
collection activities to help monitor
these factors. Our estimate of carbon
dioxide emissions in 2003 is 30.9
tonnes per £million of turnover
(37,440 tonnes in total), apportioned
as shown in the diagram below. 
Waste generation and disposal
While policies and systems are
generated at Group, divisional or
business unit level, implementing
these is generally the responsibility
of individual offices or sites. The
following are examples of how we
are doing this.
• Industrial Services’ Liverpool site
introduced aluminium can and
mobile phone recycling and
recorded increases in the amount
of paper (+46 per cent), ink
cartridges (+48  per cent), laser
cartridges (+67 per cent) and
photocopier cartridges (+61 per
cent) recycled.
• Facilities Services liaised with
wildlife consultants and advised
the MOD on amendments to the
planned maintenance regime at
its RNAS Yeovilton site in order to
allow a colony of crested newts
discovered in the ditches on the
camp to thrive.
• Innovative solutions have been
applied to minimising the
environmental impact in
Industrial Services’ contract to
paint the Avonmouth Bridge:
• specially-designed dust
extraction units allow the shot-
blasting medium to be reused while
minimising the emissions of lead
paint dust into the atmosphere
• an estimated 8,250 drums
would normally have been used
to provide the paint. A paint
system has been designed that
allows paint to be delivered in
bulk, with only a neoprene liner
to be disposed of. This removes
the requirement to dispose of the
paint tins as special waste and
also minimises wastage of the
paint being used
• All Project Services’ construction
sites are required to address
waste-handling issues through
their site management plan. 
For instance:
• a mobile crusher was brought
in at Ashford, Middlesex, where
the new prison is being built, so
that waste building blocks could
be crushed and used as fill on site
• the material arising from the
demolition of the buildings on
the Peterborough Prison contract
was processed and the hard core
used for site preparation and
landscaping
• Site Services, part of the Project
Services division, provides a
waste-handling service and
operates a waste transfer station.
Waste is collected from
Interserve’s and other clients’
sites and is segregated and
consolidated. In 2003 the station
recovered a total of 4,148 tonnes
which would otherwise have
gone to landfill – an increase of
over 170 per cent. Recovered
materials include timber, metals
and hardcore.
• When Equipment Services’
products need to be repainted,
water-based rather than solvent-
based paints are used. There is
also a programme of installing
filtration in all the branches
carrying out this activity to
remove particulates from the
atmosphere. In the longer term,
products are progressively being
galvanised to avoid repainting.
Corporate Social Responsibility continued

Estimate of apportioned carbon dioxide 
emissions in 2003 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003  27
Natural resource usage
There is little use of water as a process
component and most consumption is
in an office or site environment to
provide welfare facilities.
We use aggregates and timber in
construction and shop-fitting
activities. The materials used are
often specified by the client but
wherever possible we look at using
recycled aggregates and timber from
sustainable sources.
Equipment Services’ equipment is
made mainly from metals such as
steel and aluminium and is designed
to have a long life. Products which
are damaged are either repaired and
placed back in the fleet or are
recycled. Those products which are
made of wood are from sustainable
sources.
Potential pollution
One of the key objectives of 
the environmental management
arrangements implemented is 
to avoid pollution incidents. 
During 2003 there were:
• no cases of enforcement action
taken against the Group by the
Environment Agency
• no incidents of pollution
reportable to the Environment
Agency
Social and ethical
Diversity and equal opportunities
Interserve is committed to a policy
of diversity and equal opportunities
in its employment practices. Our
policy supports the fundamental
belief that all our employees,
including potential recruits, are
equal regardless of gender, race,
disability, sexual orientation, age,
religion, religious belief or any other
reason that might be assumed to
limit their contribution or potential.
As far as possible the structure of
the workforce should reflect the
diversity of Interserve’s external
stakeholders.
All employees have a personal
responsibility for the practical
application of equal opportunities,
demonstrated by respect for the
individual, in their everyday 
dealings and working relationships
with colleagues, customers, 
suppliers and other parties.
Ethics
It is important that individuals
throughout all of Interserve’s
operations retain a set of core values
and approaches to the process of
doing business. The reputation of the
Group and the trust and confidence
of those with whom it deals are
among its most vital resources, and
the protection of these is of
fundamental importance. We
demand and maintain high ethical
standards in carrying out our
business activities and tolerate no
form of corrupt practice. To support
an open and honest operating
environment, Interserve has a
whistleblowing policy and procedure
which is available to all employees.
Our ethical policy includes guidance
for managing our relationships with
customers, suppliers and competitors
and addresses the specific issues
associated with international
business. We consider harassment of
any employee for any reason to be
unacceptable.
Investors in People
Investors in People (IiP) is the
national standard which sets a level
of good practice for training and
development of people to achieve
business goals. It provides a
framework for improving business
performance and competitiveness
through a planned approach to
setting and communicating business
objectives and developing people to
meet these objectives.
Interserve has achieved accreditation
at its head office and at locations
within all of its principal operating
divisions. We shall continue to be
reviewed regularly against the
standard in order to gain the benefits
of ongoing improvement, both for
our people and for the business.
During 2003 we increased our
investment in training and
development across the Group to
£1.8 million (2002: £1.4 million).

Charitable giving
Interserve believes in contributing 
to the well-being of the communities
in which it operates. We have a
programme which operates at
different levels: at Group level we
have a chosen charity and make an
annual donation (£25,000 in 2003);
we encourage business units to run
charitable events, either for the
chosen Group charity or for another
cause that is important to the area
or the people involved; and we offer
support for employees to undertake
sponsored activities.
Over the last two years we have
worked with SportsAid, a charity set
up to assist young athletes and
sportspeople between the ages of 12
and 18 by helping cover the costs of
their training and travelling. During
our association with SportsAid
Interserve staff have made a great
difference to the lives of many
young people, raising grants through
a wide variety of events. In all, some
£7,000 raised by staff has been
donated to 28 young athletes in
addition to the £50,000 donated by
the Company. We are hopeful that
some of these may one day be as
successful in their chosen sports as
SportsAid alumni such as Sir Steve
Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent, Paula
Radcliffe and Tanni Grey-Thompson.
Among the recipients of grants in
2003 were:
• David Smith, a partially-sighted
boccia player who became
national champion in 2003 and
has been selected to take part in
the Paralympics in Beijing in 2008.
The grants for David and for
Michael Wood (see below) were
made possible by combining
funds raised in a range of
activities across the Group.
• Trampolinist Michael Wood, 14,
who has consistently come in the
top 10 in the under-18 category
and has been included in the
British Youth Squad.
• Shaun Thompson, a Slough ice
hockey player who has played for
the England under-16s and is hope-
ful of places in the under-17s and
the Great Britain under-18s. His
grant came from the Facilities
Services office managing the Slough
council contract. Shaun’s younger
brother Carl is also a recipient.
• Cross-country runner India Lee
from Hampshire, who came
eighth overall in the 2003
national cross country under-15s
competition. Her grant, the final
one made in conjunction with
SportsAid, resulted from a raffle
organised by the staff and
contractors at DHE 2, Warminster
(a Facilities Services contract for
the MOD). As this raised over
£1,000 there was also enough to
enable a substantial donation to
the local rugby club.
Interserve has now chosen another
charity with which to work over the
next two years: Macmillan Cancer
Relief. Macmillan provides expert
care and practical support to
improve the quality of life for
people living with cancer. Its
activities include funding specialist
Macmillan nurses and doctors,
building cancer care centres and
providing a range of information
and support services. We are
forming committees in each of 
our divisions that will help organise
fund-raising events and assist
individuals in sponsored activities.
Corporate Social Responsibility continued Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003  29
Group companies, business units and
employees also raised money for a
wide range of other causes during
the year – too many to be included
here. Among the activities and the
beneficiaries were:
• All Interserve divisions took part
in the Financial Times’ Crisis at
Christmas Card Challenge, where
money is donated to charity
instead of being spent on
Christmas cards. £7,800 was
raised in 2003 of which £2,000
was donated to the appeal with
the remainder being distributed
among four other charities: the
Anthony Nolan Trust, Riding for
the Disabled, Samaritans and
Barnardo’s. Each received £1,450. 
• Jo Colvill, an accounts assistant
at the Group’s head office,
undertook a sponsored bike ride
in Cuba in which she raised
£2,800 for the Camden Society, a
day-care centre for the mentally
and physically handicapped.
• Project Services staff and
contractors at Harmondsworth
Detention Centre undertook a
variety of activities to raise over
£5,000 for the British Kidney
Patient Association.
• Staff at the Group’s head office
took part in the ‘Race for Life’ for
Cancer Research UK raising over
£1,300 for the charity.
• Facilities Services gave £2,500 to
INSPIRE in sponsorship of a
charity polo match between
National Hunt Jockeys and Three
Day Eventers. It also designed and
produced the official invitations.
The INSPIRE Foundation funds
medical research into the
recovery of mobility following
spinal cord injury.
• Following a donation of £5,000
by Interserve to Project Compass
in 2003, a representative of
Facilities Services is now a
member of the steering group
alongside a number of leading
charities, businesses and the
government. Project Compass is
an initiative to address
homelessness among ex-service
men and women. It seeks to
establish a support structure to
enable these vulnerable people to
move into and sustain
employment by taking personal
responsibility for their own
future success.
• We are the principal sponsor 
in the bid by Ecclesfield School
(one of the six schools built and
operated by Interserve under 
its PFI project in Sheffield) to 
gain specialist status for the
performing arts and have also
sponsored the school hockey team.

Ian Burns 30 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003
The Chairman’s statement and Chief Executive’s review of
operations provide an overview of the Group’s results for 2003.
This review provides further information on key aspects of the
performance and financial position of the Group.
Accounting policies
The Directors are of the opinion that a trade in property activities
is no longer being conducted by the Group. As such the profit on
sale of land and buildings has been shown as an exceptional item
in accordance with FRS 3 “Reporting Financial Performance”, with
comparative figures restated accordingly. The total profit made
from disposals in 2003 was £2.7 million (2002: £2.5 million).
The revised transitional arrangements of FRS 17 “Retirement
Benefits” continue to be adopted such that this standard has not
been implemented in full pending the introduction of International
Financial Reporting Standards in 2005. Full balance sheet and profit
and loss disclosure is, however, provided in the notes on the
accounts as if the standard were to have been implemented in 
full during 2003.
The introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards is
anticipated to first impact the Group financial statements for 2005.
Work has been undertaken during the year in preparation for this
transition to identify the main areas of change, assess the impact
that adoption will have and to determine and initiate the work
necessary to meet reporting requirements under the new standards.
Pending final clarification of requirements, the main areas of
impact on the Group financial statements are expected to be in 
the accounting treatment of defined benefit pension schemes and
of goodwill.
Exceptional items – disposals and closures
During the year the Group has announced the sale or closure of
a number of businesses on the basis that they did not offer the
prospect of sustained growth in shareholder value. Costs of
£24.9 million associated with the sale or closure of these businesses
have been treated as exceptional and trading results have been
reported as discontinued. The exceptional charge comprises
£20.5 million relating to closure costs and asset revaluations and
£4.4 million relating to the recycling of pre-1998 goodwill
previously written off to reserves. In all cases the closure
programmes have been executed on, or ahead of, plan. 
Interest
The Group interest charge of £3.2 million (2002: £4.0 million)
comprises both amounts due in relation to Group debt and the
Group’s share of the cost of non-recourse borrowings within
joint venture companies, principally in relation to PFI projects.
The charge can be analysed as follows:
£million 2003 2002
Net interest payable on Group debt (3.5) (3.7)
Interest receivable from PFI sub-debt 1.8 1.5
Share of interest in associates/JVs:
Interest receivable 8.8 7.1
Interest payable (19.5) (13.9)
Add: capitalised interest 9.2 5.0
Group interest charge (3.2) (4.0)
Interest receivable in associates/JVs reflects the increasing maturity
of the Group’s PFI portfolio and, in particular, the fact that 12
projects have now reached their operational stage (2002: eight).  
Interest payable on non-recourse debt held within construction
contracts is capitalised as a cost of construction until the project
is completed from which point it is amortised over the remaining
income-generating life of the asset. 
Taxation
Tax on profits before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation
of £9.3 million represents an effective rate of 32 per cent. This rate
reflects the mix of the Group’s businesses both within the UK and
overseas. A credit of £4.9 million relating to exceptional charges
gives a total tax charge for the year of £4.4 million.
Net debt and cash flow
Year-end net debt was £22.5 million, representing a net inflow of
£20.3 million over the year. This can be analysed as follows:
£million 2003 2002
Operating cash inflow

38.4 54.1
Interest paid (1.7) (2.5)

inflow from operations sold or closed during the period and before £nil
(2002: outflow £1.0 million) relating to exceptional operating costs.

Non-recurring proceeds represent proceeds realised from the sale or closure of
businesses and the sale of properties.
Finance Director’s report Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003  31
Free cash flow above is defined as cash generated before the
payment of dividends, investments in PFI equity and sub-debt and
amounts realised from sale or closure of discontinued businesses
and properties. Over the year free cash flow generation of
£32.2 million represented an increase of £16.3 million over 2002
despite lower profits and the resumption of cash contributions 
into the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme of approximately
£10 million in the year.
Average debt levels across the year can differ significantly from
the level at the balance sheet date. Through 2003 average net debt
was £67.3 million (2002: £82.1 million).
Dividend
The directors recommend a final dividend for the year of 9.3p, to
bring the total for the year to 13.5p, an increase of 3.8 per cent
over last year. This dividend is covered 1.2 times by Headline
earnings per share and 2.1 times by free cash flow during the year.
PFI/PPP investments
At the balance sheet date the Group had £35.3 million of committed
investment in 20 PFI/PPP projects which had reached financial close.
Of this £20.4 million had been invested at that date, with the
balance due to be invested over the next three years. During 2003
£1.1 million was returned to the Group in repayment of loan stock
principal and interest.
The Group’s share of gross liabilities of £304.9 million principally
represents non-recourse debt within these ventures to fund 
capital building programmes and working capital requirements.
On a further two projects the Group has been nominated as
preferred bidder but these had not reached financial close at 
the year end. Completion of these projects will entail a further
investment commitment of £5.9 million. In accordance with UITF
abstract 34 “Pre-contract costs”, third party bidding costs of
£1.0 million (2002: £2.7 million) have been carried forward at 
the balance sheet date in relation to these two contracts.
Pensions
The Group’s principal pension scheme is the Interserve Pension
Scheme (the “Scheme”). The defined benefit section of the Scheme
is now closed to all but a very few new entrants and those
employees who, under agreement, TUPE transfer to the Group 
from the public sector. A defined contribution section of the
Scheme has been established for all new eligible employees.
With effect from August 2003 changes were introduced to the
defined benefit section of the Scheme arrangements whereby
member contributions were increased for a given level of
benefit accrual.
During the year the triennial valuation of the Scheme was
finalised. As a result a number of changes have been made to the
funding arrangements in place for the Scheme. These include the
agreement to resume cash contributions by the Group of
approximately £10 million per annum. A full year’s contribution
has been made in 2003.
At 31 December 2003 the Group pension deficit under FRS 17 was
£88.8 million (2002: £79.0 million). Movement in the deficit during
the year was driven by changes in market conditions – principally
an increase in the rate of forecast inflation and a decrease in the
liability discount rate outweighing an increase in equity values.
Full FRS 17 disclosures are provided in note 7b to the financial
statements.

Group borrowings are principally denominated in sterling.
Previously these borrowings were predominantly on floating
rates given the general expectations for UK and global rate
movements. During the year arrangements have been put in
place by caps to protect £40 million of the Group’s ongoing
debt requirement over the next two to four years. 
Liquidity risk
At the balance sheet date the Group had total facilities in place
of £206 million. Included within this is the main revolving credit
facility which was extended and renewed in the year to £165
million with a five-year term. These facilities are sufficient to
meet forecast borrowing requirements for at least the next 12
months.
Foreign currency risk
In preparing the accounts, profits and losses from overseas
activities are translated at the average exchange rates applying
during the year. The balance sheet is translated at the year-end
exchange rates. The impact of fluctuations in exchange rate
during the year did not have a significant effect upon the
reported results.
The Group has a number of overseas subsidiaries and associates
whose revenues, expenses and net assets are denominated
principally in local currencies. It is Group policy to protect the
sterling value of overseas net assets where practical and material.
All material foreign currency trading exposures are fully hedged.

The directors of Interserve Plc present their report and the audited
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003.
Principal activities and business review
Interserve Plc is the holding company of a group of integrated
businesses providing facilities services, industrial services, project
services and equipment services in the United Kingdom and
overseas and with a range of PFI investments. The principal
companies of the Group, together with details of their individual
activities and their locations, may be found on pages 71 to 74
and in the Chief Executive’s review on pages 10 to 15 of this Report
and Accounts. Prospects for the future appear in the Chairman’s
statement on pages 8 and 9.
Group results and dividends
The Group loss from ordinary trading activities before taxation 
and after exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill was
£2.9 million (2002: profit of £37.2 million). The detailed results
of the Group are given in the Accounts on pages 46 to 70 and
further comments on divisional results are given in the Chief
Executive’s review. An interim dividend of 4.2p per 10p ordinary
share was paid on 3 November 2003 and the Board recommends
a final dividend of 9.3p per 10p ordinary share, making a total
distribution for the year ended 31 December 2003 of 13.5p per 
10p ordinary share (2002: 13.0p).
Subject to approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting
(“AGM”), the final dividend will be paid on 9 June 2004 to
shareholders appearing on the register at the close of business on
19 March 2004. The directors recommend that the retained loss of
£23.3 million be transferred from reserves, as indicated in note 26
to the Accounts on page 69.
Share capital
The authorised share capital of the Company is 150,000,000
ordinary shares of 10p each. During the year 792,344 shares were
allotted as follows:
95,000 ordinary shares of 10p to participants in the Executive
Share Option Scheme on the exercise of options at a price of 
212p per ordinary share; and
697,344 ordinary shares of 10p to participants in the Sharesave
Scheme on the exercise of their options at a price of 199.2p per
ordinary share.
As a result of the forgoing allotments, the issued share capital at
the end of the year stood at 113,756,332 ordinary shares of 10p
each (£11,375,633.20). 
The issued share capital at the date of this report stands at
113,756,332 ordinary shares of 10p each (£11,375,633.20). 
Details of outstanding options over shares in the Company as at
31 December 2003 are set out in note 25 to the Accounts on
page 68.
The Company has authority under a shareholders’ resolution
passed at the AGM held on 14 May 2003 to purchase up to
11,303,941 of the Company’s ordinary shares at prices ranging
between the nominal value for each share and 105 per cent of the
average of the middle market price of the ordinary shares for the
five business days immediately preceding the date on which the
Company agrees to buy the shares concerned. This authority
expires on the date of the forthcoming AGM or 14 August 2004,
whichever shall be the earlier. Shareholders will be asked to renew
the authority, which will include the purchase of shares for
treasury, for a further period of up to 15 months at the AGM.
The Companies Act 1985 requires that any shares issued wholly for
cash must first be offered to existing shareholders in proportion 
to their existing holdings unless authorised to the contrary by a
resolution of the shareholders. Resolutions giving such authority
were passed in 2003. Authorities to renew for one year the power
of directors to allot shares pursuant to sections 89 and 95 of the
Companies Act 1985 will be sought from shareholders at the AGM.

Corporate governance
In June 1998 the Combined Code (the “Hampel Code”) was issued
by the London Stock Exchange. This Hampel Code is based on the
Report of the Hampel Committee and sets out Principles of Good
Corporate Governance and Hampel Code Provisions which
consolidate the work of the earlier Cadbury and Greenbury
Committees and introduced certain new Principles and Provisions.
Section 1 of the Hampel Code is applicable to companies.
A narrative statement on how the Company has applied the
Principles and a statement explaining the extent to which the
provisions in the Hampel Code have been complied with
appear below.
Narrative statement
The Hampel Code establishes 14 Principles of Good Governance
which are split into the four areas described below.
Directors
The Board
The Board comprises five executive directors (seven during the
period under review, save for between 11 August and
30 September 2003 when there were eight), four independent 
non-executive directors (three from 1 January until 15 May, two
from 15 May until 11 July and four thereafter) and a Chairman
(from 1 July 2003, when the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
were split), whose biographies are set out on page 7 of this 
Report and Accounts.
The Board normally meets monthly throughout the year, 
excepting August, and has a schedule of matters specifically
reserved for its approval. There are also Audit, Remuneration,
Nomination, PFI, Treasury and Allotment Committees with defined
terms of reference.
The Board is responsible, amongst other things, for overall Group
strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major
capital expenditure projects, approving both material contracts
and contracts otherwise than in the normal course of business of
all subsidiary companies, employee issues and key appointments,
risk management strategy including Group insurances, health and
safety, and social, environmental and ethical matters.
Below the Board is the Executive Committee, comprising the
executive directors, Mr S Maroli, Mr B Melizan and the Company
Secretary, which has its own terms of reference.
Each operating company has regular board meetings chaired by an
executive director, save for the smaller overseas subsidiaries in the
Equipment Services division, which are visited from time to time 
by the relevant executive director and on a regular basis by the
divisional and regional managing directors, divisional financial
director and regional financial controllers.
Directors may, after consultation with the Deputy Chairman, take
independent legal advice in furtherance of their duties at the
Company’s expense up to a limit of £10,000 in relation to any one
event. All directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary, whose appointment or removal is a matter
reserved for the approval of the Board or any duly delegated
committee thereof.
The individual directors have different skills, experience and
qualifications with certain of their number presently or previously
working in other sectors of the economy, and are able to bring
independent judgement to bear on matters for consideration by
the Board.
Executive directors may be permitted to take a limited number of
outside non-executive directorships in non-competing companies,
subject to the approval of the Remuneration Committee.
Every director receives appropriate training on or before
appointment to the Board and thereafter as necessary.
Group Chairman and Chief Executive
The posts of Group Chairman and Chief Executive were combined
in June 1996 and remained so until 1 July 2003 when Mr Ringrose
took up his appointment as Chief Executive, with Mr Bottjer
continuing as Group Chairman. 
All operational activities report through the executive directors
who focus on co-ordinating the Company’s businesses and
implementing Group strategy.
The Board considers its non-executive directors to be of sufficient
calibre and number that their views may be expected to be of
sufficient weight that no individual or small group can dominate
the Board’s decision-making processes.
The non-executive directors have no financial or contractual
interest in the Company other than by way of their fees and
shareholdings as disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration report.
They do not participate in the Group’s share option schemes and
their service is not pensionable.
Directors’ report continued
For the year ended 31 December 2003 34 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003
Supply of information
The Group Chairman and the Company Secretary prepare detailed
agenda papers for each meeting of the Board, which are normally
circulated in advance of each meeting. The agenda papers include
sufficient information from management on financial, business and
corporate issues to enable the directors to be properly briefed on
issues to be considered at Board meetings.
The Group has a comprehensive system for reporting financial
results, cash flows and projections to the Board on a monthly
basis. These are compared with budgets approved by the Board
prior to the commencement of each financial year. The financial
summaries are accompanied by a written report explaining
operating and financial performance, and the cause and effect
of variance from the agreed budgets.
Appointments to the Board
Nominations for appointments to the Board are made by the
Nomination Committee, which comprises the Group Chairman,
who is chairman of the Committee, the Deputy Chairman, the
Chief Executive and at least one other non-executive director.
The Committee has its own terms of reference.
Re-election
All directors are required by the Company’s Articles of Association
to submit themselves for re-election every three years.
Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee, under the chairmanship of 
Mr Keys (1 January until 14 May 2003), Mr Padovan (14 May until
31 December 2003) and Mr Balfour (from 1 January 2004), considers
and determines the remuneration, whether by way of salary or
otherwise, of the executive directors. The remuneration of the
non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits
set out in the Articles of Association. The Directors’ remuneration
report is set out on pages 37 to 43 of this Report and Accounts,
and includes details of directors’ service contracts.
Relations with shareholders
The Company encourages two-way communication with both
institutional and private investors. The Group Chairman and the
Chief Executive, accompanied in the majority of cases by the
Finance Director, attended between them 93 meetings with analysts
and institutional investors in the year ended 31 December 2003.
All shareholders are given at least 20 working days’ notice of the
AGM at which all directors and committee chairmen are introduced
and are available for questions.
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
Detailed reviews of the performance and financial position of the
Company’s operations are included in the Chief Executive’s review
and Finance Director’s report. The Board uses these, together with
the Chairman’s statement and this Directors’ report, to present a
balanced and understandable statement of the Company’s position
and prospects. The directors’ responsibility for the financial
statements is described on page 44 of this Report and Accounts.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control
and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material mis-statement or loss.
The principal features of the system of internal control are:
• An established management structure comprising the Board
with its various committees and an Executive Committee.
• A comprehensive system for reporting financial results to the
Board. Each company prepares monthly results (excepting
January) with a comparison against budget or forecast, 
together with certain key performance indicators, which are
also presented in a consolidated form on a divisional basis. 
The Board reviews these for the Group as a whole and
determines appropriate action.
• All proposals for capital expenditure below £200,000 are
submitted for approval to the Executive Committee. Larger
value proposals and company acquisitions and disposals are
controlled by the Board.
• Manuals setting out Group policy and financial and operating
procedures are in place, with which all Group companies must
comply. These manuals set out the necessary levels of
authorisation applicable for different transactions.
• The Group has certain key areas which are subject to central
management or control, which include management information
systems, safety, legal, insurance, treasury and company
secretarial. These functions report to executive directors and
operate within defined limits and levels of authority.
• During the course of each year members of the Executive
Committee or other senior operational and financial management
visit all trading companies, including those located overseas, to
discuss and monitor performance of those businesses.
• The Audit Committee receives and considers a report from the
Auditors setting out their material findings on the audit of
individual companies. These findings are also considered by the
Executive Committee and matters arising are discussed in depth
with each company.
The Board confirms that it has established the procedures
necessary to implement “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors
on the Combined [Hampel] Code”. A risk management policy
document is available to operating companies’ staff as appropriate
comprising an introduction from the Group Chairman on behalf of
the Board, the Board’s own risk management matrix, the risk
management matrix applicable to their division and their own
company internal controls in order that they understand the
significant risks which are relevant to the tasks which they
perform, apply control strategies which are relevant to those risks
and carry out the fundamentals of good risk management.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by all companies within the Group has been
in place for the period under review and until the date of approval
of this Report and Accounts.
Directors’ report continued
For the year ended 31 December 2003 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003  35
Directors’ report continued
For the year ended 31 December 2003
Internal controls are reviewed in September and March by the
Board, which accords with the Internal Control Guidance for
Directors on the Combined [Hampel] Code produced by the
Turnbull Working Party.
There is an ongoing process to embed internal control and risk
management further into the operations of the business, to deal
with areas of improvement which are identified from time to time
and to derive the maximum benefit to the business through the 
use of risk management procedures.
Audit Committee and Auditors
The Audit Committee is comprised solely of non-executive
directors: the Deputy Chairman, Mr Padovan (Mr Keys from
1 January to 14 May 2003) who is its chairman, Mr Balfour,
Mr Keegan (from 11 September 2003) and Mr Trapnell (from
11 September 2003), and has written terms of reference which deal
clearly with its authority and duties. It meets at least three times
a year with the Auditors, the Group Chairman, the Chief Executive
and the Finance Director attending by invitation. The Committee
overviews the monitoring of the adequacy of the Company’s
internal controls, accounting policies and financial reporting and
provides a forum through which the Company’s external Auditors
report to the non-executive directors. Part of the Audit Committee
meetings are held between the non-executive directors and
external Auditors in private.
During the course of the year an internal audit department was
established and an internal audit policy and plan for 2004 were
agreed with the Audit Committee.
Going concern basis
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement,
at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a
reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.
Compliance statement
The Listing Rules require the Board to report on compliance with
45 Hampel Code provisions throughout the accounting period.
Save for the limited exceptions outlined below, the Company has
complied throughout the accounting period ended 31 December
2003 with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Hampel Code.
All executive directors have service contracts terminable on one
year’s notice save for Mr Hannah and Mr Lee, both of whom had
service contracts with two-year notice periods. On 27 June 2003
Mr Hannah was given two years’ notice of the termination of his
service agreement, effective from 1 July 2003, with a view to his
being offered a new service agreement in July 2004, terminable
upon one year’s notice. Mr Lee retired from the Board on
30 September 2003.
During the period 1 January until 11 July the Board comprised less
than one-third non-executive directors.
For the period 15 May until 11 September 2003 the Audit Committee
comprised two non-executive directors. Notwithstanding the
appointment of Messrs Keegan and Trapnell as non-executive
directors on 11 July 2003 their appointment to the Audit Committee
did not become effective until close of business on 10 September
2003. The Board considered that it was appropriate that
Messrs Keegan and Trapnell should attend at least one Board
meeting before becoming members of the Audit Committee.
However, Messrs Keegan and Trapnell were invited and did attend
the only Audit Committee meeting during this period of
non-compliance, which took place on 10 September 2003.
In July 2003, the Financial Reporting Council published a revised Code
(the “2003 FRC Code”) based on the reports of the Higgs and Smith
Committees, which were published in January 2003. The 2003 FRC
Code is not applicable to the Company for the year under review,
but the Company has begun the process of reviewing and revising its
procedures to enable the Board to report, as required, on compliance
with the 2003 FRC Code for the year beginning 1 January 2004.
Charitable and political donations
Charitable donations made during the year amounted to £27,500
(2002: £26,670). No political donations were made in the period.
Creditor payment policy
It is the Group’s normal practice to agree payment terms with its
suppliers and abide by those terms. Payment becomes due when it
can be confirmed that goods and/or services have been provided
in accordance with the relevant contractual conditions. Trade
creditors for the Company at 31 December 2003, calculated in
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985,
were 5 days (2002: 9 days). This represents the ratio, expressed in
days, between the amounts invoiced to the Company in the year
by its suppliers and the amounts due, at the year end, to trade
creditors falling due for payment within one year. As figures for
the Company alone are not representative, trade creditors for the
Group (calculated on the above basis) at 31 December 2003 were
70 days (2002: 67 days).
Health and safety
Health and safety issues continue to occupy a prominent priority
in all business operations as the goal of continual improvement in
safety performance is pursued.
The policy of the Group is that accountability for health and safety
performance is managed within the operating divisions. During the
year the Group Health and Safety Policy Statement was reviewed
and reissued under the signature of the Chief Executive.
At Group level, an executive director is appointed with
responsibility for health and safety. All executive directors are
accountable for health and safety performance in areas under
their control and within each operating company senior managers
are also appointed with health and safety responsibilities.
Performance is monitored by the Board by using monthly safety
reports together with more detailed quarterly reviews.
The range of risks to which employees of the Group are exposed
are all assessed and managed in accordance with legislative
requirements using documented company procedures.  36 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003
Directors’ report continued
For the year ended 31 December 2003
OHSAS 18001 is used as the model for the development of formal
safety management systems within each operating company.
Project Services have maintained accreditation of their
management arrangements to this standard. Development and
implementation of management systems are supported by the
employment of more than 52 full or part-time qualified safety
professionals.
During the year, various initiatives have been taken to improve
health and safety performance. These included:
• Industrial Services established a training facility to meet the
requirements of both in-house and external clients. Courses
accredited by IOSH, CIEH and IPAF are offered and during
the year over 80 managers attended the IOSH Managing
Safety course;
• a programme by Project Services focusing on vehicle and plant
management arrangements which reduced the incidence of
non-conformance recorded during inspections; and
• a pilot programme run by Facilities Services using the stress
management tools provided by the HSE on their website.
Operating companies have continued to receive recognition for
their safety performance through the achievement of national
safety awards:
Interserve Industrial Services RoSPA Highly Commended
Engineering Construction
Sector
Interserve (Defence) RoSPA Gold Medal
Interserve Facilities Services (Slough) RoSPA Merit Award
Interserve Project Services RoSPA Gold Award
BSC National Safety Award
(4 years)
Interserve Engineering Services RoSPA Gold Award
Other organisations and clients also provide recognition of safety
standards achieved with awards to individual contracts or sites.
During the year this has included awards from ECIA and the
Considerate Constructors Scheme.
The Group sets targets and objects as a focus for health and safety
and, for 2003, progress can be reported in all areas.
The number of RIDDOR reportable injuries to employees and 
sub-contractors reduced by 12 per cent over the year with a
corresponding reduction in the annual incidence rate of just 
over 1 per cent, the third successive year of reduction.
Employee involvement
Within the bounds of commercial confidentiality, management
disseminates information to all levels of staff about matters that
affect the progress of the Group and are of interest and concern
to them as employees.  Information on the Group’s strategy,
performance, range of activities, training developments and
charitable activities was given within the February, June and
September editions of Focus, the Group newsletter produced 
on behalf of the Executive Committee.
Disabled employees
The Group has an established policy that disabled persons,
especially should they become disabled in the course of their
employment with the Group, be employed where circumstances
permit. The Group endeavours to ensure that disabled employees
benefit from training and career development programmes in line
with other employees.
Social, environmental and ethical policies
A Board director is appointed to be responsible for the Group
social, environmental and ethical policies. A separate report on
Corporate Social Responsibility is contained on pages 24 to 29 
of this Report and Accounts.
Auditors
On 1 August 2003, Deloitte & Touche, the Company’s Auditors,
transferred their business to Deloitte & Touche LLP, a limited
liability partnership incorporated under the Limited Liability
Partnership Act 2000. The Company’s consent has been given to
treat the appointment of Deloitte & Touche as extending to
Deloitte & Touche LLP with effect from 1 August 2003 under the
provisions of section 26(5) of the Companies Act 1989. A resolution
to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company’s Auditors will
be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.

Directors’ remuneration report
For the year ended 31 December 2003
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the “Regulations”) which
introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of
directors’ remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after
31 December 2002. The report also meets the relevant requirements
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes
how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance
relating to directors’ remuneration. As required by the Regulations,
a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company.
The Regulations require the Auditors to report to the Company’s
members on the auditable section of this report and to state
whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended
by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into
separate sections containing unaudited and audited information.
Pages 37 to 40 of this report contain unaudited information and
pages 40 (beginning with Directors’ emoluments and compensation)
to 43 contain audited information.
Remuneration Committee
The Company has a Remuneration Committee which is constituted
in accordance with the recommendations of the Hampel Code and
which determines the remuneration of the executive directors.
The directors who have served on the Remuneration Committee
(the “Committee”) during the year are: 
D C Keys (retired as Chairman of the Committee 
on 14 May 2003)
J M F Padovan (appointed as Chairman of the Committee 
on 14 May 2003)
G P Balfour
N F Keegan (appointed 11 September 2003)
D A Trapnell (appointed 11 September 2003)
all of whom the Board regards as independent.
Mr Balfour was appointed Chairman of the Committee on
1 January 2004 in place of Mr Padovan, following a review of the
chairmanship of Board committees. It has been determined by the
Board that Mr Balfour is independent after taking into account his
retirement from Slaughter and May in 2001, that whilst a partner
in that firm he was neither instructed by the Company nor worked
on any transaction involving the Company and that no instruction
of any significance has been given by the Company to that firm
since 1999.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the
Company (other than as a shareholder), any conflict of interest
arising from cross-directorships, or any day-to-day involvement 
in running the business. No director plays a part in any discussion
about his own remuneration.
In determining the executive directors’ remuneration the
Committee consulted with and received recommendations from
Mr Bottjer (Group Chairman). The Committee also received advice
relating to executive directors’ and the Group Chairman’s
remuneration from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who were
appointed by the Committee during 2001. New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP did not provide any other service to the Group.
Remuneration policy
Executive directors’ remuneration packages are designed to
attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to
improve the Company’s performance, to align the interests of the
directors with those of the shareholders and to reward them for
enhancing shareholder value. The determination of their annual
remuneration packages is undertaken by the Committee. Directors’
remuneration will be the subject of regular review, in accordance
with this policy, during this and following financial years. The
remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the
Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association and is
designed to attract and retain non-executive directors of sufficient
calibre to undertake the responsibilities entrusted to them.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for
executive directors:
• basic annual salary and benefits;
• annual bonus payments with (in some cases) linked share
arrangements;
• share option incentives; and
• pensions arrangements.
The Company’s policy is that a substantial portion of the
remuneration of the executive directors should be performance-
related. As described below, executive directors may earn annual
incentive payments up to a defined percentage of their basic 
salary together with the benefits of participating in various share
option schemes.
Basic annual salary and benefits
The executive directors’ salaries are reviewed by the Committee
annually for implementation of such review from 1 July in each year.
Ad hoc reviews can also be made. In deciding upon appropriate salary
levels, the Committee takes into account current remuneration
trends, relative up-to-date information from other comparable groups
of companies and the provisions of Schedule A to the Hampel Code.
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain
benefits-in-kind, principally a fully-expensed car or car allowance,
and medical and permanent health insurance.
Annual bonus payments
In the case of Messrs Ringrose, Hagerty, Jones and Vyse the Committee
establishes performance conditions annually which govern the amount
of bonus payable in respect of each financial year, subject to a ceiling
of 100 per cent of basic salary. The performance conditions are based
on a sliding scale of growth rates for earnings per share determined 
by the Committee on such basis as it shall choose from time to time
excluding exceptional items unless otherwise determined (“EPS”) over
the financial year. Under their bonus scheme up to 50 per cent of the
net bonus receivable by them must be invested in Company shares
under the Interserve Plc Share Matching Plan (the “Share Matching
Plan”) with the balance being payable in cash.
In the case of Messrs Bottjer, Groom, Hannah and Lee the formulae for
calculating their bonus and applicable performance conditions are or
were stated within their service contracts and are or were based
primarily on the moving average of earnings per share, before goodwill
amortisation, over the past three years, with other components based
on Company wage and salary bill and return on capital employed,
subject to a ceiling of 150 per cent of basic salary. There is no obligation
to invest any of their bonuses under the Share Matching Plan. 38 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003

Share Matching Plan
The Share Matching Plan was introduced following its approval at
the AGM on 9 May 2002. Under this arrangement participants are
required to invest up to 50 per cent of their net annual cash bonus
in Company shares (“Investment Shares”). The percentage of bonus
applicable for each year (not exceeding 50 per cent) is determined
annually by the Committee. To the extent that Investment Shares
are retained for a three-year period, the participant remains
employed and if certain conditions are satisfied, they will receive
free shares from the Company (“Free Shares”) that will “match” 
the number of Investment Shares deemed acquired (on a pre-tax
basis) and retained.
Awards made under the first cycle of the Share Matching Plan in
connection with the bonus earned in 2002 are set out on page 42
of this report.
For the next cycle of the Share Matching Plan participants are
required to invest 50 per cent of their net annual bonus, and
grants under the Share Matching Plan will be made to Messrs
Ringrose, Hagerty, Jones and Vyse in relation to their bonuses 
for 2004, subject to certain conditions. These conditions are based
on the Company’s EPS growth over and above the UK Retail Prices
Index (“RPI”) over a three-year period, measured from the financial
year ending just prior to the grant of the awards. The level of
match of Free Shares to Investment Shares will be calculated in
accordance with the following table:
Average annual EPS growth Level of match (i.e. number 
over three-year period of Free Shares to number of 
after grant Investment Shares deemed 
acquired or retained)
Less than RPI + 3% 0.25:1
RPI + 3% 0.5:1
RPI + 3% to 12% 0.5:1 to 1:1 (pro rated)
RPI + 12% 1:1
There will be no re-testing of performance following the end of 
the three-year period.
The performance conditions, relating increases in EPS to inflation
rates, were chosen to ensure that higher rewards would only be
achievable for superior financial performance by the Company.
Share options
The Interserve Sharesave Scheme (the “Sharesave Scheme”) was
introduced on 17 April 1997. It is an all-employee share scheme
and, as is normal with sharesave schemes, the exercise of options 
is not dependent upon performance criteria. There are currently
options granted under the Sharesave Scheme which remain
unexercised, the details of which are set out on pages 41 and 42
of this report.
The earliest executive share option plan under which options are
still outstanding (the “Plan”) was introduced on 17 April 1997 and
amended by a resolution of the members passed at an Extraordinary
General Meeting held on 7 March 2001. There are currently options
granted under the Plan which remain unexercised, the details of
which are set out on pages 41 and 42 of this report. No further
grants of options will be made under the Plan.
The Interserve Plc 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme (the “2002
Scheme”) was introduced following its approval at the AGM on
9 May 2002. The Company’s policy is to grant options under the
2002 Scheme annually, at the discretion of the Committee, to
motivate selected employees who have previously performed well
and who will, potentially, influence the future performance of the
business and enhance shareholder value.
Each option granted under the 2002 Scheme will be subject to a
performance condition, in a form determined by the Committee,
which is intended to link the exercise of the option to a sustained
improvement in the underlying financial performance of the
Group. Options will not be granted over shares with a market
value at the date of grant in excess of 200 per cent of salary unless
the Committee is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances
which justify this.
Options granted under the 2002 Scheme during the year ended
31 December 2003, together with the performance conditions
attaching thereto, are set out on pages 41 and 42 of this report.
The performance conditions in relation to options to be granted
under the 2002 Scheme during the current financial year are that
over the period of three financial years, measuring from the
financial year ended 31 December 2003:
• in respect of the first third of an option, the Company’s EPS
growth must exceed the growth in RPI by an average of at least
10 per cent per year;
• in respect of the second third of an option, the Company’s EPS
growth must exceed the growth in RPI by an average of at least
15 per cent per year; and
• in respect of the final third of an option, the Company’s EPS
growth must exceed the growth in RPI by an average of at least
20 per cent per year.
To the extent that the performance conditions are not satisfied 
by the third anniversary of grant, the option lapses.
The performance conditions were chosen so as to strike an
appropriate balance between potential reward levels and the
targets attaching to the options so that, in relation to the market,
the targets were reasonable.
The Committee will determine whether the performance conditions
under the 2002 Scheme and the Share Matching Plan have been
met by using the EPS information contained within the Company’s
annual report and accounts and taking the advice of the Auditors,
should it be deemed necessary, as to whether any adjustments are
required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the
relevant performance conditions.
The Company does not operate any other long-term incentive
schemes, and no amendments are proposed to be made to the
terms and conditions of any entitlement of a director to share
options. Non-executive directors do not participate in the Group’s
share option schemes.
At 31 December 2003 there remained 5,035,902 shares over which
options may be granted under the Company’s Share Schemes.
Pension arrangements
All executive directors are members of the Interserve Pension
Scheme (the “Scheme”). In general the Scheme provides a pension on
retirement equal to 1/60 of basic annual salary for each year and
proportionately for each month of pensionable service subject to
this not exceeding Inland Revenue limits. In the event of death in
service the executive directors in the Scheme are covered for a lump
sum benefit of four times basic salary (subject to Inland Revenue
limits) payable by the Trustee of the Scheme at its discretion to one
or more of their dependants. In addition, a pension would be
payable to their spouse or an alternative financial dependant. 
The normal retirement age for executive directors is 60 years. 
There are no unfunded or unapproved pension promises or similar
arrangements for directors. Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003  39
Directors’ remuneration report continued
For the year ended 31 December 2003
Executive directors’ service contracts
The Company’s policy on the duration of directors’ service
contracts is that all newly appointed executive directors should
have contracts terminable at any time on one year’s notice save
where it is necessary to offer longer notice periods to any new
directors recruited from outside the Group, in which case such
periods would be reduced to one year after an initial period. 
Details of service contracts of the executive directors who held
office during the financial year ended 31 December 2003 are
summarised as follows:
Unexpired

M S Lee 2 April 1990 see note 4 below two years
4
A M Ringrose 13 December 2001 indefinite one year
J H Vyse 13 December 2001 indefinite one year
1
Mr Bottjer’s service agreement terminated by mutual consent on 31 December
2003 and was replaced by a letter of appointment which may be terminated by
either party upon six months’ prior notice in writing.
2
Mr Groom retired from the Board on 31 December 2003.
3
On 27 June 2003 Mr Hannah was given two years’ notice of the termination of 
his service agreement, effective from 1 July 2003, with a view to his being 
offered a new service agreement, terminable on one year’s notice, in July 2004.
4
Mr Lee retired from the Board on 30 September 2003.
In the event of the termination of any service contract the policy
of the Company would be not to make payments beyond its
contractual obligations.
The service contracts of Messrs Hagerty, Jones, Ringrose and Vyse
provide that if the contract is terminated summarily, for reasons
other than gross misconduct, liquidated damages equal to the
executive’s annual basic salary are payable. The executive’s
entitlement to this payment would not be affected if the executive
was in fact able to reduce his loss by obtaining alternative
employment during the normal notice period. There are no
provisions entitling the executive to terminate his employment or
receive damages in the event of a change in control of the
Company. The same provisions were applicable to Mr Groom’s
service contract.
The service contracts of Messrs Bottjer and Lee provided that if the
executive’s employment was terminated by the Company without
notice or without due notice (other than lawfully either as a result
of the executive committing an act of bankruptcy or compounding
with his creditors or not faithfully discharging his duties under his
service contract or otherwise) the executive would be entitled to
receive, in addition to annual bonus accrued in respect of
completed financial years:
(a) a bonus calculated in accordance with a formula contained
within the executive’s service contract for the financial year of
the Company in which the employment terminated, the bonus
being the calculated proportion of salary paid or payable to the
executive for his actual service during the financial year; and
(b) save in the event of termination as a result of death (or
permanent incapacity) of the executive, a payment in lieu of 
the annual bonus which, after deducting any bonus due under
(a) above for any current period, had the Company given due
notice of termination, the executive would have received in
respect of such notice period.
The service contract of Mr Hannah provides that if the executive’s
employment is terminated on less than two years’ notice (but not to
the extent that such expiry date exceeds Normal Retirement Age):
(a) no payment of bonus under the bonus scheme applicable to him
(the “Scheme”) shall be made in respect of the period starting
on the actual date of termination or on the date notice was
given, if earlier; and
(b) any calculation of damages payable to the executive for breach
of contract shall exclude as a head of claim any amount
representing that which would have been payable under the
Scheme had the contract been terminated by the Company
upon proper notice.
In the event of Mr Hannah’s employment being terminated part
way through any financial year he is entitled to payment of a
proportionate part of the bonus to which he would be entitled 
had he remained in employment throughout the relevant financial
year, such apportionment being calculated by reference to the
total number of days of his employment as a proportion of the
financial year. There are no provisions entitling Mr Hannah to
terminate his employment or receive damages in the event of a
change in control of the Company.
Chairman and non-executive directors
Mr Bottjer’s terms of appointment as Group Chairman were revised
with effect from 1 January 2004 to reflect his retirement as
Executive Chairman. He will continue as Group Chairman unless
and until his appointment is terminated at the discretion of either
party upon six months’ prior written notice.
Non-executive directors are appointed initially until the first AGM
of the Company following appointment when they are required to
stand for re-election and, subject to their re-election, thereafter
for a maximum period of three years, renewable on the agreement
of both the Company and the director. These appointments are
terminable only by the members passing an ordinary resolution as
required by section 303 of the Companies Act 1985, or if the director
were not to be re-elected, or by the director, on one month’s notice,
without compensation. The fees of the non-executive directors are
determined by the Board as a whole, taking into account amounts
paid by other similar-sized companies within the FTSE 350 index.
Details of non-executive appointments are as follows:

This was the full pension payable following the director’s retirement in December 2003 (prior to the commutation of part of the pension for a tax-free sum in accordance 
with the rules of the Scheme) as required to be disclosed by the Listing Rules and is not therefore comparable with the accrued pension at 31 December 2002.

This is the amount (prior to commutation) that would have been the transfer value required by the Regulations but for Mr Groom’s retirement on 31 December 2003 and

As at 11 August 2003, on becoming a director.

This is the amount (prior to commutation) that would have been the transfer value required by the Regulations but for Mr Lee’s retirement on 30 September 2003 and is 
not therefore comparable with the transfer value at 31 December 2002.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director. Instead they represent a potential
liability of the Scheme.
Non-executive directors' fees are not pensionable and they have therefore not been included in the above table.
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions. Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits
are included in the above tables.
Special benefits were awarded to Mr Bottjer and Mr Lee under the Scheme on 26 October 1990. In March 1998 Mr Bottjer transferred his
entitlements to a personal pension plan. Mr Lee switched, in accordance with the terms of the Scheme applicable to him, from a money
purchase scheme to a defined benefit scheme with effect from 14 March 2003 and, accordingly, the disclosures in relation to him have
been made on a defined benefit basis.

Directors’ responsibility statement
United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare
financial statements for each year which give a true and fair view
of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end
of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that
period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent; and
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
1985. They are also responsible for the system of internal control,
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities. Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003  45
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Interserve Plc
We have audited the financial statements of Interserve Plc for the
year ended 31 December 2003 which comprise the consolidated
profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated
statement of total recognised gains and losses, the consolidated
cash flow statement, the notes to the consolidated cash flow
statement and the related notes 1 to 29. These financial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information in the part of the directors'
remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company's members those matters we are required to state to
them in an Auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As described in the directors' responsibility statement, the
Company's directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and accounting standards. They are also responsible
for the preparation of the other information contained in the
annual report including the directors' remuneration report. Our
responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of
the directors' remuneration report described as having been
audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and
regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report
described as having been audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you 
if, in our opinion, the directors' report is not consistent with the
financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and transactions
with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects
the Company's compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are
not required to consider whether the Board's statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures
or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors' report and the other information contained
in the annual report for the above year as described in the
contents section including the unaudited part of the directors'
remuneration report and consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom
auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and 
the part of the directors' remuneration report described as having
been audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation
of the financial statements and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the circumstances of the Company and the
Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
directors' remuneration report described as having been audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the financial statements and the part of the directors'
remuneration report described as having been audited.
Opinion 
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2003 
and of the loss of the Group for the year then ended; and
• the financial statements and part of the directors' remuneration
report described as having been audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

# Certain comparative figures have been restated as explained in note 8. Notes on the accounts 
For the year ended 31 December 2003
50 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003
1. Accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and with the Companies Act 1985.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year and the previous period. The Group continues to comply with
the transitional arrangements under FRS 17 “Retirement Benefits”. These have had no effect upon the results for the year, as set out in
note 7b.
The particular policies adopted by the directors are described below.
(a) Convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. Investments in joint ventures are accounted
for under the gross equity method. Investments in associated undertakings are accounted for under the equity method. For joint
arrangements that are not an entity the accounts include the Group’s share of turnover, profits, net assets and cash flows measured
according to the terms of the agreement covering the arrangement. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
included from the effective date of acquisition or until the effective date of disposal respectively. Profits arising on trading between Group
undertakings are excluded.
(c) Goodwill
Where, on acquisition of shares in a subsidiary undertaking, the purchase consideration includes a sum over and above the fair value of
the net assets acquired, the excess, being the provisional calculation of goodwill, is included in fixed assets and amortised on a straight
line basis over its useful economic life, which is normally assessed as being 20 years unless exceptional circumstances arise.
The profit or loss on disposal of a business is calculated after taking into account any applicable goodwill previously written off to
reserves.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of shares in associated undertakings is included within investments in associated undertakings.
(d) Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. These translation
differences are dealt with in the profit for the year. The financial results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries, associated undertakings
and joint arrangements that are not an entity are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange for the year, the balance sheets
are translated into sterling at the closing rate of exchange, and the difference arising from the translation of the opening net assets and
financial results for the year at closing rate is taken direct to reserves.
(e) Turnover 
Turnover, which excludes sales between Group undertakings, comprises the value of goods and services supplied to external customers and
the value of work executed in respect of contracts, excluding VAT.
(f) Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
(i) Depreciation is provided on a straight line or reducing balance basis at rates ranging between:
Straight line Reducing balance
Freehold land nil
Freehold buildings 2% to 5%
Leasehold property over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment 10% to 50% 11.5% to 38% 
(ii) Fixed assets leased under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives. The finance charges are
allocated over the primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
(iii) The costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
(g) Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. Notes on the accounts continued
For the year ended 31 December 2003
Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003  51
1. Accounting policies (continued)
(h) Stocks and work in progress
(i) Stocks and property work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
(ii) Contract work in progress is valued at cost plus attributable profit less foreseeable losses. Attributable profit is included when the
outcome of a contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty. The value of contract work in progress is accounted for within
turnover, and in accordance with SSAP 9 “Stocks and Long-term Contracts”, the excess of the book value over payments receivable is
included in debtors as “Amounts recoverable on contracts”. Payments receivable in excess of book value on an individual contract
basis are included in creditors.
(iii) Project-specific finance costs are capitalised until the asset becomes operational.
(i) Pre-contract costs
In compliance with UITF 34 pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised
as an asset when it is virtually certain that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash flows.  
(j) PFI projects
In accordance with FRS 5 “Reporting the substance of transactions” (Application note F) the Group has determined the appropriate
treatment of the principal assets of, and income streams from, PFI and similar contracts. Where the balance of risks and rewards derived
from the underlying assets are not borne by the Group, the asset provided is accounted for as a financial asset. 
Revenues received from the customer are apportioned between capital repayments, finance income and operating revenue. The finance
income element is shown within interest receivable.
(k) Pensions
The Group operates two principal pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff: the Interserve Pension Scheme, which is
of the defined benefit type; and the Interserve Retirement Plan, which is of the defined contribution type. The Group also set up a new
defined contribution section of the Interserve Pension Scheme with effect from 1 November 2002. Actuarial valuations are carried out
every three years.  
The (deficit) surplus in the Group’s pension scheme after offsetting regular pension costs and allowing for accruing interest will, in
accordance with SSAP 24 “Accounting for Pension Costs”, be released to the profit and loss account over the average remaining service life
of employees. The amortisation of the experience (deficit) surplus and pension cost charged to the profit and loss account is reflected in the
balance sheet.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the profit and loss account is equal to the contributions payable to the
schemes during the year.
(l) Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to
pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise
from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included
in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no
commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these
earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
(m) Financial instruments
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to
hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk. To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or
liabilities, they are accounted for using hedge accounting.
Transactions covered by foreign exchange contracts are recorded at the contracted rate. Interest rate payments and receipts under
interest rate derivative contracts are spread and added to / netted against the corresponding interest charge or interest receivable in the
profit and loss account over the life of the instruments. For foreign exchange instruments, premiums or discounts are spread over the life
of the underlying transactions being hedged.
Where the underlying position being hedged is permanently reduced, the profit or loss on the closure of the corresponding hedge position
will be taken to the profit and loss account in the period in which the position is closed out. 52 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003

7a. Pension scheme – SSAP 24 disclosures
(a) The Group operates two principal pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff: the Interserve Pension Scheme
(the “Scheme”), which is of the defined benefit type; and the Interserve Retirement Plan, which is of the defined contribution type. 
The Group also set up a new defined contribution section of the Interserve Pension Scheme with effect from 1 November 2002. 
From November 2002 the defined benefit section of the Scheme was closed to all but a very few new entrants and those employees
who, under agreement, TUPE transfer to the Group from the public sector. Taking account of these factors, it is expected under
normal circumstances that the age profile of the active membership of the defined benefit section will rise and consequently under
the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the Scheme approach retirement.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group and are managed by external independent investment
managers appointed by the Trustees.
(b) The net pension costs for the year (note 5) are made up as follows:
2003 2002
£million £million
UK defined benefit scheme:
Regular cost 3.7 7.1
Amortisation of experience deficit/(surplus) and interest 4.4 (7.1)
SSAP 24 cost 8.1 –
National Insurance costs* 0.8 –
8.9 –
Other UK schemes 3.3 2.3
Overseas and other pension contributions 0.6 0.5
12.8 2.8
* National Insurance costs arise on the change in the contracted-out nature of the Scheme to a money purchase basis, with effect from 6 April 2003.
(c) The pension cost relating to the Interserve Pension Scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the
projected unit method. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the actuarial calculations are those
relating to the return on investments and the rate of increase in salaries and pensions. It is assumed that the investment return will
exceed salary increases by 4.7 per cent per annum, and increases to present and future pensions in payment by 6.2 per cent per
annum.  
(d) The actuarially assessed experience (deficit) surplus in the Scheme is being amortised on a straight line basis over the average
remaining service lives of employees.
(e) The pension scheme prepayment of £33.2 million (2002: £32.3 million) shown in the balance sheet represents the amortisation of the
experience surplus less pension cost credited to the profit and loss account. The latest actuarial valuation of the Interserve Pension
Scheme was at 31 December 2002. At the date of that actuarial valuation the market value of the Scheme’s assets was £212.5 million
and represented approximately 83 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future
increases in earnings. Since the date of the valuation, on the recommendation of the actuary, the Group has recommenced
contributions to the Scheme. Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003  57

For the year ended 31 December 2003
7b. Pension scheme – FRS 17 disclosures
The principal pension schemes within the Group have been valued for the purposes of the transitional arrangements under FRS 17. For each
of these pension schemes valuation information has been updated by Lane Clark & Peacock, qualified independent actuaries, to take
account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 December 2003.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2003.
The financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are:

* Goodwill written off relates to that arising on acquisitions prior to 1998. This was previously written off to reserves on acquisition. On the termination of a
business, the goodwill is charged in the profit and loss account and is written back in the profit and loss reserve (note 26). There is therefore no effect on the
net assets of the Group.
(b) Profit on sale of tangible fixed assets (continuing operations)
Profit on sale of land and buildings 2.7 2.5
The directors are of the opinion that a trade in property activities is no longer being conducted by the Group. The profit on sale of land

The calculation of headline earnings per share, which includes both continuing and discontinued operations, is based on the weighted
average number of shares in issue throughout the year which totalled 113,380,366 (2002: 113,473,523) and a profit after taxation and
minority interest excluding exceptional items and goodwill amortisation of £19.0 million (2002: £33.6 million). This is disclosed in addition
to the basic earnings per share as the directors consider it more fairly represents the performance of the Group. Basic earnings per share
is calculated on attributable (loss)/profit after exceptional items and goodwill amortisation of (£7.9 million) (2002: £24.6 million).
Diluted earnings per share for the year is based on the weighted average number of shares, including dilutive potential shares relating to
option schemes, which totalled 113,380,366 (2002: 114,230,394) and a (loss)/profit after taxation and minority interest of (£7.9 million)

(b) Maturity of financial liabilities
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities, other than short-term creditors and accruals was as follows:

£million £million
At 31 December
In one year or less or on demand 8.6 20.6
In more than one year but not more than two years 0.1 35.4

The Group has various undrawn committed facilities. The facilities available in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met
were as follows:

£million £million
In more than one year but not more than two years – 96.5
In more than two years but not more than five years 115.5 –
115.5 96.5
(c) Currency exposures
Gains and losses relating to monetary assets and liabilities of Group companies that are not denominated in their functional currency will be
recognised in the profit and loss account. Taking into account the effect of forward contracts, the Group did not have a material exposure
to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 31 December 2003.
(d) Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
For the whole Group, financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of foreign exchange forward contracts, have fair values not
materially different to the carrying values. The fair values of the forward contracts not recorded in the balance sheet are £nil (2002: £nil).
(e) Market price risk
The Group seeks to control its exposures to changes in interest rates by limiting their impact on the interest charge in the profit and loss
account. This is achieved through the use of interest rate caps where appropriate. An instantaneous 1 per cent increase across all relevant
interest rates would increase the Group’s interest charge by less than 0.5 per cent of consolidated Group profits before exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation.
In addition the Group seeks to selectively hedge its foreign currency dividends either through forward contracts or by purchasing options.
At 31 December 2003 none of the Group’s expected dividends for the year ended 31 December 2003 has been hedged. A 10 per cent
increase in the value of sterling against all relevant currencies would reduce dividend income by 1.1 per cent of consolidated Group profits
before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
(f) Gains and losses on hedges
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to eliminate the currency exposure that arises on sales or purchases
denominated in foreign currencies immediately those sales or purchases are contracted. It also uses interest rate caps to manage the
interest rate profile. Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the
hedged positions mature. There were no unrecognised gains or losses on hedges at 1 January 2003. There were no gains or losses on hedges
that were recognised in 2003. There were no unrecognised gains or losses on hedges at 31 December 2003. Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2003  67

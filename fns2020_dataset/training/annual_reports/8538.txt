Overview
Our strategy
ITE’s primary business objectives are to:
create sustainable growth in headline earnings per share; and •	
create and maintain sustainable positions of market leadership. •	
ITE’s strategy for achieving these objectives is to continue to strengthen 
its existing positions of market leadership by investing in the quality of 
its events, and to expand the business model into other market areas or 
geographies where there is the potential to create strong market positions.
The key performance indicators that ITE uses to measure 
progress against its objectives are set out below:
 
To increase revenues from  
existing exhibition portfolio
To increase the (annually) recurring volume 
base of our exhibition business 
To make incremental bolt on acquisitions in 
support of our objectives
Secure forward venue rights for  
significant exhibitions
The Group’s performance against its key performance indicators in 2009 are 
discussed in the Chief Executive’s statement on pages 8 to 11.

Group performance
The Group has delivered a record financial 
performance, reporting revenues of £1 16.7 
million and headline pre-tax profits of 
£45.8 million. Reported pre-tax profits 
were £41.5 million, a 21% increase from 
last year and diluted earnings per share 
increased by 37% from 9.3p to 12.7p. There 
were several factors influencing these 
results, notably the downturn in the world 
economy which had a growing impact on 
trading conditions throughout our markets 
as the year progressed, the benefit of our 
stronger biennial pattern of events, newly 
acquired events and beneficial currency 
movements. The economic downturn 
reduced the Group’s like-for-like* volume 
sales by more than 20%, the effect of 
which was largely offset by changes in 
the Sterling-Euro exchange rate. The 
Group’s balance sheet at the beginning of 
the year was well positioned to deal with 
the effects of the economic downturn 
with £29.1 million of net cash and, after 
investing £8.0 million in expanding the 
business, the Group’s net cash position 
at 30 September 2009 was £23.1 million. 
Strategic progress
ITE’s primary strengths are its strong 
exhibition brands in the markets of Russia 
and the CIS allied to the reputation and 
breadth of its international sales network. 
Together these assets have given the 
Group a unique opportunity to capitalise 
on the strong growth experienced by 
the Russian and CIS economies over the 
last five years. More recently the strategy 
has been to leverage these strengths by 
both expanding the portfolio of events 
in other emerging markets and by 
enhancing the reach and effectiveness of 
our international sales network. This year 
saw a continuation of this strategy with 
the addition of the Eastern Mediterranean 
International Travel and Tourism exhibition 
based in Istanbul which has enhanced 
the Group’s portfolio of travel events. 
The Group  
has delivered a 
record financial 
performance, 
reporting 
revenues of 
£1 16.7 million 
and headline 
pre-tax profits  
of £45.8 million

non-annual events, acquisitions and disposals.

Board and management
Neil Jones joined the Board as Group 
Finance Director last November. He 
has been able to make an immediate 
contribution with his existing knowledge 
of the industry. There were no further 
changes to the Board during the year. The 
success of the business largely depends 
on the relationships that our staff build 
and maintain with our customers, and 
I should like to extend my thanks to all 
the staff who have worked so hard to 
make this year’s result achievable.
Dividend 
The Board has a progressive dividend policy 
and is recommending a final dividend of 
3.9p per share which, together with the 
interim dividend of 1.6p, makes a total 
dividend of 5.5p (2008: 5.3p) for the 
year. The increase reflects the Group’s 
strong cash position and its confidence 
in the future prospects of the business. 
The payment date of the proposed final 
dividend is being brought forward to 
February 2010 to achieve a better spread 
of returns to shareholders during the year. 
Outlook
The current trading conditions in our core 
markets are now stable, albeit at a lower 
level than this time a year ago, although 
the Group has yet to experience an 
upturn in booking patterns. The economic 
prospects in the Group’s core markets 
are for a return to economic growth over 
the course of calendar year 2010, with 
stronger growth expected thereafter. 
The nature of the exhibition business 
is such that this economic recovery is 
not expected to feed into the Group’s 
financial results until the middle of next 
year. As anticipated, this ‘late-cycle’ 
characteristic means that like-for-like 
volume sales for 2010 could be up to 10% 
lower than 2009. At 27 November forward 
bookings for 2010 stand at £56 million.
The Group has reported strong financial 
results for the year, has a strong 
balance sheet, and is well positioned to 
benefit from a recovery and capitalise 
on new opportunities to expand the 
business. Accordingly the Board remains 
confident of ITE’s future prospects.

Chief Executive’s statement
Results for the 2009 financial year
Reported revenues for the year of  
£1 16.7 million are a 6% improvement over 
last year’s £109.8 million and were earned 
from volume sales of 423,000m
2
 (2008: 
500,000m
2
). The volume sales pattern gives 
a better indication of the trading conditions 
experienced during the year. The Group’s 
like-for-like volume sales on 1 October 2008 
were circa 10% ahead of the previous year’s 
figures. By the end of December the onset 
of the financial crisis had caused like-for-
like volume sales to fall marginally behind 
the previous year’s, and over the full year 
were more than 20% below the comparable 
2008 figure. The mitigating factors 
that helped reported revenues increase 
despite the deterioration in underlying 
trading were a first time contribution from 
acquisitions of £9.4 million, a net biennial 
revenue contribution of £3.7 million and an 
estimated £10.5 million of benefit from the 
reporting of US Dollar and Euro revenues 
in Sterling. Average exchange rates for 
the year reflected Sterling being circa 12% 
weaker against our principal currency 
revenues compared to the previous year. 
Against this backdrop of reducing volume 
sales, costs were reduced in line with 
the size of exhibitions. Reducing venue 
commitments and staffing costs were the 
main focus, resulting in a gross margin 
for the year of 52%, consistent with 
the margins we normally report in our 
biennially stronger year. Overheads were 
also reduced and are maintained this year 
at 15% of revenue producing an operating 
margin of 37% for the year. Headline profits 
before tax of £45.8 million are comfortably 
ahead of last year’s £37.0 million, helped by 
acquisitions, the biennial pattern and net 
foreign exchange gains made in the year. 
The Group reduced its ongoing tax rate 
to 26% from 32% last year, reflecting 
improved tax management and falling 
tax rates in the Group’s principal 
trading regions, notably Russia.
The improved financial position, lower 
tax rate and lower average number of 
shares in issue resulted in diluted headline 
earnings per share rising 41% to 14.2p 
(2008: 10.1p). This is a strong financial 
result in a year where actual trading activity 
was more than 15% down on the previous 
year. The integration of new acquisitions, 
the reduction and control of costs and 
the successful management of its events 
leave the Group on an excellent footing 
from which to progress next year. 
Trading and operating performance  
in 2009
The principal factors affecting individual 
shows and sector performance this year 
were the proportion of international 
exhibitors in an event and when the event 
took place in the calendar. International 
customers reacted less severely than smaller 
local market customers and different 
regions reflected the economic downturn 
at different times and with varying levels of 
ITE’s discerning 
quality is its 
reputation with 
international 
exhibitors

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
severity. The strongest performing events 
all took place in the first quarter of the year 
where bookings were mostly made in pre-
crisis conditions, contrasting with events 
taking place in the final quarter where 
bookings were all made into a post-crisis 
environment. The revenues earned in the 
Group are largely denominated in Euros 
and the relative strength of this currency 
against local currencies and against Sterling 
meant that all regions reported better 
revenue results than volume results. 
The construction sector has been the 
biggest contributor to ITE’s growth over 
the last five years, and unsurprisingly 
was particularly exposed to a tightening 
of credit facilities and international 
investment. However, the biggest event in 
our portfolio, MosBuild, benefited from high 
levels of early bookings from international 
customers. Across the Group, the sector 
experienced a reduction of 25% in volume 
sales representing a balance between the 
Spring events which had some pre-crisis 
bookings in their figures and the Autumn 
events which reported larger reductions 
in volume sales. The oil and gas sales 
portfolio of events reported sales volumes 
circa 20% lower than last year on a like-for-
like basis. The low oil price detrimentally 
affected sentiment in the sector for the 
Spring events, and for the important 
biennial Moscow International Oil and Gas 
Exhibition. Latterly a recovery in oil prices 
to circa $70 per barrel has improved the 
mood of the sector and helped support 
the performance of the Kazakhstan 
International Oil and Gas Exhibition which 
took place in the first part of the 2010 
financial year. The Group’s travel exhibitions 
were a relative out-performer with sales 
volumes reducing by only 15%, reflecting 
both their Spring season timing and high 
proportion of international customers.
In 2009 the Group ran 179 events (2008: 
159), the increase largely being attributable 
to the acquired portfolio of smaller events 
in our Novosibirsk office. New launch 
activity was mostly stalled in this year 
though there will now be opportunities 
to step into gaps where competitors have 
failed. A detailed analysis of revenues 
and gross profits from our exhibition and 
conference business is set out below. 
 
The Group’s annually recurring exhibition 
business (on a volume basis) is 10% less 
than last year, but through the beneficial 
movement in currency rates together with 
good cost control, the Group has been able 
to report higher revenues and gross profits 
from this lower annually recurring volume 
base. The Group’s average sales rate in 
Sterling terms of £268 per square metre is 
a 15% increase on last year’s average sales 
rate reflecting changes in currency and mix 
of events. The average sales rates for the 
year were €1.21:£1 and $1.57:£1 reflecting 
the fact that a large proportion of our 
business was booked relatively early in the 
year before Sterling reached its lowest point. 
ITE’s strategy
ITE’s primary business objectives are to:
create sustainable growth in •	
headline earnings per share; and 
create and maintain sustainable •	
positions of market leadership.
ITE’s strategy for achieving these objectives 
is to continue to strengthen its existing 
positions of market leadership by investing 
in the quality of its events, and to expand 
the business model into other market 
areas or geographies where there is the 
potential to create strong market positions. 
In the Group’s existing markets this means 
searching out new sectors and regions in 
which to acquire or develop businesses. 
ITE’s strengths lie in its proven ability to 
deliver international sales and its search 
is focused around those businesses where 
there is potential for the participation of 
international exhibitors, and also look to 
develop new complementary geographies.
The key performance indicators that 
ITE uses to measure progress against 
its objectives and performance 
this year are set out below:
ITE has sought to develop and build 
upon its main business strengths:
 
International sales reach
ITE’s discerning quality in its business is its 
reputation with its international exhibitor 
base. ITE is unique in owning several sales 
offices which exist solely to make ‘outbound 
sales’ to its exhibitions and events in Russia 
and the CIS. The Group focuses its staff 
on selling its own exhibitions, which has 
created a specialist skill base in promoting 
sales into the Russian and CIS economies.

Key performance indicators
To increase revenues 
from existing exhibition 
portfolio
Sterling revenues from existing (‘like-for-like’) 
products has fallen by 6% in the year under 
review. This reflects both the economic crisis 
which has led to exhibitions worldwide reducing 
in size this year, mitigated by weakness in Sterling 
against our principal invoicing currencies. 
To increase the 
(annually) recurring 
volume base of our 
exhibition business 
The annually recurring volume base of the exhibition 
business fell by 10% from 449,000m
2
 to 406,000m
2
. 
This reflected the severity of the economic crisis 
in our markets leading to a reduction of 24% in our 
existing business, but offset by the acquisition of 
new events which added 67,000m
2
 to the portfolio. 
To make incremental 
bolt on acquisitions in 
support of our 
objectives
This year the Group acquired the leading travel 
exhibition in the Eastern Mediterranean region, EMITT, 
which has potential for growth in its international 
sales base. Subsequent to the year end, the Group has 
acquired a small exhibition business in India, which 
will position the Group to grow its business there.
Secure forward venue 
rights for significant 
exhibitions
Of ITE’s top ten exhibitions and conferences, 
three have secured rights for three years, six 
for two years and one for one year. The Group’s 
management is in an ongoing process of agreeing 
venue terms in compliance with this objective. 
These ten exhibitions represent 58% of revenues. 
Brands
These brands

identity with  
our customers ITE Group plc 11 Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
In 2009 international sales accounted for 
43% of total square metres sold in the year 
(2008: 43%); through its London office 
(17%), its German office (4%), its Chinese 
office (3%) and its Turkish office (3%). This 
international sales reach differentiates us 
from locally based competitors. ITE’s ability 
to add value to acquired businesses relies 
on it being able to promote the sale of new 
exhibitions to its existing international 
customer base. ITE has recently invested 
in the development of its international 
sales network by launching new offices 
in Spain, USA, Poland and Dubai. 
Established market leading brands
ITE has established strong brand identity in 
certain sectors of exhibitions. In particular 
the ‘build’ brand in construction, the 
‘International Oil and Gas Events’ (‘IOGE’) 
brand, the ‘International Travel and Tourism’ 
(‘ITT’) and World Food brands have a strong 
reputation and identity with customers, 
earned through more than 15 years of 
sustained good performance. These brands 
and their attached reputation are not 
restricted to the Russian and CIS markets 
and the Group can, and aspires to, expand 
the use of these brands into new markets.
Local presence
ITE’s brands have built their reputation 
through sustained delivery of successful 
exhibitions to customers. The foundation 
of this is our local office presence, with 
eight principal offices running more than 
170 events per year. ITE’s offices, like 
its exhibitions and brands, have been 
in place for over 15 years and today 
employ over 800 people. The local offices 
both organise all details of staging an 
exhibition, but critically own and manage 
the databases of visitors necessary for 
making an exhibition successful for our 
customers. ITE’s local office skills in Russia 
and the In CIS are a differentiating factor 
from other international organisers – and 
building a local office remains a barrier 
to entry for new organisers wishing to 
establish themselves in these markets. 
Venue relationships
ITE has established special relationships 
with the venues that host its exhibitions. 
Historically, ITE has supported the 
development of venue facilities – which in 
turn has helped the Group’s exhibitions 
to grow. This ‘partnership’ relationship 
has established for ITE the rights to 
run its main exhibition themes in its 
chosen venues at the time of its choice. 
The Group’s track record in developing 
good quality exhibitions also makes it 
the ‘organiser of choice’ for venues.
ITE’s international sales expertise, brand 
identity, local office strength and venue 
relationships give it a unique position in 
Russia and the CIS marketplace. To run 
successful international exhibitions, which 
are generally the ‘must do’ events in a 
country, an organiser needs both local 
presence and international sales strength. 
ITE has established this position in its main 
sectors in its core markets, and its brands 
and venue relationships make it hard for 
new entrants to successfully compete with 
ITE’s events in these markets. Two of these 
assets – the brand and the international 
sales skills are portable and can help ITE to 
establish itself in other emerging markets.

ITE’s business
ITE is an organiser of exhibitions and 
conferences specialising in emerging 
and developing markets. ITE organises 
high-quality events of an international 
standard throughout the twelve countries 
in which it operates. The business is split 
in five main geographic sectors: Russia, 
Central Asia & Caucasus, Eastern & 
Southern Europe, UK & Western Europe and 
Rest of World (see pages 14 to 21 and the 
Financial highlights section on page 1). 
As an exhibition organiser, ITE hires 
venues at which it stages its events and 
markets the events to both exhibitors 
and visitors. Exhibitions and conferences 
provide an opportunity for participants 
from national and international companies 
to meet, network and transact business. 
The exhibition media is the best media 
for suppliers to display and demonstrate 
their products to potential buyers and 
this is particularly true in emerging and 
developing markets where culturally face 
to face meetings are the norm and where 
alternative media, B2B publishing and on-
line marketing opportunities are limited. 
ITE’s strength derives from its focus on 
organising B2B exhibitions and conferences, 
the development of strong brands in key 
industry sectors and the regional expertise 
in the markets in which it operates. ITE 
has been operating in these markets 
for over 15 years and its experience 
and local knowledge are unique.
ITE’s principal business of organising B2B 
trade exhibitions accounts for 95% of the 
Group’s revenues. Consumer exhibitions 
account for 1% of ITE’s revenue, conferences 
circa 3% and other activities relating to 
the core exhibition business (mostly 
publishing) account for 1% of revenue. 
ITE’s sector brands are a key asset. The 
brands have been established through 
a sustained record of presenting high 
quality events which meet customer 
expectations. ITE events serve key

The offices of the Group co-operate 
in a unique way. Each office sells its 
own exhibitions, but participates 
with equal levels of commitment in 
the exhibitions organised by other 
offices. This holistic approach has been 
carefully cultivated through the years 
and enables ITE’s business to follow 
long-established trading patterns. 14 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Business review
Russia
The Russian economy is expected to have 
contracted by circa 8% by the end of 2009, 
and during our financial year the Ruble 
has fallen by 20% against the Euro and 
18% against the US Dollar. These changes 
are a measure of the impact the world’s 
financial crisis and the ensuing drop in 
the price of oil, Russia’s primary export, 
have had on the Russian economy. The 
recent increase in the oil price to around 
$70 per barrel has helped stabilise the 
situation with the Ruble recovering some 
of its earlier loses and the economy 
forecast to return to growth during 2010. 
In 2009, the combination of reduced 
foreign investment, less international 
finance and a softening real estate market 
led to an abrupt slowdown of construction 
activity. Construction accounts for circa 
6% of the Russian economy and for 46% 
of ITE’s exhibition activity in Russia and 
the slowdown in this industry has had 
consequences for expenditure in other 
sectors such as travel and food. Against 
this difficult trading backdrop ITE has the 
market leading exhibitions in construction, 
travel, oil & gas and food, and in difficult 
times exhibitors have always focused 
on the market leading exhibitions.
In Russia ITE operates through three offices 
in Moscow, St Petersburg and Novosibirsk. 
During the year the Group ran 86 events, 
with total sales of 256,000 m
2
, 4% more than 
2008. This increase was achieved thanks 
to the contributions from newly acquired 
businesses and the biennial occurrence 
of the Moscow International Oil and Gas 
Exhibition. Comparable like-for-like volume 
sales in Russia were circa 22% less than last 
year though like-for-like revenues were only 
4% lower due mainly to favourable currency 
movements. The regional businesses in 
St Petersburg and Novosibirsk suffered 
more than the Moscow market, which 
attracts a greater number of international 
customers. With the abruptness of the 
slowdown being unexpected, the main 
focus of management throughout the 
three offices has been on reducing costs 
in line with the reduced levels of sales. 
In Moscow and St Petersburg, the Group, 
has strong relationships with established 
venues offering sufficient international 
quality space for the Group’s needs. A 
new pavilion of 23,000m
2
 was opened 
this year in the old State exhibition park 
in Moscow, and at current activity levels 
there is now a sense of under utilised 
venue capacity in Moscow. Novosibirsk’s 
business is currently constrained by 
existing facilities and the various proposals 
in place to build new facilities have been 
slowed by the availability and increased 
cost of bank finance. ITE has therefore, 
extended its lease to stay in its existing 
venue and is still actively promoting 
new projects to construct purpose 
built modern exhibition facilities. 
In Moscow, where six of the Group’s 
top ten events are held, the larger more 
international events proved to be more 
resilient than the smaller more local events. 
Performance was also sector specific, 
with travel in particular faring better than 
construction, automotive and food. The 
Moscow International Travel and Tourism 
event was held in March and despite the 
economic backdrop delivered space sales 
of 20,200m
2
, only 3% smaller than was 
achieved in 2008. This resilient performance 
illustrates the strength of a market leading 
position together with a strong franchise 
of international exhibitors. The largest 
and most important event in the Group’s 
portfolio is the Moscow construction event, 
MosBuild, held in the first week of April. 
Although the Group had booked sales of 
more than 80,000m
2
 before the onset of 
the economic crisis the eventual out turn 
was 74,900m
2
, a reduction of 14% on the 
2008 event, with bookings from local 
exhibitors more severely affected than from 
international exhibitors. The slowdown 
in general economic activity also affected 
Moscow’s other three main April events 
to differing degrees, with again, the more 
international events proving more resilient. 
TransRussia, the international transport 
and logistics exhibition delivered a good 
sales performance this year, given the 
prevailing trading conditions, with sales of 
7,300m
2
 (2008: 8,200m
2
) and the Moscow 
International Protection and Security 
exhibition delivered sales of 6,400m
2
 
(2008: 7,600m
2
). ExpoElectronica, the 
electrical components exhibition, is largely 
comprised of local exhibitors and suffered 
a 41% reduction year on year to 5,500m
2
. 
The biennial Moscow International Oil and 
Gas Exhibition was held in June, and with 
little in the way of pre-crisis bookings, 
performed ahead of expectations selling 
17 ,300m
2
 and increasing the number of 
visitors. The fourth quarter events had no  Construction (46%)

pre-crisis bookings and accordingly found 
sales harder to achieve than the shows held 
earlier in the year. The Moscow International 
Motor Show sold 10,100m
2
 and Worldfood 
Moscow 16,600m
2
 both shortfalls of more 
than 30% compared to the 2008 events. 
 
In St Petersburg, the trading pattern 
mirrored that of Moscow’s, with a strong 
performance in the first quarter of the 
year and the weakest sales performance 
in the last quarter of the year. Again the 
construction portfolio was particularly 
affected. The first Interstroyexpo event 
under ITE’s ownership took place in 
April, and sold 10,100m
2
 despite very 
difficult trading conditions. Balticbuild, 
ITE’s other St Petersburg construction 
event was held in September and was 
more affected than the April event. 
Sibfair, the Novosibirsk operation acquired 
in April 2008, now integrated into the 
Group’s sales processes, contributed a full 
twelve months results for the first time. 
During the year Sibfair held 43 exhibitions 
and sold a total of 40,500m
2
 (19,100m
2
 
in April to September 2008). Whilst 
performing in line with our expectations, 
the business incurs a fixed rent for the 
whole venue, and as such has a less flexible 
cost structure than our other offices.

Central Asia & Caucasus 
ITE’s principal offices in Central Asia are in 
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. 
In total ITE organised 64 events with total 
sales of 61,900m
2
 in the region, which was 
33% less than last year. Despite this fall in 
volume sales, revenues were only 16% less 
than in 2008 reflecting the relative increase 
in strength of the Euro and US Dollar 
against Sterling over the year. Kazakhstan, 
like Russia is heavily dependent on oil for 
its overseas earnings, and its economy 
contracted by circa 2% in GDP terms over 
the year. Tenge, its currency, devalued 
against $/€ by circa 25% in February. 
Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan also depend 
heavily on oil and gas exports for their 
overseas earnings, but their economies are 
less exposed to the international banking 
system. The growth of their economies 
slowed from their previous strong growth 
rates to growth of 7% in 2009. Nonetheless, 
trade exhibitions in both countries were 
still negatively affected by the general 
downturn in international trade. 
Kazakhstan
The economic crisis had an earlier affect 
on ITE’s Kazakhstan business than other 
regions. Tightening credit conditions and 
an over inflated property market in mid 
2008 combined to create falling property 
prices; this negative effect ‘rippled’ 
through the economy, such that it was in 
full recession before the 1 October 2008. 
With no pre-crisis mitigation in its trading 
results, ITE’s volume sales were 39% down 
on the previous year, although again the 
revenues were helped by changes in relative 
currency rates. Oil & gas exhibitions are the 
main contributor to the Group’s Kazakhstan 
business and, as in other regions this sector 
proved relatively resilient to the economic 
crisis. The International Kazakhstan Oil & 
Gas Exhibition took place early in the year 
and delivered sales of 10,300m
2
, just 8% 
less than was achieved in the equivalent 
2008 event. The other important sector in 
the Kazakhstan portfolio is construction, 
which experienced extremely difficult 
trading conditions, with sales contracting 
by 50% across the portfolio compared to 
last year. ITE works closely with Atakent, 
the principal venue in Almaty to develop 
the existing facilities, although the 
economic circumstances have delayed 
the construction of the proposed venue 
extension. The Group’s relationship with 
Atakent continues to be strong and ITE 
enjoy rate and theme protection to 2017. Construction (19%)

Azerbaijan
Later into the economic crisis than other 
territories, the Azerbaijan business started 
the year very strongly with Bakubuild, 
the regional construction event, held in 
October 2008 achieving strong volume 
growth. Exhibitions held in the second 
half of the year fell back as the economic 
crisis began to impact. Overall the Group 
sold 14,500m
2
, representing only a 10% 
decline in like-for-like volumes over the 
previous year. The proposed new 28,000m
2
 
venue remains on track for completion 
in mid 2010 and will present ITE with an 
opportunity to participate in the growth 
of exhibition business which will follow. 
Uzbekistan
ITE’s Uzbekistan business experienced a 
similar pattern of trading to the Azerbaijan 
business with a strong first quarter and 
a slowdown later in the year. Overall, 
the Group sold 9,900m
2
 of exhibition 
space this year, an 1 1% decrease on a 
like-for-like basis compared to last year.

Eastern & Southern Europe
The Eastern and Southern Europe region is 
represented by the Group’s offices in Turkey, 
Ukraine and the recently opened sales 
office in Poznan, Poland. In total like-for-like 
volume sales from these offices were circa 
35% less than in 2008, though again the 
effect on revenues, (–10% like for like) was 
mitigated by relative currency movements. 
The Ukrainian economy was the most 
seriously affected of all the Group’s core 
territories given its heavy reliance on 
international investment, and experienced 
a 14% contraction over the year. The 
Turkish economy suffered a relatively mild 
recession, contracting by 6% over the year. 
Ukraine
The Group’s Ukrainian business started 
the year well, with 10%+ growth in the 
largest first quarter events, Public Health 
and World Food Ukraine. However, the 
severity of the economic downturn severely 
affected the business from the second 
quarter onwards resulting in the business 
selling only 33,200m
2
 this year compared 
to 56,000m
2
 last year. The two large Spring 
events serving the agricultural industry and 
the construction industry both reported 
volume sales more than 50% lower than 
last year’s events. Despite the significant 
space shortfalls, the flexibility of our 
business model allowed management to 
execute cost savings across the business

ITE closed its Urumqi office in China earlier

good growth in its sales to the Group’s 
exhibitions. ITE has recently acquired 
a small exhibition business in India 
comprising an office and two established 
exhibitions – one serving the paper mill 
industry and one serving the mining and 
metallurgy industry. These exhibitions are 
both biennial and are the beginning of the 
Group’s presence in India. ITE has sought to 
establish a base in India as the exhibition 
industry is sub-size for its economy, and 
its economy is expected to show good 
growth over the coming years. However 
the growth of the exhibition industry is 
currently constrained by the lack of suitable 
large international venue facilities.

Finance Director’s statement
Revenue and gross profit 
Revenue for the year was £1 16.7 
million (2008: £109.8 million). On a 
like-for-like basis this represents a 6% 
decline over last year’s revenue. 
The Group achieved a gross margin of 52% 
(2008: 50%). The current year included the 
biennial Moscow International Oil & Gas 
Exhibition which is a high margin event 
and this replaces the biennial Ankomak 
event held in Istanbul which has space 
sales of over 45,000m
2
 but with lower 
margins. This effect was complemented 
by the Group’s focus on maintaining 
event margins through reducing venue 
commitments and staff costs.
Administrative expenses across the Group 
decreased to £18.3 million from £18.8 
million in the previous year. Administrative 
expenses include significant non-cash 
items, including an amortisation charge of 
£4.3 million (2008: £2.6 million) reflecting 
the impact of the acquisitions made in 
the year together with a full year’s charge 
for acquisitions made during 2008, and 
a charge for share-based payments of 
£1.1 million (2008: £0.9 million). Offsetting 
these items are foreign exchange gains of 
£3.9 million (2008: £0.3 million) arising 
on the translation of foreign currency 
denominated assets held by overseas Group 
companies. Overall, Group administrative 
expense represented 16% of revenue 
(2008: 17%), resulting in net operating 
margins of 37% (2008: 33%) for the year. 
Operating profit was £42.9 million 
against £36.4 million last year. 
Headline pre-tax profit this year was 
£45.8 million (2008: £37.0 million).
Other operating income
Other operating income represents 
rental income earned from subletting 
surplus office space, principally 
at ITE’s London offices.
Finance income 
Finance income derived from interest on 
bank deposits decreased significantly 
during the year to £0.6 million (2008: 
£1.9 million) as the Group held lower 
average cash balances throughout 
the year of £23.1 million (2008: £36.5 
million) and worldwide interest rates 
were reduced to historically low levels.
Finance costs
Finance costs of £2.1 million (2008: £3.9 
million) represent the interest cost of the 
Group’s borrowings in Euro and US Dollar, 
bank charges and the loss on settlement of 
the Group’s derivative financial instruments 
not in hedging relationships of £1.7 million 
(2008: £3.3 million). The Group enters into 
currency borrowing arrangements as part 
of its currency hedging activity and at 30 
September 2009 the Group had currency 
borrowings of €7.9 million, and $3.6 million, 
a total of £9.5 million (2008: £6.6 million).

Tax charge
The tax charge of £10.8 million represents 
26% (2008: 32%) of profit before tax. The 
reduction in tax rate results from a lowering 
of underlying corporation tax rates within 
our main operating economies, with the 
most significant effect coming from Russia, 
which reduced its headline corporation tax 
rate to 20% (previously 24%) from 1 January

Acquisitions 
On 23 January 2009, ITE acquired 100% 
of the issued share capital of Newex 
Marketing Limited (Newex) for a cash 
consideration of $5.1 million (£3.7 million) 
and contingent consideration of £0.6 
million, based upon the performance of 
the business over 2009 and 2010. Newex 
owns 75% of the company which owns the 
East Mediterranean International Travel and 
Tourism exhibition (‘EMITT’), Turkey and the 
leading hotel guide for the Turkish market.
During the year the Group paid £3.8 
million in deferred consideration in 
relation to acquisitions made in 2008, 
bringing the liability on its balance sheet 
as at 30 September 2009 to £1.1 million, 
which it expects to pay during 2010. 
Balance Sheet
The Group’s consolidated balance 
sheet at 30 September 2009 is 
summarised in the table above:
Net assets increased by £12.7 million to 
£56.7 million. The main changes are in 
goodwill and intangibles (an increase of 
£3.5 million), deferred income (a decrease 
of £19.8 million) and deferred consideration 
(decrease of £3.8 million), offset by a 
decrease in net cash (£6.0 million), and a 
decrease in trade receivables (£10.9 million).
Investment and capital expenditure
The Group’s capital expenditure on 
plant and equipment for the year was 
£0.4 million (2008: £1.1 million) and 
included exhibition equipment, computer 
equipment and associated software. 
Venue arrangements
The Group has long-term arrangements 
with its principal venues in its main 
markets setting out ITE’s rights over

The Group funds the development of 
venues and facilities where improved 
facilities will enhance the prospects and 
profitability of its organising business. The 
funding can take the form of a prepayment 
of future venue fees (‘advance payment’), 
or a loan which can be repaid by cash or 
by offset against future venue fees (‘venue 
loan’). Generally the funding brings rights 
over future venue use and advantageous 
pricing arrangements through long-term 
agreements. Venue loans and advance 
payments are included in the balance sheet 
under non-current and current assets.
At 30 September 2009, the Group’s

Capital
During the year the Company issued 
199,800 ordinary shares of 1p. All of the 
total new issues were pursuant to the 
exercise of options and yielded aggregate 
consideration of £1 1,500. The Company 
also purchased 5,000,000 shares for the 
Employees Share Option Trust (‘ESOT’) 
and at 30 September 2009 ESOT held 
10,602,886 (4.3%) of the Company’s issued 
share capital (2008: 6,967,783; 2.8%).
Post balance sheet events
On 27 November 2009, the Group 
purchased 70% of Airgate Holdings ltd, 
a Cypriot company, which in turn owns 
100% of the shares in an Indian exhibition 
organiser based in Delhi. The initial 
purchase consideration paid on completion 
was €2.2 million, with further consideration 
to be paid in 2010, once the results for 
the latest financial year are confirmed. 
Due to the proximity to the date of 
signing these accounts, the IFRS 3 
acquisition accounting has not been 
finalised and the associated IFRS 3 
disclosures are therefore not completed.
Treasury
During the year, the Group experienced 
net foreign exchange gains of £2.2 million 
(2008: loss of £3.1 million). The exchange 
rate for the Euro at 30 September 2009 
was €1.09:£1 (30 September 2008: 
€1.26:£1); the exchange rate for the 
US Dollar at 30 September 2009 was 
$1.59:£1 (30 September 2008: $1.82:£1).
During the year, 77% of the Group’s sales 
were priced in Euros, 9% in Sterling and 1% 
in US Dollars, the balance being in local 
currency. Overall 51% of the Group’s cash 
receipts for the period were collected in 
‘hard’ currency (Sterling, US Dollars or 
Euros) and 49% was collected in various 
local currencies, the majority being Rubles.
The Group uses derivative instruments 
and currency borrowings to protect 
itself against the effect of currency 
fluctuations on a proportion of its sales 
and its balance sheet. The Group’s policy 
on derivative instruments is that:
it will hedge no more than 75% •	
of the value of anticipated hard 
currency collated sales; and
it will only enter into derivative •	
transactions up to 36 months ahead. 26 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Business review
Finance Director’s statement continued
At 30 September 2009, the Group had 
entered into forward contracts to sell 
Euros for Sterling between October 2009 
and September 2012. The value of the 
contracts is €64.5 million at an average 
rate of €1.10:£1. These instruments are 
designated as hedging instruments.
Over the year, the Group has entered 
into currency borrowing arrangements to 
minimise its exposure to foreign exchange 
risk on trade receivables. At 30 September 
2009 the Group had borrowings of 
€7.9 million, and $3.6 million. The cash 
balance of £23.1 million at 30 September 
2009 is net of these borrowings.
The Group finances its operations through 
cash holdings. The objective of the 
Group is to maximise investment income 
and minimise interest costs, bearing 
in mind its liquidity requirements. 
For short-term debt, such as overdraft 
facilities or debt with a term of less than six 
months, fixed or floating rates of interest 
are used. For debt with a term of greater 
than six months, it is policy that at least 75% 
must have fixed rates of interest so as to 
minimise the Group’s exposure to interest 
rate movements. As at 30 September 2009 
all of the Group’s borrowing requirements 
were in the form of overdraft facilities. 
It is Group policy that its cash balances 
are not invested in instruments that would 
put the capital value at risk. All invested 
funds have a determinable rate of interest.
Liquidity risk
The Group policy is to ensure continuity 
of funding for operational needs through 
cash deposits and debt facilities as 
appropriate. The key requirement for 
the business is to maintain flexibility to 
allow the Group to take advantage of 
opportunities that could arise over the 
short term. The needs of the business are 
determined on a rolling cash flow forecast 
basis, covering weekly, monthly and 
twelve monthly requirements. Short-term 
flexibility is maintained by holding cash in 
current accounts and high liquidity money 
market funds. The Group has overdraft 
facilities in place both to permit currency 
borrowing as part of its foreign exchange 
management and to allow flexibility 
in where it holds its cash balances.
Recent events in the world financial markets 
have highlighted the risks associated with 
holding deposits in foreign domiciled 
banks. The territories in which ITE operates 
do not all have internationally recognised 
banks and the Group has relationships with 
a number of domestic banks. The Group 
seeks to use the territory’s leading bank and 
to minimise the level of cash held in such 
banks. Of the Group’s total cash balance 
of £32.6 million as at 30 September 2009, 
78% was held in institutions with a rating 
of grade A or above and 9% in B to BBB+.
Going concern
The Group and Company’s business 
activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in 
the Business review on pages 14 to 21. 
The financial position of the Group and 
Company, its significant cash balance, its 
cash flow, liquidity position and absence 
of long-term borrowings are described 
on the previous pages. In addition, in the 
general information section and note 20 of 
the notes to the financial statements the 
Group and Company’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; 
its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk are referred to. 
 
After making enquires, reviewing the Group 
and Company’s forecasts and projections 
and taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue its operations for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they have adopted 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report and financial statements. ITE Group plc 27 Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Risks and uncertainties
The Group identifies and monitors the key risks and uncertainties affecting the Group and runs the business in a way that 
minimises the impact of such risks where possible.
Operational risks Potential impact Mitigation
Political uncertainty and 
regulatory risk
The Group’s business is principally carried  
out in Russia and the CIS. Changes in law  
or the regulatory environment could have  
an effect on some or all of the exhibitions  
of the Group. 
ITE has reduced the risk by establishing its 
business as independent Russian and CIS 
companies fully contributing to the local 
economy. The diversity of businesses across 
sectors and geography provides protection 
for the longer-term prospects of the Group.
Economic instability 
reduces demand for 
exhibition space
Reduced demand for exhibition space would 
reduce the profits of exhibitions. 
ITE operates across a wide range of sectors 
and countries to minimise the exposure to 
any single market. ITE, through its 
relationships with venues and staff has a 
relatively flexible cost structure, allowing it  
to manage its event margins in the short and 
medium term. 
Commercial relationships The Group has key commercial relationships 
with venues which secure the Group’s rights 
to run its exhibitions in the future.
These key relationships are regularly 
reviewed and the Group seeks to maintain  
its exhibition rights for at least three years 
forward for significant exhibitions.
Venue availability Damage to or unavailability of a particular 
venue could impact the Group’s short-term 
trading position. 
The Group carries business interruption 
insurance policies which protect profits on 
our largest 20 events against such an event in 
the short term. In the longer term the Group 
seeks to maintain good relationships with its 
principal venues to ensure the continuance  
of availability.
Competitor risk Competition has existed in ITE’s markets for 
some years. ITE faces competitive pressures 
on a market-by-market basis. 
In all of its overseas markets, ITE has  
a strong position as an international  
organiser, achieved through effective use  
of its international sales network and its 
established brands for major events. A single 
exhibition or sector in a market could have 
its prospects curtailed by a strong competitor 
launch; however, the breadth of ITE’s 
portfolio of events, with its geographic  
and sector diversity, reduce the risk of  
a competitive threat to the Group’s  
overall business.
People ITE’s employees have long-standing 
relationships with customers and a unique 
knowledge of the exhibitions business. Loss 
of key staff could impact the short-term 
prospects of a specific event or sector.
ITE has sought to build loyalty in its staff by 
ensuring remuneration is competitive and 
through a wide distribution of the Group’s 
long-term incentive plans. ITE has a good 
record of retaining its key staff through both 
growth and recessionary times.
Financial risk –  
foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to movements in 
foreign exchange rates against Sterling for 
both trading transactions and for the 
translation of overseas operations. The 
principal exposure is to the Euro, which  
forms the basis of invoicing and to the Ruble 
which is the trading currency of the Group’s 
Russian operations.
The Group seeks to minimise exposure by:
limiting soft currency deposits; and •	
protecting a certain amount •	
of Euro denominated sales 
with forward contracts. 
maintaining the majority of its •	
cash balance in ‘hard currency’. 28 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Overview
The Board of ITE believes that corporate 
and social responsibility is an important 
part of the Group’s culture and that the 
adoption of good practice will have a 
positive impact on profits and increase 
the long-term value for shareholders. Due 
consideration is given to risks arising from 
social, environmental and ethical issues as 
part of an ongoing risk review process.
Social interaction
The Board of the Company is aware of both 
the benefits to its business of engaging 
with its various constituencies in a socially-
responsible manner and the risks of failing 
to do so. As an operator of internationally-
focused businesses in emerging markets, 
the Company ensures that it is culturally 
sensitive in its dealings with the local 
community and that its employment and 
development policies are non-discriminatory 
and encourage the employment of local 
nationals at all levels in the Company. 
The Company actively supports its 
employees in their support of local 
community projects. In the past year the 
Group has made charitable donations to 
‘SOS children’s villages Kazakhstan’, ‘Astana 
children’s home’, ‘Aknied (a Kazakhstan local 
charity), Football Club ‘Pakhtakor’, Youth 
Sport Development Foundation (Uzbekistan) 
and the Uzbekistan Society for Handicapped 
People. In 2009 the Group has made 
charitable donations of over £18,000, and is 
looking to increase the number of its offices 
which take part in charitable activities.
Employees 
Employees are selected and promoted on 
the basis of merit and ability, regardless 
of age, gender, race, religion, sexual 
orientation or disability. The Group has 
a policy of encouraging employees, 
especially those from the locations in 
emerging markets, to move around the 
offices of the Group, thus providing 
development opportunities for all staff. 
In addition, employees are assisted in their 
career development through an annual 
appraisal scheme and sponsored training 
is provided where there is a benefit to both 
the individual and the Company. All staff 
are eligible for issues of share options or 
Governance
Corporate social responsibility
awards under the Employee’s Performance 
Share Plan as the Board feels that it is 
important for them to take an active part 
in the success of the Company and to 
share in the long-term value they help to 
create. The Board recognises the need to 
provide a safe working environment for 
employees and exhibitors and visitors at the 
Group’s events. Each office is responsible 
for ensuring that their business operates 
in compliance with Group policies and the 
relevant local health and safety legislation. 
During the year, all employees in the 
London office have had a ‘refresher’ health 
and safety training session. Staff from all 
regions with lead responsibility for the 
operation of the Group’s exhibitions on-site 
also attended an updated training course.
Ethics
Integrity is core to the Group’s values 
which it actively promotes in its dealings 
with employees, shareholders, customers 
and suppliers and with the authorities of 
the countries in which it operates, and 
recognises that reputation is a valuable 
and fragile asset gained over a substantial 
period. The leadership position of the 
Group’s exhibitions and the long-term 
growth of its core shows is a testament 
to the success of its practices.
The Group promotes high ethical standards 
in carrying out its business activities and 
has clear guidelines for dealing with gifts, 
hospitality, corruption, fraud and the use of 
inside information. All ITE staff are required 
to comply with the laws and regulations 
of the country in which they operate. 
The Group is a member of UFI (the 
worldwide exhibition organisers association) 
and through this, the attendance figures 
at our key exhibitions are audited by 
independent services. This helps to provide 
assurance to our exhibitors and visitors 
as to the standard of our exhibitions.
The Group aims to provide a high-
quality of service at all its events in 
all locations. The Group operates to a 
strict minimum quality level to ensure 
events are provided to exhibitors and 
visitors at international standards, 
irrespective of where they are held. ITE Group plc 29 Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
The Group ensures that all advertising 
and public communications avoid 
untruths or overstatements.
ITE builds a relationship with 
suppliers based on mutual trust and 
undertakes to pay suppliers on time 
and in accordance with agreed terms 
of business. All information regarding 
the relationship between the Group and 
a supplier must remain confidential.
Environment
As a media services company, the Group 
acknowledges that its business has 
an impact on the environment, albeit 
relatively minor, and ITE recognises 
the importance of following good 
environmental practice. The Company is 
aware that this is an area of increasing 
concern to employees, shareholders and 
customers alike. The Company does not 
manufacture or sell any tangible products 
and has identified the principal areas of 
environmental impact as energy use, waste 
recycling, paper & printing and travel. 
The Group has set the following Key 
Performance Indicator’s for managing 
its environmental impact:
1) Reduce its carbon footprint by 
office environments by 201 1; and 
2) Introduce a carbon offset programme 
on business travel during 2010.
The Company has engaged the services 
of ‘Carbon Smart’ to assist them in 
measuring their carbon footprint and 
how it can be reduced. The Group 
will be aiming to achieve Carbon 
Smart’s Blue standard in 2010.
By identifying environmental 
improvements, we expect to see increased 
efficiencies and with that, reduced costs and 
the management of environmental issues is 
part of our business strategy to create long-
term value for shareholders. The Group 
already undertakes a number of initiatives 
aimed at reducing its carbon footprint:
The Group encourages the recycling •	
of waste paper and office waste and 
plans to increase the recycling rates 
and materials recycled throughout 
the Group. The Group has recently 
introduced a ‘paid-for’ waste recycling 
initiative in our London office.
The Group has installed video- •	
conferencing facilities at its London, 
Huddersfield, Moscow, St Petersburg, 
Kyiv, Istanbul and Hamburg offices 
to reduce staff travel requirements.
Computers and IT equipment are •	
recycled where possible and redundant 
equipment is either sold to staff or 
given to charitable organisations. 
The Group has been reducing its printed •	
materials over the last few years, with 
a greater reliance on electronic media 
for its marketing materials. However, 
catalogues and delegate packs are still 
printed and the Group is implementing a 
set of operating standards to be followed 
by suppliers aimed at controlling 
paper sourcing and use of materials.
The Group encourages staff to use •	
public transport through offering 
season ticket loans for London staff.
The Group is taking advantage of •	
recent e-communications legislation 
for communicating with shareholders 
and so will be able to reduce the 
volume of printed materials produced 
with the publication of our Annual 
Report and Interim Statement.
The Group’s activities in staging 
exhibitions and conferences do impact 
on the environment, through waste and 
natural resources usage from materials 
used in assembling exhibition stands 
and travel to exhibitions and conferences 
for exhibitors, delegates and ITE staff. 
Presently, practice in controlling waste at 
different exhibition centres varies widely 
through the different regions in which the 
Group operates. The Group follows current 
best practice in each of its markets by 
observing industry and country legislation. 30 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

There were no other changes in the interests of Directors between 30 September 2009 and 30 November 2009. 
Right to purchase the Company’s shares
At the Annual General Meeting on 27 February 2009, the shareholders authorised the Company to make one or more 
market purchases of up to 24,790,790 of the Company’s ordinary shares to be held in treasury at a price between 1p 
(exclusive of expenses) and 105% of the average middle market price of a share for the five business days immediately 
preceding the date on which the share is purchased. 
The Company has a remaining authority to purchase 24,790,790 of its own shares into treasury which will expire at the 
next Annual General Meeting on 28 January 2010.
Donations
The Group made £18,168 of charitable donations (2008: Nil) during the year. No political donations were made (2008: Nil).
Employees
The Group’s human resources strategy is to attract and retain talented, high-calibre employees focused on achieving 
excellent results. Remuneration policy is designed to achieve this aim.
The Group places great importance in the development of its staff to support the business in meeting its objectives. This  
is reflected in the training initiatives in place for staff, both internally and externally. The Group keeps employees informed 
on matters affecting them and on matters affecting the Group’s performance through regular newsletters and through 
meetings, both formal and informal. Employees are able and are encouraged to move around the Group in order to 
experience the business environment in other offices. The Group actively encourages the participation of employees  
in activities of offices other than their own. The Group distributes long-term incentives widely to staff in all offices. At  
30 September 2009 approximately 47% of staff held long-term incentives in some form. As a result, the Group’s employees 
identify strongly with ITE’s overall objectives.  34 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
It is the Group’s policy to consider fully applications for employment by disabled persons, bearing in mind a number  
of factors including their suitability and fit for the role, irrespective of any disability. In the event of a member of staff 
becoming disabled, every effort would be made to ensure their continued employment and progression in the Group.  
It is Group policy that training, career development and promotion of disabled employees match that of other employees 
as far as possible.
Supplier payment policy
The Company’s policy, which is also applied to the Group, is to agree payment terms with suppliers when entering into 
each transaction to ensure that suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and to abide by the terms of payment. 
The Company has no trade creditors. Trade creditors of the Group at 30 September 2009 were equivalent to three days 
(2008: nine days) purchases, based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Annual General Meeting
Shareholders will see from the Notice of the Annual General Meeting, to be sent separately, that they are to consider and,  
if thought fit, to pass resolutions relating to business (including receiving and adopting the Directors’ report, re-election  
of Directors, declaration of a final dividend and the reappointment of auditors) and resolutions that have become routine 
business at the Annual General Meeting of most public companies. The resolutions relate to:
renewal of the authority for the Directors to allot relevant securities; •	
renewal of the powers of the Directors to allot equity securities as if pre-emption rights did not apply; and •	
renewal of the authority for the Company to purchase certain of its own shares and to hold them as treasury shares. •	
In addition, shareholders will also be asked to vote on resolutions covering:
any necessary incidental changes to the Articles of Association; and •	
approval to call general meetings, other than Annual General Meetings, on not less than 14 days’ clear notice. •	
Auditors
The Directors will place a resolution before the Annual General Meeting to reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditors for the 
ensuing year and to approve their remuneration.
Each Director of the Company at the date when this report was approved confirms:
so far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined in the Companies Act 2006)  •	
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any •	
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with section 396 of the Companies Act 2006.
The report of the Directors has been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:

Directors’ report continued ITE Group plc 35 Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) 
as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; •	
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; •	
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and •	
explained in the financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will •	
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
properly select and apply accounting policies; •	
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and •	
understandable information; 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users •	
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. •	
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with relevant reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the •	
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and •	
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Statement of Director’s responsibilities 36 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Report on corporate governance
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance that was issued in 2008 by the Financial Reporting Council (‘Combined Code’) for which the Board is 
accountable to shareholders.
Statement of compliance with the Combined Code
During the financial year, the Company complied with all of the provisions set out in section 1 of the Combined Code. 
Statement about applying the principles of good governance
The Company has applied the principles of good corporate governance as set out in the Combined Code. The explanation 
of how the principles have been applied is set out below and in connection with Directors’ remuneration, in the Report  
on remuneration.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors meets not less than seven times a year. The Board considers a range of matters for its approval, 
including setting Group strategy, acquisition policy, the budgets, major capital expenditure and material contracts. The 
Board monitors the performance of the Group’s businesses against appropriate forecasts and key performance indicators. 
The Board is supplied with financial and operational information on a timely basis to enable it to discharge its duties and 
carry out its responsibilities. All Directors have access to the Company Secretary, Neil Netto, and there is a procedure to 
enable them to take additional independent professional advice at the expense of the Company. The Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director is Michael Hartley.
In addition to the Chairman, the Board comprises three Non-executive Directors and two or three Executive Directors 
during the year. The Board currently has four Non-executive Directors (including the Chairman) and three Executive 
Directors which it considers to be an appropriate balance of Executive and Non-executive Directors. The roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive are separate, and each has defined roles and responsibilities approved by the Board.
The Nomination Committee considers all appointments made to the Board. The full terms and conditions of all 
appointments are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office and will be available for review before the 
Annual General Meeting. The Nomination Committee collectively recommended appointments to the Board.
The Directors’ diversity of experience and knowledge of the markets in which ITE operates is key to the development of a 
robust strategy for the Group and to its execution. The Non-executive Directors contribute an independent and objective 
view to the management of the Company and play a full and active part in the various Board committees. The names and 
biographies of the Directors are on page 30.
The Board considers Michael Hartley, Malcolm Wall and Neil England to be independent, and recognises that Iain Paterson 
was independent on the date of his appointment.
In accordance with the Articles of the Company, all Directors are required to stand for re-election at least every three years. 
The Non-Executive Directors met formally without the Executives present during the year. A formal evaluation of the Board 
and its Committees was carried out. The Chairman circulated a questionnaire to each Director that sought views on various 
factors concerning the workings of the Board and its effectiveness. The results were collated and debated by the Board. 
The general outcome and resulting actions included improvements being made to: the process for assessing the progress 
of various matters; the risk management review; and access and contact with senior management. As a result of the overall 
review, if necessary, the Directors receive additional training and tutoring. The Chairman’s performance was evaluated by 
the Senior Independent Director after consultation with other Board members. A number of matters were discussed at 
these meetings which served to enhance further the satisfactory performance of the Board.
The following table sets out the number of meetings of the Board, and of the principal Committees of the Board during the 
financial year, together with details of attendance. During the year, the Directors attended all of the Board and Committee 
meetings that were held.

The fees of the Non-executive Directors are proposed by the Chief Executive and approved by the Board, taking account  
of practice adopted in other companies and the time commitment required. The fees of the Chairman are determined  
by the Committee taking account of the role and the time commitment required. The Chairman does not take part in  
those discussions.
Communication with shareholders
The Board considers communication with all shareholders to be extremely important. Shareholders are provided either in 
hard copy or online, with full-year and interim accounts to help them keep up to date with the performance of the Group 
and are given the opportunity to ask questions directly of the Board at the Annual General Meeting. The Chairmen of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees are available at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions. The 
Chairman and the Senior Independent Director are generally available to discuss shareholders’ concerns as and when 
required. The Group’s website (www.ite-exhibitions.com) is regularly updated with copies of all Group press releases  
and presentations given to shareholders.
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional 
shareholders by making strategic presentations to institutional investors every six months following the publication  
of the half-year and annual results, by meeting shareholders to discuss long-term issues and obtain their feedback and  
by communicating regularly throughout the year.
Board Committees 
The Board has established three Committees all of which have written terms of reference. The terms of reference for the 
Committees are available on the Company’s website at www.ite-exhibitions.com.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises only Non-Executive Directors. The Audit Committee’s terms of reference include all 
matters indicated by Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.1 and the Combined Code. The Committee was chaired by 
Michael Hartley whom the Board considers has appropriate financial expertise to fulfil this role. The other members are 
Malcolm Wall and Neil England. The meetings are also attended by the Chairman, the Finance Director, and the auditors, 
together with any other member of staff considered necessary by the Committee to complete its work. The Committee 
meets at least four times a year and ensures that at least twice a year it meets with the auditors without executives or other 
members of staff present to discuss matters relating to its remit and any issues arising.
The Audit Committee is responsible for:
monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s •	
financial performance and reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained therein;
reviewing the Group’s internal financial controls and the Group’s internal control and risk management systems; •	
monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function; •	
making recommendations to the Board, for a resolution to be put to the shareholders for their approval in general •	
meeting, on the appointment of the external auditors and the approval of the remuneration and terms of engagement  
of the external auditors;
reviewing and monitoring the external auditors’ independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit •	
process, taking into consideration relevant United Kingdom professional and regulatory requirements; and
developing and implementing a policy on the engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit services, taking •	
into account relevant guidance regarding the provision of non-audit services by the external audit firm.
The Audit Committee is required to report its findings to the Board, identifying any matters on which it considers that 
action or improvement is needed, and make recommendations on the steps to be taken.
The Board expects the Audit Committee members to have an understanding of:
the principles of, contents of, and developments in financial reporting including the applicable accounting standards  •	
and statements of recommended practice;
key aspects of the Group’s operations including corporate policies, Group financing, products and systems of  •	
internal control;
matters that influence or distort the presentation of accounts and key figures; •	
the principles of, and developments in, company law, sector-specific laws and other relevant corporate legislation; •	
the role of internal and external auditing and risk management; •	
the regulatory framework for the Group’s businesses; and •	
environmental and social responsibility best reporting practices. •	 38 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
The Committee has a structured schedule of matters for consideration which is aligned with the Company’s financial 
calendar. During the financial year, the Committee’s work included the following:
reviewed the preliminary and interim results announcements and considered reports from the external auditors; •	
considered and approved audit plans; •	
considered the output from the Group-wide process used to identify, evaluate and mitigate risks; •	
reviewed accounting procedures and the internal control environment; •	
received internal audit reports from KPMG and reviewed management responses to proposals made in these reports; •	
monitored compliance with accounting standards and company law; •	
reviewed its own effectiveness; •	
reviewed the appointment of the auditors, the scope of the audit and any issues arising, their fees and the nature, extent •	
and costs of any non-audit services provided by them; and
undertaken an assessment of the qualification, expertise and resources, and independence of the external auditors and •	
the effectiveness of the audit process. 
The Committee has access to any employee and is able to obtain external advice on any matter as required. The auditors 
are able to request additional meetings at any time. 
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises only Non-Executive Directors. The Committee was chaired by Malcolm Wall.  
It meets at least three times a year. The other members are Iain Paterson, Michael Hartley and Neil England. The meetings 
are attended by the Chief Executive Officer and external advisers as appropriate. 
Further information about the Committee is set out in the Report on remuneration on page 39.
The Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises the Non-Executive Directors Iain Paterson, Malcolm Wall, Michael Hartley and  
Neil England. The Committee, which is chaired by Iain Paterson, is responsible if requested by the Board, for nominating 
candidates to the whole Board for approval, recommending the reappointment or continuation in office of any Director, 
and for considering and making recommendations to the Board on its composition and balance.
The Company Secretary is secretary to each of the above Committees.
Independence of external auditors
The Audit Committee has established clear guidelines concerning the levels of discretionary non-audit fees it considers  
are appropriate to safeguard the independence of the auditors. The Committee has implemented review and approval 
processes relating to the provision of non-audit services by the auditors, and undertakes an annual assessment of the 
auditors’ independence and effectiveness. The Audit Committee is satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards in place  
to ensure auditor independence. As a consequence of its satisfaction with the results of the activities outlined above,  
the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the external auditors are reappointed.
Whistle-blowing arrangements
The Company has a set policy to enable and encourage staff to report in confidence any possible improprieties in matters 
of financial reporting or otherwise. The procedure for reporting any such matter has been communicated to all staff.
Human Resources
The CEO has responsibility for human resources issues. The Company is reviewing its indicators and targets on employee 
turnover, spending on training and employee satisfaction.
Corporate social responsibility
Neil Jones has responsibility for environmental, social governance, community investment and corporate social 
responsibility matters. 
Internal audit function
As recommended by the Combined Code, the Audit Committee annually considers whether an internal audit function is 
appropriate and makes a recommendation accordingly to the Board. The Group engages KPMG to perform internal control 
audits at its main offices. This work is coordinated by the Head of Internal Controls & Procedures who reports KPMG’s 
findings directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee considers the Group to have an effective independent 
internal audit function.
Review of internal controls and of risk management process
The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management to provide them with reasonable assurance 
regarding effective and efficient operations, internal control and compliance with laws and regulations.
Report on corporate governance 
continued ITE Group plc 39 Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
A system of internal controls has been established to allow the Board, in conjunction with management, to identify, 
evaluate and manage the significant risks faced by the Company on an on-going and pro-active basis. The system  
also seeks to monitor the Company’s overall financial, operational and compliance positions and to help safeguard 
shareholders’ investments and to protect the Company’s assets. The Board is responsible for this process and for ensuring 
that it remains effective and, in order to facilitate it, it has established a single organisational structure with clearly drawn 
lines of accountability, appropriate delegation of authority and open lines of communication. 
The Group has a comprehensive system of financial reporting. There is a thorough budgeting system for all lines of income 
and expenditure, with an annual budget approved by the Board. Historical financial performance and revised forecasts for 
the full year are reported against budget and considered by the Board at each meeting. The Board pays particular attention 
to those matters which, by their nature, expose the Group to significant risks and uncertainties, including exchange rates, 
which can be subject to considerable volatility and can have a material impact on the Company’s operating results.
The Group has established procedures to deal with authorisations for expenditure. The Board is committed to ensuring that 
the Group’s data and infrastructure, and its information technology systems, are as secure as is reasonably practicable. 
Security controls and procedures are in place to prevent unauthorised access to the Group’s premises. Hardware and 
software controls have also been instigated to prevent unauthorised access to the Group’s computer system and network. 
Regular back-ups of electronic information are taken with copies being stored securely off site.
These systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
This system of internal control has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report. 
It is reviewed regularly by the Board and complies with the Turnbull guidance. The Board has performed a specific 
assessment of internal controls. The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large 
and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts & Reports) Regulations 2008. The report also links the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles 
relating to Directors’ remuneration. As required by the relevant legislation, a resolution to approve the report will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The relevant legislation requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ 
remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
Report on Remuneration
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 
2006. The report also links the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes 
how the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors’ remuneration. As required by the Act, a resolution to 
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements  
will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ remuneration  
report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Accounting Regulations. This report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) are the Group’s four Non-Executive Directors,  
Malcolm Wall (Chairman), Michael Hartley, Iain Paterson and Neil England. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for:
recommending to the Board the remuneration and terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman, Executive •	
Directors and key members of senior management; 
measuring subsequent performance as a prelude to determining the Executive Directors’ and key managers’ total •	
remuneration on behalf of the whole Board; and
granting awards under the ITE Group’s Performance Share Plans and options under the various ITE Group Share Option •	
Schemes outlined below. 
During the year, the Committee consulted with Hewitt New Bridge Street (a trading name of Hewitt Associates) for advice 
on Executive remuneration and the operation of the various ITE Group share schemes. Hewitt New Bridge Street has 
provided no other services to the Company. 40 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Remuneration policy 
The Company’s principal remuneration policy aim is to ensure that compensation offered is appropriate to attract, retain 
and motivate Executive Directors and staff with the ability and experience to deliver the Company’s strategy and grow the 
business, having regard to the prevailing economic conditions and competition for such people in the markets in which the 
Company operates. 
In formulating its policies the Committee has regard to and balances the following factors:
a) the remuneration packages offered to executives in companies competing in the same markets as the Company;
b) the remuneration practice in the markets in which the executive is principally based;
c) the need to align the interests of the executive with those of the shareholders;
d) the performance of the individual executive and of the Company as a whole; and
e) any amounts payable to executives in respect of services performed for the associates of the Company.
The Committee Chairman liaises with the Group’s independent remuneration adviser and others to ensure that pay and 
employment conditions in the Group as a whole are taken into account when framing the executive remuneration policy.
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will  
ensure that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or 
governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, the Committee will ensure that the 
overall remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.
In addition, the Committee regularly reviews the executive remuneration policy to ensure that it takes due account of 
market practice, best practice and the specific circumstances of the Company.
The remuneration packages of the executives comprise base salary and benefits, a performance-related bonus and 
longer-term share-based incentive arrangements. A significant proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration is, 
therefore, performance related. 
Policy criteria for various components 
Base salary 
Base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee. Base salary levels are set by the Committee, taking into account 
each Executive Director’s role, experience, performance and the markets in which they perform their duties. The base 
salaries for Russell Taylor and Neil Jones, and the consultancy remuneration for Edward Strachan are regularly reviewed 
and are subject to benchmarking exercises against industry and sector comparators. Details of the Executive Directors’ 
base salaries for the year commencing 1 October 2009 are set out under ‘Directors’ service contracts’. Only the Finance 
Director had an increase in base salary, otherwise it should be noted that the Executive Directors base salaries have not 
increased since 1 October 2008. Please see table on page 42 for review dates for the upcoming financial year.
Variable bonus
The Executive Directors and certain senior management participate in performance-related annual bonus schemes 
(‘Executive Bonus Plan’), which recognise Company objectives to deliver growth of headline profit before tax. For the 
financial year commencing 1 October 2009, Russell Taylor’s and Neil Jones’ maximum annual bonus opportunity provided 
under the Executive Bonus Plan will be 100% and 65% of base salary respectively. Edward Strachan’s annual bonus 
opportunity through the Company’s consultancy agreement with Kyzyl Tan Consultants Limited (‘Kyzyl Tan’) is on a similar 
basis to the Executive Bonus Plan, and for the financial year commencing 1 October 2009 is capped at 100% of the Kyzyl 
Tan consultancy fee and his remuneration as a Director. In all cases, no bonus will be payable unless a minimum financial 
target is achieved.
 
For the financial year ending 30 September 2009, a bonus equating to 58% of the maximum bonus opportunity will be paid 
to the Executive Directors under the Executive Bonus Plan.
Long-term incentives 
In recent years the Company has operated Performance Share Plans and Share Option Schemes as its share-based 
arrangements. An updated Share Option Scheme was approved by the shareholders at the last Annual General Meeting.
Performance Share Plans (‘PSP’)
The Company has operated the ITE Group plc Employees Performance Share Plan 2004 and the ITE Group plc Key 
Contractors’ Performance Share Plan 2004. Awards can be made to executives and senior management over shares worth 
up to 100% of base salary each year, and under the latter scheme to key individuals who are not Group employees. 
Report on corporate governance 
continued ITE Group plc 41 Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Until the financial year commencing 1 October 2009, awards were granted subject to aggregate three year headline 
earnings per share targets. Further information regarding these targets are found on page 44.
This performance condition was chosen by the Committee to take account of the Company’s biennial business cycle and to 
incentivise management to deliver sustained headline earnings per share performance over the relevant three year period. 
The targets are based upon a compound rate of growth in headline diluted earnings per share. The targets are calculated 
for each of the three performance years, taking account of any material events which are not annually recurring and 
aggregated into an ‘Aggregated headline diluted earnings per share target’.
The first tranche of awards made under the Plans in January 2009 were also made subject to three year aggregate headline 
earnings per share targets as set out on page 44. However, a further tranche of long-term PSP awards were made under  
the Plans in June/August 2009. Believing that it was very much in shareholders’ interests for the Company’s senior 
management and executives to be focused on the delivery of the business plan for the next five years, the Committee 
decided that this second tranche of awards should be made subject to both absolute headline Earnings Per Share targets 
for the financial year ending 30 September 2013 (as to 50% of these awards) and the Company’s relative Total Shareholder 
Return performance against specified constituents of the FTSE All-Share Media sector over a period ending 31 December 
2013 (as to the remaining 50% of these awards). It should be noted that total awards made in the financial year ending  
30 September 2009 were made within the annual 100% of salary plan limit.
It is currently intended that awards made under the Plans in the financial year commencing 1 October 2009 will revert to 
being subject to aggregate three year headline earnings per share targets.
Executive Directors will be required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of 
awards under the Plans, until they have built up a shareholding of a value equivalent to at least 1x annual base salary.
Share option plans
The Company has previously operated the following option schemes: the ITE Group 1998 Company Share Option Plan;  
the ITE Group 1998 Discretionary Share Option Scheme; the ITE Group 1998 Key Contractor Share Option Scheme. These 
schemes expired on 12 March 2008 and were replaced by the 2009 Discretionary Share Option Scheme, as approved by 
shareholders at the last Annual General Meeting. The Company has also previously operated the ITE Group Employee Share 
Trust Unapproved Share Option Scheme. It is not intended that the Executive Directors will participate in the 2009 
Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
Pensions 
The Company offers a stakeholder pension to its employees but currently makes no Company contribution under  
this scheme. 
Since his appointment as Chief Executive Officer in May 2008, the Company makes a contribution equal to 10% of Russell 
Taylor’s base salary to his personal pension scheme. 
Directors’ service contracts 
Executive Directors
Russell Taylor (Chief Executive) and Neil Jones (Finance Director) have UK contracts of employment which reflect market 
and best practice for senior management serving in the UK and have no fixed term. Notice periods and base salary details 
for all Directors are outlined in the tables set out below. Other than the contribution to Russell Taylor’s pension scheme 
described above, there are no contributions to pension schemes. The standard terms provide for medical insurance and life 
insurance but provide for no other fringe benefits such as Company cars. 
In the event of early termination of an Executive Director’s contract, it is the Committee’s policy that (subject to the 
provisions of each contract) the amount of compensation (if any) paid to the Executive Director will be determined by 
reference to the relevant circumstances that prevail at the time. The Committee’s objective will be to avoid rewarding poor 
performance. Furthermore, the Committee will take account of the Executive Director’s duty to mitigate their loss.
Edward Strachan’s remuneration as a Director from 1 October 2009 is £37,000. In addition, Edward Strachan is 
remunerated as a consultant through the Company’s agreement with Kyzyl Tan. The agreement with Kyzyl Tan is on a six 
month rolling notice period. The base consultancy fee under this agreement for the year commencing 1 October 2009 is 
£328,000. Kyzyl Tan is entitled to a bonus based upon the same targets and criteria as the Executive Bonus Scheme, which 
is capped at 100% of Kyzyl Tan’s base consultancy fee and Edward Strachan’s remuneration as a Director for the year 
ending 30 September 2009 i.e. £365,000 in total. Under the Kyzyl Tan contract, Edward Strachan is required to reside in the 
markets where his management responsibilities are based and Kyzyl Tan is entitled to an annual living away from home 
allowance of up to $90,000 for its employee. 0

The Remuneration Committee considers that Edward Strachan’s unique knowledge and skills of managing the exhibition 
business in the regions for which he is responsible, together with the requirement for him to reside abroad, warrants the 
Company entering into a consultancy contract. The Committee firmly believes that this contract is in the best interests of 
the Company. 
Consistent with market practice, there are no service contracts or other employment arrangements with any of the 
Executive Directors with fixed terms or notice periods in excess of one year or terms which would expose the Company to 
compensation payments in excess of one year’s total remuneration.
The dates of each contract, the relevant notice period and base salary for 2009–2010 are as follows:
 
      Notice Base salary Review 
Name     Date of contract period 2009–2010 dates
Russell Taylor     25 March 2003 12 months £365,000 February 
Neil Jones     3 November 2008 12 months £200,000 October
Edward Strachan     30 June 2003 6 months £37,000 October
Edward Strachan through Kyzyl Tan Consultants Ltd    1 October 2005 6 months £328,000 October
Non-executive Directors
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are entitled to one months’ written notice to terminate their contracts but no 
further rights to compensation payments on termination. The effective dates of the contracts are as follows: Iain Paterson, 
27 May 2002; Michael Hartley, 20 October 2003; Malcolm Wall, 4 May 2006; and Neil England, 18 March 2008. 
The Non-Executive Directors’ salaries were subject to an independent benchmarking exercise against industry 
comparators, taking account of their time commitment and responsibilities in 2008. There have been no increases in 2009. 
Accordingly the remuneration for the year commencing 1 October 2009 for Michael Hartley will be £40,750, for Malcolm 
Wall £40,750 and for Neil England £37,600. Iain Paterson’s remuneration will be £120,000.
Executive Directors may accept outside appointments with the prior approval of the Board and provided only that these 
appointments do not prejudice the individual’s ability to fulfil their duties at the Company. Whether any related fees are 
retained by the individual or remitted to the Company will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

(1) For the Long-term PSP awards granted in June/August 2009 that are exercisable from 31 December 2013 to  
30 December 2019, there are two performance targets applying. Half of the Award is subject to a Performance Target 
based on the Group’s absolute earnings per share during the 2012–13 financial year as follows:
EPS for the 2012–2013 financial year Percentage of one half of award that vests
Below 14p Nil
14p 25%
Between 14p and 17p Between 25% and 100% calculated on a straight-line basis.

The other half of the Award is subject to a Performance Target comparing the Company’s Total Shareholder Return against 
the FTSE All-Share Media Sector between 1 June 2009 and 31 December 2013. 25% of this portion of the award vests if ITE 
is at the median, with full vesting for upper quartile performance.
The cost of all share awards charged to the profit and loss account for the year ending 30 September 2009 was £1.2 million 
(2008: £0.9 million). 
The ITE share incentive plans operate within a standard 10% in ten year dilution limit. This provision takes account of all 
potentially dilutive awards made by the Company under any of its share incentive plans. This is because (as with certain 
other London Stock Exchange companies) the Company needs to be able to operate the discretionary scheme within this 
level (rather than being limited to 5% in any 10 year period) as it does not operate any form of share incentive on an 
all-employee basis and instead intends to extend the discretionary scheme widely to its employees. The Committee 
continues to be of the view that this approach, which has been previously agreed with shareholders, remains appropriate 
and that, therefore, it would be inappropriate to introduce a dilution limit that relates to awards under discretionary/
executive schemes only. However, the Committee will keep the dilutive impact of the share incentive schemes under 
regular view to ensure that the interests of shareholders are taken into account.
The maximum number of new share issues possible under the ten year dilution limits in the option trust deeds is 
10,790,238. Additionally the Employee’s Share Trust (‘ESOT’) can hold up to 5% of the Company’s issued share capital 
against share awards.

We have audited the Group financial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 2009 which comprise
the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, the Consolidated
Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 27. The financial reporting framework that
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted
by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with sections 495 and 496 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body,
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of  
the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the
Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (‘APB’s’) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 September 2009 and of its profit for the year  •	
then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and •	
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. •	
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or •	
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. •	
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
the Directors’ statement contained within the Corporate Governance Section in relation to going concern; and •	
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the •	
June 2008 Combined Code specified for our review. •	
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended and on the
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Consolidated cash flow statement
For the year ended 30 September 2009 ITE Group plc 51 Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
General information
ITE Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is given on page 85. 
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 1. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set 
out below.
Change in accounting policies
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’
In the current financial year, ITE Group plc has changed its accounting policy on event revenue recognition. Previously, the 
Group recognised revenue on a straight-line basis, evenly over the days over which an event was being held. As a result of 
the change in policy, revenue is now recognised on completion of the event. Management judges that the new policy 
provides a more accurate representation of the revenue earned as the Company’s obligations can only be fully discharged 
on completion of an event, and a partial service cannot be provided. The comparative financial statements for 2008 have 
been restated. The effects of these changes on the comparative figures are:
Year ended 30 September 2008: Decrease in ‘Revenue’ of £271,000, a decrease in ‘Cost of sales’ of £159,000 and a •	
decrease in ‘Tax on profit on ordinary activities’ of £22,000. On the balance sheet at 30 September 2008, ‘Trade and 
other receivables’ increased by £159,000, ‘Deferred income’ by £271,000, ‘Trade and other payables’ decreased by 
£22,000 and ‘Retained earnings’ decreased by £90,000.
The 2009 full year effect of the above accounting policy change is the reversal of the effects described above.
Impact of new accounting standards
In addition the following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the year ending 
30 September 2009, and these have been adopted but have had no impact on the 2009 Group financial statements:
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Agreements; •	
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes; •	
IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction; and •	
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation. •	
The following new standards have been issued which are not applicable to the Group since they are only effective for the 
Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2009. These are also not expected to have a material impact 
on the Group financial statements:
Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements (effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January •	
2009). This amendment introduces changes to the way in which movements in equity must be disclosed and requires an 
entity to disclose each component of other comprehensive income not recognised in profit or loss. The amendment also 
requires disclosure of the amount of income tax relating to each component of other comprehensive income as well as 
other minor disclosure amendments. 
Amendment to IAS 23, Borrowing Costs (effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January, 2009). This standard •	
requires all borrowing costs which are directly attributable to an acquisition construction or production of a qualifying 
asset to form part of the cost of that asset. The Group does not expect a significant impact from this standard.
Amendment to IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (effective for periods commencing on or after  •	
1 July, 2009). The amendment introduces changes to the accounting for partial disposals of subsidiaries, associates and 
joint ventures. Adoption of these amendments is not expected to significantly impact the measurement, presentation  
or disclosure of future disposals.
Amendments to IAS 32, Puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation (effective for periods •	
beginning on or after 1 January, 2009). The amendments are relevant to entities that have issued financial instruments 
that are (i) puttable financial instruments or (ii) instruments, or components of instruments that impose on the entity  
an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets on liquidation only. As a result of the 
amendments, some financial instruments that currently meet the definition of a financial liability will be classified as 
equity because they represent the residual interest in the net assets of the entity. The amendments set out extensive 
detailed criteria to be met in order to be able to classify these instruments as equity. The impact of these amendments  
is restricted to specific cases and no analogies can be made. The Group does not expect a significant impact from the 
adoption of this standard.
Amendments to IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement (effective for periods commencing  •	
on or after 1 July, 2009). The amendments clarify treatment of inflation in a financial hedged item and one-sided risks  
in a hedged item. The Group does not expect a significant impact from the adoption of this standard.
Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment (effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January, 2009). The •	
amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. Other features of a 
share-based payment are not vesting conditions. It also specifies that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other 
parties, should receive the same accounting treatment. The Group does not expect a significant impact from the 
adoption of this standard.
Notes to the consolidated accounts 52 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Amendment to IFRS 3, Business Combinations (effective for periods commencing on or after 1 July, 2009). The •	
amendment introduces changes that will require acquisition related costs to be expensed and adjustments to contingent 
consideration to be recognised in income and will allow the full goodwill method to be used when accounting for 
non-controlling interests. This will result in a change to the Group’s accounting policy for purchases of stakes in 
controlled entities. 
IFRS 8, Operating Segments (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January, 2009). IFRS 8 sets out disclosure •	
requirements concerning an entity’s operating segments, products, services, geographical areas in which it operates 
and its major customers. IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14, Segmental Reporting. The Group does not expect a significant impact 
from the adoption of this standard.
2008 Annual Improvements (the majority of changes will effect periods beginning on or after 1 January, 2009). The •	
standard makes 41 amendments to 25 IFRSs as part of the first annual improvements project. The amendments include: 
restructuring IFRS 1, mainly to remove redundant transitional provisions; an amendment to bring property under 
construction or development for future use as for future use as an investment property within the scope of IAS 40. Such 
property currently falls within the scope of IAS 16; and an amendment to clarify the circumstances in which an entity 
can recognise a prepayment asset for advertising or promotional expenditure. Recognition of an asset would be 
permitted up to the point at which the entity has access to the goods purchased or up to the point of receipt of services. 
The standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group. In relation to the amendment to IAS 38 
regarding prepayments for advertising or promotional expenditure, the Group will be required to reassess its 
accounting approach to reflect the requirements of the standard.
The following interpretations have been issued which are not applicable to the Group since they are only effective for the 
Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2009. These are also not expected to have a material impact 
on the Group financial statements:
IFRIC 17 Distributions of non-cash Assets to Owners (effective 1 July 2009) •	
IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets to Customers (effective 1 July 2009) •	
Basis of accounting
ITE Group plc is a UK listed company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as ‘the Group’. 
The Company is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. In addition, the Group has complied with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (‘IASB’). 
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses. These 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time 
and are used to make judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from 
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to estimates and assumptions are 
reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are made. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future as disclosed in the Directors’ report on page 35. 
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, 
except for the revaluation of financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company 
drawn up to 30 September each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. The interest  
of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised. 
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the 
interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used 
into line with those used by the Group. 
Notes to the consolidated accounts 
continued ITE Group plc 53 Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured  
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business 
combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition 
under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) 
that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations), which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. If the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the minority’s proportion of the net fair value 
of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value 
of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an 
asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement 
and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested  
for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, pro-rata on the basis 
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit 
or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.  
The Group has elected to treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as Sterling  
denominated assets.
 
Intangible assets
Computer software is initially measured at purchase cost, acquired trademarks, brands and customer lists are measured at 
fair value. Computer software, trademarks, brands and customer lists have a definite useful life and are carried at cost or 
fair value less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over 
their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are typically between three and seven years, with some trademarks 
having an estimated useful life of up to 20 years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows 
that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is 
an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have 
not been adjusted. 54 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment is recognised 
immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in 
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a 
revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, 
on the following bases:
Leasehold improvements       term of lease
Fixture and fittings       ten years
Plant and equipment       four years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or 
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint 
control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the 
power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over 
those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method  
of accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post acquisition changes  
in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of  
an associate in excess of Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form 
part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate 
at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment 
and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share 
of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is 
credited in profit or loss in the period of acquisition.
 
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which 
case an appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Venue advances
Where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either off-setting against future venue hire or 
by cash repayment, the fair value is recognised based on the discounted value of future cash receipts. The loan balance is 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the ‘effective interest rate method’. Appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are 
recognised at cost as prepayments in venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Financial Instruments
Classes of financial instruments
The Group aggregates its financial instruments into classes based on their nature and characteristics. The details of 
financial instruments by class are disclosed in note 20 to the accounts.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and 
derivative assets at fair value through profit or loss. The classification is determined by management upon initial 
recognition, and is based on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Financial assets are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its financial assets are to be impaired. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence of impairment. Financial assets are derecognised  
(in full or partly) when the Group’s rights to cash flows from the respective assets have expired or have been transferred 
and the Group has neither exposure to the risks inherent in those assets nor entitlement to rewards from them.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash 
and cash equivalents are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition cash and cash 
equivalents are stated at fair value with all realised gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included  
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in  
an active market. This category includes the following classes of financial assets: trade and other receivables and  
venue advances.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised  
cost. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there  
is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The estimates are based on specific credit circumstances and the Group’s 
historical bad receivables experience. No interest is charged on the loans and receivables, due to either their short-term 
nature or specific arrangements in place, and hence the effective interest rate method is not applied. 
 
Derivative assets
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or 
little net initial investment and is settled at a future date. Derivative assets are classified as at fair value through profit or 
loss. Derivative assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value 
at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement. These derivatives are 
acquired in full compliance with the Group’s risk management policies.
Financial liabilities 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories: bank borrowings, trade and other payables held  
at amortised cost and derivative liabilities through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
Written put options
Any contract with a single or multiple settlement option that contains an obligation for the Group to purchase equity in a 
subsidiary for cash gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the repurchase price. An amount equal to the 
liability is recorded in equity on initial recognition of a written put option. The liability is subsequently remeasured through 
profit or loss. 56 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges 
are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit or loss and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. Where bank overdrafts are deemed to be integral to the 
Group’s cash management activities, they are presented within net cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement. 
Overdrafts that are considered to be financing in nature are presented as financing activities in the cash flow statement.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade 
payables are derecognised in full when the Group is discharged from its obligation, it expires, is cancelled or replaced by  
a new liability with substantially modified terms. Trade and other payables are short term and there is no interest charged 
in connection with these, hence the effective interest method is not applied.
Derivative liabilities
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or 
little net initial investment and is settled at a future date. 
Derivative liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss. Derivative liabilities are measured at initial 
recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance date with the resulting gains 
and losses recognised in the income statement. 
These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Group’s risk management policies.
Hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group uses 
derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge these exposures. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement 
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the 
recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates its derivative 
financial instruments as cash flow hedges. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if  
the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than twelve months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within  
twelve months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and  
the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.  
At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used 
in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values of cash flows of the hedged item.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The effective portion of changes in the fair value  
of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to any 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement, and is included in ‘Finance income/cost’ in the 
income statement. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item 
is recognised in the income statement, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity 
at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group’s use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s financial policies. Further details on these policies can 
be found in the Business review on pages 14 to 21. 
Fair values
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction 
between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
Notes to the consolidated accounts 
continued ITE Group plc 57 Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
The Group determines the fair value of its financial instruments using market prices for quoted instruments and widely 
accepted valuation techniques for other instruments.
Valuation techniques include discounted cash flows, standard valuation models based on market parameters, dealer quotes 
for similar instruments and use of comparable arm’s length transactions.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of 
business net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised on completion of an event. Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable costs 
relating to future events are deferred. The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event income 
and prepaid event costs respectively. Losses anticipated at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest  
rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions
Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, 
revenues and costs are recognised in the income statement. 
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after the share of results of associates and profit or loss on disposal of Group undertakings and 
before investment income and finance costs. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will 
be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not affect the tax profit or the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset  
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends  
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 58 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual 
rate where applicable. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate 
prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost  
in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the 
retranslation of monetary items, are included in income for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation  
of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in income for the period except for differences arising on the 
retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-
monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Details of the Group’s accounting polices for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative 
financial instruments.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and 
their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange 
rates at the date of transaction are used. Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the 
Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the 
operation is disposed of.
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 (the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates), cumulative translation 
differences for all foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero. Consequently, any gain or loss  
on disposal will exclude translation differences that arose prior to 1 October 2004.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Employee Share Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust (‘ESOT’). Shares in the Company held 
by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to 
profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied IFRS 2 (share-based payment). IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after  
7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding 
the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are 
not made on such a basis. Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the following judgements and assumptions have been made by 
management and have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or have the most 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-
generating units to which goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an 
estimation of future cash flows expected from the cash-generating unit for a period of ten years and a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate present value. The ten year period used in the calculation is based on management’s average 
expectation of the period over which the value will be derived from the cash-generating units. The carrying value of 
goodwill and intangible assets at 30 September 2009 is £44.6 million and £16.0 million respectively.
Intangible assets
The valuation of intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future cash 
flows arising from customer relationships and trademarks to determine the value of those intangible assets. This involves 
estimating the period over which the customer relationships and trademarks affect future cash flows. 
Share-based payments 
The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at their estimated fair  
value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant  
date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will 
eventually vest. The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Group’s 
share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives. Management regularly performs  
a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest; this is dependent on the anticipated number  
of leavers. 
Taxation 
Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a tax structure which makes 
the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the 
Group and is often dependent on the efficiency of legal processes. Such issues can take several years to resolve. The Group 
however takes a considered view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that 
the eventual resolution could differ significantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Group’s results 
and future cash flows. 60 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

For diluted and headline diluted earnings per share       239,382 252,140
Basic and diluted earnings per share
The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the profit for the financial year attributable to equity 
holders of the parent of £30.4 million (2008: £23.4 million). Basic and diluted earnings per share were 12.8p and 12.7p 
respectively (2008: 9.4p and 9.3p respectively).
Headline diluted earnings per share
Headline diluted earnings per share is intended to provide a consistent measure of Group earnings on a year-on-year basis 
and is 14.2p per share (2008: 10.1p). Headline basic earnings per share is 14.2p per share (2008: 10.2p).

10 Goodwill acquired through business combinations
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units that are expected to 
benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:
 
        2009 2008 
        £000 £000
UK & Western Europe        10,873 10,873
Central Asia & Caucasus        7,400 6,080
Russia        23,298 21,579
Eastern & Southern Europe        3,048 2,450
        44,619 40,982
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might  
be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions 
for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to cash flows 
during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of 
the time value of money and risks specific to the cash-generating units. The growth rates are based on management 
forecasts. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based upon the most recent financial plans approved by the Board and 
extrapolates the planned cash flows. Assumed growth rates based on GDP growth rates in the local markets and 
management judgements have been applied for the first four years beyond the detailed plans and a rate of 3% is applied 
thereafter. These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for our business in the relevant markets.
The discount rates applied to the cash-generating units are between 9% and 13%.
 
The only addition in the year relates to the acquisition of Newex Marketing Limited LLC which gave rise to £2.0 million of 
goodwill. Other movements relate to the revaluation of goodwill due to foreign exchange movements. 
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and growth rates used. Management believes that  
no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value to exceed its 
recoverable amount.

The values used in accounting for the identifiable assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are provisional in nature  
at balance sheet date. If necessary adjustments will be made to these carrying values and the related goodwill, within  
12 months of the acquisition date. The goodwill arising on acquisition of Newex Marketing Limited represent significant 
expected synergies with other operations of the Group and the complementarity achieved with the Group’s existing

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
The cash at bank and in hand comprises cash held by the Group and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less. The carrying value of these assets approximates their fair value. The cash balance is represented by £19.3 
million of Sterling, £10.2 million of Euros, £1.1 million of US Dollars and £2.0 million of other currencies. Surplus funds are 
placed on short-term deposit with floating interest rates.
The venue advances and other loans of £2.0 million due after one year is all due within five years (2008: £Nil due after 
more than five years). The venue loans repayable by cash are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. 
The venue prepayments are held at cost. All venue advances are stated net of allowance for doubtful receivables. The 
venue advances are denominated primarily in either Euros or US Dollars and are analysed as follows:

16 Bank overdraft
The bank overdrafts are all repayable on demand. Of the total borrowing, £7.5 million (2008: £4.7 million) is denominated 
in Euros and £2.0 million (2008: £1.8 million) is denominated in US Dollars. The borrowings are arranged at floating interest 
rates, thus exposing the Group to interest rate risk. The Euro and US Dollar borrowings are taken out to act as a partial 
hedge against the UK monetary assets in those currencies.
The overdraft has been secured by a guarantee between ITE Group plc, ITE Exhibitions & Conferences Limited, International 
Trade and Exhibitions (JV) Limited, ITE Overseas Limited, ITE Enterprises Limited, ITE Moda Limited and ITE Moda Footwear 
Limited and a charge over the assets of International Trade and Exhibitions (JV) Limited. The average interest rate on the 
bank overdrafts approximates 1.8% per annum (2008: 4.9%) and is determined by reference to base rate plus 0.5%. The 
Directors estimate the carrying value of the overdrafts approximates their fair value. At 30 September 2009 the Group had 
£10.5 million (2008: £13.4 million) of gross undrawn committed borrowing facilities.

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in the above table. The following is the analysis of deferred tax 
balances for financial reporting purposes:
        2009 2008 
        £000 £000
Deferred tax liabilities        (4,134) (3,617)
Deferred tax assets        1,268 1,594
        2,866 (2,023)
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £1.9 million (2008: £1.5 million) available for offset  
against future profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the 
unpredictability of future profit streams. These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of 
subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £4.5 million (2008: £3.7 million). No liability 
has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Details of the accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset and financial liability

        19,885 20,574
Maturity of financial instruments 
In 2009, all financial liabilities except the put option and derivative financial instruments have a maturity of one year or 
less. The put option is an open option with no fixed maturity date. Out of the total of £0.3 million of derivative financial 
assets, £0.2 million had a maturity of one year or less and £0.1 million had a maturity of one to two years. Out of the total 
of £0.8 million of derivative financial liabilities, £0.8 million had a maturity of one to three years. 
In 2008 all financial liabilities except the put option have a maturity of one year or less. The put option is an open option 
with no fixed maturity date.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate to their fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.

The Group seeks to minimise the effects of foreign currency risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the 
risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board. Compliance 
with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board on a continuous basis. The Group does not enter into financial 
instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. 70 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Financial risk management
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to a number of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency 
and interest rate), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. This note presents the Group’s exposure to each of the above 
risks. The Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks can be found in the Business 
review on pages 14 to 21. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.  
The Board has put in place policies that have been established to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set 
appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value 
of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest 
rates. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. Market risk 
exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence, exposures to exchange rate 
fluctuations arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward-plus  
or forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
reporting date are as follows:

Forward foreign exchange contracts
As at 30 September 2009 the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that the Group has 
committed to amounted to €64.5 million. These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for 
the next 36 months and are renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing the Group to less than six 
months or more than 36 months in the future.
At 30 September 2009, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a net liability of approximately £0.6 million 
(2008: £1.0 million). These amounts are based on market valuations. 
The Group has taken out foreign currency overdrafts in Euros and US Dollars to act as a natural hedge against  
certain currency trade receivable balances. These borrowings have not been designated as hedging instruments by  
management. All foreign exchange movements on these borrowings and trade receivables are recognised directly  
in the income statement.
 
Interest rate risk management
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, other than cash, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are 
substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its 
borrowings at floating interest rates. This risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate level of floating 
interest rate borrowings. The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in 
the liquidity risk section of this note.

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for financial assets and 
financial liabilities at the balance sheet date. With all other variables held constant the table below demonstrates the 
sensitivity to a 1% change in interest rates applied to the major currencies of net variable rate asset/liabilities. 1% is the 
sensitivity rate that represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.

Credit risk management
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its contractual obligations. The Group’s principal financial 
assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, venue advances and derivative financial instruments. 
These represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The Group has adopted a policy of only 
dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group’s 
objective is to ensure all customers have paid before any service is provided to them. The concentration of credit risk is 
limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The ageing profile of the Group’s trade receivables and the details of the Group’s allowances for doubtful receivables can 
be seen below.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments arises due to where the liquid funds are held. The 
territories in which ITE operates do not always have banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating 
agencies such as Moody’s and Fitch. The Group aims to minimise the exposure to credit risk by minimising the level of cash 
held in such banks. The Group’s exposure and credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the 
aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Management review debtors ageing on a contractual basis and also based on when an event has been held. The Group 
raise invoices on events using stage payments. Any overdue amounts, after the stage payment due date, are reviewed  
and chased. Management also review the debts due based on when an event has taken place, as this is typically when  
the service is provided. Both measures are included in the table above as both are used by management to manage 
outstanding debts.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by 
the Group’s management based on prior experience, specific credit issues and their assessment of the current economic 
environment. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical 
areas and the Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The 
demographics of the Group’s customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers 
operate, has less of an influence on credit risk. 
The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade 
receivables when there is objective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full. The allowance is recognised and 
measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows, where 
material discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition. The main component of this allowance  
is a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposure on shows which have taken place but the  
debt has not been collected in full. This allowance is determined by reference to the specific circumstances of each show 
and past experience.
The details of the movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables are shown below.

Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due. Such risk may result from 
inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing problems. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests 
with the Board of Directors. They have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of 
the Group’s short-, medium- and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt 
facilities as appropriate. 
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the 
Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, bank overdraft, which is disclosed in note 16 and equity attributable to equity 
holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 21 to 22.

At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 17 November 1998, shareholders approved the establishment of the ITE 
Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘ESOT’). The terms of the ESOT allow the trustees to transfer shares to employees 
who exercise options under the Company’s Share Option Schemes, to grant options to employees and to accumulate shares 
by buying in the market or subscribing for shares at market value. The ESOT is capable of holding a maximum of 5% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The ESOT reserve arises in connection with the ESOT. The amount of the reserve 
represents the deduction in arriving at shareholders funds for the consideration paid for the Company’s shares purchased 
by the Trust which had not vested unconditionally in employees at the balance sheet date.
The ESOT held 10,602,886 shares in ITE Group plc at 30 September 2009 (2008: 6,967,783 shares). During the year 
1,871,100 share options and 1,857,342 nominal share options under the Employees Performance Share Plan were granted 
against ESOT held shares. The market value of the ordinary shares held by the ESOT at 30 September 2009 was £10.2 
million (2008: £8.4 million).
The Company has agreed to make available to the ESOT an interest-free loan of up to £12.5 million for the purpose of 
buying shares. At 30 September 2009, the amount of the loan drawn down was £9.8 million. The ITE Group plc Company 
only profit and loss account and balance sheet include the results of the ESOT for the year ended 30 September 2009.

25 Share-based payments
The Company operate two share option schemes.
Share option plans
The Company operates a share option plan for all employees of the Group. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the

and are exercisable up to ten years from granting. The options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the 
options vest.
Performance share plans
The Company operated a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for executives and staff. Awards under the PSP are at an exercise 
value of either 1p or nil. Awards can be made to an employee over shares up to a maximum of 100% of base salary each 
year based on market value. The vesting period is three years and awards are exercisable up to ten years from the date of 
grant. For conditional awards the vesting is automatic on the satisfaction of performance targets. The options are forfeited 
if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. The awards are also subject to a performance target. Further 
details of the performance targets can be found in the Report on remuneration. 76 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Independent auditors’ report to the members of ITE Group plc
We have audited the Parent Company financial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 2009 which 
comprise the Parent Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 10. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with sections 495, 496 and 497 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by 
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2009; •	
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and •	
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. •	
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the •	
Companies Act 2006; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is •	
consistent with the Parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not •	
been received from branches not visited by us; or
the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in •	
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or •	
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. •

1 Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The financial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Group going concern disclosure on page 52.
These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Companies Act 2006 and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards and have been applied consistently.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and 
the preceding year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets
Trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. 
The estimated useful lives are up to 20 years.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, it is probable  
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount  
of the obligation.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes  
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors and creditors
Trade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value. Trade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances  
for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for on  
an accrual basis to profit or loss.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and 
its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in 
periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all 
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the 
future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding 
agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial 
statements. Neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable 
gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences 
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance  
sheet date.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at 
that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets are included in profit or loss for the period.
Employee Share Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust (‘ESOT’). Shares in the Company held 
by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to 
profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value 
(excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
2 Profit for the year
The profit after tax for the year ended 30 September 2009 was £124.4 million (2008: £29.8 million). As permitted by 
Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.

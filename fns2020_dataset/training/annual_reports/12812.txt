Introduction
The year ended 30 June 2009 proved to be 
an extremely challenging period for Pure Wafer. 
With the semiconductor industry struggling to 
recover from the slowdown experienced during 
last financial year, the onset of the worldwide 
economic recession during the first quarter 
of the financial year pushed the industry into 
the worst downturn ever experienced. We saw 
business in volume terms drop dramatically 
during our third quarter, compounded by falling 
selling prices as competitors sought to maintain 
volume sales. 
During the period the weakening of Sterling 
against the US Dollar mitigated some of the effect 
of the falling revenue streams, when converted 
to Sterling as our presentational currency.
Financial results
›  Turnover £17.2m (2008: £22.3m).
›  Operating loss £3.8m (2008: profit of £0.2m).
›  Pre-tax loss £5.3m (2008: £0.8m).
›  Pre-tax loss before restructuring costs and 
other gains and losses £4.4m (2008: £0.1m).
›  Basic loss per share 19.9p (2008: 23.1p). 
›  Net cash inflow from operating activities 
£2.8m (2008: £1.7m).
The board is encouraged by the actions of the 
management team during the period to reduce 
the impact of the market conditions by reducing 
costs across all areas of the business as well as 
focusing on revenue generation during a difficult 
trading period.
Group funding
Following the refinancing and equity fundraising 
in August 2009, the group is now on a much 
firmer financial footing. Our negotiations with the 
bank and asset funders succeeded in rescheduling 
the group’s existing debt over a six year period 
which includes up to two years of capital 
repayment holiday together with an additional 
overdraft facility of £1.4m.
As a condition of the financial restructuring, 
and to demonstrate their commitment and 
confidence in the business, certain directors 
and senior management invested £0.3m of 
cash into the business by way of a placing, 
alongside an open offer to shareholders, 
which was well supported. This together 
with the placing of excess shares raised 
a total of £2.0m of funds before costs.
The financial restructuring and take-up of 
the open offer and placement demonstrates 
the commitment that the bank, asset funders, 
shareholders and management have to Pure Wafer 
and shows a confidence in the recovery of the 
business and I would like to thank them for 
their support.
Management
In February 2009, we announced that 
Eurfyl ap Gwilym would be stepping 
down from his position of non-executive 
chairman to non-executive director; I was 
appointed as non-executive chairman in 
his place. I have served on the Pure Wafer 
board since October 2008, and led the 
complex negotiations with its lenders 
during the financial restructuring.
We further strengthened our board with 
the appointment of Tim Lowe as group 
finance director during August 2009. Tim 
qualified as a chartered accountant in 1988 
with T ouche Ross and is an experienced public 
company finance director, whose previous 
positions included group finance director of 
PKL Holdings plc (an AIM listed company). 
We also appointed Jerry Winters to the Board 
during November 2009. He has many years’ 
experience of manufacturing in the semiconductor 
industry and more specifically in the wafer 
reclaim sector, including as managing director 
of Pure Wafer Inc. since the acquisition of this 
company in 2007. We see Jerry’s appointment 
as a reflection of the growing importance of 
the US market to the Pure Wafer group.
I would like to thank the entire team for their 
support and effort during what has been a 
turbulent and challenging year.
Chairman’s statement
Pure Wafer’s successful financial restructuring and 
open offer demonstrates confidence in the recovery 
of the business and provides a strong foundation 
on which to move forward.

Highlights
›  Successful financial restructuring
›  Significant board changes
›  Signs of industry recovery
Outlook
Although it is too early to be confident 
about a sustained return to growth, recent 
trading together with positive news in the 
press of returning volumes and an industry 
recovery are encouraging signs from which 
we draw confidence that the growth in volume 
recovery, that we have seen over the last 
few months, will be maintained.
This together with our additional funding 
gives Pure Wafer a strong foundation on 
which to move forward.

Operational review
The financial year ended June 2009 proved to 
be a difficult period as the semiconductor industry 
suffered the most severe and sharp decline in 
its history, following the world economic turmoil 
during our first quarter.
Volume sales were severely affected during 
the period with 300mm wafer reclaim down 
by 22% when compared to the prior year, and 
200mm wafer reclaim down 11%. Whilst we 
saw a promising start to the period for volume 
sales, the second half of the year was severely 
affected. We saw a rapid decline in the third 
quarter, finally stabilising with a small recovery 
by the financial year end.
During a year of difficult trading conditions, 
the company concentrated on reducing its cost 
base. The board undertook a further operational 
restructuring process during the year ended 
30 June 2009, which has further reduced the 
production costs per wafer and thus enhanced 
the competitiveness of the group’s products. Further 
successful, engineering-led cost reduction activities 
have enabled us to reduce the consumable 
costs per wafer and certain fixed costs, all without 
affecting the quality of the group’s product offering.
In conjunction with the operational restructuring 
and due to low production volume requirements 
we implemented short time working during the 
second half of the period, where all employees 
took periods of unpaid leave each month. 
This was to maintain the essential level of skill 
base within the business required to produce 
a quality product, whilst giving cost savings 
proportional to volume trading.
I would like to thank all our employees for 
supporting the short-time working initiative, 
enabling Pure Wafer to continue to trade 
competitively throughout this difficult period.

Market
Despite the downturn we have made 
significant progress in increasing our 300mm 
wafer reclaim market share in the US, from our 
Prescott, Arizona facility. The Prescott facility 
is now fully equipped for large scale 300mm 
production and, with the quality of offering equal 
to the stringent requirements of our blue chip 
customer base, we envisage further significant 
market gains.
Whilst there have been some corporate 
failures within the competitive landscape, 
there still remains a worldwide overcapacity 
of wafer reclaim services, which in turn is 
reflected in continued pressure on selling 
prices. However, as customer specification 
requirements increase, the capacity of high 
quality reclaim services is restricted to wafer 
manufacturers who have both the technical 
know how and the relevant measurement 
equipment to produce an offering to the 
quality required.
Chief executive’s review
Pure Wafer is well placed to take advantage 
of any industry upturn following its operational 
restructuring together with significant and 
successful cost reduction activities.
_1_PUR_ar09_Front.indd   6 20/11/2009   13:50:54 07 Annual report and accounts 2009  Pure Wafer plc
With the group’s current installed capacity 
for 300mm and smaller diameter wafers 
at Pure Wafer’s high quality facilities in 
Swansea and Prescott, Arizona, together 
with the reduced cost per wafer, the board 
believes that the company is well placed 
to take advantage of any industry recovery.
new products
We continue to explore new opportunities 
outside our core business of wafer reclaim, 
to enhance our portfolio of products. We are 
looking at areas where we have certainty 
of the end market and where we will not 
incur significant research and development 
costs. We are confident that we can deliver 
new product developments in areas of global 
growth, compatible with our existing core skills 
and world-class manufacturing equipment 
and facilities.

r evenue
Revenue for the period was £17.2m, a decrease 
of 22% on last year (2008: £22.3m); an analysis 
of turnover by origin and destination can be found 
in note 5.
Volumes
The volume of 300mm equivalent wafers at 
844,000 (2008:1,029,000) was a reduction 
of 18% in the year. An analysis of turnover by 
origin and destination can be found in note 5.
Gross profit
Gross profit at £4.0m (2008: £6.2m), a reduction 
of 35%, was impacted both by the reduction in 
average 300mm selling prices in the marketplace 
and by the reduction in volumes. The gross profit 
margin reduced accordingly to 23% (2008: 28%).
Operating loss
The operating loss of £3.8m (2008: 
profit of £0.2m) was achieved after incurring 
£0.4m (2008: £0.4m) of restructuring costs. 
administrative expenses
Administrative expenses of £7.5m (2008: 
£5.7m) for the group show an increase however 
this is due to the increase in depreciation and 
amortisation charge included in the operating profit 
which was £4.4m (2008: £2.9m).
(Loss)/profit before tax
The loss before tax was £5.3m (2008: 
£0.8m profit).
Foreign exchange
As over 95% of group revenue is in US Dollars, 
revenue and margins are impacted by the 
movement in the currency. 
We continue to convert as much of the 
cost base as possible to US Dollars in order 
to provide a natural hedge against the US Dollar 
revenue streams. 
The group’s two major operating subsidiaries in 
the UK and the US both use the US Dollar as 
their functional currency. The strengthening of the 
US Dollar against Sterling during the year has led 
to an increase in the valuation of the fixed asset 
base of the group, which drives a retranslation 
gain of £3.9m, recorded directly in reserves.
Cash flow and capital expenditure
The group continues to be cash generative on 
an operating level, with a net cash inflow from 
operating activities of £2.8m (2008: £1.7m). 
taxation
There is no current tax charge across the 
group. Due to the losses incurred during the 
year, the Board has taken the prudent decision 
not to recognise the deferred tax asset of £6.4m 
(2008: £5.6m) in the balance sheet, as it is 
not expected to be utilised within the 
foreseeable future. 
ePs and dividend
Basic loss per share for the period was 19.9p 
(2008: 23.1p).
Due to the current economic climate, the cash 
constraints faced by the group moving forward 
and the lack of available distributable reserves 
the Board is not able to recommend the payment 
of a dividend for this financial year.
Maturity of debt
At the year end the company was in negotiations 
with its existing lenders to restructure the capital 
repayment terms of bank loans, hire purchase 
and finance leases. Although these negotiations 
were very well advanced at 30 June 2009 they 
were not completely finalised until shortly after 
the year end. 
Financial review
We continue to convert as much of the 
cost base as possible to US Dollars in 
order to provide a natural hedge against 
the US Dollar revenue streams.
_1_PUR_ar09_Front.indd   8 20/11/2009   13:51:02 09 Annual report and accounts 2009  Pure Wafer plc
At 30 June 2009, the group had ceased 
making capital repayments in line with the 
bank loan, hire purchase and finance lease 
agreements that were in place at that date. 
Accordingly, the group was in technical breach 
of those agreements and all debt is presented 
as repayable immediately as is shown in the 
statutory column of the balance sheet.
On 20 August 2009, the group reached an 
agreement with its lenders to restructure the 
capital repayment terms of bank loans, hire 
purchase and finance leases as set out in note 
31 of the financial statements. Accordingly, at 
the date of approval of the financial statements, 
the group is no longer in breach of the revised 
agreements. The proforma information presented 
on the balance sheet shows how the balance 
sheet would have appeared had that agreement 
been completed before 30 June 2009.

The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements of the group for the year ended 30 June 2009.
Principal activity 
The principal activity of the group remains the reclaim of silicon test wafers. The principal activity of the company is as a holding company 
and the provision of management services to the group’s trading subsidiaries.
The consolidated income statement is set out on page 21.
A review of developments affecting the group during the year and its prospects for the future is set out in the chairman’s statement, 
chief executive’s review and the financial review.
Business review
A detailed review of the group’s operations and key performance indicators is contained in the chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5, the chief 
executive’s review on pages 6 and 7 and the financial review on pages 8 and 9.
Information about the use of financial instruments by the company and its subsidiaries is given in note 25 to the financial statements. 
Dividends
The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2008: £nil).
Risks and uncertainties 
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the company’s long-term performance.
Market risk
Volumes – in the current climate, there is a risk that sales volumes, whilst currently recovering, will decrease if the industry recovery is not sustained, 
leading to a reduction in market prices as our competitors compete for existing business. We mitigate the risk by maintaining our standards of quality 
and endeavouring to qualify to provide wafer reclaim services to as many of the major semiconductor manufacturers as we can.
Price – competitive pressures create a risk that the market price for wafer reclaim services will fall, affecting our gross margin. We mitigate this risk 
by understanding the production cost for each wafer and only tendering for work at rates that will achieve an acceptable return.
Credit risk
The group offers short-term credit to customers and there is a risk that customers will default on payments for services provided. The group 
manages the risk by trading with a wide range of customers in diverse geographical locations and monitoring the creditworthiness of customers, 
both before offering credit terms and during their relationship with Pure Wafer. 
Treasury risk
Foreign exchange – the group’s sales are predominantly in US Dollars, therefore changes in the strength of Sterling against the US Dollar will 
affect reported revenue. The group currently hedges a portion of this risk with forward exchange contracts, but also achieves natural hedges by 
incurring a proportion of the group’s operating costs and securing all of the loan finance in US Dollars.
Interest rate – the group’s borrowings include variable rate term loans and fixed rate finance leases. We mitigate the risk associated with our 
variable rate loans by entering into interest rate swaps. 
Competitor risk
New entrants – the high level of investment required and the related cost of capital makes this unlikely in the current market conditions.
Technology risk
As the group operates in a technology sector, there is a risk that the process could be superseded and new capital investment required; however, 
the board feels that this is extremely unlikely in the current market and based on available knowledge of new product/technology developments.
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital are shown in note 26. The company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right 
to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the company. 
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding or on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the 
Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the company’s shares that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. Substantial shareholders are listed in a separate section that follows.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 27. 
No person has any special right of control over the company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
Directors’ report 
_2_PUR_ar09_back.indd   1 20/11/2009   14:51:53 13 Annual report and accounts 2009  Pure Wafer plc
Capital structure continued
With regard to the appointment and replacement of directors, the company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies Acts 
and related legislation. The Articles themselves may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The powers of the directors are described 
in the corporate governance section of the directors’ report on pages 12 to 16.
Under its Articles of Association, the company has authority to issue ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal value equal to 5% of the 
aggregate nominal ordinary share capital as in issue immediately following admission.
Supplier payment policy 
The group’s policy is to settle terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of trade. Trade creditors of the group at 30 June 2009 
were equivalent to 65 days (2008: 67 days) purchases, based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.

Substantial shareholders continued
Authority to issue and allot shares
The Companies Act 2006 contains restrictions on the power of the directors to allot a company’s shares. As a result, the directors may only 
issue the shares pursuant to the authority within the statutory terms given by shareholders’ resolutions or contained in the Articles of Association. 
Their power to issue equity shares for cash to persons other than the existing shareholders is similarly restricted.
Resolutions to confer these authorities were passed at the previous Annual General Meeting (AGM), not on incorporation. These authorities will 
expire at the conclusion of the next AGM unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the company in general meeting.
Resolutions to renew the authorities will be prepared at the 2009 AGM to be held on 15 December 2009.
Subsequent to the passing of these resolutions, the directors will have the authority to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £757,816 
and it will not be necessary for the directors to seek further approval from shareholders to issue shares for cash to persons, other than existing 
shareholders, up to an aggregate nominal amount of £126,303.
Health and safety, environmental and social responsibility
The company has detailed health and safety guidelines which are communicated to all employees and which are regularly reviewed for suitability 
in the context of the company’s activities.
The group is fully committed to protecting the environment in which we live and work, both ecologically and socially. A formal policy is in place 
with internal management control systems to ensure that this is achieved as best as is practicable and to ensure that the international standard 
for environmental management ISO 14001 is met.
Charitable and political donations
The group did not make any monetary charitable or political donations during the period.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5. The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the financial review on pages 8 and 9. The key business risks faced are described in the directors’ report on pages 12 to 16. In addition note 25 
to the financial statements includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The directors have assessed the balance sheet and likely future cash flows of the company and group at the date of signing the audit report. 
This review considered detailed forecasts for the period to 30 June 2012. On this basis the directors have concluded that it is appropriate 
to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
As described in the chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5, the current environment is challenging. The group has recorded a pre-tax loss: 
however, as noted in the chairman’s statement, the group successfully negotiated a financial restructuring package in August 2009. The financial 
agreements comprise the rescheduling of all of the group’s existing debt over a six year period which includes up to two years of capital repayment 
holidays together with an additional overdraft facility of £1.4m. The impact of this post year end transaction is demonstrated with the inclusion 
of a proforma balance sheet, which indicates how the balance sheet would have looked had it been signed on 30 June 2009.
As a condition of the agreement the group undertook a share placement that resulted in a total of £2.0m of funds before costs being raised 
in September 2009. This gives the group significant headroom above its forecast cash requirement, which will allow it to manage its business 
risks successfully despite the current uncertain outlook. 
The key sensitivity in the forecasts includes the achievement of increased sales volumes and the forward US Dollar rate. The business is beginning 
to see an upturn in demand and the directors believe that this will be sustained. Sales prices are assumed to remain largely unchanged.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report 
and financial statements.
Post balance sheet events
Details regarding the post year end restructuring of existing loans, arrangement of an extended overdraft facility and the placing and open offer 
for new shares as set out in the going concern section above are given in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements.
Corporate governance
The company is listed on AIM and is therefore not required to comply with the provisions of the Combined Code. However, the board adopts a 
number of principles of the Combined Code that it feels are relevant to a business of the size and complexity of Pure Wafer plc, as set out below.
During the year the board comprised a non-executive chairman, three executive directors and a further three non-executive directors who brought 
an independent judgement to the group. The roles of chairman and chief executive have been split.
All the directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary, who is responsible to the board for ensuring that board procedures 
are followed and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. If necessary, independent professional advice can be sought by all the directors 
of the company.

Corporate governance continued
Board responsibilities
The board of directors, which includes four non-executive directors, meets regularly throughout the year. 
S Boyd, C G Clarke, E ap Gwilym and P Dolan are considered by the board to be independent non-executive directors.
The board is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and investment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects and consideration 
of significant financing matters. There is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to the board’s jurisdiction. It reviews the strategic direction 
of the group, its annual budgets, the progress towards achievement of those budgets, its forecasts and its capital expenditure programmes. In furtherance 
of their duties, there are agreed procedures for the directors to take independent advice, if necessary, at the company’s expense.
The board considers the chairman to be the main point of contact to whom concerns of whatever nature may be conveyed. In the event that 
an individual does not wish to raise a concern with him, the board has identified the deputy chairman as an independent member of the board 
to whom such concerns may be addressed.
Audit committee
The company has an audit committee comprising three non-executive directors. During the period the committee was chaired by P Dolan. 
The committee provides a link between the board and the group’s auditors on matters falling within the scope of the group’s audit. These matters 
include accounting standards and policies, internal financial control procedures and the group’s statutory financial statements, which are intended 
for publication. 
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises the non-executive directors and the chairman and meets at least once a year. During the year, the committee 
was chaired by E ap Gwilym. It is the remuneration committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on executive remuneration 
and to set remuneration packages for individual directors.
Treasury committee
The treasury committee comprises the executive directors. The committee meets on an as-needed basis where speedy approval of treasury 
matters, particularly relating to foreign exchange, is required. The chairman of the committee, P Harrington, reports any decisions taken, 
with justification, to the board as quickly as practicable.
Board meetings
During the period ended 30 June 2009, there were 16 board meetings, three audit committee meetings and one remuneration committee meeting. 
Attendance was as follows:

Risk management
The board of directors has overall responsibility for the group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the role 
of management is to implement board policies on risk and control. The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure of business objectives. In pursuing these objectives, internal controls can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of this system are:
›  the audit committee;
›  a comprehensive budgeting system, with an annual budget approved by the group board;
›  detailed monthly reporting, including forecasting to the group board and comparison of results against budget, with performance monitoring 
and explanations provided for significant variances; and
›  a defined procedure for seeking and obtaining approval for major transactions.

Corporate governance continued
Risk management continued
In order to address risk management, a control framework is in place which aims, as best as practicable, to:
›  safeguard group assets;
›  ensure proper accounting records are maintained; and
›  provide reliable financial information for internal and external use.
Dialogue with shareholders
The company reports formally to the shareholders twice a year, when its half-year and full-year results are announced, and the interim report 
and annual report are sent to shareholders. The annual report is accompanied by notice of the AGM of the company, at which a presentation 
is given and directors are available to take questions, both formally during the meeting and informally after the meeting. The management is 
available for dialogue with major shareholders on the company’s plans and objectives and from time to time meets with them.
Auditors
In the case of each of the persons who are directors of the company at the date when this report is approved:
›  so far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and
›  each of the directors has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office as auditors. A resolution for their reappointment will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.

Directors’ remuneration report 
introduction
This report sets out Pure Wafer’s executive remuneration policy, structure and details of remuneration received by directors in the year ended 
30 June 2009. This report is unaudited.
Role of the remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is responsible for:
›  establishing and recommending to the board the policy for executive remuneration;
›  determining, on behalf of the board and shareholders the level and structure of remuneration packages of the executive directors; and
›  reviewing and ensuring the alignment of executive remuneration with remuneration throughout the organisation, including company share schemes.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board as a whole. No director is involved in discussions related to his own remuneration.
Membership and meetings
Members of the committee were E ap Gwilym, chair of the committee, S Boyd, C G Clarke and P Dolan. All the members of the committee 
are non-executive directors. The committee met once during the year and all the members attended the meeting.
Advisers
During the year, the remuneration committee received guidance from the chief executive officer and the company secretary, except on matters 
relating to their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The committee and board believe that in order to attract, motivate and retain a senior management team of the right calibre it is necessary 
to provide a competitive market-based remuneration structure which rewards company and individual performance.
Remuneration packages comprise:
›  basic salary;
›  annual performance related bonus;
›  other benefits; and
›  participation in share incentive plans.
Basic salary
Salaries are normally reviewed annually and any changes are effective from July in each year. Pay reviews take into account company 
and individual performance. In the period directors took a reduction in remuneration.
Performance related bonuses
Payments under the scheme are based upon the achievement of financial targets for the company as set by the remuneration committee.
Benefits
Benefits in kind include the provision of a car or car allowance, a payment of private fuel, private medical insurance, life assurance and 
permanent health insurance.
Share incentives
Remaining share options in the executive scheme have all lapsed as a result of the earnings for 30 June 2009 not achieving the vesting targets 
(2008: 414,697 options outstanding).

Share incentive schemes (non-directors)
The group also operates a share option scheme in relation to employees who are not directors.
The group had granted options over 138,621 shares during 2006. The exercise price of the options is £1.45 and the option can be exercised 
by the individuals at any point from two years from the date of issue, up to a period of ten years from the date of issue of the option. These options 
do not have any performance criteria. There remain 22,398 share options under the scheme that have not yet been exercised or lapsed.
SAYe scheme
Each year consideration is given to setting up a SAYE scheme for the benefit of all employees.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required to prepare 
the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and 
have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
›  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
›  make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
›  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
›  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
›  properly select and apply accounting policies;
›  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
›  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
›  make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Consolidated independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Pure Wafer plc
We have audited the group financial statements of Pure Wafer Plc for the year ended 30 June 2009 which comprise the consolidated income 
statement, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related 
notes 1 to 31. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Sections 495 and 496 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the group financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended 30 June 2009
1. General information
Pure Wafer plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is Pure Wafer plc, 
Central Business Park, Swansea Vale, Swansea SA7 0AB. The nature of the UK group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the 
Financial review and principal activity section on pages 8 and 9.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union 
as they apply to financial statements of the group for the year ended 30 June 2009 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
In the current year, two Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the current period. 
These are: ‘IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions and IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding 
Requirements and their Interaction’. The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to any changes in the group’s accounting policies.
IAS 1 (revised 2007), IAS 23 (revised 2007), IAS 27 (revised 2008), IAS 32 (amended), IAS 39 (amended July 2008 and November 2008), 
IFRS 1 (amended), IFRS 2 (amended), IFRS 3 (revised 2008), IFRS 8 and IFRIC Interpretations 12, 15, 16, 17 and 18 were in issue but not yet 
effective as at the year end, and have not been applied in the preparation of the financial statements. The directors do not anticipate that the adoption 
in future periods of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional 
disclosures when IAS1 (revised 2007) and IFRS 8 come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These accounting policies are based on the IFRS, IAS and IFRIC Interpretations as adopted by the EU (collectively “IFRS”). 
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5. The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the financial review on pages 8 and 9. The key business risks faced are described in the directors’ report on pages 12 to 16. In addition note 25 
to the financial statements includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The directors have assessed the balance sheet and likely future cash flows of the company and group at the date of signing the audit report. 
This review considered detailed forecasts for the period to 30 June 2012. On this basis the directors have concluded that it is appropriate 
to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
As described in the chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5, the current environment is challenging. The group has recorded a pre-tax loss, 
however as noted in the chairman’s statement the group successfully negotiated a financial restructuring package in August 2009. The financial 
agreements comprise of rescheduling all of the group’s existing debt over a six year period which includes up to two years of capital repayment 
holidays together with an additional overdraft facility of up to £1.4m. The impact of this post year end transaction is demonstrated with the inclusion 
of a proforma balance sheet, which indicates how the balance sheet would have looked had it been signed on 30 June 2009.
As a condition of the agreement the group undertook a share placement that resulted in a total of £2.0m of funds before costs being raised 
in September 2009. This gives the group significant headroom above its forecast cash requirement, which will allow it to manage its business 
risks successfully despite the current uncertain outlook. 
The key sensitivity in the forecasts includes the achievement of increased sales volumes and the forward US Dollar rate. The business is beginning 
to see an upturn in demand and the directors believe that this will be sustained. Sales prices are assumed to remain largely unchanged.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report 
and financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise Pure Wafer plc (the company) and its subsidiary undertakings, Pure Wafer International Limited 
and Pure Wafer, Inc.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the company. Control exists when the company has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value 
of the consideration plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the group’s share of the fair value 
of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill. Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions 
between group companies are eliminated; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered. Where necessary, accounting 
policies of subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.

year ended 30 June 2009 continued
2. Accounting policies continued
f oreign currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates (the functional currency). For the group’s two operating subsidiaries, Pure Wafer International Limited and Pure Wafer Inc. 
this has been determined to be US Dollars. Pure Wafer plc as an individual entity has a Sterling functional currency.
The income and cash flow statements of non-Sterling denominated group entities are translated to Sterling (the group’s presentation currency) 
at average rates of exchange in each period. Assets and liabilities of these undertakings are translated at rates of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. The differences between retained profits and losses translated at average and closing rates are taken to reserves, as are differences 
arising on the retranslation to Sterling of non-Sterling denominated group entity net assets at the beginning of the year.
Any translation differences that have arisen since 1 July 2006 are presented as a separate component of equity. As permitted by IFRS 1, 
any differences prior to this date are not included in this separate component of equity. 
Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying net 
investment hedges.
Revenue recognition
Revenue, which represents the value of goods and services supplied, excluding value added tax and trade discounts, is recognised on completion 
of the service or despatch of goods sold. In respect of the provision of wafer reclaim services, the service is deemed to be complete at the point 
that the wafers are despatched for return to the customer. If entitlement to revenue is subject to the customer’s use of reclaimed wafers, the revenue 
is deferred until the point at which the wafer is utilised by the customer and revenue is earned.
f inancial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive benefits have expired or been transferred, and the group has transferred substantially 
all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is extinguished.
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either receivables or cash and cash equivalents. They are stated at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. A provision for impairment of trade receivables 
is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of those 
receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, 
and is recognised in the income statement. For interest-bearing assets, their carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, together with other short-term highly liquid investments. 
Non-derivative financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For borrowings, their carrying value 
includes accrued interest payable, as well as any unamortised issue costs.
The group transacts derivative financial instruments to manage the underlying exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The group 
does not transact derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, as the group has decided not to hedge account for its derivative 
financial instruments as permitted under IAS 39, they are accounted for through the income statement. Derivative financial assets and liabilities 
are stated at fair value, which includes accrued interest receivable and payable where relevant. Changes in fair values are recognised in the 
income statement in the period in which they arise.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, where it is more 
likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either 
commenced or has been publicly announced. Future operating losses are not provided for.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the 
class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same 
class of obligations may be small.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are shown in the balance sheet at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition and installation of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ 
carrying amounts or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with them 
will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement 
as incurred.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the initial cost of each asset to its residual value on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life 
as follows:
Long leasehold buildings 15 years 
Fixtures and fittings 5 years 
Plant and equipment 4–10 years 
Computer equipment 3 years 
Motor vehicles 5 years
_2_PUR_ar09_back.indd   15 20/11/2009   14:51:55 27 Annual report and accounts 2009  Pure Wafer plc
2. Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment continued
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Where the carrying amount 
of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount. Gains and losses on 
disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts. These are included in the income statement.
As described in note 14, carriers, which have historically been treated as inventory are now refurbished back to their original condition and this 
extends their life very significantly. Accordingly, on 30 June 2009, the carriers were transferred to property plant and equipment. Carriers will 
be amortised over a period of four years and depreciation will be charged for the first time in 2010.
non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets are 
classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is 
regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management 
must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Government grants
Government grants are recorded initially as deferred income and recognised in the income statement in line with the expense to which they 
contribute. For grants in respect of the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the deferred income is released over the life of the related 
assets. For grants in respect of staff costs, the deferred income is released over the monitoring period of the grant offer.
intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired both tangible 
and intangible.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the income statement and cannot be subsequently reversed. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units for the 
purpose of impairment testing. Gains or losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 
internally generated intangible assets – research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the group’s development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset 
is created that can be separately identified; it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and the development cost 
of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally-generated intangible asset 
can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
intangible assets – other
These consist mainly of process development costs capitalised. The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful 
economic life of five years.
impairment of assets
Assets that have an indefinite life are not subject to amortisation and are tested at least annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to 
amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).
inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of finished 
goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating 
capacity) but excludes borrowing costs. Work in progress is valued to reflect the historical yield from the reclaim process. Net realisable value is 
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Leasing
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group at their fair value, or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance 
lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Restructuring costs
Certain costs are classified as relating to restructuring where they relate to the incremental cost of undertaking a significant change to the 
operations or staff structure of the business.
operating loss
Operating loss is stated after charging restructuring costs, but before investment income, finance costs and foreign exchange gains and losses.

year ended 30 June 2009 continued
2. Accounting policies continued
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the costs of those assets, until such time as the assets 
are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from 
the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Taxes
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, 
and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements, 
and the tax base. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and are expected 
to apply when the deferred tax liability is settled or the deferred tax asset is realised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except where it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Share-based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments, the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date 
of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the company’s estimate of shares or options that will eventually 
vest. Where the estimate of the number of options vesting due to achievement of performance conditions is revised, the change to the share-based 
payments cost is adjusted prospectively, leading to a share-based payments credit in periods where the performance criteria that were historically 
expected to be achieved are determined to be unlikely to be met. Fair value of new options granted is measured by a Black-Scholes pricing model.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
impairment of non-current assets
Determining whether goodwill, property, plant and equipment, or intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash generating units (CGUs) to which those assets are allocated. The group has two separate CGUs, representing the UK and the US businesses. 
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate present value. The carrying amount of goodwill was £4.0 m and property plant and equipment was £26.8m 
at the balance sheet date. 
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the first three years 
assuming growth based on detailed sales and cost forecasts. The cash flows are extrapolated for the following nine years assuming 6% growth. 
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows of each 
of the CGUs as defined above was based on the group’s weighted average cost of capital 8.2%. 
For both CGUs, the impairment review is sensitive to the forecast level of sales. Sales are planned to increase as demand returns to the market 
through the three year forecast period. The impairment review includes significant headroom, particularly for the US CGU, to address this. 
There is a risk of impairment if sales were to fall well below expectation.
The review of the UK CGU is also sensitive to discount rate and the forward US$ rate. Were the discount rate to increase to above 11% 
or the long term US$ forward rate to rise above $1.65, there would be a risk of impairment.
Based on the assumptions made by the directors, no impairment has been booked.

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
As described in note 25, the directors use their judgement in selecting appropriate valuation techniques for financial instruments not quoted 
on an active market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions 
are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Other financial instruments are valued using a discounted 
cash flow analysis based on the assumptions supported, where possible, by observable market prices or rates. The fair value of financial 
instruments at the balance sheet date was a net liability of £324,000 (2008: £100,000). 
Deferred tax
The group has tax losses of some £23m available for offset against future taxable profits. In determining the value of the deferred tax asset 
that can be attributed to these losses, the directors have to estimate likely future taxable profits and the period over which the asset may be recovered. 
The directors consider the most up-to-date forecasts for the business and assess the risks inherent in achieving those forecasts. At the balance 
sheet date, no deferred tax asset has been recorded. The deferred tax asset may be recognised again in future if there is an improvement in the 
forecast taxable profits. 
useful life of property, plant and equipment
The group’s plant and machinery is amortised over a period of seven to ten years. In estimating the life of the equipment, the directors have 
to consider the likely period over which the technology will be used in the market and the ability of the business to maintain the equipment 
to an appropriate condition for use. Were the technology to be superseded in a much shorter timeframe than this, the carrying value would 
need to be depreciated over a shorter timeframe, resulting in an increase in the annual depreciation charge.

5. Business and geographical segments 
The group’s activities and turnover primarily consist of the reclamation and reprocessing of silicon test wafers, in the UK and the US, 
for external customers. 
For management purposes, the group is organised into two operating divisions based on the geographical territory of origin. These divisions 
are the basis on which the group reports its primary segment information.

Diluted loss per share is the same as basic for both years because the exercise of remaining options would have been anti-dilutive. On 14 September 2009 
the company issued 99,711,511 ordinary shares, as outlined in note 31. Had these shares been in issue at 30 June 2009 the loss per share 
would have been 4.2p.

Goodwill relates to the February 2007 acquisition of the group’s US business, is denominated in US$, and is considered to represent a single 
cash generating unit (CGU).
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations 
are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management 
estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. 
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations 
of future changes in the market.

13. Goodwill and other intangible fixed assets continued
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the first three years 
assuming growth based on detailed sales and cost forecasts. The cash flows are extrapolated for the following nine years assuming 6% growth. 
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows of each 
of the CGUs as defined above was based on the group’s weighted average cost of capital of 8.2%. 
The impairment review is sensitive to the forecast level of sales. Sales are planned to increase sharply as demand returns to the market through 
the three year forecast period. The impairment review includes significant headroom to address this, but there is a risk of impairment if sales 
were to fall well below expectation.
Process development 
Process development costs are amortised over their useful economic lives which is estimated at five years.

 *  On 30 June 2008, certain spares which were used infrequently or could be refurbished were determined to be plant and machinery rather than inventory and were reclassified.
**  On 30 June 2009 carriers used in the reclamation process with a value of £1,102,000 were transferred from inventory to plant and machinery. This move reflects a change 
in the way the carriers are used allowing them to be refurbished and reused rather than disposed of after a short period of use.
Included within the net book value of plant and machinery are assets with a net book value of £4,408,000 (2008: £3,744,000) as assets held

Trade receivables 
Total trade receivables (net of allowances) held by the group at 30 June 2009 amounted to £2,027,000 (2008: £3,707,000). 
The average credit period taken on sale of goods is 36 days (2008: 71 days). The group has provided fully for all receivables which are considered 
impaired. Management performs a detailed review of the trade receivables ledger across the group at least twice annually to assess receivables 
that are past due and not recoverable. 
Before accepting any new customer, the group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines 
credit terms by customer. Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, £336,000 (2008: £593,000) is due from the group’s largest 
customer. There are no other customers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade receivables. 
Included in the group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £552,000 (2008: £1,348,000) which are past due 
at the reporting date for which the group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in the credit quality and the amounts are still 
considered recoverable. The group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of these receivables is 90 days (2008: 110).

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date 
credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. 
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

At 30 June 2009, the group had ceased making capital repayments in line with the bank loan, hire purchase and finance lease agreements 
that were in place at that date. Accordingly, the group was in technical breach of those agreements and all debt is presented as repayable 
immediately. The breaches were not enforced by the related counterparties.
On 20 August 2009, the group reached an agreement with its lenders to restructure the capital repayment terms of bank loans, hire purchase 
and finance leases as set out in note 31 of the financial statements. Accordingly, at the date of approval of the financial statements, the group 
is no longer in breach of the revised agreements. The proforma information presented in this note shows how the balance sheet would have 
appeared had that agreement been completed before 30 June 2009. Proforma information is unaudited.

The fair value of the group’s loan, finance leases and hire purchase obligations approximates their carrying amount. 
Notwithstanding the restructuring of facilities noted above the principal features of the group’s bank loans, which were used to finance the acquisition 
and development of the US business at 30 June 2009 were as follows:
›  A loan for US$7.5m (£3.7m) was taken out in May 2007 with a variable interest rate based on US LIBOR. It was repayable in quarterly 
instalments commencing three months after the first drawdown and was due to be fully repaid in February 2011. 
›  A loan for US$1.75m (£0.9m) was taken out in May 2008 with a variable interest rate based on US LIBOR. It was repayable in quarterly 
instalments commencing three months after the first drawdown and was due to be fully repaid in February 2012.
›  A loan for US$7.0m (£3.5m) was drawn down during 2008 with an effective fixed interest rate of 5.4%. It was repayable in quarterly instalments 
commencing in 2008 and was due to be fully repaid in May 2012.
›  A loan for US$1.95m (£1.3m) was drawn down during 2009 with a variable interest rate based on UK LIBOR. It was repayable in quarterly

For the year ended 30 June 2009, the average effective borrowing rate was 7.4% (2008: 7.8%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. 
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. The carrying amount 
of the borrowings approximates their fair value.
All lease obligations are denominated in US Dollars. The fair value of the group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount. 
The group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

Due to the losses incurred during the current and prior years, the board has taken the prudent decision to fully provide against the deferred tax asset 
for losses carried forward, as they are not expected to be utilised within the foreseeable future. At 30 June 2009 the directors do not consider 
there is sufficient evidence to support recognition of this asset.
The value of the unrecognised deferred tax asset at 30 June 2009 is £6.4m (2008: £5.6m).

f inancial risk management objectives
The group’s financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables and trade payables 
that arise already from its operations. The purpose of the instruments is to raise finance for group activities. 
The group seeks to minimise the effects of financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge known exposures. The interest rates 
on bank loans are managed through the use of interest rate swaps and interest on the remaining financial liabilities are fixed. The use of financial 
derivatives is governed by the group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. 
The group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Market risk
The group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The group enters 
into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including:
›  forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of services by the UK trading subsidiary in US Dollars; and 
›  interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.
f oreign currency risk management 
The group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying amounts of the group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:
          2009 2008 
          £’000 £’000
Monetary assets

Yen          112 369
US Dollar          — 737
f oreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The group is mainly exposed to fluctuations in the US Dollar. 
The following table details the group’s sensitivity to a 10% decrease in Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate 
used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably 
possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and 
adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well 
as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender 
or the borrower (2008: 20%). The table below indicates the impact of a reduction in the US Dollar rate from $1.64, as at year end to $1.50.

f orward foreign exchange contracts
It is the policy of the group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts within 
50% to 75% of the exposure generated. The group also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated 
sales and purchase transactions out to six months within 50% to 75% of the exposure generated. The agreements undertaken cover the period 
up to December 2009, appropriate contracts will be put in place at the completion of the current agreements. Basic adjustments are made 
to the carrying amounts of non-financial hedged items when the anticipated sale or purchase transaction takes place.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at 30 June 2009:

These contracts have been valued at fair value, calculated as the difference between the Sterling value of the year-end calculated using mark to 
market off spot rate at close of business on 30 June 2009, and the rate contracted at maturity and included as financial instruments on balance 
sheet. The bank has an option to extend the 2008 foreign exchange contracts beyond initial contracted dates. The option was valued as a liability 
of £29,000 at 30 June 2009, within the value disclosed above, and has not yet been exercised post year. 
The contracts are net settled. 
interest rate risk management
The group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed 
by the group maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts to fix 
the interest rate on the floating rate loans. 
The group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note. 
interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated 
on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of higher interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate 
debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held. The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined 
by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below. 
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year. The current contracts were matched to the original 
payment profiles for the group debt, with the financial restructuring package that has taken place after the year end these are no longer matched. 
The directors will consider the impact of the mismatch in evaluating the interest rate strategy going forward.
The group has entered into interest rate swap agreements in respect of the bank loans. 
The company has two interest rate swap contracts. The first expires on 12 February 2011; the fair value of the interest rate swap on 30 June 2009 
was a liability of £146,000 (2008: £159,000). The second expires on 12 February 2012; the fair value of the contract as at 30 June 2009 
was a liability of £34,000 (2008: £9,000 asset). The contracts are net settled. 
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group. The group 
has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. The group only transacts with major high street banks. 
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on 
the financial condition of accounts receivable. The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty (the details 
are disclosed in note 16). 
Liquidity risk management
The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring 
forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

Note 20 describes that the majority of the group’s interest bearing debt is denominated in US Dollars. The above table presents the group’s 
liabilities at the year end exchange rate, which was $1.64 at 30 June 2009 (2008: $1.98). 
The above table is based upon the statutory presentation as indicated in note 20. As described in note 31, an agreement was reached post year end 
to restructure the group’s borrowing facilities and the amended presentation can be seen in notes 20 and 21.
With the exception of financial assets as disclosed in note 16, financial assets are current and are non interest bearing. 
Fair value of financial instruments
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
›  foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts;
›  interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves 
derived from quoted interest rates; and
›  the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost approximates to their fair value.

The group has one remaining share option scheme, which is a save as you earn scheme and is available to all employees of the group. 
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the company’s share on the date of grant. The average remaining 
vesting period for options which are not exercisable is 1.5 years. The options are exercisable in the year of vesting and are forfeited if the employee 
leaves the group before the options vest. 
The options issued under the former executive share option scheme all lapsed during the year ended 30 June 2009, because the business 
did not meet the required earnings targets.

Notes to the company financial statements
year ended 30 June 2009
1. Accounting policies – company
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. The particular accounting policies 
adopted, which have been applied consistently throughout the current and the prior financial year, are described below.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5. The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the financial review on pages 8 and 9. The key business risks faced are described in the directors’ report on pages 12 to 16. In addition note 25 
to the financial statements includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The directors have assessed the balance sheet and likely future cash flows of the company and group at the date of signing the audit report. 
This review considered detailed forecasts for the period to 30 June 2012. On this basis the directors have concluded that it is appropriate 
to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
As described in the chairman’s statement on page 3, the current environment is challenging. The group has recorded a pre-tax loss, however as 
noted in the chairman’s statement the group successfully negotiated a financial restructuring package in August 2009. The financial agreements 
comprise rescheduling all of the group’s existing debt over a six year period which includes up to two years of capital repayment holidays together 
with an additional overdraft facility of up to £1.4m.
As a condition of the agreement the group undertook a share placement that resulted in a total of £2.0m of funds before costs being raised 
in September 2009. This gives the group significant headroom above its forecast cash requirement, which will allow it to manage its business 
risks successfully despite the current uncertain outlook. 
The key sensitivity in the forecasts include the achievement of increased sales volumes and the forward US$ rate. The business is beginning 
to see an upturn in demand and the directors believe that this will be sustained. Sales prices are assumed to remain largely unchanged.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual 
report and financial statements.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention. 
investments
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are held as fixed assets and are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
Cash flow statement
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 (revised 1996), the company is not required to prepare a cash flow statement as a group cash flow 
statement has been included in the financial statements of the group. 
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less 
tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion 
of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not discounted.

At 30 June 2009, the company had ceased making capital repayments in line with the bank loan agreement that was in place at that date. 
Accordingly, the company was in technical breach of that agreements and all debt is presented as repayable immediately. The breach was 
not enforced by the related counterparties.
On 20 August 2009, the company reached an agreement with its lenders to restructure the capital repayment terms of bank loans, hire purchase 
and finance leases as set out in note 31 of the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, at the date of approval of the financial statements, 
the group is no longer in breach of the revised agreements.

7.   A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. 
If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) 
as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the Meeting.

most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s 
register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).

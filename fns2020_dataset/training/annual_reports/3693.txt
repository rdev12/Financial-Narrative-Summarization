Overview and strategic report 
Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to say we have moved on. Coats Group plc 
is a world class manufacturing business and has now  
returned to the market under its own name in the  
125th anniversary year of its initial listing on the  
London Stock Exchange. 
Further details regarding 
Coats Group plc corporate 
governance given from page 
21 of this report.
Mike Clasper
Chairman
We have moved away from the GPG 
investment company past, we now have 
one Board to lead the business and we are 
structuring our executive team to efficiently 
support the simplified corporate structure.
Within Coats, the Industrial business 
delivered good profit growth; however the 
results were impacted by Crafts, particularly 
in EMEA. Despite this Coats achieved a high 
conversion into free cash flow during the 
year. We have recently agreed the sale of 
the loss making EMEA Crafts business, 
leaving management free to focus on 
further growth opportunities in our strong 
and profitable global Industrial and 
Americas Crafts businesses.
The ongoing investigations by the UK 
Pensions Regulator mean we cannot pass 
on our success by way of returns to 
shareholders. However, we are not going to 
let the investigations stop us from creating 
further value for our shareholders and 
continuing to strengthen the business which 
underpins the Company’s obligations to its 
pension schemes.
Corporate and Board changes
On 26 February 2015 the Directors of GPG 
took the decision to rename the Company as 
Coats Group plc and establish a single, 
combined Board of Directors. This 
established Coats Group plc as the 
standalone, listed entity and signalled its 
return to the market in the 125th anniversary 
year of its first listing on the London Stock 
Exchange. It also marked the point at which 
the listed Company became a focused, 
global industrial manufacturing business and 
moved on from being an investment 
company with a diversified portfolio of 
assets.
The name change from Guinness Peat Group 
plc to Coats Group plc became effective on 
26 February 2015.
Rob Campbell, Scott Malcolm, (Chair of  
the Remuneration and Nominations 
Committee), and Waldemar Szlezak all 
stepped down from the Board, effective 
2 March 2015.
Rob, as former GPG Chairman, has brought 
continuity, experience and insight over this 
period of change. The Board would like to 
thank all retiring directors for their 
leadership during the successfully 
completed asset realisation programme, 
and for their support for the corporate 
changes.
Directors of the Coats plc Board were 
appointed to the Coats Group plc Board, 
effective Monday 2 March 2015. David 
Gosnell, who was recently appointed to the 
Coats plc Board, and Alan Rosling both 
became Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, while Paul Forman, Coats Group 
Chief Executive, Richard Howes, Chief 
Financial Officer, and Rajiv Sharma, Global 
CEO Industrial became Executive Directors. 
They join Mike Allen, Ruth Anderson,  
Sir Ron Brierley, Blake Nixon and me on the 
Coats Group plc Board. In line with best 
practice, it is the intention that from 2016 
onwards Directors of Coats Group plc will 
stand for re-election on an annual basis, 
and the Board will continue to assess its 
composition with respect to its size and mix 
to reflect the needs of a global 
manufacturing business with FTSE 250 
aspirations.
With the departure of Scott Malcolm, and 
in line with best practice, the Board has 
decided to separate the Remuneration and 
Nominations Committee. The Coats  
Group plc Remuneration Committee  
will be chaired by David Gosnell and its 
Nominations Committee will be chaired by 
me. Further information on Board 
committees is available in the corporate 
governance section of this report. 03 Annual Report 2014
Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Coats financial information
Further details regarding 
Coats’ performance in 2014 
given on page 8 in this report
Capital management and share schemes
In addition to the corporate changes, the 
Board is focused on having in place a 
suitable capital structure to support the 
business and its growth strategy. To that 
end Coats has successfully refinanced its 
main debt facility which features an 
extended maturity and a lower margin. The 
facility is backed by a group of international 
banks that reflects Coats’ global footprint 
(see Coats financial review on pages 16 to 
17 for more details).
Coats Group plc will look to grant share-
based long term incentives for senior 
executives, consistent with our FTSE 250 
aspirations. To support this programme we 
plan to fund an employee benefit trust to 
buy shares in the open market over time, 
and we are considering wider share 
ownership across the Group. The employee 
benefit trust is able to hold shares at any 
one time of up to 5% of the market 
capitalisation without seeking shareholder 
approval.
Although the Company is moving forward 
with the change in name, corporate 
structure and capital structure, in one 
aspect the Company is unable to move on. 
While the pension schemes are under 
investigation by the UK Pensions Regulator, 
we cannot pass on the success of the strong 
and cash generative Coats business by way 
of returns to shareholders. It is entirely 
appropriate that the Company fulfils all 
obligations to its pension schemes, and the 
Board and management continue to work 
to find a route forward balancing the 
interests of all stakeholders.
Reported consolidated financial results
Movements in shareholders’ funds
shareholders’ funds decreased from £444 
million (NZ$888 million) at 31 December 
2013 to £241 million (NZ$482 million) at  
31 December 2014. The major change was 
actuarial losses in respect of retirement 
benefit schemes (£201 million), which was 
only partially offset by Coats’ attributable 
profit (£13 million).
The net asset backing per share has, as a 
result, decreased from 31.5p (NZ63.0c) to 
17.2p (NZ34.4c).
Income statement
The Group generated revenues, all 
attributable to Coats, of £1,023 million 
(NZ$2,046 million) in 2014 (2013: £1,089 
million, NZ$2,178 million). Gross profit of 
£375 million (NZ$750 million) was relatively 
flat year-on-year (2013: £380 million, 
NZ$760 million). Operating profit increased 
from £41 million (NZ$82 million) to 
£64 million (NZ$128 million) in 2014, 
primarily driven by a significant reduction in 
Parent Group administrative expenses. Net 
attributable profit was £9 million compared 
to £23 million in 2013, which included a 
£46 million profit from discontinued 
operations. Earnings per share from 
continuing operations was 0.66p 
(2013: loss of 1.58p).
Overview of GPG’s key net assets
Coats
Net profit attributable to GPG was  
£13 million (US$21 million) compared with 
£19 million (US$29 million) in 2013. The 
decline was primarily driven by an  
£11 million (US$19 million) impairment 
charge on property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets relating to the EMEA 
Crafts business. Excluding this and other 
exceptional items, net attributable profit to 
GPG was £27 million (US$45 million), up  
£3 million from 2013 (£24 million,  
US$37 million). Coats generated a free cash 
inflow of £44 million (US$72 million) which 
contributed to a reduction in Coats net debt 
to £169 million (US$263 million) as of  
31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: 
£199 million (US$329 million)). Free cash 
flow is the foundation for investing in future 
growth and will provide the capacity to pay 
dividends in the future.
The agreed EMEA Crafts sale followed a 
comprehensive review of the business, 
including its strategic fit within Coats, and 
the formulation of a turnaround plan. The 
sale, expected to complete in Q2 2015, 
better positions Coats for future profitable 
growth and allows it to focus attention on 
its high performing global Industrial and 
strong Americas Crafts businesses. Further 
details of the transaction are included on 
page 17.
Cash at bank
At 31 December 2014 the Parent Group had 
cash of £375 million (NZ$750 million)  
(31 December 2013: £383 million (NZ$766 
million)). The decrease in cash during the 
year was primarily as a result of operating 
expenses and costs related to pensions 
investigations, which were partially offset by 
foreign exchange gains.
Pensions
The deficits in the Coats UK Pension Plan 
(‘Coats Plan’) and the Brunel and Staveley 
schemes, on an IAS19 financial reporting 
basis have increased from the position at  
31 December 2013. This is due to an 
increase in liabilities largely driven by a 
115 basis point (bps) decrease in the 
discount rate, which more than offset a 
35bps decrease in the inflation rate, the 
adoption of revised assumption setting 
methodologies and the Coats Plan trustee 
formally adopting improved cash 
commutation factors for members.
Coats has appointed John Lovell, previously 
Head of Pensions at J Sainsbury plc, as 
Group Pensions Director responsible for 
overseeing the Group’s pension schemes. 
This newly created position will be 
responsible for further developing the 
Group pension strategy and working closely 
with the trustees of the various schemes to 
ensure its delivery.
The UK Pensions Regulator’s 
investigations
The Board continues to actively engage with 
the UK Pensions Regulator’s (‘tPR’) 
investigations and will continue to explore 
all options to try to resolve these matters 
balancing the interests of all stakeholders.
Coats Plan
As previously announced on 19 December 
2014 the Company, GPG (UK) Holdings plc 
and Coats plc received a Warning Notice 
(‘WN’) from tPR in relation to the Coats 
Plan. 04 Annual Report 2014
Overview and strategic report 
Chairman’s statement continued
The WN explains that tPR’s case team is of 
the view that each of the three sponsoring 
employers of the Coats Plan was 
insufficiently resourced at the relevant date 
(31 December 2012), which is a prerequisite 
for it to use its statutory powers. Further, 
the case team considers it is reasonable for 
the Determinations Panel (‘DP’) of tPR to 
issue a Financial Support Direction (‘FSD’) in 
relation to the Coats Plan. This could result 
in the Company, GPG (UK) Holdings plc 
and/or Coats plc being required to put in 
place financial support for the Coats Plan.
Having reviewed the WN with its legal and 
other advisers, the Company will continue 
to robustly oppose tPR’s view on 
insufficiency of resources. The Company 
believes that the Coats Plan already benefits 
from strong support provided by the Coats 
business in accordance with the statutory 
scheme specific funding regime, and also 
does not accept that under the regulations 
it is proper for tPR to seek to use its 
statutory powers in relation to the Coats 
Plan. The Board intends to litigate this 
matter as far as necessary unless it can be 
resolved satisfactorily via negotiation.
Brunel and Staveley schemes
As previously disclosed, in December 2013 
GPG received WNs from tPR in respect of 
Brunel and Staveley. GPG submitted written 
representations on the WNs at the end of 
September 2014 within the deadlines set by 
tPR, but has yet to receive responses from 
tPR.
Timing and settlement discussions
Hearings before the DP for the Brunel and 
Staveley schemes would have been likely in 
2015. However, in the Coats WN, tPR has 
indicated that it believes that it would be 
appropriate for the DP to hear the Brunel 
and Staveley cases at the same time as the 
Coats case rather than considering one or 
two of the three schemes in isolation. 
Therefore, the timetable is likely to be driven 
by the status of the Coats Plan FSD 
proceedings and, as a result, any hearing 
before the DP for all three schemes is 
unlikely before the second half of 2016 at 
the earliest. The delay that will be caused by 
linking all three schemes is frustrating in the 
view of the Board.
In early 2015 a proposal, which reflected 
the Board’s view of the strong legal position 
in respect of the Coats Plan, was put to tPR 
and the various trustees to settle matters 
across the three schemes in order to resolve 
all investigations. This proposal was not 
accepted by tPR or the various scheme 
trustees. As noted above, the Board will 
litigate these matters as far as necessary, 
unless they can be resolved satisfactorily via 
negotiation.
Triennial funding valuations
The current level of deficit reduction 
payments for the Coats Plan of £14 million 
per annum that commenced in November 
2013 for a period of approximately 14 years 
will be subject to review at the next triennial 
valuation, which commences from  
1 April 2015.
The triennial valuation processes for both 
the Brunel and Staveley schemes are 
on-going and have been delayed by tPR’s 
investigations. The Company is engaged in 
discussions with the trustees of both 
schemes with a view to reaching agreement 
on the valuations in due course.
Parent group overheads
Total operating costs, net of foreign 
exchange gains/losses, were £7 million 
compared with £43 million in 2013. Foreign 
exchange gains in 2014 of £11 million (2013: 
£2 million loss) were partly driven by the 
strengthening US Dollar against the British 
Pound.
The Company continues to carefully 
manage its costs while focussing on 
achieving a successful completion of tPR’s 
investigations, taking external advice as 
necessary in order to protect the Company’s 
interests. Costs incurred in relation to tPR’s 
investigations during 2014 were covered by 
an £8 million provision made at the end of 
2013 for anticipated costs during 2014. A 
further £8 million provision has been made 
at the end of 2014 to respond to the 
Warning Notice received from tPR in 
relation to the Coats Plan and for 
progressing the process around the Staveley 
and Brunel schemes, for the Company and 
the trustees of these schemes.
As reported at the 2014 half year results, 
GPG completed the downsizing and 
outsourcing of support services on 30 June 
2014 with the closure of its London office. 
This followed a significant reduction in staff 
numbers during 2013. As a consequence 
staff costs significantly reduced year-on-
year to £2 million (2013: £13 million). Other 
Company expenses, which included staff 
costs as well as GPG Board expenses, legal, 
audit and other non-pensions related 
professional fees, declined from £21 million 
to £6 million in 2014. Other pensions 
related expenses, including pension scheme 
administrative costs under IAS19, totalled 
£4 million.
Excluding pension investigations costs, the 
Company maintains its guidance of annual 
overheads of approximately £3-4 million for 
pension related expenses. Given the 
corporate structure changes announced, 
the Company expects other corporate 
expenses to reduce to around £3 million  
per annum (previous guidance was  
£3-4 million).

Overview and strategic report 
GPG
Strategy and business model
In February 2011 the GPG Board announced 
a plan for an orderly value realisation of 
the Group’s investment portfolio with the 
proceeds being used for capital 
management initiatives. At the time it was 
indicated that this may result in an 
investment in GPG becoming a direct 
investment in Coats.
The asset realisation programme was 
successfully completed during 2013 and 
generated a cumulative £698 million from  
1 January 2011. Between 2011 and 2013 
more than £160 million of proceeds were 
returned to shareholders via capital returns, 
cash dividends and share buybacks. 
However completion of the capital return 
process has been delayed by tPR’s 
investigations. The Chairman’s statement 
contains a full update on this process and 
the costs incurred to date in dealing with 
these matters.
During the year under review, and prior to 
renaming Guinness Peat Group plc as Coats 
Group plc, the Group was managed with 
two clear operational levels:
— GPG plc Board had overall responsibility 
to shareholders for stewardship of the 
Company; including central treasury, 
tPR’s investigations and capital 
management and structuring; and
— Coats plc Board had responsibility for 
setting the detailed strategy of the 
Coats business and monitoring 
performance against that strategy. 
Detail relating to Coats’ strategy, 
business model and performance in 
2014 can be found from page 8 
onwards.
In February 2015 the Directors took the 
decision to rename Guinness Peat Group plc 
as Coats Group plc and established a single, 
combined Board of Directors. The 
responsibilities of the Coats Group plc 
Board can be found on pages 26 to 27.
The Group is primarily comprised of the 
Coats business, as well as a Parent Group 
cash balance of £375 million (at 
31 December 2014) and two legacy UK 
defined benefit pension schemes (Brunel 
and Staveley).
Although the Company has moved forward 
with the change in name, corporate 
structure and capital structure, in one 
aspect the Company is unable to move on. 
While the pension schemes are under 
investigation by tPR, it cannot pass on the 
success of the strong and cash generative 
Coats business by way of returns to 
shareholders. It is entirely appropriate that 
the Group fulfils all obligations to its 
pension schemes, and the Board and 
management continue to work to find a 
route forward balancing the interests of all 
stakeholders.
Operational performance
The financial performance of the Group as a 
whole is dealt with by the Chairman in his 
statement. Further details of Coats’ 
operational performance can be found from 
pages 10 to 17.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
A KPI for GPG was its reported net asset 
value. The reported net asset value per 
share in 2014 decreased from 31.5p to 
17.2p. A significant factor in the 
determination of net assets per share is the 
IAS 19 employee benefit obligations. These 
are based on market conditions at each 
period end including the yield on corporate 
bonds.
The Board previously monitored the value 
realisation programme against the value of 
the portfolio at the time the strategy was 
announced. As noted above, the 
programme was successfully completed 
during 2013 and generated a cumulative 
£698 million from 1 January 2011. This 
compares to a market value on 1 January 
2011 of the investment portfolio of 
£677 million. Given the programme was 
completed in 2013 the Board decided that 
this KPI was no longer relevant for the year 
under review.
As stated above a key element of the value 
realisation strategy is returning capital to 
shareholders. Given the events during 2013 
and 2014 relating to tPR’s investigations, 
this indicator does not fully convey the 
developments of GPG during the year under 
review.
The primary financial measures against 
which Coats was monitored in the year 
under review were turnover, pre-exceptional 
operating profit, pre-exceptional 
attributable profit and adjusted free cash 
flow. During 2014, Coats reported a decline 
in turnover of 1% (up 1% on a constant 
currency basis), pre-exceptional operating 
profit declined by 1% (flat on a constant 
currency basis), pre-exceptional attributable 
profit grew 21% to $45 million and 
adjusted free cash flow increased 30% to 
$70 million.
With the change in name to Coats Group 
plc, and the transition from an investment 
company with a diversified portfolio of 
assets to a focused, global manufacturing 
business, the KPIs for the Company will be 
reviewed by the Board during the year and 
presented in the 2015 Annual Report.
Linking performance and reward
The Board through the Remuneration and 
Nominations Committee has developed a 
Remuneration Policy which provides an 
appropriate framework of incentives for the 
Executive Directors of the Company. This 
Policy is set out from page 32.
Prospects
See Chairman’s statement on pages 2 to 4 
and Chief Executive’s review on pages 10 
and 11.
Corporate Responsibility (CR)
The CR focus for the year under review lay 
within Coats. Further information regarding 
Coats’ CR approach, including how it links 
to business strategy, can be found on page 
13 and includes our approach to 
environmental matters, employees and 
social, community and human rights issues. 
Detail is provided on greenhouse gas 
emissions on page 25.
Diversity
In line with the requirements of the Code 
and of the ASX Governance Principles, it is 
the Company’s practice to treat all 
appointments equally and on merit, 
regardless of ethnicity or gender. The Board 
does not have a formal policy on diversity. 
That said, the Company has been 
developing a policy which is intended to be 
approved by the Board in the coming year. 
Coats already employs a diverse workforce 
and has a stated ambition to increase the 
number of women at more senior levels. 
See page 12 for more information in this 
area. 06 Annual Report 2014
Overview and strategic report 
GPG continued
Details of the make-up of the Group’s employees by gender as at 31 December 2014 are set out in the following table.
Male Female Total Female %
Board of Directors 7 1 8 13%
Senior Management (excluding Board Directors) 292 71 363 20%
All employees (excluding onsite contract workers) 11,939 8,314 20,253 41%
In accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006, Senior Managers are employees with responsibility for planning, directing or controlling 
the activities of the Company, or a strategically significant part of the company, and persons who were directors of subsidiaries of the 
Company.
Within the Coats business, 41% of its global workforce and 20% of its senior management excluding Board Directors were female as of  
31 December 2014.
As of 31 December 2014 there were 20,253 employees within the Group. Coats carries out an annual Engagement survey amongst its 
employees and has a policy of responding to the feedback this generates.
Principal risks
It is the responsibility of the Board and its various committees to identify and understand the key risks faced by the business and to 
ensure mitigating action is taken to control them. Those risks are:
Risk Nature of risk Action/mitigation
Employee defined benefit 
obligations – accounting 
impact and regular funding
The Group has a number of employee 
defined benefit arrangements in place, the 
most significant being:
> three UK pension schemes: Coats, Brunel 
and Staveley; and
> the Coats North America plan.
The UK schemes can impact the Group 
on various levels. Given their size, and 
particularly that of the Coats Pension Plan, 
these schemes can have a material impact 
on the Group’s reported results. Under IAS19 
the Consolidated Income Statement includes 
an administrative charge and a finance cost 
relating to these schemes and variations in 
these charges can give rise to fluctuations in 
reported earnings. In addition, changes in the 
IAS19 accounting surpluses and deficits in 
the schemes impact the level of shareholders’ 
funds.
When funding deficits arise this can have a 
cash flow impact. The net accounting and 
funding positions of these arrangements are 
particularly sensitive to real discount rates 
and the investment performance of any 
segregated assets.
Managing the funding position of the three UK pension 
schemes is the primary responsibility of their respective 
trustees. The strategy followed by each trustee targets the 
long term funding position of its scheme. Each has used 
corporate bonds to fund short term liabilities. Equities and 
other return-seeking assets are held for the longer term. 
These provide a natural hedge respectively for short term 
obligations and long term inflation risk. Coats has in place 
a short term inflation hedging programme. In addition, the 
trustees have implemented formal de-risking strategies with 
thresholds for switching return-seeking assets into bonds.
The 2012 funding valuation for the Coats UK Pension Plan 
was completed during 2013 and a scheme deficit of £215 
million was agreed. As of November 2013 a 14 year recovery 
plan commenced and the rate of contributions increased 
from that date from £7 million per annum to  
£14 million per annum. In addition Coats plc agreed to 
provide the scheme with a parent company guarantee.
The Brunel scheme is in the process of completing its 2013 
triennial valuation. There was no deficit in 2010 and, hence, 
there is currently no recovery plan. However, the Board 
expects a deficit and a recovery plan to result from the 
current exercise.
The Staveley scheme last had a triennial valuation as at  
5 April 2011. The 2011 valuation resulted in a one-off 
payment of £5 million being made to the scheme in July 2012 
and an eight-year recovery plan at an annualised rate of 
£1.3 million.
The triennial valuation processes for both the Brunel and 
Staveley schemes are on-going and have been delayed by 
tPR’s investigations. The Company is engaged in discussions 
with the trustees of both schemes with a view to reaching 
agreement on the valuations in due course.
The Coats North America plan has a funding surplus and 
the investment strategy followed includes a matching asset 
pool which should substantially reduce the risk of a funding 
shortfall arising in the future. 07 Annual Report 2014

Risk Nature of risk Action/mitigation
Employee defined benefit 
obligations – regulatory 
investigation
As previously reported and described further 
in the Chairman’s statement on pages 3 to 
4, tPR is investigating the Group’s three UK 
defined benefit pension schemes and has 
issued Warning Notices in relation to all three 
schemes.
The Board continues to actively engage with tPR’s 
investigations and will continue to explore all options to 
try to resolve these matters balancing the interests of all 
stakeholders.
Treasury concentration risk The completion of the asset realisation 
programme combined with the deferral of the 
return of capital to shareholders during tPR’s 
investigations has resulted in a significant 
proportion of shareholder value being 
represented by cash.
The Board is cognisant of the potential for this to give rise 
to concentration risk. The Board is provided on a monthly 
basis with a report of cash balances by bank, jurisdiction and 
currency. In addition it regularly reviews these risks at Board 
meetings to ensure appropriate mitigating action is being 
taken.
Foreign currency exposure Coats business’ activities are primarily 
denominated in USD, although it has major 
asset bases in other currencies, including the 
Indian Rupee and the Brazilian Real.
Coats takes action to protect its anticipated 
transactional currency exposure but does not 
hedge its assets and liabilities.
Cash generated through the asset realisation 
programme is primarily held in GBP, USD and 
NZD. The GBP balance is held to cover known 
liabilities whereas the NZD and USD balances 
represent the currently surplus funds.
Given the investigation being carried out by 
tPR, the Board faces the potential of some 
as yet unquantified obligations to provide 
further financial support to the Group’s UK 
pension schemes. The size and nature of 
these obligations will only be known once 
the process with the respective scheme 
trustees and tPR has been completed. Any 
hearing before the Determination Panel of 
tPR for all three schemes is unlikely before the 
second half of 2016 at the earliest. If all rights 
of appeal are pursued, this process would 
extend beyond this period.
This in turn means the Board is currently not 
able to determine with certainty the quantum 
of future returns, if any, to shareholders.
The Board regularly reviews its currency exposures and has 
taken steps to ensure transparent reporting to shareholders 
of the positions held.
Human resources Shareholder value is heavily dependent on key 
individuals within the Group.
The Board has recognised the risk to delivery of the 
Company’s strategy from key staff leaving during the process. 
It regularly reviews the appropriateness of its incentive and 
reward arrangements and has established retention and/or 
incentive plans to address this risk.
Coats Given the simplification of the Company’s 
business model, the Coats business now 
represents the major portion of the Group’s 
business risk.
Coats faces a wide range of commercial and operational 
risks. Coats manages these risks through various structures, 
including its Internal Audit Function and Operational Risk 
Management Committee, comprising a broad mix of 
managers across the business, chaired by the Group Chief 
Executive.
The Head of Internal Audit attends meetings of and reports 
to the Board’s Audit and Risk Committee. The key risk areas 
identified and managed through this process are described in 
more detail on pages 18–20. 08 Annual Report 2014

Overview
In 2014 Coats’ reported revenues marginally 
declined to $1,685.9 million from $1,703.7 
million in 2013. On a like-for-like basis 
Coats’ revenues grew 1% during 2014, with 
5% growth in Industrial sales and a 9% 
decline in Crafts. The decline in demand for 
fashion handknitting products in both 
North America and EMEA impacted 
performance in Crafts, suppressing growth 
in group sales. The decline on a reported 
basis reflected the translation impact of a 
strengthening US Dollar against currencies 
such as the Brazilian Real and the Indian 
Rupee.
Coats’ pre-exceptional operating profit 
declined 1% year-on-year on a reported 
basis and remained stable on a like-for-like 
basis at $130.9 million. Industrial delivered a 
like-for-like 18% improvement, driven by 
increased sales, while inflationary cost rises 
continued to be offset with procurement 
and productivity improvements coupled 
with pricing initiatives. Crafts was primarily 
impacted by a decline in sales, as well as by 
one-off costs. However performance in the 
second half improved in line with guidance 
issued in the 2014 half year results. 
Operating profit included approximately  
$8 million of reorganisation related costs 
that have not been classified as exceptional.
Industrial
Industrial sales in 2014 were $1,243.1 
million, up 5% year-on-year, continuing the 
positive momentum from 2013. Revenue 
growth was balanced across the regions 
with double digit growth in the key markets 
of Turkey, the USA and Vietnam. Speciality 
sales grew 14% year-on-year, and by 18% 
in the second half of 2014, with strong 
demand from the protective clothing 
markets in EMEA and North America and 
the outdoor and sporting goods markets in 
Asia. Operating profit growth of 18% 
year-on-year was delivered through volume 
growth, with productivity and purchasing 
improvements, coupled with pricing 
initiatives, successfully offsetting cost 
inflation.
Crafts
Crafts’ sales of $442.8 million represented a 
9% year-on-year decline. The reduction in 
both the Americas and EMEA was primarily 
due to lower demand for fashion 
handknitting products. Excluding this 
anticipated decline, North American Crafts 
sales grew 3% year-on-year. Sales in EMEA 
were also impacted by a decline in the 
Needlecrafts category and a change in 
Coats’ Scandinavian operating model. As a 
result of improved sales performance in the 
Americas and cost reduction initiatives the

business returned to profitability in the 
second half of 2014, thereby delivering a 
$2.8 million operating profit for the year.
Sale of EMEA Crafts
As announced on 19 February 2015 Coats 
has agreed to sell the EMEA Crafts business 
to the Aurelius Group. The sale follows a 
comprehensive review of the business, 
including its strategic fit within Coats, and 
the formulation of a turnaround plan. The 
sale better positions Coats for future 
profitable growth and allows it to focus 
attention on its high performing global 
Industrial and strong Americas Crafts 
businesses. The sale is subject to a limited 
number of conditions usual for this type of 
transaction and is expected to complete in 
Q2 2015. Further details of the transaction 
are included on page 17.
Financial summary
Net profit attributable to equity 
shareholders increased 21% to $45.1 
million, on a reported pre-exceptional basis, 
compared to 2013 ($37.3 million). This was 
primarily due to lower pension finance 
costs, reduced finance costs resulting from 
lower year-on-year net debt and average 
interest rates, and a lower tax charge. 
Pensions finance costs will be significantly 
higher in 2015 due to the increase in the 
pensions deficit of the Coats Plan during 
2014. Including exceptional items and their 
associated tax effect, including an $18.8 
million impairment charge of property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets 
relating to the EMEA Crafts business, Coats 
generated a reported attributable profit of 
$21.2 million (2013: $29.2 million). No 
exceptional reorganisation charges were 
incurred in 2014. Operating profit included 
approximately $8 million of reorganisation 
related costs that have not been classified 
as exceptional.
In 2014 Coats generated adjusted free cash 
flow
a
 of $70.1 million, a 30% increase on 
2013 ($54.1 million). The year-on-year 
improvement was driven by improved 
working capital management, lower interest 
and tax payments. Reflecting strong cash 
generation, year-end net debt fell to  
$262.6 million (2013: $329.2 million) and 
Coats’ leverage ratio
b
 of net debt to EBITDA 
fell to 1.4 times (2013: 1.8 times).
Return on capital employed
c
 increased to 
26% (2013: 22%), primarily driven by the 
reduction in net working capital.
Prospects
A mixed regional picture in consumer 
demand for Coats’ products is expected to 
continue in 2015. While Coats anticipates a 
broadly positive outlook in Asia and solid 
growth in North America, the situation in 
Europe is likely to be affected by underlying 
macroeconomic developments and Latin 
America is expected to remain relatively flat. 
In a general deflationary environment it will 
become increasingly challenging to use 
pricing improvements to offset payroll and 
other inflationary pressures which Coats 
faces in the many countries in which it 
operates.
In the core Apparel and Footwear business 
there will be an increased focus on 
customer engagement and order 
management using digital channels, while 
in the Speciality business continued growth 
is expected to be achieved through 
geographic expansion and new product 
innovation in areas such as aramids and 
composites. Year-on-year performance in 
the Americas Crafts business is expected to 
remain relatively stable, as ongoing growth 
in core handknitting sales will be offset by 
reduced demand for fashion handknitting 
products.
The mixed consumer demand outlook, 
ongoing inflationary challenges and a 
continued strengthening of the US dollar 
will have a negative impact on operating 
profits in 2015. This will be somewhat 
mitigated by the treatment of losses 
attributable to EMEA Crafts as discontinued 
items, leading to a broadly stable operating 
profit for the year, with profitability 
weighted towards the second half. 
Attributable profit will be reduced by an 
increase in pensions finance costs, which 
should be offset by a continuing reduction 
in the effective tax rate and interest 
charges.
Conclusion
The underlying results for the year 
demonstrate a strengthening of the core 
Apparel and Footwear business, double 
digit sales growth within Speciality and a 
strong and profitable Americas Crafts 
business. This enabled Coats to deliver 
growth in pre-exceptional attributable profit 
and to generate significant free cash flow, 
which provides a strong base for organic 
and inorganic growth.

Overview and strategic report 
People
Coats’ employees are the core of our business. 
Their leadership, talent and commitment ensure 
we remain leaders in our sector, are competitive 
in the marketplace and operate our businesses 
effectively and efficiently.
A healthy working environment
Our number one priority is to keep our 
employees safe and our health, safety and 
welfare programmes continue to keep our 
accident statistics low. In 2014, our global 
accident rate was 0.33 reportable incidents 
per 100 full time employees (compared to 
0.37 in 2013, 0.44 in 2012, and 0.60 in 
2011). This is well below the latest OSHA
a
 
average of 3.1 for US textile mills and below 
the UK average of 0.43 for the manufacture 
of textiles, as reported for 2013/14 by the 
UK HSE
b
. However, there is always more we 
can do and we aspire to reduce our accident 
levels still further in the coming years.
Employee engagement
In order to achieve our business goals, we 
rely on our employees being engaged and 
driving our business forward. To make sure 
we are on the right track, we benchmark 
our workplace culture on an annual basis 
through our employee engagement survey. 
This tells us how people feel about working 
at Coats and helps us identify areas that 
need attention. With a high participation 
rate of 94% in the 2014 survey, we were 
pleased to see that our employee 
engagement score has increased to 81% 
(one percentage point higher than last year 
and four higher than 2012). This positions 
Coats in the top 10% of all global surveyed 
companies (as benchmarked by a leading 
specialist survey organisation).
Leadership and talent development
It is important to Coats that we harness and 
nurture the best talent among our 
workforce and provide them with the skills 
and opportunities to succeed. Through 
competitive packages we recruit and retain 
high calibre individuals. We invest in our 
people by providing equal opportunities for 
learning, through general training and 
job-skills programmes and, where 
appropriate, tailored career planning and 
leadership development.
During 2014, we reviewed our global 
approaches to leadership, talent 
development and succession planning and 
made great progress.
 > We have reviewed our senior 
management positions, and by the end of 
2015 will have developed comprehensive 
succession plans for all senior posts.
 > Our Management Capability 
Development Programme (MCD) was 
awarded a Brandon Hall Bronze Award 
for Best Blended Program in 2014. This is 
a tailored learning programme aimed at 
strengthening leadership skills throughout 
the business. During 2014, more than 
300 people across 10 countries 
participated in the MCD programme, and 
99% said that ‘it makes them a better 
leader’. A further 240 will enrol during 
2015.
 > Our ‘CEO Circle’ initiative saw its first 
group of nine high potentials complete 
the programme. A second group has now 
started its journey. This is a two-year 
programme led by the Group CEO and 
designed to accelerate the development 
of leadership capabilities in a select group 
of high potential managers within Coats.
A diverse workforce
We believe in equal opportunities and pride 
ourselves on the diversity of our workforce. 
At the end of 2014, we had 77 nationalities 
amongst our employees and 24 are 
represented in our global leadership team. 
Gender diversity at Coats Senior management 
(excl. Board Directors)
Women
Men
Women
Men
Although our average gender split is good, 
with women representing over 40% of our 
global workforce, only 20% of our senior 
management (excluding Board Directors) 
are women. We recognise there is more to 
do and during the year we developed plans 
for a new diversity and inclusion initiative 
which was launched in January 2015. 
Through a range of associated activities, we 
aim to increase the diversity of our 
workforce at all levels, and specifically 
address the number of women in leadership 
positions.
Human rights and employment 
standards
Whilst the Company does not have a 
specific human rights policy, our worldwide 
employment standards (available on 
www.coats.com) set out the principles 
which are observed across our global 
operations. These standards state our 
approach to human rights and recognise 
the requirements of the UN Declaration of 
Human Rights and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, the core ILO 
Conventions, and the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises.

Corporate Responsibility
Responsible behaviour is the thread that holds 
us all together. Our Corporate Responsibility (CR) 
programme is integrated with our business strategy 
and helps us build and maintain both our reputation 
and our relationships with key stakeholders.
The values and standards that we subscribe 
to as a company are at the core of our CR 
programme. They are embodied in the five 
principles that describe the way we work: 
openness and honesty, energy for change, 
freedom to operate, customer-led 
innovation and keeping our promises.
Defining our programme
Our CR materiality assessment underpins 
the CR programme. The assessment, which 
is available on our website, quantified 
what’s important to Coats and our 
stakeholders and identifies issues that 
support our business goals: profitable sales 
growth, increased productivity and positive 
teamwork.
The key issues we identified were grouped 
under seven themes as illustrated in the 
graphic on the right. Although we discuss 
just two of these themes here, all seven 
themes are equally important to us and the 
progress we are making across each of 
these areas is described on our website.
To further embed our CR programme, we 
created a global network of CR champions 
this year. Their main role will be to share 
information on CR initiatives, act as a point 
of contact for their area of the business and 
help disseminate best practice.
Manufacturing processes and 
environmental impact
We constantly review our manufacturing 
processes to remain as efficient as possible, 
to minimise both the cost to our business 
and the impact we have on the world 
around us. Since 2000, we have focused on 
reducing our energy consumption and have 
seen a dramatic reduction in our carbon 
footprint. In 2014, greenhouse gas 
emissions were 5.1 kg CO
2
e per kg of dyed 
product (compared to 5.3 in 2013, 5.6 in 
2012 and 5.7 in 2011) and we have seen a 
5% reduction in our overall carbon 
footprint.
Engaging with our communities
Developing a clear and active approach to 
community engagement helps us build 
stronger relationships with local 
communities, governments and business 
partners. It also increases our ability to 
attract and retain high quality, committed 
employees.
2014 saw the global launch of our 
community engagement programme. The 
two key themes of Education and Textiles 
provide a focus for our activities and reflect 
the interests of our employees, our business 
and the products and services we offer. 
Our entire senior team was involved in the 
launch and as a result, during 2014 we 
implemented around 100 separate 
community engagement plans in 47 
business units across 38 different countries. 
Although the types of activity vary greatly 
across the globe, the enthusiasm that our 
employees have shown for this initiative has 
been universal.

our approach to CR and our 
seven strategic themes,

Operating review
an improved performance following 
softness in demand from some US brands 
during the first half of 2014.
EMEA
Sales in EMEA increased 6% with year-on-
year growth across most key markets and a 
strong performance from both Speciality 
and Zips. The Speciality category benefited 
from strong demand in the bedding market 
during the second half and the protective 
clothing market throughout 2014.
Category
Apparel and Footwear
Revenues in the Apparel and Footwear 
category grew 3% year-on-year from a 
combination of market share gains and 
underlying market growth, although 
growth during the second half slowed due 
to strong comparators.
Speciality
In the Speciality category, 14% year-on-year 
growth (18% in the second half) was 
achieved through geographic expansion 
and new product innovation and sales. For 
example, sales to engineered performance

Flamepro product range, an aramid thread 
used in personal protective equipment,

sales of aramid composite products, that 
enable the replacement of steel natural gas 
pipes with reinforced thermoplastic pipes, 
were up $3 million.
Sales in 2014
$1,243.1m
Industrial overview
Industrial sales rose 5% year-on-year due 
primarily to significant revenue growth in 
Speciality (14%) and steady growth in the 
core Apparel and Footwear category. This 
resulted in both categories growing by 
approximately the same amount in absolute 
terms. Double digit sales growth was 
delivered in key markets such as Turkey, 
USA and Vietnam due to market share gains 
and underlying market growth.
Industrial operating profit increased by 18% 
to $128.1 million (2013: $108.9 million), 
with volume growth, productivity, 
procurement and pricing initiatives more 
than offsetting payroll and energy inflation. 
As a result operating margins increased by 
110bps to 10.3% (2013: 9.2%).
Region
Asia and Australasia
Asia and Australasia sales increased by 4% 
year-on-year with growth across the region. 
A key growth driver was apparel and 
footwear sales in both Vietnam and India, 
although a marginal slowdown in these key 
markets led to reduced regional growth in 
the second half. Speciality made good 
progress, with the outdoor and sporting 
goods markets in particular contributing to 
sales growth.
Americas
A strong second half performance enabled 
the Americas region to generate a 5% 
year-on-year increase in revenues. In H2 
2014 growth of 7% was primarily driven by 
North American Speciality sales, particularly 
within the protective clothing and wire and 
cable markets, which also showed good 
growth in the first half. In addition the 
Apparel and Footwear category delivered

Crafts overview
Crafts sales declined 9% year-on-year, 
primarily due to the impact of lower 
demand for fashion handknitting products 
in North America and EMEA and the 
change in operating model in Scandinavia in 
2013.
Due to the overall weaker sales 
performance, and change in operating 
model in Scandinavia, Crafts made an 
operating profit of $2.8 million in 2014, 
compared to $22.0 million in 2013. This 
resulted in a decline in operating margin to 
0.6% from 4.5% in 2013. However, and in 
line with prior guidance, the Crafts business 
returned to profitability in the second half 
due to improved sales performance in the 
Americas and cost reduction initiatives. This 
enabled the Americas business to deliver a 
reasonable operating profit for the year.

2. EMEA  $147.1m
Region
Americas
In the Americas, revenue fell 5% year-on-
year, primarily due to a decline in fashion 
handknitting sales, including Red Heart’s 
Sashay fashion handknitting product range, 
following a peak in demand in 2013. 
Excluding fashion handknitting sales, North 
American Crafts grew sales by 3%. In the 
smaller Latin America business, growth in 
Handknittings in the first half of 2014 
continued into the second half, despite 
challenging market conditions. Overall 
Americas Crafts remains a strong business 
that generates good margins based on its 
market leading position.
EMEA
Revenue in EMEA, down 15%, was 
significantly impacted by the decline in 
fashion handknitting sales. The full year 
decline also reflected falling sales in the 
Needlecrafts category and the move from a 
retail sales model to distribution model in 
Scandinavia, which impacted sales by 
approximately $11 million, equating to a 6% 
decline in EMEA revenues.
Category
The 6% decline in Needlecraft sales reflects 
the long term decline in that market.  
The 11% fall in Handknitting sales was 
impacted by the previously mentioned 
change in fashion trends following a peak in 
demand in 2013, although the core 
handknitting business grew globally.

Financial review
Exceptional items
Net exceptional costs before taxation 
totalled $23.8 million (2013: $8.5 million). 
This included an $18.8 million impairment 
of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets related to EMEA Crafts.
In addition there was a $3.7 million charge 
relating to costs incurred by the trustee of 
the Coats Plan in 2014 in responding to 
tPR’s investigation into the scheme, and a 
provision made for the trustee’s expected 
costs to respond to the Warning Notice 
received from tPR. There was a $2.9 million 
gain on the disposal of properties, related 
to activities in 2014 and prior years, and 
$4.2 million of other exceptional costs 
related to the capital incentive plan. This 
plan is intended to reward the Coats’ senior 
executive team for delivering growth in the 
value of the Company’s investment; the 
amount incurred in 2015 is expected to 
reduce.
No exceptional reorganisation charges were 
incurred in 2014 (2013: $21.6 million). 
Operating profit includes approximately  
$8 million of reorganisation related costs 
that have not been classified as exceptional.
Non-operating results
The share of profit from joint ventures was 
$1.5 million (2013: $0.7 million).
Excluding IAS19 pensions interest, finance 
costs reduced by 7% to $27.4 million (2013: 
$29.4 million) as a result of lower year-on-
year net debt and a reduction in the margin 
over LIBOR on borrowings as a consequence 
of lower leverage.
The taxation charge for 2014 was $45.6 
million (2013: $51.0 million) resulting in a 
reported tax rate of 60%. Excluding all 
exceptional items and the impact of IAS19 
finance charges, the underlying effective 
rate on pre-tax profits reduced by 500bps 
to 42% (2013: 47%). The reduction was 
primarily driven by a change in mix as 
regions with lower statutory tax rates 
contributed higher profits and a reduction 
in unrelieved losses in the year.
Profits attributable to minority interests 
were $9.6 million in 2014 (2013: $7.8 
million).
Net profit attributable to equity 
shareholders, on a pre-exceptional basis, 
was $45.1 million, a 21% year-on-year 
improvement (2013: $37.3 million). 
Including exceptional items and their 
associated tax effect, Coats generated a 
reported attributable profit of $21.2 million 
(2013: $29.2 million).
Richard Howes
Chief Financial Officer
Investment
During 2014 investment continued to be 
made to support business growth and to 
further improve Coats’ operational 
performance. Investment in new plant and 
systems amounted to $47.4 million (2013: 
$37.8 million).
The year-on-year increase was driven by 
investment in IT, digital services and 
efficiency initiatives, such as the 
construction and commissioning of a bio 
mass plant for steam generation at an 
Indian factory. Capital expenditure was  
1.0 times depreciation (including computer 
software amortisation) for 2014 (2013:  
0.8 times).
Cash flow
Adjusted free cash flow of $70.1 million  
was up 30% on 2013 ($54.1 million).  
This excludes reorganisation spend of $3.7 
million related to expenses incurred in 2013 
(2013: $27.7 million), a $1.8 million tax 
inflow (repayment) related to a US antitrust 
litigation (2013: $8.2 million non-tax related 
outflow) and proceeds from property 
disposals, including tax, of $3.6 million 
(2013: $26.6 million). Free cash flow was 
$71.8 million (2013: $44.8 million).
EBITDA (defined as pre-exceptional 
operating profit before depreciation and 
amortisation) was $179.4 million (2013: 
$181.6 million).
Net working capital as a percentage of sales 
fell year-on-year to 11.5% (2013: 15.1%) 
resulting in a cash inflow of $41.1 million. 
This improvement was driven by a 
continued focus on all aspects of working 
capital, with improvements made in 
Industrial inventory and debtor 
management, as well as reduced Crafts 
sales.

17 Annual Report 2014
Coats financial information Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
Interest paid decreased to $21.9 million (2013: $26.2 million), as a 
result of lower year-on-year net debt and lower interest rates 
achieved on borrowings.
Taxation paid was $56.0 million, compared to $53.3 million in 
2013. Excluding the tax impact of exceptional items, taxation paid 
in 2014 declined by $2.5 million in 2014 to $53.3 million (2013: 
$55.8 million).
Pension payments increased to $37.7 million in 2014 (2013: $25.6 
million) due to higher recovery plan contributions to the UK funded 
scheme, in line with the recovery plan agreed with the Coats Plan 
trustee in 2013.
Balance sheet
Due to the strong cash flow performance net debt reduced to 
$262.6 million (2013: $329.2 million).
An important metric for the Coats Group is the leverage ratio of 
net debt to EBITDA. Under the definitions of net debt and EBITDA 
prescribed in Coats’ senior debt facility, net debt at 31 December 
2014 was 1.4 times EBITDA of the preceding twelve months 
(31 December 2013: 1.8 times). Coats is comfortably within the 
covenant limit of 3.0 times.
Equity shareholders’ funds decreased from $226.2 million at 31 
December 2013 to a deficit of $11.5 million at 31 December 2014. 
This primarily reflects actuarial losses in respect of retirement 
benefit schemes of $246.1 million, which more than offset 
attributable profit of $21.2 million.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The net obligation for the Coats Group’s retirement and other post-
employment defined benefit liabilities was $409.6 million as at 
31 December 2014, up from $202.6 million at the end of 2013.
Coats Plan
As at 31 December 2014, the deficit on an IAS19 accounting basis 
in the Coats Plan, which represents the Group’s most significant 
funded defined benefit arrangement, increased from $129.2 million 
at the end of 2013 to $333.6 million. The movement was due to an 
increase in liabilities, which was primarily driven by a 115bps 
decrease in discount rate, which more than offset a 35bps decrease 
in the inflation rate. In addition the adoption of revised assumption 
setting methodologies and the trustee formally adopting improved 
cash commutation factors for members had a negative impact of 
approximately $41 million on the deficit. Deficit reduction 
contributions to the Coats Plan during the year were $23.1 million, 
which is in line with the 14 year recovery plan agreed with the 
Coats Plan trustee in 2013 as part of the 2012 triennial valuation.
Other pension and post-employment arrangements
The recognised surplus for the US funded defined benefit scheme 
increased to $54.8 million as at 31 December 2014 (31 December 
2013: $47.1 million), while the overall net deficit on other plans was 
$130.8 million (31 December 2013: $120.5 million).
Refinanced debt facility
In February 2015 Coats successfully replaced its $760 million 
syndicated bank facility with a new $680 million, five year revolving 
facility. The new facility, which matures in February 2020, was 
oversubscribed and is syndicated among a changed group of 
international banks, which better reflects Coats’ global footprint.  
It features a lower margin, approximately 25bps, compared with 
the previous facility and indicative pricing for 2015 is LIBOR plus 
150bps. The size of the new facility reflects Coats’ ability to 
generate free cash. There is no change to the financial 
covenants, namely, net debt will not exceed three times EBITDA 
and EBITDA will not be lower than four times net finance 
charges.

Sale of EMEA Crafts
Coats announced an agreement to sell its EMEA Crafts business 
to the Aurelius Group on 19 February 2015 for a total 
consideration of US$10.0 million, payable in cash on completion 
and subject to customary adjustments. As part of the sale an 
amount of cash will be retained within the business being sold, 
which is expected to result in the transaction being marginally 
cash negative. The sale followed a comprehensive review of the 
business, including its strategic fit within Coats, and the 
formulation of a turnaround plan. The sale better positions 
Coats for future profitable growth and allows it to focus 
attention on its high performing global Industrial and strong 
Americas Crafts businesses. The sale is subject to a limited 
number of conditions usual for this type of transaction and is 
expected to complete in Q2 2015.
As part of the strategy review and sales process it was decided 
that the UK Crafts business should remain within Coats. This 
decision was based on a number of factors, including the long 
heritage of Coats in the UK and the due diligence requirements 
for any buyer in relation to the ongoing tPR investigations.  
On balance it was concluded that retaining the business would 
generate the best overall value to shareholders.
In 2014 EMEA Crafts (excluding the UK) generated revenues of 
$124.9 million and a pre-exceptional operating loss of $9.8 
million. Including exceptional items, namely an $18.8 million 
impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets, EMEA Crafts incurred an operating loss of $28.6 million. 
As at 31 December 2014, after impairment, the business had 
net tangible assets of $35.4 million, including cash retained 
within the business as part of the sale. Given the total 
consideration of $10 million for the business compared to its net 
tangible asset position of $35.4 million at 2014 year end, and 
taking into account completion adjustments and disposal-
related costs, a substantial loss on disposal is expected to be 
recognised on completion of the transaction. The precise 
quantum will be finalised on completion and will in addition 
include historical foreign exchange translation gains and losses 
previously recognised in equity. The results of the EMEA Crafts 
business (excluding UK) together with the loss on disposal will 
be presented as a discontinued operation when the Group 
reports its 2015 half year results.
On completion of the sale Coats expects to provide some 
transitional support services to the EMEA business under new 
ownership for a period of time. However during the transition 
period Coats will continue to incur some costs previously 
allocated to the EMEA Crafts business, thereby impacting Coats’ 
2015 operating profit from ongoing operations. These costs will 
be subject to review during 2015 to ensure Group operating 
margins will not be negatively affected in the medium term.

Coats faces a wide range of commercial and  
operational risks
While our risk management process is driven from Board level, identifying, assessing and managing risks is embedded into our day to day 
operations. Overlaying Coats’ positive business principles and culture are formal structures and reporting procedures, including the 
Internal Audit Function and the Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), which comprises a broad mix of managers across the 
business and is chaired by the Group Chief Executive.
Overview and strategic report 
Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk Nature of risk Action/mitigation
Strategy and strategic planning risks
Delivery of strategy A lack of resource, poor project management, 
lack of skills or lack of acceptance in the 
market may result in not delivering growth 
projects. Consequently profitability goals 
are not achieved or the market multiple is 
materially below target.
Projects are managed by a dedicated team and sponsored by 
a member of the Coats Management Board or Industrial or 
Crafts Americas Leadership Teams. They are controlled by a 
Steering Committee and monitored financially.
The Board receives regular progress reports and sets targets 
for profitable sales.
Recruiting, maintaining 
and motivating high-quality 
staff
Not identifying and retaining key staff or 
improving their skills and knowledge may 
result in an inability to execute growth 
strategy.
HR policies cover reward and recognition, health and safety, 
talent management, skills assessment and development, 
performance management, succession planning and 
employee consultation.
An annual group-wide employee satisfaction survey flags any 
areas for concern which are then acted on.
An annual survey of pay and benefits ensures that terms and 
conditions of employment remain competitive.
Financial risks
Pensions Fluctuations in discount rates, investment 
values and returns, inflation and/or member 
longevity in the defined benefit pension 
arrangements result in funding burdens on 
the Group in the future.
Pension position and strategy is regularly reviewed by the 
Board.
Funded pension schemes are overseen by their trustees. 
Trustees are required to have the appropriate knowledge 
and understanding in this area and take professional and 
actuarial investment advice as necessary. Where appropriate 
independent professional trustees are appointed to schemes 
to provide additional expertise.
Coats and the trustees seek to de-risk the scheme through 
liability management and investment strategies to reduce the 
impact of fluctuations.
Treasury An exposure to uncertainties in financial 
markets and the banking sector including 
foreign exchange, interest rate, credit and 
liquidity risks as well as the risk of bank 
failure.
Coats’ policies cover all aspects of its Treasury operations, 
providing strict controls on managing risks and bank 
selection.
Coats may be unable to present itself as an 
attractive candidate for financing.
Compliance with the terms of Coats’ senior bank facility 
agreements is actively monitored. There is regular contact 
with core relationship banks and alternative sources of 
finance have been identified. In 2015 debt facility was 
successfully refinanced and maturity extended to 2020.
Operational risks
Information Technology (IT) Unauthorised access to Coats IT systems and 
data may result in the theft of data or the 
disruption of business processes.
Standard firewall capability is overseen by an external vendor. 
Coats’ networks are actively monitored and multiple layers of 
password protection are used at device and application level. 
Communications with portable devices are encrypted.
Coats ensures all internal users have appropriate access rights 
and permissions for their roles.
An inability of Coats’ IT network and systems 
to perform critical transactions and processes 
may result in business disruption.
Coats has sufficient network capacity and established IT 
systems in place with Group and Divisional IT teams to 
manage the IT risks. 19 Annual Report 2014
Coats financial information Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
Risk Nature of risk Action/mitigation
Supplier dependency If one or more major external suppliers is 
unable or unwilling to supply goods it may 
cause major disruption to the Coats supply 
chain that cannot be replaced in the short-
term, leading to lost contribution and long-
term impact on customer relations.
Supplier relationships and external supply chains are 
monitored and managed, with multiple sourcing of materials 
and strategic inventories.
Regular supplier meetings include detailed discussions of 
market conditions and supply expectations. Risk is spread by 
dealing with more than one supplier on each key material 
and continual identification of new supply sources.
Global insurance programmes include supplier dependency 
cover.
Internal supply chain Disproportionate reliance on critical internal 
supply chain nodes may have a significant 
impact on profitability in the event of 
disruption to any of them.
Manufacturing and supply chain function monitors and 
reviews internal supply chains, fire protection systems and 
creates and tests disaster recovery plans.
Rolling property risk surveys are conducted of all Coats 
critical supply chain nodes. The implementation of the risk 
reduction recommendations is actively monitored and where 
necessary capital expenditure is prioritised.
Global insurance programmes include property destruction 
and business interruption cover.
Customer dependency Key Crafts customers reduce shelf space for 
a group of products which Coats supplies 
or engages in price negotiation, materially 
reducing the contribution earned by the 
business.
Strong commercial relationships are maintained with senior 
level management with direct access to final decision 
makers. Coats works to ensure a high degree of customer 
collaboration, communication and management attention to 
POS data and weekly replenishment levels. It provides a high 
level of service/stock availability.
Significant investment in pattern/design support, product 
promotions and consumer advertising undertaken to boost 
in-store footfall and sales growth. Strategic marketing has 
targeted craft consumer demographics, in-store buying 
behaviour and positive correlation to store sales in other 
categories.
Environmental Non-compliance with internal environmental 
control procedures or local requirements (if 
these are stricter) leads to a serious pollution 
event having an adverse impact on operations 
and resulting in regulatory action being taken. 
This results in litigation, resultant damages 
and damage to reputation.
Management aims to achieve the highest practicable 
standards of environmental performance. All environmental 
issues are reported to the Group’s Audit and Risk Committee 
and Management Board through a semi-annual Risk 
Questionnaire completed by all operating units.
All sites must comply with local legal requirements for 
effluent quality and volume and hold the relevant permit to 
discharge. Coats has ‘Global Water Effluent Limits’, a set of 
15 parameters with the strictest limits of any local authority 
across three downstream categories.
Global insurance programme includes cover for 3rd Party 
property damage and injury or illness resulting from pollution 
of air, water or soil caused by a sudden or unforeseen 
incident.
Coats may be held responsible and 
accountable for clean-up/remediation costs 
of legacy environmental issues originating 
before it acquired those sites or after their 
disposal/closure.
Appropriate checks are undertaken on sites we are looking to 
acquire, and we conduct ongoing monitoring of current sites.
Every step appropriate is taken to ensure closed and/or sold 
sites are cleaned up.
Labour relations Poor labour relations in critical manufacturing 
sites could result in disruption to business.
An annual Employee Engagement satisfaction survey 
is conducted and relevant strategies developed and 
implemented to address concerns.
In the event of disruption, Coats can move production to 
other sites.

Risk Nature of risk Action/mitigation
Health and Safety (H&S) Non-compliance with internal H&S 
procedures or local requirements (if these are 
stricter) may lead to the injury or death of 
individuals.
As well as being a failure of its duty of care to 
its employees and contractors, this adversely 
impacts operations and results in regulatory 
action being taken. This results in litigation, 
resultant damages and damage to reputation.
Group H&S Policy requires high standards of H&S 
management at all sites, implemented through performance 
monitoring, risk assessment and management and mitigation 
of identified risks.
The most senior manager for each business unit is 
responsible for H&S, supported by site managers and senior 
HR officers who are responsible for ensuring all activities 
under their control are carried out in line with the Group H&S 
Policy and management systems. Every unit is required to 
report its H&S KPIs to the Group Risk Manager who reports 
them to the Board. Each site has an H&S Manager who as 
a minimum must be trained and qualified according to local 
legislation. All employees are responsible for reporting all 
incidents and near misses on site and on the way to or from 
work to their H&S Manager.
Product liability Increased focus on growth of Speciality 
products potentially leads to more exposure 
to Product Liability claims.
Products are tested and measured against stringent 
standards with quality control teams periodically improving 
and measuring progress.
Coats’ global insurance programme includes product liability 
cover.
Compliance and ethics risks
Non-compliance with laws 
and regulation
Non-compliance with any applicable laws/
regulations (including those relating to 
bribery and corruption, human rights and 
competition/anti-trust) by Coats or one of 
its major trading partners results in civil or 
criminal liabilities, individual or corporate fines 
and reputational damage. It could also result 
in being excluded from government related 
contracts.
Coats is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
and individual behaviour as set out in the Ethics Policy and 
the Code of Business Conduct. Online compliance training on 
anti-bribery and corruption, competition/anti-trust and ethics 
is repeated periodically for all senior employees and those in 
high risk positions. The Chief Legal & Risk Officer and Group 
Company Secretary attends and also sits as a member of the 
Management Board.
Coats has a whistle-blower system, enabling employees who 
are aware of, or suspect, misconduct, illegal activities, fraud, 
abuse of assets or violations of any group policy, to report 
these confidentially.

announced on 26 February 2015.
I believe it is essential that every company 
has in place robust corporate governance 
arrangements to underpin the work of the 
Board. We have worked hard during the 
year to develop our governance structures 
to ensure they are appropriate and to 
support our transition from an investment 
company, with a diversified portfolio of 
assets, to a global manufacturing business 
with FTSE 250 aspirations. In this section of 
our Annual Report we have set out our 
approach to governance and provided 
further information on the operation of the 
Board and its Committees. Some of this 
report refers to arrangements which were 
in place during the financial year ended  
31 December 2014. We have also set out 
our current arrangements and indicated 
where these will change going forward.
Governance
Other than as referred to in this report, the 
Company complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued in September 2012 
(the Code) and with its equivalent in 
Australia. It should be noted that the Code 
may materially differ from the corporate 
governance rules of NZX Limited (NZX) and 
the principles of NZX’s Corporate 
Governance Best Practice Code but the 
Company is not obliged to comply with 
these.
Board composition and succession 
planning
I was appointed to the Board on  
20 February 2014 and became Chairman on 
16 April when Rob Campbell stepped down 
as Chairman. Rob remained a Director until 
his resignation on 2 March 2015. I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank him 
for his time as Chairman and as a Director. 
Scott Malcolm and Waldemar Szlezak also 
resigned on 2 March 2015 and the Board 
thanks them for their contributions during 
the successfully completed asset realisation 
programme.
We were delighted to welcome a number of 
new Directors to the Board. Ruth Anderson 
joined the Board as an independent 
Non-Executive Director on 16 April 2014 
having joined the Board of Coats plc on 
2 January 2014. On 2 March 2015 the five 
Directors of the subsidiary company, Coats 
plc, who were not already on the Board of 
Coats Group plc were appointed to it. David 
Gosnell and Alan Rosling both joined as 
independent Non-Executive Directors 
bringing the total number of independent 
Directors, excluding me, to four while Paul 
Forman, Richard Howes and Rajiv Sharma 
joined the Board as Executive Directors.
I believe that these appointments result in a 
strong Board with the appropriate mix of 
skills and experience. We will, however, 
keep this under review. The Nominations 
Committee, which I chair, will review the 
Board’s structure, size and composition and 
make recommendations to the Board on 
succession planning, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the 
Company. Our Directors’ experience is 
varied and they bring a wealth of 
knowledge and skills to bear on all aspects 
of the management of the Group. 
Biographical details, which include a 
summary of particular experience, skills and 
qualifications are set out on page 26 to 27 
of this report. Senior management are 
regularly invited to attend Board meetings 
to present and there is an effective level of 
communication, challenge and support 
between the Board and management.
Board focus
Naturally, during 2014 the Board 
concentrated most of its work on 
stewardship of the Company and engaging 
actively with the UK Pensions Regulator 
(tPR).
Supported by the Audit and Risk 
Committee, the Board has also increased 
and deepened its focus on risk over the 
period. The Financial Reporting Council has 
highlighted, in the 2014 Code, that 
companies are expected to give a broader 
and clearer view of risk management than 
may have been the case previously. We 
provide an overview of Principal risks and 
uncertainties on pages 6 to 7 and 18 to 20.
Further detail on the matters discussed by 
the Board through the year is set out on 
page 28 of this report.

Listings
The Company is a premium listed issuer on 
the London Stock Exchange and its shares 
are also quoted on the Australian Securities 
Exchange (‘ASX’) in CDI form. In addition it 
is an Overseas Listed Issuer on the New 
Zealand Stock Exchange.
Compliance
The Board of Directors remains fully 
committed to the principles of best practice 
in corporate governance and throughout 
2014 has complied, except as otherwise 
noted, with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued in September 2012 (the Code) 
which can be found at www.frc.org.uk.
As an ASX listed company the Company is 
required to explain any deviation from the 
ASX Corporate Governance Council’s 
Corporate Governance Principles and 
Recommendations (3
rd 
edition) (ASX 
Governance Principles). More information 
on the ASX Governance Principles can be 
found at www.asx.com.au. It should be 
noted that the Code may differ materially 
from the corporate governance rules and 
the principles of NZX’s Corporate 
Governance Best Practice Code but the 
Company is not obliged to comply with 
these.
Leadership
The Role of the Board
The Board is responsible to the shareholders 
for the management of the Group’s assets 
and operation. It is also ultimately 
responsible for the management, 
governance, controls, risk management, 
direction and performance of the Group. 
During the year under review, the Directors 
were situated in the UK, Australia, New 
Zealand and the United States of America 
and had in place suitable communication 
and reporting systems which enabled them 
to monitor, on a timely basis, the Group’s 
activities.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
strategy and for its overall management. All 
matters are reserved for the Board unless 
specifically listed in the terms of reference 
for Committees of the Board or where the 
Board has delegated its authority. A formal 
schedule of delegated authorities is 
reviewed by the Board annually.
Composition of the Board and Board 
Meetings
During the year under review, the Board 
considered the Company a small company 
for the purposes of the Code and, as such, 
had, at all times during 2014, at least two 
independent Non-Executive Directors as 
prescribed by the Code. The Board currently 
consists of an independent Chairman, six 
Non-Executive Directors and three Executive 
Directors. Four of the Non-Executive 
Directors are considered to be independent 
and free of any business relationships that 
could compromise the exercise of 
independent and objective judgement. Two 
Non-Executive Directors are not considered 
independent. Sir Ron Brierley is not 
considered to be independent because of 
his length of service and Blake Nixon was 
previously an Executive Director.
All the Directors, whether judged 
independent or not, challenge assumptions 
effectively and assist management in the 
development of strategy and the effective 
leadership of the Group. 
The Board met regularly throughout the 
period. There were nine scheduled meetings 
in 2014. Directors are expected to attend all 
meetings of the Board, and the Committees 
on which they sit, and to devote sufficient 
time to the Company’s affairs to enable 
them to fulfil their duties as Directors. The 
Directors were located in the UK, Australia, 
New Zealand and the USA and this 
geographical diversity meant that it was not 
always possible for every Director to attend 
all Board and Committee meetings. In the 
event that Directors were unable to attend 
a meeting, their comments on papers to be 
considered at the meeting were discussed in 
advance with the Chairman so that their 
contribution could be included in the wider 
Board discussion.
The table at the foot of this page shows 
Directors’ attendance at scheduled Board 
and Committee meetings in 2014.
Governance structure
Division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and Chief Executive
During the year under review, the Company 
was an investment holding company and 
had no Executive Directors and so there was 
no requirement to formally document the 
separate roles and responsibilities of a 
Chairman and Chief Executive. Following 
the appointment of the Chief Executive, 
Paul Forman to the Board on 2 March 2015, 
this separation has been documented.
Role of the Chairman
Mike Clasper, the Chairman, leads the 
Board, and is responsible for its 
effectiveness and governance. He sets the 
tone for the Company and ensures that the 
links between the Board and management 
and between the Board and shareholders 
are strong. He sets the Board agenda and 
ensures that sufficient time is allocated to 
important matters, in particular those 
relating to strategy issues.
Mike Clasper was appointed to the Board 
on 20 February 2014. Further information 
on Mike is set out on page 22 along with 
the biographies of the other Directors.
Role of the Chief Executive
Paul Forman was appointed to the Board on 
2 March 2015, having been Chief Executive 
of Coats plc since 31 December 2009.
Paul is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the Group’s operations, for 
recommending the Group’s strategy to the 
Board and for implementing the strategy 
agreed by the Board. He is supported in 
decision-making by a Management Board 
comprised of senior managers.
Senior Independent Director
The Code provides that a company should 
identify a senior independent Non-Executive 
Director. During the year under review, the 
Company did not have such a designated 
director and the independent Non-
Executive Directors collectively fulfilled the 
role set out in the Code in respect of a 
senior independent director. In particular, in 
respect of shareholder communications 
with the Board, if a shareholder found that 
contact through the normal channels of the 
Chairman had failed to address particular

concerns, then these could be conveyed to 
any of the independent Non-Executive 
Directors whose wide experience enabled 
them to deal appropriately with any such 
enquiries.
Following the structural changes announced 
on 26 February 2015, the Board intends to 
appoint a Senior Independent Director in 
due course.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated specific 
responsibilities to each of the Audit and 
Risk, Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees, details of which are set out 
below. Each Committee has written terms 
of reference setting out its duties, authority 
and reporting responsibilities. Copies of all 
the Committee Terms of Reference are 
available via the Company’s website 
www.coats.com.
The Terms of Reference are kept under 
review to ensure they remain appropriate 
and reflect any changes in legislation, 
regulation or best practice. They are 
reviewed formally on an annual basis by the 
relevant Committee and the Board. The 
Chairman of each Committee reports on 
the proceedings of the previous Committee 
meeting at the following Board meeting 
matters.
Audit and Risk Committee
During 2014 this Committee consisted of 
Ruth Anderson as Chairman from 16 April 
2014, and Blake Nixon (previously 
Chairman) and David Wadsworth FCA. 
David Wadsworth is not a Director of the 
Company but was appointed in 2009 to 
comply with the Code requirement that the 
Committee included a member with recent 
and relevant financial expertise. Mr 
Wadsworth was formerly a partner at 
Deloitte LLP. Ruth Anderson, who was 
appointed as Chairman on 16 April 2014 
also has recent and relevant financial 
expertise. Mr Wadsworth resigned on 
28 February 2015. The composition of the 
Committee was not fully compliant with the 
Code or the ASX Governing Principles 
throughout 2014 as it did not have the 
requisite number of independent Non-
Executive Directors. However, following the 
appointment of David Gosnell and Alan 
Rosling to the Committee on 2 March 2015 
it is now fully compliant. It was compliant 
with the ASX Governance Principles 
recommendation that the Chairman be an 
independent Director from the date of the 
appointment of Ruth Anderson.
Remuneration and Nominations 
Committee
During the year under review, this 
Committee consisted of Scott Malcolm as 
Chairman together with all other Non-
Executive Directors of the Company. During 
the year, the Committee monitored, 
reviewed and set the Group’s remuneration 
policy as set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 32 to 40. 
It was also tasked with establishing and 
agreeing with the Board the policy for 
Board appointments.
During the year under review, the 
Committee performed the functions of the 
Nominations Committee. Following careful 
consideration by all members of the Board, 
Mike Clasper was appointed to the Board 
on 20 February 2014 and Ruth Anderson 
was appointed to the Board on 16 April 
2014. At the time of their appointments, 
both were directors of Coats plc (having 
been appointed in August 2013 and January 
2014 respectively) following a thorough 
recruitment process involving external 
search consultants, the Inzito Partnership, 
which has no other connections to the 
Company.
With effect from 2 March 2015, following 
careful consideration by the Board, the 
following directors of Coats plc were 
appointed to the Board: Alan Rosling, Paul 
Forman, Richard Howes, and Rajiv Sharma. 
David Gosnell was also appointed to the 
Board with effect from that date, having 
been appointed as a director of Coats plc in 
February 2015 following a thorough 
recruitment process involving the Inzito 
Partnership.
When searching for candidates for Board 
appointments, the Board seeks to make 
appointments on merit against objective 
criteria with due regard to the benefits of 
diversity. This includes gender diversity.
On 2 March 2015 the Committee was 
renamed the Remuneration Committee and 
its nomination work was transferred to a 
new Nominations Commmittee. Both 
Committees have written terms of reference 
which are available via www.coats.com.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is currently 
chaired by David Gosnell and its other 
members are Alan Rosling and Mike Allen.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is chaired by 
Mike Clasper and its other members 
comprise all the Non-Executive Directors.
Pensions Committee
The Pensions Committee is an ad hoc 
committee of the Board which has been 
formed specifically to manage tPR related 
pensions issues and have oversight of the 
Company’s pension strategy. The Board has 
delegated certain authorities relating to, 
amongst other matters, the approval of tPR 
related legal fees incurred. The Committee 
reports and makes recommendations to the 
Board on a regular basis. The Committee is 
chaired by Mike Allen and, from 2 March 
2015, its other members are David Gosnell; 
Ruth Anderson; Blake Nixon; and Richard 
Howes. Prior to 2 March 2015, during year 
under review, the Committee consisted of 
Mike Allen as Chairman; and its other 
members were Rob Campbell; Scott 
Malcolm; and Blake Nixon.
Effectiveness
The skills and experience of the Board are 
set out in their biographical details on pages 
22 and 23. The experience and knowledge 
of each of the Directors gives them the 
ability to constructively challenge strategy 
and to scrutinise performance.
Induction of new Directors
On joining the Board, all Directors undergo 
a thorough induction programme. 
Ordinarily, Directors are advised of the time 
required to fulfil the role prior to 
appointment and are asked to confirm that 
they can make the required commitment 
before an appointment is made. However, 
as a result of the evolving asset value 
realisation process which concluded in 
2013, together with the more recent need 
to address tPR’s investigations, it has not 
been possible to quantify the time 
commitment required from Directors, nor 
the commitment which will be required 
going forward. The letters of appointment 
of Non-Executive Directors, therefore, do 
not set out their expected time 
commitment, although all Directors have 
undertaken to provide sufficient time to 
engage effectively on behalf of 
shareholders. The Board is satisfied that 
each of the Non-Executive Directors has 
been able to devote sufficient time to the 
Company’s business.
Evaluation
During the year, the Board conducted a 
formal evaluation of its members. Each 
Director was invited to submit an evaluation 
of their performance during the year with 
particular regard to how they have 
contributed to the effectiveness and 
timeliness of the asset realisation process, 
the functional wind-down of GPG 
operations, the preparation process to allow 
Coats to stand alone and the handling of 
the tPR investigations, as well as their 
contributions and commitments to the 
Board and its Committees. The Chairman of 
the Board was invited to comment on each 
evaluation. The Chairman’s evaluation was 
considered by the other members of the 
Board. The outcome of these evaluations 
allows the Board to conclude that it is  28 Annual Report 2014
Corporate governance
Corporate governance continued
satisfied with the effectiveness and 
appropriateness of the composition of the 
Board and its Committees.
Continuing development
All Directors are advised of changes in 
relevant legislation and regulations and 
changing risks, with the assistance of the 
Company’s advisers where appropriate.
Directors’ interests
The interests of the Directors, including 
their connected persons, in the share capital 
of the Company and its subsidiaries are set 
out in the Directors’ remuneration report on 
pages 32 to 40. No Director, either during 
or since the end of the year under review, 
was or has become interested in any 
material contract (not being a contract of 
employment) with the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries.
Conflicts of interest
At each meeting the Board considers 
Directors’ conflicts of interest. The 
Company’s Articles of Association provide 
for the Board to authorise any actual or 
potential conflicts of interest.
Independent professional advice
Directors have access to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. In addition, they have access to 
the advice and services of the Group 
Company Secretary who is responsible for 
advice on corporate governance matters to 
the Board.
Directors and officers liability insurance
As recommended by the Code, Coats Group 
plc provides certain protections for directors 
and officers of companies within the Group 
against personal financial exposure that they 
may incur in the course of their duties. In 
addition, the Company has provided an 
indemnity for its Directors to the extent 
permitted by law in respect of the liabilities 
incurred as a result of their office.
Election of Directors
In accordance with the Articles of 
Association all the Directors appointed 
during the year will offer themselves for 
election by the shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting. In addition, Mike Allen 
will retire by rotation in accordance with the 
Articles of Association and offer himself for 
re-election. It is proposed that a resolution 
will be tabled at the Annual General 
Meeting to amend the Articles of 
Association to require all continuing 
Directors of the Company to offer 
themselves for election or re-election each 
year, which is best practice under the Code.
Board decisions and activity during 
the year
Each year the Board agrees a schedule of 
regular business, financial and operational 
matters to be addressed by the Board and 
its Committees during the course of the 
year and this ensures that all areas for which 
the Board has responsibility are reviewed. 
Directors receive Board and Committee 
papers one week prior to meetings.
Senior management and professional 
advisers are invited to attend Board and 
Committee meetings where appropriate to 
contribute to discussions and advise 
members of the Board or its Committees on 
particular matters. The involvement of the 
senior management at Board and 
Committee discussions strengthens the 
relationship between the Board and its 
operating business and helps to provide the 
Board with a greater understanding of 
operations and strategy.
Accountability
Annual Report and Financial Statements
The Board considers that the Annual Report 
and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
The Board is responsible for determining the 
nature and extent of its principal risks and 
for determining the extent of the Group’s 
risk appetite. The Audit and Risk Committee 
is tasked with keeping the effectiveness of 
the Group’s risk management framework 
under review and the Group’s approach to 
the management of risk is set out on pages 
6 to 7.
Going Concern
The Company’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are 
set out in the Chairman’s Statement. 
In addition, note 35 to the financial 
statements includes the Company’s 
objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities; 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity 
risk. The Directors believe that the Company 
is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully.
At the year end the Parent Group had cash 
totalling £375 million (2013: £383 million). 
The Parent Group also has various other 
actual and contingent liabilities. The Board 
expects to be able to meet these obligations 
from existing resources. Further information 
on the net cash position of the Group is 
provided in the table at the foot of the 
Consolidated statement of cash flows.
Giving due consideration to the nature of 
the Group’s business and underlying 
investments, taking account of the following 
matters: the ability of the Group to realise 
its liquid investments and to manage the 
timing of such liquidations; the Group’s 
foreign currency exposures; the potential 
requirement to provide financial support to 
the Group’s UK pension schemes; the 
appropriate capital structure to be adopted 
in the future; and the factors which will 
determine further returns of surplus cash to 
shareholders; and also taking into 
consideration the cash flow forecasts 
prepared by the Group and the sensitivity 
analysis associated therewith, the Directors 
consider that the Company and the Group 
are going concerns and these financial 
statements are prepared on that basis.
Relations with shareholders
The Group has a dedicated Investor 
Relations function and a website  
focussed on information and updates  
relevant to public shareholders  
(www.coats.com/investors).
The Board receives regular updates on 
investor communication activity, changes to 
the shareholder register and analysis of 
share price performance.
The Board considers transparency and 
openness to be a key feature of its stated 
strategy and endeavours to ensure that 
both the market and shareholders are made 
aware, as soon as possible, of any matters 
which may be of interest and that regular 
updates are released to the market. The 
Group has a formal policy on continuing 
disclosure and communications with 
shareholders.
Presentations are made to analysts and 
shareholders covering the Company’s 
Preliminary Results and its half year results 
each year.
Annual General Meeting
The Board considers the Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”) to be a useful forum to 
develop an understanding of the views of 
its shareholders. At its 2014 AGM the 
Chairman provided an additional report 
to shareholders.
Copies of these presentations and reports 
and the results of proxy voting at the 2014 
AGM were released to the markets and can 
be found on the Company’s website 
www.coats.com.
This year’s AGM will be held on 21 May 
2015 in London. 29 Annual Report 2014

Annual statement by the Chairman  
of the Audit and Risk Committee
Coats financial information
Our work during the year has led us to conclude that 
the internal control and risk management systems 
within the business remain effective.
Dear Shareholder, 
As Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee (‘the Committee’), I 
am pleased to report below on the 
Committee’s activities in 2014.
I succeeded Blake Nixon as Chairman of 
the Committee on 16 April 2014 and I 
would like to thank him for his work as 
Chairman. Blake remained a member 
of the Committee throughout 2014, 
along with David Wadsworth, who was 
co-opted onto the Committee in 2009, 
and both David and I were considered 
to have the recent and relevant financial 
experience required by the Code. The 
attendance of Committee members is 
set out on page 26. The Group Chairman 
and senior executives also attended 
Committee meetings and we received 
reports from the Operational Risk 
Management Committee, the meetings 
of which I have a standing invitation to 
attend.
One of my first actions as Chairman 
was to ask the Committee to review its 
terms of reference; the updated terms of 
reference can be found via our website 
at www.coats.com/governance. The 
Committee has an annual work plan 
to ensure that it covers all the work 
required of it and in addition to this plan 
it considered a number of significant 
accounting issues which are described in 
more detail in this report below.
 
Finally, a key element of the Committee’s 
work is to review the internal control 
and risk management systems of the 
business. Our work during the year has led 
us to conclude that they continue to be 
effective.
I will be available at the AGM to answer 
any questions about our work.

Introduction
The Committee is responsible on behalf of 
the Board for monitoring, amongst other 
things:
 > the financial reporting process, the 
integrity of the financial statements of the 
Company, and any other formal 
announcements relating to its financial 
performances and reviewing significant 
financial reporting judgments contained 
in them;
 > the effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls and the controls and risk 
management systems of the Company;
 > the terms of engagement of the external 
auditor, its remuneration, its

executive management. 30 Annual Report 2014
Corporate governance
Annual statement by the Chairman  
of the Audit and Risk Committee continued
The Committee has formally reported to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.
The Committee has an annual work plan. This includes standing items that the Committee considers regularly in addition to any specific 
matters that require its attention and topical items on which it has chosen to focus.
Significant accounting issues considered during the year
Significant financial and reporting issues considered by the Committee in the year, in no particular order, were as 
follows:
Significant financial and 
reporting issue
How the issue has been addressed
Pension matters – valuation of 
obligations and disclosure
The Committee reviewed the methodology for determining key assumptions underpinning the valuation of 
liabilities of the Group’s most significant pension schemes under International Accounting Standards. The 
Committee also reviewed in detail the various aspects of the continuing obligation to the Group’s ongoing 
schemes, including the potential impact of tPR’s investigation, and is satisfied that the disclosure relating to 
these provides an appropriate balance.
The carrying value of intangible 
assets
The Group has significant balance sheet values relating to intangible assets with indefinite lives (brands). 
Following input from executive management, the Committee has considered these carrying values and agreed 
impairment adjustments where necessary.
The carrying value of tangible 
assets
The Committee also reviewed evidence of impairment of tangible assets. This entails identifying loss making 
business activities and interrogating the related business plans. The Committee is satisfied the carrying value of 
tangible fixed assets is recoverable.
US environment provisions The Committee has considered management’s position on the accounting and disclosure implications 
surrounding the Lower Passaic River following the publication of the Focused Feasibility Study by the US 
Environmental Protection Agency during the year and concurs with the treatment adopted and related 
disclosures.
Other provisioning The Committee considered the various judgments made by management in setting other provisions, the 
main areas being in respect of property and costs associated with tPR’s investigation and is satisfied with the 
judgments made.
Taxation The Group operates in numerous jurisdictions around the world and the sheer variety of regulation together 
with the quantum of cross-border transactions gives rise to inherent risks. The Committee has reviewed 
management’s reports on tax risks and is satisfied with the judgments taken in preparing the financial 
statements.
Going Concern
The Committee reviewed a detailed paper 
presented by management setting out the 
assumptions underlying the going concern 
statement. The paper covered the Group’s 
current financing, budgets and forecasts 
and assessments of principal risks and 
uncertainties. The Committee considered 
this report, the report of the external 
auditors and also in particular issues relating 
to tPR’s investigations and concluded that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group will have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the period of assessment of 
twelve months from the date of signing the 
accounts. The Committee reported 
accordingly to the Board.
External Audit
The Committee is also responsible for 
making recommendations on the 
engagement and independence of the 
Company’s auditor, Deloitte LLP. The audit 
firm has a policy of partner rotation which 
complies with regulatory standards and the 
audit engagement partner changed with 
effect from the beginning of the 2014 
financial year in line with this requirement. 
In addition, the auditor has a structure of 
peer reviews for its engagements which is 
aimed at ensuring from its perspective 
independence is maintained. Deloitte LLP 
was appointed the Company’s auditor in 
2003 following an evaluation process 
including the Company’s predecessor audit 
firm. During the year a formal audit 
tendering policy was approved. It was 
agreed that, in the future, the audit would 
be put out to tender at least every ten 
years, although, in order not to adversely 
affect the business, the Group would take 
advantage of the FRC transitional 
arrangements proposed at the time of the 
publication of the 2012 Code. The 
Committee considers maintaining an 
independent relationship with the 
Company’s auditor to be a critical part of 
assessing the effectiveness of the audit 
process. To this end the Committee 
regularly reviews the level of audit and 
non-audit fees paid to Deloitte LLP and also 
has in place a policy for ensuring significant 
assignments are not awarded to the auditor 
without first being subject to the scrutiny of 
the Committee. There are no contractual 
obligations that restrict the Company’s 
choice of external audit firm. The policy 
requires the Committee to take action 
based on the following categories of 
non-audit services:
(i) Permitted services are those that fall 
outside the scope of an audit and these 
are managed with reference to the fee 
levels whereby services with fees 
exceeding certain amounts cannot be 
provided by the auditor without the 
prior approval of the Audit, and Risk 
Committee. During 2014, these 
permitted non-audit services were 
primarily comprised of tax strategy, 
compliance and reporting accountant’s 
work in relation to The Pensions 
Regulator’s (tPR) insufficiently resourced 
tests for the Coats Pension Plan; 31 Annual Report 2014
Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Coats financial information
(ii) Other advisory services which are 
deemed not to compromise the 
independence of the auditor but are 
reviewed on a case by case basis and 
require the prior approval of the 
Committee; and
(iii) Certain services, such as services 
remunerated on a success fee or 
participation in activities normally 
undertaken by management, are 
prohibited from being provided by the 
auditor because of the potential to 
compromise audit independence. The 
Committee confirms that no such 
services have been provided.
The Committee is satisfied that the policy 
on the supply of non-audit services by the 
Company’s auditor, Deloitte LLP, could not 
lead to audit objectivity and independence 
being compromised.
The scope of the external audit is 
documented by the auditor in a formal 
proposal. The draft proposal is discussed 
with management before it is referred to 
the Committee. The Committee then 
reviews the draft and satisfies itself as to its 
adequacy by further discussions with 
management. The Committee suggests 
changes to the plan as appropriate before 
final approval.
The finance team and the external audit 
team review the effectiveness of the audit 
process at their closing meetings and 
consider how it might be improved. Their 
suggestions are then discussed with the 
Committee. The Committee then meet 
privately, without the external auditors 
present, to discuss the overall performance 
of the auditors and their independence and 
objectivity, and potential reappointment. 
Following the year under review, the 
Committee concluded that there were no 
concerns about the auditors’ performance, 
and that they had maintained a suitable 
level of independence and objectivity and 
that it was therefore appropriate to 
recommend their reappointment for the 
2015 financial year. The Committee have 
decided to enhance the review process by 
issuing a questionnaire to all those involved 
in the audit process, to seek further views 
on its effectiveness and suggestions for 
improvement.
Internal audit
The Code obliges Audit Committees to 
consider the need for internal audit and to 
make a recommendation to the Board. The 
Committee considers Group’s operations to 
be sufficiently widespread and complex to 
require an internal audit function. The Head 
of Group Internal Audit agrees the 
department’s programme of work with, and 
makes his reports directly to, the 
Committee. Internal audit reports contain a 
grading for each location visited and those 
not reaching an acceptable standard are 
scheduled for follow up visits as part of the 
programme for the following year. In 
addition to its rolling programme of 
reviews, the Company’s Internal Audit team 
carries out special reviews as the need 
arises.
Whistleblowing procedure
The Company has a whistleblower system, 
enabling employees who are aware of, or 
suspect, misconduct, illegal activities, fraud, 
abuse of assets or violations of any 
Company policy, to report these 
confidentially. The Committee is briefed on 
the instances of whistleblowing at each 
meeting by the Head of Group Internal 
Audit.
Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. It has delegated 
to the Committee within its terms of 
reference the formality of monitoring 
compliance with this obligation and receives 
regular reports from the Committee.
The reporting process ensures that all 
significant business units within the Group 
report to the Board as a whole in relation to 
financial information, risk management and 
internal control. The systems operated by 
the Group are reviewed annually by 
management and the results of these 
reviews are reported to the Committee and 
to the Board.
The Committee and the Board are satisfied 
that these systems operate effectively in all 
material respects in relation to financial 
reporting risks. Furthermore, the Committee 
and the Board are satisfied that this process 
provides appropriate assurance regarding 
the Group’s financial condition, operational 
results, risk management and internal 
compliance and control systems.
The Board considers that its system of risk 
management and internal control is 
operating effectively in all material respects 
in relation to financial reporting risks. 
However, the Company has not received the 
declaration referred to in section 295A of 
the Australian Corporations Act (as 
recommended by Recommendation 7.3 of 
the ASX Governance Principles), since the 
Australian Corporations Act does not apply 
to the Company.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Company are addressed in the Strategic 
Report and in the table on page 30 of this 
report.
The Board has been notified of its 
responsibilities for identifying key business 
risks appropriate to its own business sector 
and establishing appropriate and relevant 
control and compliance procedures. The 
Board is also required to acknowledge it is 
responsible for the operation of its internal 
control systems. Notwithstanding this, as 
noted above, the Committee takes full 
responsibility for reviewing the internal 
control environment within the Company 
and receives regular reports from 
management, Internal Audit and the 
external auditor.
Governance
The Committee has undertaken a review of 
its own performance, focussing on the 
Code requirements for Audit Committees, 
via a new questionnaire. The results are 
positive. The related comments will be 
debated at a forthcoming Audit & Risk 
Committee meeting, when the Committee 
will agree whether there are actions which 
should be taken to further improve the way 
in which the Committee operates.

Directors’ remuneration report 
for the year ended 31 December 2014
Annual statement by the Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Remuneration 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) I am pleased 
to present the Directors’ remuneration 
report for the year ended 31 December 
2014.
This report includes the remuneration 
policy for Directors as approved by 
shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) on 22 May 2014 and 
discloses the amounts paid relating to the 
year ended 31 December 2014.
Throughout 2014 the Committee 
continued to prepare for the transition of 
the Company from an investment 
portfolio holding company with only 
Non-Executive Directors to a more 
traditional global LSE main market listed 
company with a Board consisting of 
Non-Executive and Executive Directors.
Prior to the AGM on 22 May 2014 the 
Company consulted with major 
shareholders on the details of the 
remuneration policy for both Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors. The policy 
was intended to be appropriate for the 
on-going Coats business and to adhere to 
the latest best practice guidelines for a 
FTSE company. I am pleased that the 
policy and the associated share-based 
incentive plans received overwhelming 
support from our shareholders at the  
2014 AGM.
No Executive Directors were appointed to 
the Board during 2014. However, as 
announced on 26 February 2015, Paul 
Forman, Richard Howes and Rajiv Sharma 
joined the Board as Executive Directors in 
March 2015. The remuneration policy will 
therefore, as planned, apply to the new 
Executive Directors from 2015 onwards.
Mike Clasper joined the Board on 20 
February 2014 and became Chairman on 
16 April 2014. As disclosed in the 2013 
Remuneration Report he elected not to 
receive an additional fee from the 
Company on appointment as a Non-
Executive Director of the Company. He 
continued to receive a fee as Chairman of 
the Board of Coats plc (a subsidiary of the 
Company). From 1 June 2014 this 
Chairman’s fee was paid by the Company. 
The Chairman’s fee remained at the same 
level following his appointment as Coats 
plc Chairman and was not increased. Full 
details of the fees paid to all Non-
Executive Directors are shown in this 
report.
The Committee will continue to monitor 
and evaluate the effectiveness of the 
Company’s remuneration policy and 
ensure that it remains aligned with the 
interests of all the Company’s stakeholders 
and provides an effective framework that 
enables the Company to attract, retain 
and incentivise the executives that the 
Company needs to meet its objectives.
I joined the Board on 2 March 2015 and 
have assumed responsibility as 
Remuneration Committee Chairman from 
Scott Malcolm following his decision to 
retire from the Board.
David Gosnell
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Committee has responsibility for 
determining remuneration for the 
Company’s Directors including the 
Chairman. The Committee takes into 
account the need to recruit and retain 
Directors who have the suitable skills and 
experience to perform in the interests of the 
Company and its shareholders, while paying 
no more than is necessary.
It will need to ensure that any incentive 
compensation for Executive Directors is 
suitably motivational and will encourage any 
such Executive Directors to meet stretching 
performance targets within an acceptable 
degree of risk.
The Committee’s policy is that remuneration 
and benefit levels should be sufficiently 
competitive, having regard to remuneration 
practice in the industry and the countries in 
which the Group operates, to attract, 
incentivise, reward and retain Directors and 
senior executives.
Although the Company did not have any 
Executive Directors during 2014, the 
Remuneration Policy set out below applies 
to all Executive Directors who are appointed 
to the Board during the life of this policy.
Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
receive an annual fee (paid in monthly 
instalments). The fee for the Chairman is set 
by the Committee and the fees for the 
Non-Executive Directors are approved by 
the Board, on the recommendation of the 
Chairman. In determining the appropriate 
level of fees the Committee and the 
Chairman consider advice from external 
sources and data on the fee levels in other 
similar companies. No individual is present 
when his or her own level of remuneration 
is discussed.

Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Coats financial information
Legacy matters
Two of the Non-Executive Directors hold 
share options granted under the Guinness 
Peat Group plc 2002 Executive Share 
Option Scheme (“the Scheme”). Details of 
share options granted to existing Non- 
Executive Directors are set out on page 38 
of the Annual Report.
These remain eligible to vest based on their 
original award terms. The share options 
were not granted subject to performance 
targets, although as the options were 
granted with an exercise price equal to the 
share price at the date of grant, the options 
are subject to an inherent share price target. 
All such options are fully vested and are 
capable of exercise in full.
The Scheme contains limited discretions 
including determining the treatment of 
leavers based on the rules of the relevant 
plan and whether adjustments are required 
in certain circumstances (eg rights issues, 
corporate restructuring events and special 
dividends). Any exercise of these discretions 
would, where relevant, be explained in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
When recruiting Non-Executive Directors, 
the remuneration arrangements offered will 
be in line with those set out in the relevant 
table above.
In determining the level of fees for a new 
Non-Executive Director, the Committee will 
take into account all factors it determines to 
be relevant, including the skills and 
experience of the individual and the need to 
attract Non-Executive Directors of the 
appropriate calibre. The Committee will also 
take into account the level of fees offered 
by equivalent companies.
Terms of appointment
Fees
Under their respective Non-Executive 
Director appointment letters, all of the 
Non-Executive Directors other than 
Waldemar Szlezak are entitled to receive an 
annual fee. Waldemar Szlezak’s 
appointment letter reflected his agreement 
not to receive any fee.
Sir Ron Brierley is eligible under his Non- 
Executive Director appointment letter to 
participate in the Scheme and staff bonus 
scheme. However, no further options can 
be granted under the Scheme and there is 
no current or future intention to award Sir 
Ron Brierley any bonus under the staff 
bonus scheme. Sir Ron Brierley has elected 
not to receive any fee as from 1 October 
2013.
Mike Clasper elected not to receive any fee 
in respect of his duties from his 
appointment until 1 June 2014 (although he 
did continue to receive his fee for being the 
Chairman of Coats plc). With effect from  
1 June 2014 this fee became payable by the 
Company.
T erm and termination provisions
None of the appointment letters contains a 
set term of office.
None of the appointment letters (other than 
for Sir Ron Brierley) contains a notice period. 
Removal of the Non-Executive Directors 
would be governed by the Articles of 
Association of the Company.
Sir Ron Brierley’s appointment is terminable 
by the Company on giving 18 months’ 
written notice or by Sir Ron Brierley giving 
12 months’ written notice. In case of early 
termination by the Company other than for 
cause Sir Ron Brierley is entitled to receive a 
payment in respect of any annual bonus for 
the period to the date on which the notice 
period would expire, based either (at Sir Ron 
Brierley’s election) on the average bonus 
paid in the preceding two financial years or 
on the bonus actually declared (or which 
would have been declared but for the 
cessation of office) for the relevant financial 
years. If Sir Ron Brierley is removed as a 
director within two years of a change in 
control of the Company, other than for 
cause, he is entitled to compensation equal 
to two times the average bonus received in 
the preceding two financial years. As 
referred to above, there is no current or 
future intention to award Sir Ron Brierley 
any bonus under the staff bonus scheme.
All Non-Executive Director letters of 
appointment are available for inspection at 
1 The Square, Stockley Park, Uxbridge, UB11 
1TD during normal hours of business, and 
will also be available at the Company’s 
AGM on 21 May 2015 until the close of the 
meeting.
Policy on payment for loss of office
Save in respect of Sir Ron Brierley, there are 
no provisions in the Non-Executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment that would 
give rise to any compensation payments for 
loss of office. Sir Ron Brierley’s entitlements 
on termination of appointment are set out 
above.
Share options
In respect of the share options granted 
under the Scheme and held by certain 
Non-Executive Directors, on a cessation of 
office on grounds of gross misconduct or 
on-going breach of the terms of 
appointment following a written warning, 
options will lapse. In all other cases options 
would remain capable of exercise.
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration policy table
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation
Fees
To attract and retain a 
high-calibre Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors by 
offering market competitive fee 
levels.
The Chairman is paid an all-inclusive fee for all Board responsibilities. The other 
Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board fee, with supplementary fees payable for 
additional Board responsibilities (if appropriate). The fee levels are reviewed on a 
periodic basis, and may be increased taking into account factors such as the time 
commitment of the role and market levels in companies of comparable size and 
complexity.
Additional payments may be made above the basic Board fee if duties significantly 
exceed expectations.
Supplementary fees. Supplementary fees may be payable to the Senior Independent Director, Chair of the

Executive Directors
As noted above there were no Executive 
Directors at any stage during 2014. 
However, the policy that applies following 
the appointments of Paul Forman, Richard 
Howes and Rajiv Sharma as Executive 
Directors with effect from 2 March 2015 is 
shown below. A similar policy applies to 
other senior executives to the extent 
applicable.
Recruitment
In order to appoint an Executive Director, 
including a promotion to the Board of an 
executive from within the Group, the 
Committee will offer the recruit a 
remuneration package that it believes is 
appropriate, taking into account the skills 
and experience of the individual and the 
need to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy table
Fixed remuneration
Salary
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
To attract and retain the key talent 
that the Company needs to achieve 
its objectives.
Salaries for new Executive Directors will be set by the Board taking into account such factors as it determines to 
be necessary, as discussed above.
Following recruitment, salaries will be reviewed annually with effect from 1 July. Salary reviews take account 
of factors including the market competitive level of pay in other companies, average salary increases applied 
elsewhere across the Group, the performance of the Company and the relative skills, performance and talent 
of the individual and any increase in the scope and/or responsibility of the individual’s role.
The Committee’s approach will consider the median level of salary of similar positions in the FTSE250 
(excluding financial services) for UK based roles to reflect the global scope and dimensions of the Group’s 
operations and the sector in which it operates. External benchmark data is considered only as a reference point 
and the median figure will not be regarded as a target level of remuneration.
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
To provide a market competitive 
level of retirement provision.
In the case of an external appointment, the Executive Director will either be entitled to participate in a defined 
contribution scheme, on a non-contributory basis, with an employer contribution of up to 20% of salary, or 
will be provided with a cash alternative in lieu of any pension benefits of up to 20% of salary.
In the case of promotion of an executive of the Group to the role of Executive Director, the individual will be 
entitled to continue to participate in any pension arrangements (including any cash alternative arrangements) in 
which they participate at the time of promotion or to participate in a new arrangement on the same terms as 
may be offered to an external appointment (as described above).
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
To provide a market competitive 
level of benefits.
Benefit provision to Executive Directors will be determined by the Committee taking into account such factors 
as it determines to be necessary, with the aim of creating a competitive overall package.
Benefits may include the provision of private medical insurance, ill-health protection and/or life insurance and a 
cash-for-car-allowance.
In addition, the Company may provide assistance in connection with the relocation of an Executive Director 
and, in the event of an international transfer, may provide tax equalisation arrangements.
Executive Directors may also participate in any all-employee incentive plan operated by the Company from time 
to time, up to the same limit for participation as applies for other employees.
individuals of the appropriate calibre. In 
determining the remuneration package that 
may be offered to a new Executive Director, 
the Committee may also take into account 
external and internal comparisons and 
relevant market factors, as well as any other 
factors which the Board determines to be 
relevant.
The remuneration package offered may 
include the components of remuneration 
described below in the Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy Table subject to the 
relevant limits as set out in the table.
For external appointments, the Committee 
may determine that there may be 
exceptional circumstances where it would 
be appropriate, in order to secure the right 
candidate, to compensate for lost awards 
incurred by an individual as a result of 
leaving their former employer. In the case of 
any long term incentive awards, save where 
such awards are close to vesting, any such 
award on appointment would normally be 
granted as a share based award, subject to 
such vesting and/or performance conditions 
as the Committee determined to be 
appropriate, either under a one-off 
arrangement or under the terms of the 
Long Term Incentive Plan (as described 
below). In determining the terms of any 
such awards, the Committee would take 
account of the vesting schedule and 
conditions attached to the forfeited awards, 
but also other factors that it determined to 
be relevant, including the need to suitably 
incentivise and retain the individual during 
the initial years of their appointment. 35 Annual Report 2014

Annual bonus
Cash bonus and deferral into shares under the rules of the Deferred Bonus Plan
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity Performance
Annual bonus incentivises key 
individuals to achieve the objectives 
of the annual business plan.
The metrics are designed to 
incentivise key individuals to 
achieve the objectives and targets 
that result in an increase in 
profit growth, strong cash-flow 
generation for the Group and 
individual key objectives that will 
contribute to the growth of the 
Group.
The deferred element ensures 
that the final value of the annual 
incentive is linked to the longer 
term value of the Group.
Annual bonuses will be determined by reference to 
performance, in the normal course measured over one 
financial year.
The maximum annual bonus that may be awarded will be 
100% of salary.
Any bonuses awarded will be subject to a mandatory 25% 
deferral into shares, to be held for a three year retention 
period, under the terms of the Deferred Bonus Plan. Deferral 
may operate so that shares will be held beneficially by the 
Executive Director during this period, in which case dividends 
will be payable on shares during such period. The deferral 
may alternatively be achieved by the grant of a share award 
or nil-cost option in lieu of the deferred portion of the bonus, 
and in which case an additional payment in cash or shares 
may be made to reflect dividends that may have been earned 
during the period from grant to vesting.
The deferred element of the bonus may be subject to 
clawback (via the forfeiture of the deferred shares) in cases 
of personal misconduct or a restatement of results that mean 
the annual bonus awarded was greater than it should have 
been.
The Deferred Bonus Plan was approved by shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM.
The performance measures, weightings and 
targets for the annual bonus will be set by the 
Committee on an annual basis.
Performance measures will normally include 
tests of both business and individual 
performance.
As an indication, the business objectives will 
include a profit-based measure and a measure 
that reflects cash generation.
The weighting for each business objective will 
be between 20% and 50% and the weighting 
for the personal objectives will be up to a 
maximum of 20%.
The Target or Budget level of performance 
will result in a payment of between 40% to 
60% of the maximum award. The Committee 
will determine the Target/Budget level 
of remuneration on a basis that it feels is 
stretching and challenging.
The Committee will be able to reduce 
vesting levels if it determines the result of 
the performance targets does not accurately 
reflect the financial health of the Company.
All annual bonus payments and awards are 
made at the discretion of the Committee and 
the terms of the awards may be amended by 
the Committee at any time provided that they 
remain within the terms of this policy.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity Performance
To incentivise key individuals to 
achieve key long term objectives.
Principally the objectives are to 
achieve profit growth; sustained 
cash generation and superior 
performance in Total Shareholder 
Return relative to the FTSE250.
Targets are established considering 
the sector in which the Group 
operates and the acceptable risk 
profile of the Group.
To create alignment between 
executives and shareholders.
To retain key individuals.
Awards will be made annually, conditional on the 
achievement of three year performance conditions.
Award levels for a Chief Executive Officer or a Chief Financial 
Officer will be up to 150% of salary, with lower award levels 
for any other Executive Director. Awards may be made to 
other senior executives within the Group. Larger awards 
may be made in exceptional circumstances, but in no case to 
exceed 250% of salary.
Awards will normally be made in the form of nil-cost options, 
exercisable following vesting until the tenth anniversary of 
grant, although awards may be made in other forms. An 
additional payment in cash or shares may be made to reflect 
dividends that may have been earned on the proportion of 
the award that vests during the period from grant to vesting.
Awards will be subject to malus and claw-back provisions. 
The malus provisions give the Committee discretion to 
reduce the level of an award prior to vesting in the event of 
personal misconduct or if events happened that caused the 
Committee to determine the grant level was not appropriate. 
The Committee will have discretion to claw-back vested 
awards in the event that personal misconduct prior to vesting 
is discovered or if within three years of vesting there is a 
restatement of results that means awards vested at too high 
a level.
The Long Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders 
at the 2014 AGM.
Performance will be assessed over a period of 
not less than three years.
The performance measures will consist of 
a profitability measure, a cash generation 
measure and a total shareholder return 
measure.
The weighting for each measure will be 
between 20% and 50%.
The weighting for each specific award, the 
definition of the precise measure and the 
targets will be determined by the Committee 
considering the balance of strategic priorities 
for the Company for each three year 
performance period.
In addition, the Committee may consider 
setting an underpin condition which must be 
satisfied prior to vesting of an award.
The Committee will be able to reduce 
vesting levels if it determines the result of 
the performance targets does not accurately 
reflect the financial health of the Company.
Following grant of an award, the Committee 
will have power to amend performance 
measures and targets if events happen 
that mean they are no longer a fair test of 
performance, but not so as to make the 
assessment of performance materially less 
onerous.

Corporate governance
Directors’ remuneration report continued
for the year ended 31 December 2014
Legacy matters in respect of future 
Executive Directors
In the event that an executive of the Group 
is promoted to the Board, the Company 
retains power to honour any existing 
remuneration commitments. In particular, 
any long term awards, both cash and share 
awards, will continue to be capable of 
vesting on their existing terms. This would 
include awards previously granted under 
legacy Group incentive plans. This would 
also include any awards granted under the 
Long Term Incentive Plan or Deferred Bonus 
Plan prior to the individual being appointed 
as a director (although it would be intended 
that any such awards would in any event 
comply with the Policy as set out above).
Shareholding target
Executive Directors will be required to attain 
a shareholding, over a five year period, 
equivalent to 100% of salary.
Service contracts of future Executive 
Directors
The Committee’s policy is for service 
contracts for Executive Directors to reflect 
the Committee’s understanding of best 
corporate practice for listed companies. 
However, in the event that an executive of 
the Group is promoted to the Board, the 
Committee may include terms in any new 
service contract which are consistent with 
that individual’s existing service contract 
and legacy arrangements.
Service contracts offered to non-UK based, 
external appointments will generally be in 
line with the provisions set out above, 
subject to any local law requirements.
Executive Directors will be able to accept 
Non-Executive appointments outside the 
Company (as long as this does not lead to a 
conflict of interest) with the consent of the 
Board, as such appointments can enhance 
their experience and add value to the 
Company. Any fees received (excluding 
positions where the Executive Director is 
appointed as the Company’s representative) 
may be retained by the Executive Director.
Policy on payment for loss of office of 
future Executive Directors
In the case of an executive of the Group 
who is promoted to the Board, the terms on 
cessation of office or employment would be 
governed by the terms of the individual’s 
existing employment agreement. In 
addition, the terms of any incentive awards 
made to the individual prior to being 
appointed as an Executive Director, and the 
terms of any pre-existing participation in a 
pension scheme, would govern the 
treatment of such arrangements.
Notice period The notice period will be no more than 12 months (in the case of notice 
being given by the Company or the Executive Director). An Executive 
Director may be placed on garden leave during some or all of the notice 
period.
Payment in 
lieu of notice 
(“PILON”)
Save in circumstances justifying summary termination, employment may 
be terminated without notice by paying a PILON comprising basic salary 
and contractual benefits. Subject to any legacy terms, the Company will 
have discretion to pay on a phased basis, which will normally be subject to 
mitigation.
Pension The service contract may include entitlement to pension benefits, subject 
to the provisions and any limits set out in this Policy and the pension 
scheme rules or an annual allowance. The entitlement to pension benefits 
may continue during any notice period.
Benefits The service contract may include entitlement to other benefits, subject to 
the provisions and limits set out in this Policy. The entitlement to benefits 
may continue during any notice period.
Incentive plans The Executive Director will be eligible to be considered (at the Committee’s 
discretion) to participate in the annual bonus and long term incentive 
arrangements operated from time to time, subject to the provisions and 
limits set out in this Policy. The terms of such arrangements would apply in 
the event of a cessation of office or employment, as set out below.
Subject to this, the key elements of a service contract offered to a UK based Executive 
Director appointment will be:
Notice periods, salary and contractual 
rights
The notice periods and contractual rights on 
termination that would be included in a 
service contract offered to an external 
recruit are set out above. In addition, the 
Executive Director would be entitled to 
accrued but untaken holiday.
In respect of any awards made to an 
Executive Director under any all-employee 
share plan, the same leaver conditions will 
apply as apply in respect of employees 
generally.
Discretions
In considering the exercise of its discretions 
under the incentive arrangements, as 
referred to above, or otherwise in 
connection with the cessation of office or 
employment of an Executive Director, the 
Committee will take into account all 
relevant circumstances, having regard to 
their duties as Directors.
In doing so, factors that the Committee may 
take into account shall include, but not be 
limited to, considering the best interests of 
the Company, whether the Executive 
Director has presided over an orderly 
handover, the contribution of the Executive 
Director to the success of the Company 
during their tenure, the need to ensure 
continuity, the need to compromise any 
claims that the Executive Director may have, 
whether the Executive Director received a 
PILON and whether, had the Executive 
Director served out their notice, a greater 
proportion of the outstanding award may 
have vested.
Other
The Company may enter into new 
contractual and financial arrangements with 
a departing Executive Director in connection 
with the cessation of office or employment, 
including (but not limited to) in respect of 
settlement of claims, confidentiality, 
restrictive covenants and/or consultancy 
arrangements, where the Committee 
determines it necessary or appropriate to do 
so. Appropriate disclosure of any such 
arrangement would be made.
Corporate Actions
On a corporate action affecting the 
Company, the rules of the Long Term 
Incentive Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan will 
apply. In summary, on a change of control 
awards will vest, subject to the performance 
conditions and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, time pro-rating. 
Deferred shares awarded under the terms 
of the Deferred Bonus Plan, which represent 
deferrals of previously earned bonus, will 
vest in full. Under the Long Term Incentive 
Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan, the 
Committee may determine that a demerger 
or similar event shall constitute a corporate 
action.
On a variation of share capital or similar 
event, the Committee may make such 
adjustment to awards under the Long Term 
Incentive Plan and the Deferred Bonus Plan 
as the Committee considers appropriate. 37 Annual Report 2014

Incentive plans
“Good leavers” Other leavers
Annual bonus The Company does not consider it appropriate to set defined “good 
leaver” and “bad leaver” conditions in respect of the annual bonus 
arrangements. Instead, where an Executive Director has ceased to hold 
office or employment with the Group, or is under notice, other than due 
to personal misconduct, the Committee will determine whether or not the 
individual will be eligible to receive any annual bonus.
If the Committee determines that a departing Executive Director is eligible 
to receive a bonus, the amount of the bonus will be assessed by reference 
to the performance targets set for that financial year.
The deferral requirement in respect of 25% of the amount of any bonus 
awarded will apply if the Committee so determines.
The amount of any bonus will be pro-rated for time, provided that the 
Committee has discretion to waive time pro-rating.
Where the reason for cessation of office 
or employment is personal misconduct no 
bonus will be payable.
In other cases, unless the Committee 
determines that the departing Executive 
Director is eligible to receive a bonus, no 
bonus will be payable.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan
A departing Executive Director will be a “good leaver” on ceasing 
employment due to retirement, injury, disability, ill-health, death, 
redundancy or the sale of a business or subsidiary out of the Group.
Awards held by “good leavers” will normally vest on the normal vesting 
date (ie the third anniversary of grant) to the extent that the performance 
conditions are met, and be pro-rated for time.
The Committee will have discretion to accelerate vesting to the date of 
cessation. The Committee also will have discretion to waive the time pro- 
rating requirement.
Unvested awards will lapse in full where 
the cessation of office or employment is on 
grounds of personal misconduct.
In other cases, the Committee will have 
discretion to determine that unvested awards 
will vest (in which case the terms applicable 
to “good leavers” will apply). Unless this 
discretion is exercised, unvested awards lapse 
in full.
Deferred Bonus 
Plan
Unvested deferred shares (which represent deferrals of earned bonus) will 
vest in full on the normal vesting date (ie the third anniversary of grant), 
provided that the Committee will have discretion to accelerate vesting to 
the date of cessation.
Where the reason for cessation of office or 
employment is personal misconduct unvested 
deferred shares will lapse in full.
Development of this policy
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee does not consult with employees when determining remuneration policy.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee remains committed to shareholder dialogue and takes an active interest in voting outcomes. The Committee sought the 
views of our major shareholders before submitting this Policy for shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM.
The Committee may, without seeking shareholder approval, make minor changes to this Policy that do not have a material advantage 
to Directors.

Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2015
The current Chairman’s fee is £225,000 per annum which is the same level that applied upon his appointment as Chairman of Coats plc, 
a subsidiary of Coats Group plc. Basic fees were reviewed and maintained at the same level that applied from 1 October 2013; and the 
current basic fee for each Non-Executive Director is £60,000 per annum (although Sir Ron Brierley and Waldemar Szlezak have agreed 
not to receive any fee). The Chair of the Pensions Committee receives an additional fee of £20,000 because of the significant time 
commitment required. An additional fee of £10,000 per annum is paid to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the Audit 
and Risk Committee.
Following the appointment of three Executive Directors on 2 March 2015 the Committee has determined that the following performance 
measures and weightings will apply in respect of the annual bonus arrangements and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan 
(provided that the Committee retains absolute discretion to determine the level of grant of such awards up to the permitted maximum). 
These performance measures and weightings are generally in line with the measures and weightings that are set for other senior 
employees within the Group. Salaries, pensions and benefits will be provided to Executive Directors in accordance with the policy table 
shown above.

Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
Directors’ responsibilities statement
Coats financial information
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to 
prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law the directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Company for that 
period.
In preparing the parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; 
and
• prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting 
policies;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Each of the persons who is a Director at the 
date of approval of this Annual Report 
confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• the Director has taken all the steps that 
he ought to have taken as a director in 
order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge: 
1. the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
2. the Strategic Report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
The Directors’ responsibilities statement was 
approved by order of the Board.
Mike Clasper 
Chairman 
Coats Group plc
18 March 2015  42 Annual Report 2014
Independent auditor’s report to the Members of Coats Group plc
Opinion on financial statements of 
Coats Group plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of 
the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of the group’s profit for 
the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position, the Company Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 
36. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Separate opinion in 
relation to IFRSs as 
issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the group financial statements, in addition to complying with 
its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the group has also 
applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Going concern As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement contained 
within note 1 on page 53 that the group is a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on 
the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is 
not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the 
greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Going Concern and the impact of the 
Pensions Regulator’s investigations
Significant judgement is required by 
management in assessing the going 
concern considerations for the group. 
This includes assessing the impact of the 
Pensions Regulator’s investigations into the 
funding gap of the existing UK defined 
benefit schemes. The Director’s evaluation 
of the business as a going concern is given 
on page 53 and further details of the 
Pension Regulator’s investigation in note 29 
of the financial statements.
We considered the appropriateness of management’s assumptions and estimates 
used in their cash flow model, challenging those assumptions and considering 
supporting forecasts, estimates and sensitivities by examining past performance against 
management’s budgets and external industry data. We considered the appropriateness 
of management’s conclusions over the impact of the Pensions Regulator’s investigations 
through reviewing board minutes, correspondence with the pension trustees and 
meeting with the legal advisers. 43 Annual Report 2014
Material assumptions underlying 
retirement benefit obligations
The net defined benefit liability of Coats 
Group plc is £375 million (2013: £178 
million) which represents an area of 
significant judgement for the financial 
statements, particularly in relation to the 
assumptions adopted such as discount, 
inflation and mortality rates. The key 
assumptions underlying the valuation of 
the pensions schemes are presented in note 
9 of the financial statements. This is also 
identified as a critical judgment in note 1 of 
the financial statements.
We worked with our own actuarial experts to test the assumptions such as discount, 
inflation and mortality rates underlying management’s calculation of the group defined 
benefit schemes. We have compared these assumptions to industry benchmarks and 
prior year rates.
Provisions and litigation
Provisions require significant management 
judgment including assessing the likely 
outcome of litigation, the most significant 
of which is related to the US Environmental 
Protection Agency’s claim in respect 
of the Lower Passaic River Study Area.  
Management have set out their 
considerations in respect of this litigation 
in note 29 of the financial statements, 
concluding that it is not possible to reliably 
estimate the future remediation costs. 
This is also identified as a critical judgment 
in note 1 of the financial statements.
We challenged management’s assumptions including a review of relevant 
correspondence with management’s experts used in determining provisions for 
litigation, environmental and other provisions both in terms of appropriateness of 
recognition and in terms of valuation. We carried out testing on movements in the 
provisions. We considered the legal advice management had obtained in relation to 
litigation and held calls with key legal advisers. We have reviewed the disclosures in the 
financial statements and considered the presentation of the Lower Passaic River Study 
Area litigation as a contingent liability.
Carrying value of intangible assets and 
tangible assets
The group holds £156 million of brands 
(2013: £147 million) and £8 million of 
other intangible assets (2013: £7 million) 
described in note 13 to the financial 
statements. Management is required to 
assess whether the carrying value has been 
impaired where assets have an indefinite 
life or where there are indications of 
impairment. The impairment test requires 
significant management judgement and 
is based on assumptions about future 
profitability, cost of equity and cost of debt. 
This is also identified as a critical judgment 
in note 1 of the financial statements.
We tested management’s assumptions used in the impairment model for tangible 
and intangible assets including cash flow projections, discount rate and sensitivities 
used. We considered the historical accuracy of management’s forecasts, challenged 
the assumptions used in management’s model by comparing to industry data sources, 
reviewing supporting evidence and applying further sensitivities.
Taxation
Due to the nature and complexity of tax 
legislation in the multiple jurisdictions in 
which the group operates, management are 
required to exercise a degree of judgement 
as to the application of corporation tax 
laws and the recoverability of deferred tax 
assets of £10 million (2013: £8 million). The 
tax reconciliation is included in note 8 and 
the deferred tax in notes 17 and 24 of the 
financial statements.
We worked with our tax specialists in key jurisdictions to evaluate the appropriateness 
of judgements and assumptions made by management with respect to their assessment 
and valuation of tax risks, including a review of applicable third party evidence and 
correspondence with tax authorities.
We evaluated management’s forecasts and assessed management’s conclusions on the 
sufficiency and availability of future profits to support the recognition of deferred tax 
assets.
Last year our report included a risk that concerned the appropriate accounting 
for investment disposals. The group’s programme of disposal of investments was 
completed in 2013 and as such this is not considered a significant risk of material 
misstatement in the current year.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues 
considered by the Audit and Risk Committee discussed on page 30.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of 
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on 
individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not 
modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an 
opinion on these individual matters. 44 Annual Report 2014
Independent auditor’s report to the Members of Coats Group plc continued
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that 
makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person 
would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our 
audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be £6.3 million (2013: £6.4 million), which 
is below approximately 1% (2013: 1%) of adjusted net assets, and below 3% (2013: 
2%) of net assets. Adjusted net assets is calculated as net assets of £241.3 million 
adjusted for deemed pension liabilities of £375.0 million. Due to Coats Group plc being 
an investment company during 2014 we considered the adjusted net asset basis as the 
most relevant to the members.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee 
all audit differences in excess of £0.35 million (2013: £0.35 million), as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. We also report to the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we 
identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of 
the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement at the group level. Based on that assessment, we 
scoped our work primarily under two components: Coats Group plc (referred to as the 
parent group entities) and Coats plc. Both components were subject to a mixture of full 
scope audit and audit of specified balances.
Due to the geographically widespread nature of the group there are a number of 
component auditors involved. Our involvement in these component audits is as follows: 
we work with component auditors during the audit planning stage to ensure the 
global audit meets our requirements, we follow a programme of planned site visits 
to meet with components and review local procedures and we perform the audit of 
some significant components (the US companies) within the group audit team. Our 
involvement in the component audit is designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory 
Auditor has sufficient oversight to assess the suitability for inclusion in the group results. 
75% (2013: 70%) of the group’s net assets, 81% (2013: 78%) of the group’s profit 
before tax and 85% (2013: 77%) of the group’s turnover are subject to full scope audit 
or audit of specified account balances.
The components were selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit 
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work 
at the components identified above was executed at levels of materiality which were 
lower than group materiality.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out 
analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks 
of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining 
components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
Opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; 
or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Adequacy of explanations received and 
accounting 
records
Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters. 45 Annual Report 2014
Corporate Governance Statement Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with ten provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the  
Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that 
they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the 
annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit 
and Risk Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that 
we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International 
Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim 
to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our 
quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team 
and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or 
for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the 
parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.

Notes to financial statements
Coats financial information
1. Principal accounting policies
The following are the principal accounting 
policies adopted in preparing the financial 
statements. 
GROUP
Critical accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted by 
the Group are set out in this note to the 
consolidated financial statements. Certain 
of the Group’s accounting policies 
inherently rely on subjective assumptions 
and judgements, such that it is possible over 
time the actual results could differ from the 
estimates based on the assumptions and 
judgements used by the Group. Due to the 
size of the amounts involved, changes in the 
assumptions relating to the following 
policies could potentially have a significant 
impact on the result for the period and/or 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities in 
the consolidated financial statements:
 > Pension and other employee benefit 
obligations
The retirement benefit obligations 
recognised in the statement of financial 
position in respect of defined employee 
benefits are the present values of the 
defined benefit obligations at the year 
end less the fair value of any associated 
assets. Key assumptions involved in the 
determination of the present values of the 
defined benefit obligations include 
discount rates, beneficiary mortality and 
benefits in payment inflation rates. 
Changes in any or all of these 
assumptions could materially change the 
employee benefit obligations recognised 
in the statement of financial position.
A sensitivity analysis relating to the 
Group’s major defined benefit pension 
arrangements is included in note 9.
 > Carrying value of intangible assets and 
tangible assets
The carrying value of intangible assets 
and tangible assets is dependent on the 
calculation of discounted cash flows 
arising from the cash-generating units to 
which those assets relate. Changes in 
either the discount rates applied or the 
estimated cash flows could materially 
change the carrying values of these 
assets.
 > Provisions
In determining the level of provisions held 
at year end the Board takes advice from 
external experts as appropriate. The 
nature of the estimates adopted is such 
that the final liability that crystallises may 
differ from these estimates.
A) Accounting convention and format
The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union, 
which comprise standards and 
interpretations approved by the 
International Accounting Standards Board 
(“IASB”) and International Accounting 
Standards and Standing Interpretations 
Committee interpretations approved by the 
predecessor International Accounting 
Standards Committee that have been 
subsequently authorised by the IASB and 
remain in effect.
The accounting policies set out below have 
been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial 
statements.
B) Basis of preparation
Subsidiaries
The principal subsidiaries are listed in note 
16. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal, as appropriate, or 
the subsidiary meets the criteria to be 
classified as held for sale. The effective date 
is when control passes to or from the Group. 
Control is achieved when the Group has the 
power over the investee and is exposed, or 
has the rights to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to use its power to affect its returns. 
The existence and effect of potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable or 
convertible are considered in determining 
the existence or otherwise of control. Where 
necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to align 
their accounting policies with those used by 
the Group. 
Where subsidiaries are not 100% owned by 
the Group, the share attributable to outside 
shareholders is reflected in non-controlling 
interests. Non-controlling interests are 
identified separately from the Group’s 
equity, and may initially be measured at 
either fair value or at the non-controlling 
interests’ share of the fair value of the 
subsidiary’s identifiable net assets. The 
choice of measurement is made on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Changes in 
the Group’s interests in subsidiaries, that do 
not result in a loss of control, are accounted 
for as equity transactions. Where control is 
lost, a gain or loss on disposal is recognised 
through the consolidated income 
statement, calculated as the difference 
between the fair value of consideration 
received (plus the fair value of any retained 
interest) and the Group’s previous share of 
the former subsidiary’s net assets. Amounts 
previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in relation to that 
subsidiary are reclassified and recognised 
through the income statement as part of 
the gain or loss on disposal.
These financial statements incorporate the 
consolidated results of Coats Group Limited 
(“CGL”) as adjusted to account for the Coats 
capital incentive plan (“CIP”), on a basis 
consistent with that required to be adopted 
by GPG.
Joint Ventures
Joint ventures are entities in which the 
Group has joint control, shared with a party 
outside the Group. The Group reports its 
interests in joint ventures using the equity 
method.
Going concern
Giving due consideration to the nature of 
the Group’s business and underlying 
investments, taking account of the 
following matters: the ability of the Group 
to realise its liquid investments and to 
manage the timing of such liquidations; 
the Group’s foreign currency exposures; the 
potential requirement to provide financial 
support to the Group’s UK pension 
schemes; the appropriate capital structure 
to be adopted by the Group in the future; 
and the factors which will determine further 
returns of surplus cash to shareholders; and 
also taking into consideration the cash flow 
forecasts prepared by the Group and the 
sensitivity analysis associated therewith, the 
directors consider that the Company and 
the Group are going concerns and these 
financial statements are prepared on that 
basis. Further detail is contained in the 
corporate governance section on page 28. 54 Annual Report 2014
Financial statements
Notes to financial statements continued
C) Foreign currencies
Foreign currency translation
The Company’s functional and the Group’s 
presentation currency is the Pound Sterling. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the rates of exchange ruling at 
the period end. All currency differences on 
monetary items are taken to the 
consolidated income statement with the 
exception of differences on receivables and 
payables that represent a net investment in 
a foreign operation, which are taken directly 
to equity until disposal of the net 
investment, at which time they are recycled 
through the consolidated income 
statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rate as at 
the date of initial transaction.
Group companies
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose 
presentation currency is not the Pound 
Sterling are translated into the Group’s 
presentation currency at the rates of 
exchange ruling at the period end and their 
income statements are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the year. The 
exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation since 1 January 2004 are taken 
to a separate component of equity. On 
disposal of such an entity, the deferred 
cumulative amount recognised in equity 
since 1 January 2004 relating to that 
particular operation is recycled through 
the consolidated income statement. 
Translation differences that arose before the 
date of transition to IFRS in respect of all 
such entities are not presented as a separate 
component of equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on acquisition of such operations are 
regarded as assets and liabilities of the 
particular operation, expressed in the 
currency of the operation and recorded at 
the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction and subsequently retranslated at 
the applicable closing rates.
D) Segment reporting
Operating segments are the components of 
the Group about which separate financial 
information is available that is evaluated 
regularly by the Company’s directors in 
deciding how to allocate resources and in 
assessing performance. The information 
presented within the operating segment 
analysis is reported on the same basis as 
that used internally by the Company’s 
directors in evaluating operating segment 
performance.
E) Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are 
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any accumulated impairments.
Leased assets
Leases where the lessor retains substantially 
all the risks and benefits of ownership of 
the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as 
an expense in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Subsequent expenditure
Expenditure incurred to replace a 
component of an item of property, plant 
and equipment that is accounted for 
separately, including major inspection and 
overhaul expenditure, is capitalised. Other 
subsequent expenditure is capitalised only 
when it increases the future economic 
benefits embodied in the item of property, 
plant and equipment. All other expenditure 
is recognised in the income statement as an 
expense as incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of property, plant and 
equipment, and major components that are 
accounted for separately. Land is not 
depreciated. The estimated useful lives are 
as follows:
Freehold buildings –  50 years to  
100 years
Leasehold buildings –  10 years to 
50 years or over 
the term of the 
lease if shorter
Plant and equipment –  3 years to  
20 years
Vehicles and office  
equipment –  2 years to  
10 years
Assets’ residual values and useful lives are 
reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at 
each period end.
F) Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents 
the excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a 
subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and 
reviewed for impairment at least annually. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately 
in the income statement. On disposal of a 
subsidiary, the attributable amount of 
goodwill is included in the determination of 
the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating 
units (“CGUs”) for the purpose of 
impairment testing. CGUs represent the 
Group’s investment in each of its business 
segments.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 
1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the 
basis of its deemed cost, which represents 
the amount recorded previously under UK 
GAAP. 
Negative goodwill is recognised immediately 
in the income statement.
Brands
Brands with finite useful lives are carried at 
cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight-line method over their useful lives 
of up to 10 years. Brands with indefinite 
useful lives are carried at cost less any 
accumulated impairment charges.
Other intangibles
Acquired computer software licences 
and computer software development costs 
are capitalised on the basis of the costs 
incurred to acquire and bring to use the 
specific software and are amortised over 
their estimated useful lives of up to 5 years.
Intellectual property, comprising 
trademarks, designs, patents and product 
development which have a finite useful life, 
are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment charges. 
Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight-line method to allocate the cost 
over the assets’ useful lives, which vary from 
5 to 10 years.
Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life 
are not subject to amortisation and are 
tested annually for impairment. Assets 
that are subject to amortisation are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. 
An impairment charge is recognised for the 
amount by which the asset’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows have not  55 Annual Report 2014
Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Coats financial information
been adjusted. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are measured 
at the CGU level.
Research and Development
All research costs are expensed as 
incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset 
arising from development is recognised only 
if all of the following conditions are met:
 > An asset is created that can be separately 
identified;
 > It is probable that the asset created will 
generate future economic benefits; 
and
 > The development costs can be measured 
reliably.
Internally-generated intangible assets are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful lives.
Where no internally-generated intangible 
asset can be recognised, development 
expenditure is recognised as an expense in 
the period in which it is incurred.
G) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
recognised when the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the 
relevant financial instrument.
Financial assets
(i) Investments
Investments are recognised and 
derecognised on a trade date basis and are 
initially measured at fair value, plus directly 
attributable transaction costs for fixed asset 
investments. Investments are classified as 
either current assets (held-for-trading) or 
fixed assets (available-for-sale), dependent 
upon the Group’s intention at the time of 
purchase, and are measured at subsequent 
reporting dates at fair value. Gains and 
losses arising from changes in fair value of 
current asset investments are included in 
the income statement for the period. For 
fixed asset investments, gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised directly in equity, until the 
security is disposed of or is deemed to be 
impaired, at which time the cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in equity is 
included in the income  statement for the 
period. Impairment charges recognised for 
equity investments classified as fixed asset 
investments are not subsequently reversed 
through the income statement until such 
time as the equity investment is disposed of.
Net gains and losses recognised in profit or 
loss on disposal of investments do not 
incorporate dividends or interest receivable 
on those assets.
Listed investments held as part of the 
Group’s investment portfolio are stated at 
market value.
Unlisted investments are stated at fair value 
based on directors’ valuation, which is 
supported by external experts’ advice or 
other external evidence.
(ii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the 
statement of financial position comprise 
cash at bank and in hand and short-term 
deposits. For the purposes of the 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts.
(iii) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried 
at original invoice amount less an allowance 
for any uncollectable amounts. An estimate 
for doubtful debts is made when collection 
of the full amount is no longer probable. 
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Financial liabilities
(i) Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and 
are stated at nominal value.
(ii) Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are 
initially measured at fair value, net of 
direct issue costs. These financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, with interest expense 
recognised over the period of the 
relevant liabilities.
(iii) Compound instruments
The component parts of compound 
instruments are classified separately as 
financial liabilities and equity in accordance 
with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement. At the date of issue, the fair 
value of the liability component is estimated 
using the prevailing market interest rate for 
a similar non-convertible instrument, and 
this amount is recorded as a liability at 
amortised cost. The equity component is 
the fair value of the compound instrument 
as a whole less the amount of the liability 
component, and is recognised in equity, net 
of income tax effect, without subsequent 
remeasurement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial 
instruments or other host contracts are 
treated as separate derivatives when 
their risks and characteristics are not 
closely related to those of the host 
contracts, and the host contracts are not 
measured at fair value with changes in 
fair value being recognised in the income 
statement.
(iv)  Derivative financial instruments 
and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the 
financial risks of changes in foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates.
The use of financial derivatives is 
regulated by the Board or that of the 
relevant operating subsidiary in 
accordance with their respective risk 
management strategies. Changes in 
values of all derivatives of a financing 
nature are included within investment 
income and finance costs in the income 
statement.
Derivative financial instruments are 
initially measured at fair value at contract 
date and are remeasured at each 
reporting date.
The Group designates hedging instruments 
as either fair value hedges, cash flow 
hedges or hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations. Hedges of currency risk 
on fixed commitments are accounted for as 
cash flow hedges.
At the inception of each hedge 
transaction the issuing entity documents 
the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item and the 
anticipated effectiveness of the hedge 
transaction, and monitors the ongoing 
effectiveness over the period of the 
hedge. Hedge accounting is discontinued 
when the issuing entity revokes the 
hedging relationship, the hedge 
instrument expires, is sold, exercised or 
otherwise terminated, and the adjustment 
to the carrying amount of the hedged 
item arising from the hedged risk is 
amortised through the income statement 
from that date.
(v) Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair values of derivatives that 
are designated and qualify as fair value 
hedges are recognised immediately through 
the income statement, together with any 
changes in the fair value of the related 
hedged items due to changes in the hedged 
risks. On discontinuation of the hedge the 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the 
hedged item arising from the hedged risk is 
amortised through the consolidated income 
statement from that date. 56 Annual Report 2014
Financial statements
Notes to financial statements continued
(vi) Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the 
fair value of derivatives that are 
designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges is deferred in equity. Once the 
related hedged item is recognised in the 
income statement, the amounts deferred 
in equity are recycled through the 
consolidated income statement. The gain 
or loss arising from any ineffective portion 
of the hedge is recognised immediately 
through the consolidated income 
statement.
(vii)  Hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations
Gains and losses on hedging instruments 
relating to the effective portion of such 
hedges are recognised through the 
translation reserve, and recycled through 
the consolidated income statement on 
disposal of the respective foreign 
operations. The gain or loss arising from any 
ineffective portion of such hedges is 
recognised immediately through the 
consolidated income statement.
H) Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale 
of goods and services, net of sales tax and 
discounts, and after eliminating sales within 
the Group. Revenue is recognised as 
follows:
(i) Sales of goods
Sales of goods are recognised in revenue 
when the associated risks and rewards of 
ownership of the goods have been 
transferred to the buyer.
(ii)  Sales of services
Sales of services are recognised in the 
period in which the services are rendered, 
by reference to the stage of completion of 
those services at the period end. 
(iii)  Income from sales of property
Income from sales of property is recognised 
on completion when legal title of the 
property passes to the buyer.
(iv)  Investment revenue
Investment revenue comprises proceeds 
receivable from the sale (trade date) of 
current asset investments during the 
year.
I) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Costs incurred in 
bringing each product to its present 
location and condition are accounted for as 
follows:
Raw materials are valued at cost on a 
first-in, first-out basis.
The costs of finished goods and work in 
progress include direct materials and labour 
and a proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal operating 
capacity but excluding borrowing costs. Net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price 
in the ordinary course of business, less 
estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. 
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving 
and defective inventories.
Land for resale, which is included in 
development work in progress, is valued at 
the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost includes capitalised interest and those 
costs necessary to prepare the land for sale.
J) Employee benefits
(i) Retirement and other post-
employment obligations
For retirement and other post-employment 
benefit obligations, the cost of providing 
benefits is determined using the Projected 
Unit Credit Method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at the end of 
each reporting period by independent 
actuaries. Remeasurement comprising 
actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the 
asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on 
scheme assets (excluding interest) are 
recognised immediately in the consolidated 
statement of financial position with a 
charge or credit to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the 
period in which they occur. Remeasurement 
recorded in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income is not recycled. Past 
service cost is recognised in profit or loss in 
the period of scheme amendment. Net 
interest is calculated by applying a discount 
rate to the net defined benefit liability or 
asset. Defined benefit costs are split into 
three categories:
–  current service cost, past-service cost and 
gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements;
– net interest expense or income; and
– actuarial gains and losses.
The Group presents current and past service 
costs within cost of sales and administrative 
expenses in its consolidated income 
statement. Curtailments gains and losses 
are accounted for as past-service cost.
Net interest expense or income is 
recognised within finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in 
the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
In addition, pension scheme administrative 
expenses including the PPF (Pension 
Protection Fund) levy and actuary, audit, 
legal and trustee charges are recognised as 
administrative expenses.
The retirement benefit and other post-
employment benefit obligation recognised 
in the consolidated statement of financial 
position represents the deficit or surplus in 
the Group’s defined benefit schemes. Any 
surplus resulting from this calculation is 
limited to the present value of any economic 
benefits available in the form of refunds 
from the schemes or reductions in future 
contributions to the schemes.
For defined contribution plans, the Group 
pays contributions to publicly or privately 
administered pension plans on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. The 
contributions are recognised as employee 
benefit expenses when they are due. 
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an 
asset to the extent that a cash refund or a 
reduction in the future payments is 
available.
(ii) Share-based compensation
Cash-settled
The Group operates a cash-settled share-
based compensation plan for the benefit of 
certain employees of Coats plc. Cash-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair 
value (excluding the effect of non market-
based vesting conditions) at each reporting 
date. The fair value is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
Equity-settled
The Group operates equity-settled 
compensation plans for the granting of 
non-transferable options to employees. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value (excluding the effect 
of non market-based vesting conditions) at 
the date of grant. The fair value determined 
at the grant dates of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
based on the Group’s estimate of the shares 
that will eventually vest and adjusted for the 
effect of non market-based vesting 
conditions, with a corresponding increase in 
equity. For shares granted to employees, the 
fair value of the shares is measured at the 
market price of the shares, adjusted to take 
into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the shares were granted. The fair 
value of share options is measured using an 
adjusted version of the Black-Scholes pricing 
model to reflect the terms and conditions of 
the options granted, based on 
management’s best estimate of the effects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations. 57 Annual Report 2014
Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Coats financial information
(iii)  Non-share-based long term 
incentive schemes
The anticipated present value cost of 
non-share-based incentive schemes is 
charged to the consolidated income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the 
period the benefit is earned, based on 
remuneration rates that are expected to be 
payable.
(iv) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when 
employment is terminated before the 
normal retirement date, or whenever an 
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in 
exchange for these benefits. The Group 
recognises termination benefits when it is 
demonstrably committed to either: 
terminating the employment of current 
employees according to a detailed formal 
plan without possibility of withdrawal; or 
providing termination benefits as a result of 
an offer made to encourage voluntary 
redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 
12 months after the period end are 
discounted to present value.
K) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the 
tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on 
taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from net profit as reported in the 
consolidated income statement because it 
excludes items of income and expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years and 
it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the period end.
Deferred tax is provided using the liability 
method, providing for temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes. Deferred taxation is 
measured on a non-discounted basis. The 
following temporary differences are not 
provided for: goodwill not deducted for tax 
purposes, the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor 
taxable profit and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent 
that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of 
realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the period end. A deferred tax asset is 
recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the 
related tax benefit will be realised. 
Additional income taxes that arise from the 
distribution of dividends are recognised at 
the same time as the liability to pay the 
related dividend. 
The carrying values of deferred tax assets 
are reviewed at each period end.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to 
items charged or credited directly to equity 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in equity.
L) Investment income
Income from equity investments is 
recognised when the legal entitlement 
vests. Dividends from UK companies are 
presented net of the attributable tax credit. 
Dividends received from overseas 
companies include any withholding taxes, 
but exclude any underlying tax paid by the 
investee company on its own profit. Special 
dividends arising from the Group’s 
investments are included as income in the 
income statement and, where appropriate, 
an impairment provision is recognised 
against the investment.
M) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of 
qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time 
to prepare for their intended use or sale, are 
added to the cost of those assets, until such 
time as the assets are substantially ready for 
their intended use or sale. Investment 
income earned on the temporary 
investment of specific borrowings pending 
their expenditure on qualifying assets is 
deducted from the borrowing costs eligible 
for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs, except where 
otherwise stated, are recognised in the 
income statement in the period in which 
they are incurred.
N) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of financial position when the 
Group has a legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation. If the 
effect is material, a provision is determined 
by discounting the expected future cash 
flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of 
money and, where appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability. Where discounting is 
used, the increase in the provision due to 
the passage of time is recognised as a 
borrowing cost.
O) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is 
recognised when the expected benefits to 
be derived by the Group from a contract are 
lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting 
its obligations under the contract.
P) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised 
when the Group has approved a detailed 
and formal restructuring plan, and the 
restructuring has either commenced or has 
been announced publicly. Future operating 
costs are not provided for.
Q )  A s s e t s held for sale and 
discontinued operations
Non-current assets and businesses which 
are to be sold (“disposal groups”) classified 
as held for sale are measured at the lower 
of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell.
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are 
classified as held for sale if their carrying 
amount is expected to be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is 
regarded as met only when such a sale is 
highly probable and the asset (or disposal 
group) is available for immediate sale in its 
present condition. Management must be 
committed to the sale, which should be 
expected to qualify for recognition as a 
completed sale within one year from the 
date of classification.
Non-current assets are classified as held for 
sale from the date these conditions are met, 
and such assets are no longer depreciated.
Discontinued operations are classified as 
held for sale and are either a separate 
business segment or a geographical area of 
operations that is part of a single 
coordinated plan to sell. Once an operation 
has been identified as discontinued, or is 
reclassified as discontinued, the comparative 
information in the Income Statement is 
restated.
R) Cash flow
In accordance with the Directors’ views, the 
consolidated statement of cash flows 
reflects cash flows arising in the normal 
course of the Parent Group’s investment 
business as part of operating cash flows. 
The proceeds of sale of Parent Group 
operating subsidiary and associated 
undertakings and joint ventures are 
included within acquisitions and disposals 
within cash flows from investing activities.  58 Annual Report 2014
Financial statements
Notes to financial statements continued
Acquisitions and disposals of fixed asset 
investments, associated undertakings and 
joint ventures, together with dividends 
received from associated undertakings and 
joint ventures, in respect of the Group’s 
operating subsidiaries, remain within cash 
flows from investing activities, as these are 
strategic investments by those subsidiaries 
rather than being held for investment 
gains. 
New IFRS accounting standards and 
interpretations adopted in the year
During the year, the Group has adopted the 
following standards and interpretations:
Amendments to IAS 36 (“Recoverable 
amount disclosures for non-financial 
assets”);
Amendments to IAS 39 (“Novation of 
derivatives and Continuation of hedge 
accounting”); and
Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 
10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27).
The adoption of these standards and 
interpretations has had no significant 
impact on these consolidated financial 
statements.
New IFRS accounting standards and 
interpretations not yet adopted
The following published standards and 
amendments to existing standards, which 
have not yet all been endorsed by the EU, 
are expected to be effective as follows:
From the year beginning 1 January 2016:
IFRS 14 (“Regulatory Deferral Accounts”);
Amendments to IAS 1 (“Disclosure 
Initiative”);
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 
(“Clarification of Acceptable Methods of 
Depreciation and Amortisation”);
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 
(“Investment Entities: Applying the 
Consolidation Exception”);
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (“Sale 
or Contribution of Assets between an 
Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture”); 
and
Amendments to IFRS 11 (“Accounting for 
Acquisitions of Interests in Joint 
Operations”).
From the year beginning 1 January 2017:
IFRS 15 (“Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers”).
From the year beginning 1 January 2018:
IFRS 9 (“Financial instruments”).
The directors do not expect that the 
adoption of the Standards and 
Interpretations listed above will have a 
material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group in future periods, except that 
IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement 
and disclosure of financial instruments.
Company
The financial statements comply with 
applicable UK law and accounting 
standards, modified where appropriate to 
present a true and fair view, and have been 
prepared under the historical cost 
convention.
A) Fixed assets – investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are 
reflected at cost less provisions for any 
impairment.
B) Investment income
Income from equity investments is 
recognised when the legal entitlement 
vests. Dividends from UK companies are 
presented net of the attributable tax credit. 
Dividends received from overseas 
companies include any withholding taxes, 
but exclude any underlying tax paid by the 
investee company on its own profit. Special 
dividends arising from the Company’s 
investments are included as income in the 
profit and loss account and, where 
appropriate, an impairment provision is 
recognised against the investment.
C) Share-based compensation
Cash-settled
The Company operates a cash-settled 
share-based compensation plan for the 
benefit of certain employees of Coats plc. 
Cash-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value (excluding the effect 
of non market-based vesting conditions) at 
each reporting date. The fair value is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, with a corresponding 
increase in liabilities.
Equity-settled
The Company operates an equity-settled 
compensation plan for the granting of 
non-transferable options to directors and 
other employees. For share options granted, 
the fair value of the shares is measured at 
the market price of the Company’s shares, 
adjusted to take into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the share options 
were granted, using an adjusted version of 
the Black-Scholes model, based on 
management’s best estimate of the effects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations. The charge 
to the profit and loss account has no impact 
on net assets since the credit is reflected in 
equity.
D) Taxation
Provision is made for taxation assessable on 
the profit or loss for the year as adjusted for 
disallowable and non-taxable items. 
Deferred taxation is provided in full in 
respect of timing differences which have 
arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date, except that deferred tax assets 
(including those attributable to tax losses 
carried forward) are only recognised if it is 
considered more likely than not that they 
will be recovered. Deferred taxation is 
measured on a non-discounted basis.
E) Dividends payable
Dividends proposed are recognised in the 
period in which they are formally approved 
for payment. 59 Annual Report 2014

(b) Defined contribution schemes

(c) Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates three significant defined benefit schemes in the UK, namely the Brunel Holdings Pension Scheme (“Brunel”), the 
Staveley Industries Retirement Benefits Scheme (“Staveley”) and the Coats Pension Plan (“Coats UK”) which offer both pensions in 
retirement and death benefits to members. In addition, Coats operates the Coats North America Pension Plan (“Coats US”) in the US as 
well as various pension and other post-retirement arrangements around the globe (most significantly in Germany). The assets of the 
Brunel, Staveley, Coats UK and Coats US plans are held under self-administered trust funds and hence are separate from the Group’s 
assets. 65 Annual Report 2014
Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Coats financial information
9. Employee benefit costs continued
The following disclosures do not include information in respect of schemes operated by joint ventures.
The Group is exposed to actuarial risks including:
Interest rate risk – the present value of the defined benefit plan liabilities is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to 
high quality corporate bond yields. A decrease in bond yield rates will increase defined benefit obligations; 
Longevity risk – the present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of member life 
expectancies. An increase in life expectancy will increase liabilities; 
Inflation risk – the present value of the defined benefit liabilities are calculated by reference to assumed future inflation rates. An increase 
in inflation rates will increase defined benefit obligations; and
Salary risk – certain of the Group’s employee benefits are linked to salary and, hence, a faster than assumed increase in salaries may 
adversely impact on defined benefit liabilities. However, this is not a significant risk to the Group.
Pension costs in respect of these plans are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries. 
The information provided below for defined benefit plans has been prepared by independent qualified actuaries based on the most 
recent actuarial valuations of the schemes, updated to take account of the valuations of assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2014. 
For the principal schemes, the date of the most recent actuarial valuations were 1 April 2012 for the Coats UK scheme, 31 December 
2014 for the Coats US scheme, 5 April 2011 for the Staveley scheme and 31 March 2010 for the Brunel scheme.

During the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group offered certain pensioners within the Coats UK scheme the opportunity to uplift 
their pension with effect from March 2014, in return for giving up rights to annual inflationary increases. The level of pensioner 
acceptance resulted in a past service credit of £4 million for the year ended 31 December 2013, net of costs, reflecting the reduction in 
liabilities which had arisen.
The actual return on scheme assets was £117 million (2013: £145 million) for the Coats UK scheme, £16 million (2013: £3 million) for the 
Coats US scheme, £2 million (2013: £2 million) for the other Coats schemes, £5 million (2013: £16 million) for the Staveley scheme and

Included in the tables above are UK equity instruments of £55 million (2013: £60 million), corporate bonds of £140 million (2013:  
£128 million), government/sovereign instruments of £29 million (2013: £25 million), derivative liabilities of £20 million (2013: £1 million 
asset), insurance contracts of £7 million (2013: £4 million) and other assets of £3 million (2013: £6 million) without a quoted price in an 
active market. All other assets have a quoted price in an active market.
For the UK funded schemes the investment policy is centred around establishing for each scheme a cash flow-matching portfolio (“CFM”) 
and a separate return-seeking asset portfolio (“RSA”). The aim of the proposed investment policy is for the CFM to match a pre-
determined number of years’ liability cash flows, with additional return being targeted via the RSA portfolio, so that the schemes have a 
high probability of being able to move to a fully matched position at some point in the future. 69 Annual Report 2014
Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Coats financial information
9. Employee benefit costs continued
The CFM is targeted to be low risk relative to meeting the agreed number of years’ cash flows and the focus of the schemes’ investment 
risk will be in respect of the RSA portfolio. The Coats UK scheme also holds inflation swap contracts to provide hedging against 
movements in inflation. Market implied inflation inside the CFM period is monitored against an agreed set of inflation triggers with the 
intention of implementing further inflation hedging should these triggers be breached.
The US scheme is fully funded and has a significant proportion of fixed income investments. The fixed income is invested directly to 
protect the funded status of the scheme. Trustees work with investment managers to consider the liabilities (including key period 
durations, credit spread duration and convexity) and have created a custom fixed income benchmark to match the liabilities and protect 
the funded status.
The recoverable surplus on the US scheme has been recognised in line with the benefit from contribution holidays, plus annual refunds 
expected from the scheme to fund the US post-retirement medical scheme in accordance with relevant US legislation.
The Coats UK and US schemes as well as the Staveley and Brunel schemes are funded arrangements. Of the other schemes’ actuarial 
liabilities as at 31 December 2014, £82 million (2013: £72 million) related to wholly unfunded arrangements.

Sensitivities regarding the discount rate, inflation (which also impacts the rate of increases in salaries and rate of increase for pension in 
payments assumptions for the UK scheme) and mortality assumptions used to measure the liabilities of the principal schemes, along with 
the impact they would have on the scheme liabilities, are set out below. Interrelationships between assumptions might exist and the 
analysis below does not take the effect of these interrelationships into account:

If members of the Coats UK scheme live one year longer the scheme liabilities will increase by £58 million (2013: £53 million). If members 
of the Coats US scheme live one year longer scheme liabilities will increase by £3 million (2013: £2 million), however there would be no 
overall impact on the recoverable surplus. If members of the Staveley and Brunel schemes live one year longer scheme liabilities will 
increase by £11 million (2013: £11 million) and £8 million (2013: £7 million) respectively.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected 
unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation 
liability recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in 
preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years. 71 Annual Report 2014

The triennial valuation of the Coats UK pension plan as at April 2012 showed an actuarial deficit of £215 million, which equated to a 
funding level of 87%. A fourteen year recovery plan has been agreed with the trustee, under which contributions of £16 million per 
annum are payable from November 2013 (of which £2 million per annum relates to future service). This recovery plan will be reviewed at 
the next triennial valuation as at April 2015. A triennial valuation for Staveley was undertaken as at April 2011 and was finalised during 
2012, resulting in an actuarial funding deficit of £20 million, which equated to a funding level of 90%. A recovery plan was agreed, 
comprised of an initial payment of £5 million followed by monthly payments commencing from July 2012 amounting to £1.3 million per 
annum for eight years. The trustee of the Staveley scheme has called for a funding valuation with an effective date of 31 December 2013. 
The last triennial valuation of the Brunel scheme, as at April 2010, was completed in 2011. This did not result in a requirement to make 
contributions. The triennial valuations for both Staveley and Brunel are on-going and have been delayed by tPR’s investigations. The total 
estimated amount to be paid in respect of all of the Group’s retirement and other post-employment benefit arrangements during the 
2015 financial year is £23 million.
The weighted average duration of benefit obligations is 15 years (2013: 14 years) for the Coats UK scheme and 9 years (2013: 8 years) for 
the Coats US scheme, 13 years (2013: 13 years) for the Staveley scheme and 12 years (2013: 12 years) for the Brunel scheme.
10. Earnings/(loss) per Ordinary Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) from continuing and discontinued operations is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity 
holders of the parent company of £9 million (2013: £23 million) by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the 
year of 1,407,431,333 (2013: 1,433,827,035).
Basic earnings/(loss) per share from continuing operations is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity holders of the 
parent company of £9 million (2013: loss £23 million) by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year of 
1,407,431,333 (2013: 1,433,827,035).
For the calculation of diluted EPS, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential Ordinary Shares, being share options granted to employees. There are no differences between the calculated basic 
earnings/loss per share and the diluted earnings/loss per share for either year.

 The carrying value of brands at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 related to Coats. There is no foreseeable limit to the net cash 
inflows from royalties, which are generated from continued sales of thread resulting from the Coats brands, and those brands are 
therefore assessed as having indefinite useful lives. The recoverable amount of these brands has been estimated using the value in use 
and is re-assessed annually by reference to the discounted cash flow arising from the royalties generated by those brands. The valuation 
has been based on management’s recent budgets and forecasts covering the period to 31 December 2015, applying a pre-tax weighted 
average cost of capital of the relevant business unit and a terminal value including no growth. The pre-tax weighted average cost of 
capital applied above is 10%. An increase in the weighted average cost of capital to 20% would reduce the value in use of these brands 
to book value. 73 Annual Report 2014

At the year end, the Group had approximately £2.0 billion (2013: £1.9 billion) of unused tax losses available for offset against future 
profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £183 million (2013: £164 million) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has 
been recognised in respect of the remaining losses due to lack of certainty regarding the availability of future taxable income. Such losses 
are only recognised in the financial statements to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that sufficient future taxable profits 
will be available for offset.
At the period end, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £Nil (2013: £Nil).  81 Annual Report 2014

29 .  Con ti n g e n t liabilities
Coats’ borrowings at the year end include £262 million (2013: £225 million) secured by guarantees issued by Coats plc and certain of its 
principal subsidiaries.
The Group has guaranteed the banking facilities of Australian Country Spinners Ltd, on a joint and several basis with the other 
shareholder. The Group’s liability under that guarantee, which is limited to 50% of those facilities, amounts to A$3 million (2013: 
A$3 million).
Guarantees
The Group has guaranteed certain amounts that may become payable in respect of a former subsidiary in Australia. At 31 December 
2014, the Group’s liability under these guarantees amounted to A$1.7 million (2013: A$1.7 million). At the time of the sale of that former 
subsidiary, in 2013 the Group was paid A$1.2 million by the former subsidiary in support of any potential claims against the guarantee. 
The Group holds that A$1.2 million in an interest-bearing bank account on trust for the former subsidiary. On expiry of these guarantees 
any unutilised balance from the A$1.2 million bank balance, together with any interest received on that account, will be repaid to the 
former subsidiary. This liability is fully accrued in these financial statements.
Environmental contingent liabilities
As noted in previous reports, the US Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”) has notified Coats & Clark, Inc. (“CC”) that it is a 
“potentially responsible party” under the US Superfund law for investigation and remediation costs at the Lower Passaic River Study Area 
(“LPRSA”) in New Jersey in respect of an alleged predecessor’s former facilities which operated in that area prior to 1950. Approximately 
70 companies to date have formed a cooperating parties group (“CPG”) to fund and conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility 
study (“RI/FS”) of the area. CC joined the CPG in 2011. The total costs of the RI/FS and related expenditures are currently estimated by the 
CPG to be approximately $136 million.
Under the interim allocation in place when CC joined the CPG, CC was responsible for approximately 1.7% of the total RI/FS and related 
CPG costs. During 2012, three companies that had shared a common allocation within the CPG – Tierra Solutions, Inc, Maxus Energy 
Corporation and Occidental Chemical Corporation (collectively ‘TMO’) – withdrew from the CPG. TMO is not currently funding the RI/FS, 
and CC’s interim allocation of future RI/FS and related CPG costs is now approximately 2%. The interim allocation is expressly limited to 
the RI/FS and other authorised expenditures; it does not relate to the ultimate LPR remediation and is subject to reallocation after the RI/
FS has been issued. CC believes that there are many parties that will participate in its remediation that are not currently funding the study 
of the river, including those that are the most responsible for its current contamination, which will reduce CC’s allocation.
In April 2014, the EPA released a Focused Feasibility Study (‘FFS’) for the lower 8 miles of the LPRSA. The FFS analyses a series of remedial 
alternatives and the EPA has estimated the cost of its preferred remedy at approximately $1.7 billion on a net present value basis. The 
CPG has submitted extensive comments opposing the FFS during the comment period. The EPA is required to review and respond to all 
substantive comments submitted by both the CPG and other parties. The EPA is not currently expected to issue a Record of Decision 
(‘ROD’) selecting a remedy until the end of H2 2015.
It is not yet known which, if any, of the proposed FFS remedies EPA will select, and there are a number of uncertainties that could have a 
material effect on the scope and cost of EPA’s preferred remedy including:
 – The development by the CPG of a Sustainable Remedy proposal that combines targeted dredging of the most contaminated sediment 
with other pollution control and risk management policies, at a lower cost than EPA’s preferred remedy;
 – The RI/FS is currently expected to be submitted to EPA in H1 2015, before the expected selection of an FFS remedy for the lower  
8 miles, and it is possible that EPA will combine the RI/FS and the FFS to select a single remedy for the entire LPRSA;
 – The EPA has specifically requested comment on several aspects of its preferred FFS remedy that could materially affect the scope and 
estimated cost of the remedy.
Once the RI/FS has been submitted to the EPA and the EPA has issued a ROD for the FFS and/or the RI/FS, it is expected to begin 
negotiations with PRPs to implement the selected remedy. These negotiations are likely to involve parties that are not currently in the 
CPG, including TMO and other PRPs who have previously been identified by EPA. While the cost of the remedial design and the FFS and/
or RI/FS remedy are expected to be shared among hundreds of parties, the allocation of such costs among these parties is not yet known. 
The interim CPG allocation does not apply to remedial actions, and non-CPG members not included in the interim allocation are expected 
to participate in the funding of the remedy.
During 2012, the members of the CPG, including CC, agreed to fund the remediation of one part of the LPRSA (River Mile 10.9).  
CC’s interim allocation of the cost of this is estimated at approximately $0.6 million, which was provided. 85 Annual Report 2014
Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Coats financial information
29 .  Con ti n g e n t liabilities continued
Coats believes that CC’s predecessors did not generate any of the contaminants which are driving the current and anticipated remedial 
actions in the LPRSA, that it has valid legal defences which are based on its own analysis of the relevant facts, and that additional parties 
not currently in the CPG will be responsible for a significant share of the ultimate costs of remediation. Therefore, while the foregoing 
factors could reduce CC’s relative allocation of remedial costs, the Company cannot predict what CC’s share of any such costs would be 
in light of the significant uncertainties surrounding the selection and cost of EPA’s FFS remedy, the number of parties who will participate 
in the remediation and the relative allocation of costs among such parties. The Company believes, in light of the significant uncertainties 
at this stage in the process, that it is not possible to reliably estimate future remediation costs nor CC’s share of those costs. Accordingly, 
no provision has been made for such costs at the present time.
Pensions
As described on pages 3 and 4 in the Chairman’s Statement, the Group is dealing with investigations by tPR into its three UK defined 
benefit pension schemes. The outcome of these investigations remains uncertain, but may result in changes to the current deficit recovery 
plans for these schemes.
30 .  C a pi t a l commitments
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had commitments of £2 million in respect of contracts placed for future capital expenditure  
(2013: £1 million).

34. Post balance sheet event
On 19 February 2015 Coats agreed to sell its EMEA Crafts business for a consideration of US$10 million (£6 million at 2014 year end rate) 
payable in cash on completion subject to customary adjustments. The sale is conditional upon, inter alia, a limited number of conditions 
usual for this type of transaction and is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2015. The UK Crafts business will remain within 
Coats.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, EMEA Crafts (excluding UK) generated external sales of £76 million and an operating loss of  
£17 million, which includes a property, plant and equipment and intangible assets exceptional impairment charge of £11 million. As at  
31 December 2014, after impairment, the business had net tangible assets of £23 million, including cash retained within the business as 
part of the sale. Given the total consideration for the business of US$10 million (£6 million at 2014 year end rate) and its net tangible 
asset position of £23 million at 2014 year end, and taking into account completion adjustments and disposal-related costs, a substantial 
loss on disposal is expected to be recognised on completion of the transaction. The precise quantum will be finalised on completion and 
will in addition include historical foreign exchange translation gains and losses previously recognised in equity.
The results of the EMEA Crafts business (excluding UK) together with the loss on disposal will be presented as a discontinued operation 
when the Group reports its 2015 half year results.

Market values have been used as proxies for the fair value of all listed investments. Unlisted investments are stated at fair value. For 
floating rate financial assets and liabilities, and for fixed rate financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than twelve months, it 
has been assumed that fair values are approximately the same as book values. Fair values for forward foreign currency contracts have 
been estimated using applicable forward exchange rates at the year end. All other fair values have been calculated by discounting 
expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS RECOGNISED IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
The following tables provide an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped 
into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
•  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques which include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
observable market data (unobservable inputs). 91 Annual Report 2014

Level 1 financial instruments are valued based on quoted bid prices in an active market. Level 2 financial instruments are measured by 
discounted cash flow. For interest rates swaps future cash flows are estimated based on forward interest rates (from observable yield 
curves at the end of the reporting period) and contract interest rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the various 
counterparties. For foreign exchange contracts future cash flows are estimated based on forward exchange rates (from observable 
forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period) and contract forward rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of 
the various counterparties. For equity instruments that are classified as level 3 financial instruments the carrying value approximates to fair 
value.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are as follows:
– currency risk;
– interest rate risk;
– capital risk;
– market price risk;
– liquidity risk; and
– credit risk.
The Group’s policies for managing those risks are described on pages 93 to 98 and, except as noted, have remained unchanged since the 
beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate. 93 Annual Report 2014
Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Coats financial information
35.  Derivatives and other financial instruments continued
CURRENCY RISK
The income and capital value of the Group’s financial instruments can be affected by exchange rate movements as a significant portion 
of both its financial assets and financial liabilities are denominated in currencies other than Sterling, which is the Group’s presentational 
currency. The accounting impact of these exposures will vary according to whether or not the Group company holding such financial 
assets and liabilities reports in the currency in which they are denominated.
The Board recognises that the Group’s Sterling statement of financial position will be affected by short term movements in exchange 
rates, particularly the value of the Australian, New Zealand and United States dollars and the Euro. The Board takes the view that the 
major currencies in which the Group is invested move within a relatively stable range and that currency fluctuations should even out over 
the long term. However, the Board recognises the importance of managing currency risk differently in light of the strategy to return value 
to shareholders. The current Board strategy is to hold cash in currencies to match known Parent Group liabilities. 
At certain times, the Board will make limited use of forward foreign currency contracts and swaps to maintain the Group’s relative 
exposure to the Australian, United States and New Zealand dollars. These contracts tend to have a maturity of less than three months.
Coats uses forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the currency exposure that arises on business transacted in currencies other 
than its own functional currency. Coats only enters into such foreign currency contracts when there is a firm commitment to the 
underlying transaction. The contracts used to hedge future transactions typically have a maturity of between 6 months and 2 years.
INTEREST RATE RISK
In 2014, the Group financed its operations through shareholders’ funds, bank borrowings and commercial bills. The Group’s trading 
subsidiaries use a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt. The Group also has access to bank facilities amounting to some £462 million, of 
which £305 million had been drawn down at year end. This includes facilities negotiated by certain trading subsidiaries to meet their local 
needs. 
Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings using interest rate swap 
contracts. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and risk appetite.
The Group’s interest income does not vary significantly from the returns it would generate through investing surplus cash at floating rates 
of interest since the interest rates are re-set on a regular basis.
A reasonably possible change of one per cent in market interest rates would change profit before tax by approximately £3 million  
(2013: £3 million), and would change shareholders’ funds by approximately £4 million (2013: £5 million).
Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are excluded from the following disclosure (other than the currency disclosures) 
as there is limited interest rate risk.
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group manages its capital so as to ensure that the Company and the Group will be able to continue as a going concern.
The Group’s capital structure comprises cash and cash equivalents and borrowings (see Summary of net cash on page 52), and share 
capital and reserves attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company.
CURRENCY EXPOSURE
The table on page 94 shows the extent to which Group companies have financial assets and liabilities, excluding forward foreign currency 
contracts, in currencies other than their functional currency. Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation of these assets and 
liabilities are taken to the Group income statement.  The table excludes loans between Group companies that form part of the net 
investment in overseas subsidiaries on which the exchange differences are dealt with through reserves, but includes other Group balances 
that eliminate on consolidation. 94 Annual Report 2014

Market Price Risk
The Group has equity and bond available-for-sale investments at 31 December 2014 of £2 million (2013: £3 million) held for strategic 
rather than trading purposes. The Group does not actively trade these investments and is not materially exposed. 97 Annual Report 2014
Overview and strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Coats financial information
35.  Derivatives and other financial instruments continued
LIQUIDITY RISK
Following the Board’s announcement in February 2011 of the strategy to undertake an orderly value realisation, cash proceeds from the 
orderly realisation of investments are being retained in relatively liquid form awaiting the opportunity to return capital to shareholders. 
Such return of capital is being executed having regard to the actual and contingent liabilities of the Group and, hence, requires liquidity 
risk to be effectively managed. In response to this, the Group typically holds cash balances in deposits with a short maturity. Additional 
resources can be drawn through committed borrowing facilities at operating subsidiary level. During the year the Group has complied 
with all externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at the 
year end.

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas and industries.
Customers requesting credit facilities are subject to a credit quality assessment, which may include a review of their financial strength, 
previous credit history with the Group, payment record with other suppliers, bank references and credit rating agency reports. All active 
customers are subject to an annual, or more frequent if appropriate, review of their credit limits and credit periods.
The Group does not have a significant credit risk exposure to any single customer. 99 Annual Report 2014

HEDGES
During 2014, the Group hedged the following exposures:
 – interest rate risk – using interest rate swaps; and
 – currency risk – using forward foreign currency contracts.
At 31 December 2014, the fair value of such hedging instruments was a net liability of £3 million (2013: £1 million).
Cash flow hedges outstanding at 31 December 2014 are expected to impact the income statement in the following periods:

The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is three months’ LIBOR.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow 
hedges to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The amount accumulated in equity 
is reclassified to profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss.

Notes to Coats financial information
1. Basis of preparation
The financial information contained in this section of the report represents the unaudited results of Coats as contained within the audited 
consolidated financial statements of GPG for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013.
It incorporates the consolidated results of Coats Group Limited (“CGL”) as adjusted to account for the Coats capital incentive plan (“CIP”), 
on a basis consistent with that required to be adopted by GPG, and for inclusion in the balance sheet both at 31 December 2014 and  
31 December 2013 of $6.0 million of intangible assets held at the GPG level but which are associated with its acquisition of Coats.
The CIP is operated by GPG for the benefit of certain senior CGL employees. In accordance with IFRS, this is accounted for by CGL as an 
equity-settled compensation plan as CGL has no obligation to settle the share-based payment. Under IFRS, equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant and this fair value 
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the 
parent. GPG accounts for this arrangement as a cash-settled share-based compensation plan and, in accordance with IFRS, is required to 
reassess the fair value of the CIP at each reporting date.
CGL is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. It does not prepare consolidated statutory accounts and therefore the financial 
information contained in this section of the report does not constitute full financial statements and has not been, and will not be, 
audited, other than in so far as it is included within audited financial information of its ultimate parent company.
The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2014 has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) endorsed by the European Union. The same accounting policies have 
been applied to the financial information presented for the year ended 31 December 2013.

7. Post balance sheet event
On 19 February 2015 Coats agreed to sell its EMEA Crafts business for a consideration of $10 million payable in cash on completion 
subject to customary adjustments. The sale is conditional upon, inter alia, a limited number of conditions usual for this type of transaction 
and is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2015. The UK Crafts business will remain within Coats.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, EMEA Crafts (excluding UK) generated external sales of $124.9 million and an operating loss of 
$28.6 million, which includes a property, plant and equipment and intangible assets exceptional impairment charge of $18.8 million. As 
at 31 December 2014, after impairment, the business had net tangible assets of $35.4 million, including cash retained within the business 
as part of the sale. Given the total consideration of $10 million for the business and its net tangible asset position of $35.4 million at 2014 
year end, and taking into account completion adjustments and disposal-related costs, a substantial loss on disposal is expected to be 
recognised on completion of the transaction. The precise quantum will be finalised on completion and will in addition include historical 
foreign exchange translation gains and losses previously recognised in equity.
The results of the EMEA Crafts business (excluding UK) together with the loss on disposal will be presented as a discontinued operation 
when the Group reports its 2015 half year results. 110 Annual Report 2014

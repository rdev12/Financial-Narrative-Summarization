This was a successful year for 
Greenko.  Our operating performance 
was good, EBITDA was ahead of 
expectations and we now have 
806.6 MW either operating or under 
construction.  During the year, we 
acquired 61 MW of attractively priced 
operational hydro assets; added six 
large Himalayan hydro development 
concessions; brought 180 MW of wind 
power into construction; and secured 
a £100 million equity commitment 
from GIC.  Outside our control was 
on-going currency weakness that 
affect ed	 rupee	 pr o fits	 r epor t ed	
in Euros and an unusually poor 
monsoon that impacted southern 
hydro performance.   However, our

meant that a strong performance 
by our northern hydro assets largely 
offset the monsoon’s impact in the 
south, while on a constant currency 
basis our revenue increased by 10.4% 
and adjusted EBITDA by 27.5%. 
We were delighted to welcome 
GIC, the Government of Singapore 
sovereign wealth fund, as an investor. 
Its investment of £100 million into 
our ordinary shares shows great 
confidence	 in	 our	 business	 model

500 MW this year Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 7 6
from 244 MW in March 2013 to over 
500 MW this year, as the initial phases 
of our main wind clusters complete 
construction.  Subsequent phases 
are likely to follow on swiftly, as the 
access roads and grid connections are 
already in place.  We recently added 
Gamesa as a turbine supplier to 
complement GE, and help deliver this 
year’s construction programme. 
We have 65.6 MW of wind power 
already operational, with a further 51.2 
MW completed at Basavana Bagewadi 
and ready to deliver power when the 
grid	 modificatio ns	 ar e	 complet ed	 in	
mid-August 2013. A further 258.6 
MW of wind projects are currently 
under construction, with 471.5 MW 
at an advanced stage of development 
and soon ready for construction.  In 
addition, there is a substantial pipeline 
of future opportunities that should 
feed into our active development 
pipeline.
energy is an increasingly important 
part of the Indian energy market that 
attracts strong regulatory support 
and a favourable tariff structure.  The 
renewable ‘cost free’ and local nature 
of our fuel source creates a unique 
opportunity for Greenko’s portfolio of 
clean energy projects, which can now 
pr o fitably	 sell	 pow er	 in	 most	 S tat es	
at or below the price of conventional 
generation. This is further helped by 
the fact that wind and run-of-river 
hydro projects are quicker to build and 
do not require the onerous permitting 
and infrastructure associated with 
conventional generation.  The 
recent recapitalisation of many State 
Electricity Boards has resulted in 
significant	 incr eases	 in	 pow er	 prices,	
from which we expect our projects 
under construction and active 
dev elopment	t o	benefit.
Our hydro projects under construction 
are making good progress and remain 
set to begin commissioning in 2014. 
The 96.0 MW Dikchu project in Sikkim 
is our largest hydro project under 
construction.   Despite the challenging 
terrain found in the Himalayas, the 
unusually high rainfall in recent 
months and the requirement for 
almost 10 km of tunnelling, the project 
is on  budget and on track to start 
commissioning toward the end of the 
2014-15	 financ ial	 y ear .	 	 Building	 on	
the capabilities created at Dikchu, we 
secured a further six northern hydro 
development concessions (totalling 
425 MW) that will enable us to access 
the high voltage transmission grid and 
sell across the entire Indian market.

Strategy
Our strategy is to create a well-
div er sified	 pow er	 por tfolio	 that	
maximises returns for shareholders. 
Our focus remains on States that offer 
a good renewable resource, as well as 
a supportive economic and regulatory 
environment for renewable energy.
As such, we work with project clusters 
that build on our local knowledge 
and goodwill, to ensure faster 
implementation, better operational 
management and more robust 
resource data. This mitigates risk, 
helps secure multiple revenue streams 
and positions us to capture the most 
attractive opportunities. 
The next few years will see an increased 
focus on northern run-of-river hydro, 
which we believe is the most attractive 
power asset in India today.  We 
also anticipate increasing average 
project sizes, to take advantage of 
the improved transmission network 
to reach a wider market of valuable 
commercial tariffs. To this end, we 
are now investing in the front-end 
development of projects that will drive 
our growth beyond 2015, with site 
work beginning later this year at the 
six run-of-river hydro projects recently 
announced in Himachal Pradesh 
and Arunachal Pradesh.  As the 
opportunities arise, we will continue 
to evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, 
potential hydro asset acquisitions that 
offer attractive returns.
We have also built additional 
infrastructure capacity at our current 
wind power clusters, such that future 
expansion can happen more quickly 
and	 efficiently ,	 in	 line	 with	 our	
philosophy of focussing on utility scale 
wind assets.  While we will typically still 
build in phases of 50 MW, the eventual 
clust er s	 ar e	 lik ely	 t o	 be	 significantly	
larger and we will continue to use 
the latest Class-III wind technology 
to optimise returns.  We minimise 
the risks of project cost over-runs by 
awar ding	 fix ed	 price	 ‘ engineering,	
procurement and construction’ 
contracts with our main contractors, 
and our project teams work closely 
with the contractors to support and 
monitor their performance.
We make full use of India based 
suppliers and almost all of the 
equipment, materials and services for 
our projects are sourced locally.
Board
A t	 the	 end	 o f	 the	 2012-13	 financial	
year Y Harish Chandra Prasad stepped 
down as a Director after seven years 
of diligent service, during which he 
successfully led the Board as Chairman 
from its inception.  I know that all my 
Board colleagues join me in thanking 
Harish for his unstinting support over 
these formative years.  Post the year-
end, we were delighted to  welcome 
John Rennocks to the Board as the 
Senior Non-Executive Director. John 
Rennocks	 brings	 significant	 F TSE-100	
board experience and has joined our 
Audit Committee. 
Outlook
With demand for power in the Indian 
market increasing and an emphasis on 
generation from clean energy sources, 
Greenko is very well positioned for 
strong and sustained growth.  Although 
the Indian economy’s growth slowed 
this year and uncertainty around the 
upcoming elections impacted the 
currency, we believe India’s progress 
remains very attractive and we are 
confident	 o f	 deliv ering	 substantial	
long-term value to our shareholders.
Over the next two years the shape 
and size of our operating portfolio 
will change substantially, as we add 
four large wind farms and complete 
the construction of six hydro projects.  
Developing and constructing projects, 
often in remote locations and very 
difficult	 t errain ,	 is	 nev er	 an	 easy	
task but the experience gained has 
enabled the Greenko team to meet 
those challenges. There is now real 
momentum behind Greenko and our 
shareholders will see further tangible 
progress this year as we commission a 
significant	number	o f	pr ojects.	
We remain on track to reach our target 
of 1,000 MW in 2015 and see Greenko 
emerging as one of the leading 
players in India’s power generation 
sector.  We look forward to reporting 
further progress to you in the coming 
months.   Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 9 8 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 9

Introduction
It is a pleasure to present Greenko’s

with a 19.9% increase in EBITDA and 
continued to build a portfolio that 
establishes Greenko as a strong utility 
in the Indian energy market.  During 
the year, we agreed a £100 million 
investment into our ordinary equity 
with GIC.  This gives us the balance 
sheet strength to readily reach our 
2015 target of 1,000 MW and puts 
in place the foundations for growth 
beyond that.  Our total portfolio 
currently available to generate 
power is 309.2 MW, with a further 
51.2 MW completed and 446.2 MW 
under construction.  We expect to 
commission several projects in the 
coming months and substantially 
increase our generating portfolio.
Financial Review
For the full year, the Company’s 
revenue was €38.3 million (2012: €36.9 
million), with generation of 886.0 
GWh (2012: 769.8 GWh).  The Rupee’s 
depreciation against the Euro by 
appr o ximat ely	 6.4%	 ov er	 the	 financial	
year has again led to foreign currency 
translation differences in our accounts. 
Although generation increased 15.1%, 
reported revenue only increased 3.8%, 
due to a change in the generating mix 
and	 mor e	 significantly ,	 the	 w eakness	
of our functional currency (the Indian 
Rupee) relative to our reporting 
currency (the Euro).  On a constant 
currency basis, revenue would have 
increased by approximately 10.4% and 
adjusted EBITDA by 27.5%. 
Adjusted EBITDA, a key performance 
indicator for Greenko, increased 
19.9% to €32.8 million (2012: €27.3 
million), despite the adverse currency 
movements. 
We demonstrated profitable growth and continued 
to build a portfolio that establishes Greenko as a 
strong utility in the Indian energy market.

Adjust ed	 pr o fit	 befor e	 tax	 was	 down	
slightly at €12.0 million (2012: €13.9 
million) as EBITDA growth was offset 
by the depreciation and interest 
charges attributable to the 61 MW of 
hydropower  added during the year. 
This was exacerbated by the timing of 
the Sumez acquisition, which occurred 
towards the end of the northern 
generating season. Adjusted fully

cents)	 r eflectin g	 the	 imp act	 o f	 the	
shares issued in June 2011 and June

The adjusted EBITDA margin increased 
from 74.0% to 85.4% and was affected 
by a number of one offs.  The impact 
of the non-cash charge for the 2008 
LTIP (€4.0 million), reported in our 
interim results, was partly offset 
by the sale of an unused biomass 
project licence (€1.2 million) and 
compensation received by the AMR 
(24.75 MW) and Rithwick (24.75 MW) 
hydro plants for reduced generation 
due to water abstraction by the State 
(€1.8 million).  Underlying EBITDA (i.e. 
excluding share payments and the fair 
value adjustment) increased 18.4% 
to €25.3 million (2012: €21.4 million) 
on a reported basis and the margin 
increased to 65.9% (2012: 57.8%), while 
in constant currency terms underlying 
EBITDA would have increased 25.9% 
to approximately €26.9 million.
During	 the	 fina ncial	 y ear ,	 w e	 inv est ed	
€219.9 million in power assets through 
on-going construction activity and the 
hydropower acquisitions.  This resulted 
in a 69.0% increase in Plant, Property 
and Equipment and Intangible Assets 
to €516.7 million (2012: €305.8 
million).  Cash (including deposits) at 
the end of the year was €35.8 million 
(2012: €63.2 million) as planned 
construction activity and acquisitions 
were funded by a mix of debt and 
equity .	 	 In	 the	 y ear ,	 the	 final	 US$60	
million was drawn from the Standard 
Chartered and GE commitments. Total 
borrowing at the end of the year was 
€247.9 million (2012: €153.1 million) 
and Greenko currently has €205.6 
million of committed but undrawn 
debt facilities in place. 
Post the year-end, the £100 million 
equity investment was received as 
expected from GIC.
Market Environment and Group 
Strategy
The macro environment within India 
continues to support Greenko. Over 
a third of India’s population does 
not have access to power and the 
country’s GDP growth is still estimated 
to be in excess of 5% per annum. 
Given the continued population and 
GDP	 gr owth,	 a	 wider	 electrification	
programme and growing urbanisation, 
the country’s installed capacity is 
expected to reach 290 GW by 2017, 
from a current base of approximately 
205 GW. Therefore, with fossil fuel’s 
difficulty	 in	 deliv ering	 sufficient	 cost -
effective power capacity, Greenko 
remains well positioned to become a 
leading Indian power producer.
 
Our	 pr ojects	 benefit	 fr om	 long	 t er m	
power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) 
that are not available to conventional 
power producers, thereby enhancing 
the security and long-term visibility 
of our revenue. Most of our projects 
are registered under the Clean 
Development Mechanism (“CDM”) 
and provide the Group with Carbon 
Emission Reduction (“CER”) revenue.  
As disclosed last year, we are selling 
CERs on a consistent basis and, while 
carbon revenue enhances project 
pr o fitability ,	 our	 pr oject	 asses sments	
continue the existing prudent 
approach of excluding it from the 
fundamental economic analysis.  
There is a trend towards rising tariffs, 
supported by the Central Electricity 
Regulatory Commission guidelines.  
This	 is	 p ar ticularly	 beneficial	 in	 wind	
pow er ,	 wher e	 zone	 classification	 and	
general industry practices are used 
as a benchmark, which complements 
Greenko’s strategy of developing 
top-quartile projects. The Generation 
Based Incentive scheme, which 
provides an incremental incentive of 
INR 0.5/kWh was restarted in April 
2013 for new projects and should 
benefit	 all	 the	 wind	 cap acity	 w e	 expect	
to commission this year.  Recent tariff 
increases have meant our wind and 
hy dr o	 pr ojects	 can	 operat e	 pr o fitably	
at or below grid parity.  As a result, 
we are starting to develop PPAs with 
commercial off-takers, beginning with 
our 15 MW Matrix wind farm, which is 
expected to improve returns through 
a	 mix	 o f	 higher	 prices	 and	 inflation	
linking.
Greenko’s projects also have access to 
R enewable	 Ener gy	 Cer tificat es	 (“RECs”)	
where the generator sells the local 
component of electricity at market 
prices and trades the environmental 
attribute in the form of RECs separately 
through an established Power 
Exchange.  REC revenue was €1.6 
million in the year (2012: nil) from our 
tw o	 qualified	 pr ojects.	 	 Although	 REC	
revenue is expected to be substantial 
in	 the	 next	 four	 t o	 fiv e	 y ear s,	 b ased	 on	
the present renewable energy capacity 
shortfall, we are prudently limiting 
the number of projects exposed to 
the scheme until this new market’s 
teething problems have been resolved.
Operational and Development 
review
Greenko reports on its capacity 
as: operating assets, projects in-
construction and concessions under 
active development.  Together, 
these represent approximately 2.34 
GW .	 	 Behind	 this	 is	 a	 significant	
pipeline of potential development 
pr ojects,	 which	 ar e	 only	 classi fied	 as	
‘active development’ once the key 
concessions, resource assessment and 
agreements are in place.  Overall, we 
have today:
•	 Operational: 309.2 MW
•	 Completed/being commissioned: 
51.2 MW
•	 Under-construction: 446.2 MW
•	 Active development: 1,529.4 MW
We expect to complete construction 
of over 250 MW projects before 
the end of March 2014, and started 
construction on a further 179.5 MW of 
projects.
Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 11 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 13 12
totalling 33.6 MW under construction. 
A new development concession (115 
MW) consisting of two cascading 
hydro projects in the Chamba District 
is due to begin site work later this year.  
These are near our existing projects 
and located on a tributary of the Ravi 
River, which has good hydrology data 
and relatively easy site access. 
 
Our largest hydro project under 
construction, Dikchu (96 MW) in Sikkim, 
remains on track for commissioning to 
start in late 2014-15. Key components 
of the project are progressing 
w ell,with	 the	 fir st	 Alsthom	 turb ine	 and	
its associated balance of plant on-site, 
along with initial deliveries for the 
second turbine. Project debt of INR 5.2 
billion is being provided by an IDBI led 
banking consortium.  
The	 Kar nataka	 clust er	 has	 fiv e	
operational run-of-river hydro projects 
totalling 94.25 MW. There are three 
projects, totalling 58 MW, that are 
under construction and that should 
be commissioned in 2014-15, all with 
key contracts in place and site work 
underway.
The Arunachal Pradesh projects 
form a new regional cluster and 
consist of four cascading run-of-river 
hydro projects. Arunachal is one of 
India’s most mountainous states 
and is substantially covered by the 
Himalayas. This region is one of the 
few areas remaining in India where 
large run-of-river projects are feasible, 
due to the steep topography and high 
quality hydrology. The projects are 
located on the perennial Yargyap Chu 
River (a tributary of the Tato River) 
in the West Siang District and have 
a catchment area of approximately 
839 sq km. The sites are particularly 
attractive, as they have good road 
access, reliable power evacuation and 
relatively little need for tunnelling.
Overall, we believe run-of-river hydro 
is the most attractive power asset in 
India today.  However, shareholders 
will only see the tangible delivery of 
our extensive work from next year, as 
projects start to commission. 
In the interim, we are continuing 
to assess several acquisition 
opportunities that are consistent with 
our strategy, although we will only 
proceed where an attractive return 
is achievable.  In the next eighteen 
months, our wind portfolio will show 
the most tangible growth, as we 
expect to commission a substantial 
number of projects.
Wind
Our wind strategy is based on 
extensive analysis aimed at delivering 
a	 r eliable	 long	 t er m	 generation	 pr o file,	
using validated wind data, robust 
project design and economic return 
hurdles.  Execution is differentiated 
from the broader Indian wind energy 
market by focusing on utility scale 
pr ojects	 that	 can	 be	 efficiently	 built	
in phases around core infrastructure.  
As previously announced, we have 
934.0 MW of wind assets in active 
development, plus three 100+ MW 
utility scale wind power projects that 
are in varying stages of construction.
Shortly after the year-end, we signed 
a turbine supply and construction 
agreement with Gamesa to support 
the build out of our wind portfolio.  This 
complements our existing GE turbine 
supply agreement, but provides useful 
t echnology	 div er sification	 and	 r educes	
the risk of supply constraint delays.  
The agreement is for the Gamesa G97-
2.0 MW IIIA turbine, with a binding 
obligation for 200 MW and an option 
for an additional 100 MW. The G97-2.0 
is a specialised 2 MW low wind speed 
turbine, with a hub height of 90m and 
rotor diameter of 97m.  The contract 
includes	 a	 tw o-y ear	 warrant y ,	 fiv e	
years’ operations and maintenance, 
a 100% power curve guarantee and 
attractive availability guarantees 
linked to the Indian wind season.  
This contract helps Greenko maintain 
its growth rate, while diversifying its 
technology and delivery risk.  An initial 
order of 100 MW was placed and the 
fir st	 G97	 equipment	 has	 arriv ed	 at	 	
Basavana Bagewadi Phase-2 (50.0 
MW). A second order is likely to be 
placed in the next few weeks, for 
Hydro
Greenko’s hydro portfolio is made 
up of run-of-river projects, grouped 
in four clusters.  The northern hydro 
portfolio has clusters in the states 
of Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and 
Arunachal Pradesh.  Our southern 
hydro portfolio has only one cluster, 
in Karnataka.  The southern cluster is 
made up of relatively large projects 
on rivers that are primarily monsoon 
dependent.  The northern hydro 
portfolio is all high-head projects that 
typically run for most of the year, due 
to hydrology based on snow melt, 
glacier melt and rainfall. Underpinning 
each cluster is a larger pipeline of 
active development project companies 
that are acquired once they have 
secured the key concessions, resource 
assessments and agreements.
During the year we added 61 MW of 
operating hydro assets in Himachal 
Pradesh and 425 MW of development 
assets in Himachal Pradesh and 
Arunachal Pradesh.  Today, we are 
one of the largest operators of sub-
100 MW hydro projects in India and 
will continue to add medium sized 
hydro projects to ensure portfolio risk 
is spread geographically and across 
technologies. The hydro portfolio 
now consists of 165.25 MW of 
operating assets and 187.6 MW under 
construction.
Greenko’s hydro portfolio performed 
well, with an average Plant Load 
Factor (“PLF”) of 34%. A very weak 
monsoon impacted the southern 
hydro projects, although the effect on 
the portfolio was offset by a strong 
performance from the northern hydro 
assets, which delivered an average 
PLF of 58% across the year, despite a 
number of projects still being in post-
commissioning stabilisation.  In the 
south, Jasper Power (Sonna) had a 
p ar ticularly	 poor	 y ear	 due	 t o	 difficult	
rainfall patterns linked to its position 
on an irrigation canal.
The Himachal cluster has 11 
operational run-of-river hydro projects 
totalling 71 MW and two projects,

national IT Park via a 10-year PPA. 
The attractively priced ReGen 1.5 
MW V87 turbine is being used and 
all the turbines are on site.  Project 
commissioning is planned for the end 
of the 2013 wind season.  
Current regulatory uncertainty in 
Rajasthan means we have delayed our 
T anot-Jaisalmer (100 MW) and Devgarh 
(49.5 MW) projects until there is more 
clarity. Although we believe Rajasthan 
remains an attractive location, the 
strength of our development portfolio 
means we have the option to redeploy 
resources to more predictable near-
term opportunities.
Thermal projects
The 36.8 MW LVS gas plant continued 
t o	 generat e	 operating	 pr o fits	 under	
the contract’s quasi-tolling structure in 
line with expectations.  Our 58.4 MW 
Greenko Godavari gas plant remains 
delayed by the well-publicised 
uncertainty over output from the 
Reliance Krishna Godavari KG-D6 
basin. As a result, we have moved the 
project to the tail end of our active 
development pipeline, in order to free-
up management resources for projects 
with greater near term certainty.  We 
may revisit these timings when there is 
more certainty over the gas supply, as 
construction is relatively swift.
The Group’s 41.5 MW of biomass assets 
continued to perform below long-
term expectations, with individual 
operating PLFs ranging from 19.9% to 
80.4%. Whilst biomass power offers 
stable generation, it does not offer the 
scope for growth that can be achieved 
with our hydro or wind assets.  As 
such, we realised €1.2 million through 
the sale of an unused biomass project 
license and are currently evaluating 
all options to improve the return on 
capital from the existing operating 
assets.
Business Development
In addition to the 2.34 GW already 
secured, we have a large pipeline of 
potential opportunities. 
The Company’s infrastructure, brand 
and standing within the industry 
provide it with unrivalled access to deal 
flow .	 Gr eenk o	 will	 continue	 t o	 pur sue	
a dual strategy in hydro, assessing 
both potential acquisitions as well as 
new concession tenders. The Greenko 
team is currently analysing a number 
of assets, but will only take forward 
the most attractive opportunities.  
However, our growth plans are 
unchanged and continue to assume 
a preference for new concessions, 
particularly in the wind sector where 
our strategy is highly differentiated and 
focussed on maximising shareholders’ 
returns through high quality resource 
data and utility scale assets. 
“There can however be attractions 
in acquiring existing larger hydro 
operating assets which offer 
immediate returns, by comparison 
with the long construction period 
for new Hydro developments. This is 
significantly	 less	 significant	 for	 wind	
projects where construction periods 
are quite short, particularly where 
existing grid connections may already 
have been created for earlier phases 
of the wind farms”.
First quarter 2013-14 performance
In	 the	 fir st	 thr ee	 months	 o f	 our	 new	
financial	 y ear	 the	 ov erall	 por tfolio	
performed marginally ahead of 
management expectations.  Northern 
hydro achieved 89% of its budget, as 
a relatively harsh winter delayed the 
initial snowmelt, with approximately 
110.9 GWh generated.  However, 
generation in June was ahead of 
budget, as snowmelt picked up and 
the monsoon arrived early.  Southern 
hydro generated 118% of budget (18.8 
GWh), due to technical improvements 
at AMR and Rithwick that increased 
the projects’ net head, and the early 
monsoon.  Ratnagiri Phase-1 achieved 
good performance, with 25.8 GWh 
generated, or 132% of expectations, 
helped by the early monsoon.  Total 
thermal generation was equivalent 
to 79.6 GWh, which was in-line with 
management expectations, net of 
various planned shutdowns.  
delivery beforethe end of 2013. 
Phase-1 of our Ratnagiri Wind Farm 
(65.6 MW) in Maharashtra has been 
commissioned.  Phase-2 (36.0 MW) is 
on track to begin construction in late 
2013 and the order for the enhanced 
GE 1.6 XLE turbine has now been 
placed.  On past experience, the access 
roads are likely to require remediation 
after the monsoon, before we can 
reliably get the sixty-six 40.3m long 
blades to site.  This remediation takes 
only a matter of weeks, but can only 
start once the monsoon ends.    
Basavana Bagewadi Wind Farm 
(145.2 MW) is our second major wind 
project in construction.  This is in 
Karnataka and Phase-1 (51.2 MW) is 
fully completed using the GE 1.6 XLE 
turbine.  The electrical sub-station 
is currently being tested and delays 
with the transmission line mean that 
power sales will only begin in August.  
However, approval for total power 
evacuation from the project was 
increased from 101.2 MW to 145.2 
MW (158 MW including Matrix) and 
this capacity is included in the existing 
transmission line. Phase-2 (50.0 MW) 
will use the Gamesa G97-2.0 machine 
and should be commissioned in early 
2014. 
Our third major wind project is 
Balavenkatpuram
1
 Wind Farm (200.0 
MW) in Andhra Pradesh.  Phase-1 
(57.6 MW) will use the enhanced 
GE 1.6 XLE turbine, with full 
commissioning expected around the 
end of the 2013 monsoon. Phase-2 
(50.0 MW) will use the G97-2.0 turbine 
with commissioning in early 2014, 
and we are now moving Phase-3 
(50.0 MW) into construction.  Half the 
Phase-1 turbines are already up and 
the sub-station is two-thirds through 
construction.  Approved capacity was 
recently increased to 200 MW and 
we are starting the land acquisition 
process for this additional capacity.
Our fourth wind project, Matrix Wind 
Farm (15.0 MW – Karnataka), effectively 
extends our Basavana Bagewadi site, 
but sells its power directly to a multi-

While we cannot control wind or water 
flows,	 having	 the	 plant	 av ailable	 t o	
run when the resource is available is 
critical.	 In	 the	 fir st	 quar t er ,	 nor ther n	
hydro achieved 99.8% availability and 
southern hydro 99.9%. This means 
southern generating capacity was only
unavailable for less than two hours 
over a three-month period.  This was 
exceptionally good performance by 
the northern and southern hydro 
assets, and a testament to the teams 
running those projects. 
Outlook
The backdrop for power in India 
remains positive, as conventional 
power assets are struggling to supply 
power to the grid, due to fuel supply 
and off-take price issues. The grid 
parity achievement of the Group’s 
wind and hydro portfolio, coupled 
with increased demand, means that 
Greenko is well positioned to provide 
financially	attractiv e	r etur ns.
The Group enjoyed a successful 
twelve months in which we secured 
the	 fina nce	 t o	 deliv er	 our	 strat egy	
and	 a	 significan tly	 lar ger	 dev elopment	
pipeline.  Commissioning Ratnagiri 
was an important milestone, as wind 
power will accelerate our growth 
and	 cr eat e	 a	 div er sified	 generating	
portfolio that delivers strong returns 
to shareholders.  We are pleased 
with progress at our projects under 
construction, as these underpin the 
significant	 gr owth	 w e	 plan	 t o	 deliv er	
this year.
We strongly believe that Greenko’s 
div er sified	 por tfolio	 o f	 pr ojects,	
both operating and under active 
development, is the most attractive 
long-term power asset in the Indian 
market.  We are on track to meet our 
2015 target of 1,000 MW and there are 
considerable further opportunities to 
pr o fitably	 gr ow	 our	 business	 bey ond	
that.

Principal risks & uncertainties
The management of the business and 
the execution of the Group’s strategy 
are subject to a number of risks. These 
risks are formally reviewed by the 
Board and appropriate processes and 
controls are put in place to monitor 
and mitigate them.
The key risks affecting the Group 
are set out below: 
Financial risk management 
objectives and policies
The	 Gr oup	 uses	 v arious	 financial	
instruments which include equity 
investments, bank loans and items 
such as trade debtors and trade 
creditors that arise directly from its 
operations. The main purpose of these 
financial	 instruments	 is	 t o	 raise	 finance	
for the Group’s operations and to hold 
surplus funds. The main risks arising 
fr om	 the	 Gr oup ’ s	 financial	 instruments	
are interest rate and credit risk. The 
Directors review these risks on an on-
going basis.
Government policy
The Indian Energy market is subject to 
regulation and pricing tariffs are set by 
Government bodies. While the sector’s 
various policies and legislation do not 
indicate anything to the contrary, it 
is not possible to rule out potential 
changes which may affect the Group’s 
business	 and	 its	 financial	 condition.

Significant shareholdings in the company
As at 5
th
 August 2013 the Company was aware of the following substantial interests in its issued ordinary share capital: Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 19 18 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 19
Although Government policies are 
supportive to the present business of 
the Group, the policies may change 
in future which may alter the tariff 
structure or the market, affecting the 
viability of new build projects based 
on current tariff and cost assumptions 
and	 also	 the	 pr o fitability	 o f	 existing	
plants.
Fuel supply 
Only less than 15% of total operating 
capacity (only biomass projects) have 
the Fuel supply risk, the long term 
strategy of the group is to minimize 
the fuel risks and to develop fuel risk 
free portfolio. The cost of acquiring 
feedstock for each typical biomass 
plant is approximately half of the 
power revenue generated. The Group 
relies on different local suppliers 
to supply feedstock and the prices 
fluctuat e	 betw een	 supplier s	 and	 ov er	
different seasons of the year. While 
the Group is endeavoring to establish 
long- term supply arrangements and 
identifying alternative feed stocks, 
changes of feedstock prices may affect 
the	pr o fitability	o f	biomass	plants.
Carbon Emission Reduction Risk 
The Group sells the CERs it generates 
from its power plants. The sale of 
CERs is determined by market forces 
and	 can	 fluctu at e	 accor dingly .	 The	
Group regularly analyze the trading 
prices and has put in place measures 
whereby it is not forced to sell at a 
time when the market price may be 
temporarily lower.
An additional CER risk relates to 
the process of registration with the 
UNFCC. The length of time for an 
asset’s registration to be approved can 
vary. Also there is no guarantee that 
each registration application will be 
successful. The Group has a dedicated
experienced CDM team who have put 
measures in place to mitigate this risk.
Construction and acquisition risk
 
The Group has a number of projects 
under development and intends to 
Upper Taraila  Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 21 20
construct additional clean energy  
assets in the future as well as acquiring 
operating assets. The timing and 
impact of these acquisitions and new 
builds are not known. Any delays in 
obtaining the required government 
approvals, construction and/or 
acquisition could have an adverse 
effect	 on	 the	 Gr oup ’ s	 financial	 r esults.	
The Group regularly reviews these 
risks and takes steps to mitigate them.
Competition 
The Group faces competition from 
both incumbent utilities and other 
clean power operators. Competitors 
and potential competitors may have 
substantially greater resources than 
those of the Group and may be in a 
position to acquire clean energy assets 
by	 p aying	 a	 significant	 pr emium.	 The	
Group has implemented mechanisms 
to review the competitive strategies in 
response to emerging threats.

Sustainable Development and 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
Greenko is committed to inclusive 
growth and local stakeholder 
involvement as a fundamental value 
and strives to enhance:
•	Social	w ellbeing
•	Economic	w ellbeing
•	Envir onmental	w ellbeing
•	Local	community	initiativ es
Social Wellbeing: Greenko’s project 
activity has visible impact on the 
development of the region or district 
involved.
The  collection  and  transportation of  
the	 	 biomass	 	 fuel	 fr om	 fields	 generat es	
direct and indirect employment 
opportunities for the rural population. 
Similarly in setting up hydro and wind 
projects, Greenko specially works 
to enhance local infrastructure and 
provide employment opportunities 
in the communities surrounding the 
projects.
Rural industries are being set up as 
a consequence of the location of 
power plants nearby. This also assists 
infrastructure development in rural 
areas, thereby reducing the migration 
to cities.
Economic Wellbeing:  The project 
activities of Greenko generate much 
needed employment in areas local 
to its power plants. The projects 
also provide economic value to 
agricultural and wood waste, as well 
as to provide stable and quality power 
to neighbouring industry, farmers 
and households.  The projects  create 
business  opportunities for local 
stakeholders such as consultants, 
suppliers, manufacturers, contractors 
etc.
Environmental Wellbeing:  Greenko 
projects use biomass materials, wind 
or	 naturally	 flowing	 wat er	 for	 pow er	
generation and therefore has a 
completely carbon neutral foot print.
Local Community Initiatives: 
Greenko‘s works to bring cumulative 
improvements in the areas of 
Education, Healthcare and Rural 
Development to communities near its 
facilities by progressive interventions 
to create permanent value. Greenko 
has a systematic framework to 
achieve this working closely with 
local governments, NGOs and other 
likeminded organizations in the area 
to maximize the impact of its activities.
Education
Greenko continues to contribute 
in	 the	 field	 o f	 education.	 Gr eenk o	
continued its holistic approach to 
ensure that the younger generation 
by working closely with the local 
communities to increase enrollment, 
improve school attendance and 
minimize dropout rates. We have been 
recognizing meritorious students and 
providing scholarships and have been 
contributing to the improvement of 
school facilities. 
Some recent initiatives include 
enabling the construction of 
an auditorium (Rangamandira 
Auditorium) for the Narikumbo 
Higher Primary School near our

Healthcare 
Greenko has taken steps to 
augment healthcare services to 
the communities that surround 
the plants all over India. In May 
2012, Sneha Kinetic Power Projects 
Private Limited (in collaboration with 
the Manipal Medical Employees 
Welfare Association) organized and 
successfully conducted a free medical 
camp at the power house in Dikchu. 
This medical team that treated more 
than 520 participants comprised of 
13 doctors and specialists and 15 
paramedics, all from Sikkim Manipal 
Hospital, Gangtok. The equipment 
present catered to all students, the 
young, the elder, men and women. 
Medication was distributed free of 
charge and patients that required 
further attention were referred to 
Manipal Hospital Gangtok where 
they were consulted and treated 
free of charge. This is a continuation 
and substantial expansion of last 
year’s activity and will be a regular 
intervention. 
Greenko will continue working closely 
with the communities that surround 
our plants all over the country to 
monitor their progress regularly to 
ensure the social, economic and 
environmental wellbeing of the local 
communities. 
Rural Development
Greenko continues to collaborate with 
local panchayats and NGO for various 
needs of the local communities, such 
as, clean drinking water, roads, street 
lighting, clean toilet facilities and assist 
in developing local infrastructure.
Street lighting: Greenko installed 
street lights in localities near its 
projects that did not have any street 
lights.
Roads: Building new roads and 
extensive repairs of existing roads for 
the local communities at several of 
our projects including Pangthang to 
Lingdok, Ratnagiri villages etc.
Greenko Integrated Management 
System (GIMS)
GIMS implementation at all its 
facilities follows the Deming’s cycle 
of Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) process 
and	 the	 int er nal	 cer tification	 pr ocess	
is being formalized and is expected to 
r oll	 out	 this	 y ear .	 Int er nal	 cer tifications	
will be done in compliance with 
Medical Camp Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 31 30
Greenko Standard metrics based 
on ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001:2004 
and OHSAS 18001:2007 which refer, 
respectively, to: quality management, 
occupational health and safety 
management, and environmental 
management systems.
GIMS audits are designed to look back 
and analyze where we stand vis-à-vis 
laid down procedures. To strengthen 
its internal audit capabilities, Greenko 
selected 25 employees at different 
levels from various operating plants 
and projects for a four day programme 
on IMS Internal auditing. The training 
and testing was conducted by Det 
Norsk Veritas (DNV), a well regarded 
cer tification	 body .	 The	 newly	 trained	
auditors are now deployed with 
existing Greenko auditors to further 
develop their skills.
Quality Management System
The GIMS motto is “Completeness, 
Rigor and Accuracy to achieve 
Excellence”. Standard processes in 
projects under construction and 
operating plants are different. 
Therefore we have clearly separated 
quality procedures for projects 
under construction into Greenko 
Project Quality Management Process 
(GPQMP) as part of GIMS while 
operating plants follow regular 
GIMS procedures. Greenko has also 
formulated a comprehensive Hand 
over Take Over (HOTO) process so that 
projects are smoothly transferred to 
the operating teams.
This year GIMS implementation has 
been initiated at Fortune Five Wind 
project in Basavana Bagewadi and 
Rayala Wind project in Anantapur 
in addition to the existing 2 under 
construction projects, four hydro 
plants,	 fiv e	 biomass	 plants.	 The	
cer tification	pr ocess	is	under	way .
Greenko Energies Pvt. Ltd, the 
Company’s subsidiary and Indian 
holding company, which had received 
cer tification	 o f	 ISO	 9001:2008,	 for	
implementing Quality Management 
System, has successfully been re-
audited periodically both by internal 
and external audit agency Det Norsk 
Veritas.
Environment, Health and Safety 
(EHS) Management
Greenko is committed to practice 
safe working methods to prevent 
occupational health and safety risks 
and adopt clean technologies to 
prevent pollution. Greenko aims 
to achieve zero accidents at every 
Greenko site. To achieve this, Greenko 
has developed comprehensive EHS 
processes which can be simply 
communicated and implemented 
across the organization – at every 
operational and project site. 
We follow a two pronged approach to 
Health and Safety, viz. 
Identify and minimize hazards at the 
work spots by reviewing the facility, 
equipment and materials used in 
project sites for safety.
Prevent unsafe acts by training 
employees to follow safe work 
methods and practices. 
Our team has developed a library of 
hazards and related risks. The library 
comprises a list of all work areas 
in an operating plant or a project 
under construction; activities being 
performed in the work areas and a 
list	 o f	 associat ed	 hazar ds	 &	 safe	 w ork	
practices. 
The EHS team has devised a simple 
slogan to help everyone to remember 
and follow - “4PS for Safety” and to 
report avoidable hazards and prevent 
unsafe acts. The “four P’s” stand for 
“Place”, “People”, “PPE’s” and “Permit 
&	 P ost er s” .	 The	 “S”	 stands	 for	 “Safe	
Work Methods”.
Greenko has a “4PS” process to identify 
the risks associated and a rigorous 
safety plan based on the intensity of 
the risks:
The “Place” of work is reviewed for 
avoidable hazards and such hazards 
are corrected
“People” - For each activity in 
a workplace the competency 
requirement and who is authorized to 
visit or work in the workplace is clearly 
laid out.
Similarly “Personal Protective 
Equipments (PPEs)” to be worn in 
the work areas and for work being 
per for med	ar e	defined	
“Permits” to carry out prescribed 
jobs and “Publicity” (Signage and 
W ar nings)	r equir ed	ar e	specified
“Safe work methods” on how to 
per for m	 specific	 activities	 ar e	
formulated
These constitute the safety plan 
for each workplace. Employees are 
trained to report avoidable hazards 
and prevent unsafe acts.
Greenko trains employees and 
frequently communicates with them 
to ensure that they are aware and 
conscious about the importance 
of safety at work. Greenko facilities 
are audited for safety and a safety 
coverage report is prepared for each 
site for a quick and comprehensive 
view of the compliance.
The EHS Management system provides 
for periodic audits to verify compliance 
with applicable requirements and 
to address the implementation of 
preventive and corrective actions. 
Greenko management is kept 
informed about audit results and 
continues to enforce effectiveness and 
continuous improvement of the EHS 
management system. Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 31 30 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 31
Greenko’s business is built on 
environmental friendly generation and 
all our facilities comply with emission, 
pollution and noise norms in force. Our 
Hydro sites are designed to minimize 
environmental damage and to further 
reduce our footprint, we have devised 
a rigorous process of energy audit and 
efficiency	 impr ov ement	 acr oss	 our	
sites.

These	 consolidat ed	 financial	
statements were authorised for issue 
by the board of directors on 05 
September 2013
2. Summary of significant  
accounting policies
The principal accounting policies 
applied in the preparation of these 
consolidat ed	 financial	 stat ements	 ar e	
set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the 
periods presented.
2.1 Basis of preparation:
The	 consolidat ed	 financial	 stat ements	
of Greenko Group plc have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union. The consolidated 
financial	 stat ements	 hav e	 been	
prepared under the historical cost 
conv ention,	 as	 modified	 by	 the	
revaluation of available-for-sale 
financial	 assets ,	 and	 financial 	 assets	
and	 financial	 liabilities	 (including	
derivative instruments) at fair value 
thr ough	pr o fit	or	loss.	
The	 pr ep ara tion	 o f	 financial	
information in conformity with 
IFRS requires the use of certain 
critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its 
judgment in the process of applying 
the Group’s accounting policies. The 
areas involving a higher degree of 
judgment or complexity, or areas 
where assumptions and estimates 
ar e	 significant	 t o	 the	 consolidat ed	
financial	 infor mation	 ar e	 disclosed	 in	
the critical accounting estimates and 
judgments section (note 5).
2.2  Consolidation
The	 consolidat ed	 financial	 stat ements	
include the assets, liabilities and 
results of the operations of the 
parent company and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which 
the Group has the power to govern 
the	 finan cial	 and	 operating	 policies	 so	
as	 t o	 obtain	 economic	 benefit s	 fr om	
its activities, generally accompanying 
a shareholding of more than one 
half of the voting rights. The Group 
considers the existence and effect 
of potential voting rights that are 
presently exercisable or convertible 
in determining control. Subsidiaries 
are consolidated from the date on 
which the Group acquires effective 
control. Consolidation is discontinued 
from the date when control over the 
subsidiary ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting 
is used to account for the acquisition 
of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost 
of an acquisition is measured as the 
fair value of the assets given, equity 
instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of 
ex change.	 Identifiable	 assets	 acquir ed	
and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business  combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at 
the acquisition date, irrespective of the 
extent of any non-controlling interest. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share 
o f	 the	 identifiab le	 net	 assets	 acquir ed	
is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of 
acquisition is less than the fair value 
of the net assets of the subsidiary 
acquired, the difference is recognised 
dir ectly	 in	 pr o fit	 or	 loss.	 Acquisition	
related costs are expensed as incurred.
Pr eviously	 held	 identifiable	 assets,	
liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the acquired entity are revalued 
to their fair value at the date of 
acquisition, being the date at which 
the Group achieves control of the 
acquired entity. The movement in fair 
v alue	is	r ecognized	in	pr o fit	or	loss.
All intra-group transactions, balances 
and unrealised gains on intra-group 
transactions are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated but 
considered an impairment indicator 
of the asset transferred. Accounting 
policies of subsidiaries have been 
changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted 
by the Group.
Non-controlling interests represent 
the	 por tion	 o f	 pr o fit	 or	 loss	 and	
net assets that is not held by the 
Group and are presented separately 
in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and within 
equity in the consolidated statement 
o f	 financial	 position,	 sep arat ely	 fr om	
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 41 40
parent shareholders’ equity. 
Acquisitions of an additional stake 
or dilution of a stake from/ to non-
controlling interests in the Group are 
accounted for using the equity method, 
whereby, the difference between the 
consideration paid or received and 
the book value of the share of the net 
assets is recognised in ‘other reserve’ 
within the statement of changes in 
equity. The Group attributes total 
comprehensive income of subsidiaries 
between the owners of the Parent and 
the non-controlling interests based on 
their respective ownership interests.
2.3 Segment reporting
The Group’s operations predominantly 
relate to generation and sale of 
electricity. The chief operating 
decision maker evaluates the Group’s 
performance and allocates resources 
based on an analysis of various 
performance indicators at operating 
segment level. Accordingly, there 
is only a single operating segment 
“generation and sale of electricity, 
related emission reductions and 
r enewable	ener gy	cer tificat es” .
2.4 Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation 
currency
It ems	 included	 in	 the	 financial	
statements in each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity 
operates (“the functional currency”). 
The	 consolidat ed	 financial	 stat ements	
are presented in ‘Euro’ (“€”), which 
is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency. The functional 
currency of the Group’s subsidiaries in 
India is Indian Rupees (“INR”). 
b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are 
translated into the functional currency 
using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the date of the transaction. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at 
year-end exchange rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognised in 
pr o fit	or	loss.
c)  Group companies
The	 r esults	 and	 financial	 position	
of all the Group entities (none of 
which has the currency of a hyper-
inflationar y	 economy)	 that	 hav e	 a	
functional currency different from the 
presentation currency are translated 
into the presentation currency as 
follows:
•	 assets and liabilities 
presented for each reporting date are 
translated at the closing rate at the 
reporting date;
•	 income and expenses for 
each statement of comprehensive 
income are translated at average 
exchange rates (unless this average 
is not a reasonable approximation 
of the cumulative effect of the rates 
prevailing on the transaction dates, in 
which case income and expenses are 
translated at the rate on the dates of 
the transactions); and 
•	 the resulting    exchange 
differences are charged / credited 
to other comprehensive income and 
recognised in the currency translation 
reserve within equity.
When a foreign operation is partially 
disposed of or sold, exchange 
differences that were recorded as 
other comprehensive income are 
r ecognised	 in	 pr o fit	 or	 loss	 as	 p ar t	 o f	
the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
entity are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
2.5  Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment 
is stated at historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any 
impairment in value. Freehold land 
is not depreciated. Historical cost 
includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the 
items and borrowing cost. Subsequent 
costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as 
a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future 
economic	 benefits	 associat ed	 with	
them	 will	 flow	 t o	 the	 Gr oup	 and	 the	
cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance expenditure are charged 
t o	 pr o fit	 or	 loss 	 during	 the	 period	 in	
which they are incurred. Depreciation 
is calculated on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful life of the 
asset as follows: 
Useful life

15 – 20 years
10 years Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 41 40 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 41
An item of property, plant and 
equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic 
benefit	 is	 expect ed	 t o	 arise	 fr om	 the	
continued use of the asset. Any gain 
or loss arising on de-recognition of 
the asset (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the item) 
is	 r ecognised	 in	 pr o fit	 or	 loss	 in	 the	
period the item is derecognised.
2.6  Intangible assets
a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the future 
economic	 benefits	 arising	 fr om	 a	
business combination that are not 
individually	 identified	 and	 sep arat ely	
recognised. Goodwill represents the 
excess of the cost of an acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s 
shar e	 o f	 the	 net	 identifiable	 assets	 o f	
the acquired subsidiary at the date of 
acquisition. Goodwill on acquisition of 
subsidiaries is included in intangible 
assets. Goodwill is tested annually 
for impairment and carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. 
Impairment losses on goodwill are 
not reversed. Gains and losses on 
the disposal of an entity include 
the carrying amount of goodwill 
relating to the entity sold. Goodwill 
is allocated to cash-generating units 
for the purpose of impairment testing. 
The allocation is made to those cash-
generating units or groups of cash-
generating units that are expected to 
benefit	 fr om	 the	 business	 combination	
in which the goodwill arose.
b) Other intangibles
Intangible assets acquired individually, 
with a group of other assets or in a 
business combination are carried at 
cost less accumulated amortization 
and any impairment in value. The 
intangible assets are amortised 
over their estimated useful lives in 
pr opor tion	 t o	 the	 economic	 benefits	
consumed in each period. The 
estimated useful lives of the intangible 
assets are as follows:
Amortisation of intangible assets is 
included within ‘Depreciation and 
Amortisation’.
2.7  Impairment of non-financial 
assets
Assets	 that	 hav e	 an	 indefinit e	 useful	
life, for example goodwill, are not 
subject to amortization and are 
tested annually for impairment. Assets 
that are subject to amortization are 
reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. An impairment 
loss is recognised for the amount by 
which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of 
an asset’s fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. For the purposes 
of assessing impairment, assets are 
grouped at the lowest levels for which 
ther e	 ar e	 sep arat ely	 identifiable	 cash	
flows	 (cash-generating	 units).	 Non-
financial	 assets	 other	 than	 goodwill	
that suffered impairment are reviewed 
for possible reversal of the impairment 
at each reporting date.
2.8  Financial assets
The	 Gr oup	 classifies	 its	 financia l	 assets	
in the following categories: loans and 
receivables, and available for sale. The 
classification	 depends	 on	 the	 purpose	
for	 which	 the	 financial	 asset	 was	
acquired. Management determines 
the	 classification	 o f	 its	 financia l	 assets	
at initial recognition.
a) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-
deriv ativ e	 finan cial	 assets	 with	 fix ed	
or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market. They 
are included in current assets, except 
for maturities greater than 12 months 
after the reporting date. These are 
classified	 as	 non-curr ent	 assets.	
The Group’s loans and receivables 
comprise trade and other receivables, 
investment in bank deposits and cash 
and cash equivalents in the statement 
o f	 finan cial	 position	 (not es	 2.12,	 2.13	
and 2.14). Loans and receivables 
are initially recognised at fair value 
plus transaction costs. Loans and 
receivables are carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest 
method. 
b)	A v ailable-for -sale	financial	assets
A v ailable-for -sale	 financial	 assets	
are non-derivatives that are either 
designated in this category or not 
classified	 in	 any	 o f	 the	 other	 cat egories.	
They are included in non-current 
assets unless management intends to 
dispose of the investment within 12 
months of the reporting date. 
Changes in the fair value of monetary 
and	 non-monetar y	 securities	 classified	
as available-for-sale are recognised in 
other comprehensive income. When 
Useful life Asset category
Licences
Power purchase agreements

4 – 10 years Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 43 42
securities	 classified	 as	 av ailable-
for-sale are sold or impaired, the 
accumulated fair value adjustments 
recognised as other comprehensive 
income	 	 ar e	 included	 in	 the	 pr o fit	
or loss as ‘gains and losses from 
investment securities’. Dividends on 
available-for-sale mutual fund units 
ar e	 r ecognised	 in	 the	 pr o fit	 or	 loss	 as	
a part of other income.
R egular	 pur chases	 and	 sales	 o f	 financial	
assets are recognised on the trade-
date – the date on which the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. 
Investments are initially recognised 
at fair value plus transaction costs for 
all	 finan cial	 assets	 not	 carried 	 at	 fair	
v alue	 thr ough	 pr o fit	 or	 loss.	 Financial	
assets are derecognised when the 
rights	 t o	 r eceiv e	 cash	 flows	 fr om	 the	
investments have expired or have 
been transferred and the Group has 
transferred substantially all risks and 
rewards of ownership. Available-for-
sale	 fina ncial	 assets	 ar e	 subsequently	
carried at fair value. 
The fair value of the mutual fund units 
is based on the net asset value publicly 
made available by the respective 
mutual fund managers.
The Group assesses at each reporting 
date whether there is objective 
evidence	 that	 a	 financial	 asset	 or	 a	
gr oup	 o f	 financ ial	 assets	 is	 imp air ed.	
Impairment testing of trade receivables 
is described in note 2.12.
The	 Gr oup	 der ecognises	 financial	
assets when it transfers substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of 
the	 fina ncial	 asset.	 On	 de-r ecognition	
o f	 a	 financial	 asset	 the	 differ ence	
between the carrying amount and the 
consideration received is recognised 
in	pr o fit	or	loss.
2.9   Options with non-controlling 
interests in subsidiaries
The Group has entered into put 
and call options over certain non-
controlling interests in subsidiaries. 
The	 option	 ex er cise	 price	 is	 fix ed	 and	
the options are exercisable within a 
fix ed	 timeframe.	 The	 pot ential	 cash	
payments related to options issued 
by the Group over the equity of 
subsidiary companies are accounted 
for	 as	 financial	 liabilities	 at	 the	 pr esent	
value of the redemption in line with 
the requirements of IAS 32 and 
39. The amount that may become 
payable under the option on exercise 
is initially recognised at fair value with 
a corresponding debit to ‘Option 
R eser v e’	 under	 equity .	 Such	 financial	
liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortized cost, using the effective 
interest rate method.  
2.10 Derivative financial 
instruments
a) Forward contracts 
The Group purchases foreign 
exchange forward contracts to 
mitigate the risk of changes in foreign 
exchange rates associated with its 
loans denominated in US dollars. 
These derivative contracts do not 
qualify for hedge accounting under 
IAS 39, and are initially recognised 
at fair value on the date the contract 
is entered into and subsequently re-
measured at their fair value. Gains 
or losses arising from changes in the 
fair value of the derivative contracts 
ar e	 r ecognised	 in	 pr o fit	 or	 loss. 
b) Sale commitments
IAS 39 requires contracts to buy or 
sell	 non-financial	 it ems	 t o	 be	 tr eat ed	
as derivatives and accordingly fair 
valued on the reporting date, unless 
the contracts qualify for ‘own use’ 
ex emption.	 The	 Gr oup	 qualifies	 for	
the limited ‘own use’ exemption from 
derivative accounting on the basis 
that its emission reduction purchase 
and sale commitments are entered 
into and continue to be held for the 
purpose of the receipt or delivery of 
emission reductions in accordance 
with the Group’s expected purchase 
and sale requirements. Own use 
contracts are outside the scope of IAS 
39 and are therefore accounted for as 
executory contracts.
2.11  Inventories
a) Raw material, stores and 
consumables
Inventories of raw material, stores and 
consumables are valued at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
includes expenses incurred in bringing 
each product to its present location 
and condition and is determined on a 
weighted average basis. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business less 
any applicable selling expenses.
b) Emission Reductions (“ER”) and 
R enewable	Ener gy	Cer tificat es	(“REC”)
Inventories of ER and REC are stated at 
the lower of cost or net realisable value. 
Net realisable value is the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course 
of business less the estimated costs 
of completion and selling expenses. 
ER are generated and held for sale 
in the ordinary course of business. 
Electricity and ERs/RECs are treated as 
joint products, as they are generated 
simultaneously. Cost of generation is 
allocated in the ratio of relative net sale 
value of the products. Cost comprises 
all production, acquisition and 
conversion costs and is aggregated 
on a weighted average basis. To the 
extent that any impairment arises, 
losses are recognised in the period 
they occur. The costs associated with 
generating inventories are charged to 
the	 pr o fit	 or	 loss 	 in	 the	 same	 period	 as	
the related revenues are recognised.
2.12   Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognized 
initially at fair value. They are 
subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest 
method, net of provision for 
impairment, if the effect of discounting 
is considered material. The carrying 
amounts, net of provision for 
impairment, reported in the statement 
o f	 financial	 position	 appr o ximat e	 the	
fair value due to their short realisation  Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 43 42 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 43
period. A provision for impairment of 
trade receivables is established when 
there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original 
terms of receivables. The provision is 
measured as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future 
cash	 flows	 (ex cluding	 futur e	 cr edit	
losses that have not been incurred) 
discounted at the receivables’ original 
effective interest rate. The amount 
of the provision is recognized in the 
pr o fit	or	loss.
2.13  Investment in bank deposits
Investments in bank deposits 
represent term deposits placed with 
b anks	 ear ning	 a	 fix ed	 rat e	 o f	 int er est.	
Investments in bank deposits with 
maturities of less than a year are 
disclosed as current assets and more 
than one year as non-current assets. 
At the reporting date, these deposits 
are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. 
Cash and cash equivalents which are 
pledged with the banks for availing 
shor t	 t er m	 lo ans	 ar e	 classified	 as	 p ar t	
of investment in bank deposits. 
2.14  Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include 
cash in hand and at bank, and short–
term deposits with an original maturity 
period of three months or less. Bank 
overdrafts that are an integral part of 
cash management and where there is 
a legal right of set–off against positive 
cash balances are included in cash 
and cash equivalents. Otherwise bank 
ov er draf ts	 ar e	 classified	 as	 borr owings.
2.15  Share capital
Or dinar y	 shar es	 ar e	 classified	 as	 equity	
and represent the nominal value of 
shares that have been issued.
Share premium includes any 
premiums received on the issue of 
ordinary shares. Any transaction costs 
associated with the issuing of shares 
are deducted from share premium, net 
o f	any	r elat ed	income	tax	benefits.
Share-based payment reserve 
represent fair value of employee 
services received in consideration for 
the equity instruments (options) of the 
Group.
The revaluation reserve within equity 
comprises gains and losses due to the 
revaluation of intangible assets.
Foreign currency translation 
differences arising on the translation 
of the Group’s foreign entities are 
included in the translation reserve.
Other reserves include all other 
transaction with the owners in 
their capacity as owners, impact of 
changes in the ownership interest in 
subsidiaries that do not result in loss 
of control and government grants 
accounted under capital approach.
Option reserve represents fair value of 
non-controlling interests put on initial 
recognition.  
Retained earnings include all current 
and	prior	period	r etained	pr o fits.
All transactions with owners of the 
Parent are recorded separately within 
equity.
2.16  Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised 
initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, if the effect 
of discounting is considered material.
2.17  Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially 
at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
stated at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds 
(net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value is recognised in 
pr o fit	 or	 loss	 ov er	 the	 period	 o f	 the	
borrowings using the effective interest 
method.
The fair value of the liability portion of a 
non-convertible bond with detachable 
warrants is determined using a market 
interest rate for an equivalent non-
convertible bond without detachable 
warrants. This amount is recorded as 
a liability on an amortised cost basis 
until extinguished on maturity of the 
bonds. The remainder of the proceeds 
is allocated to the warrants. This is 
recognised in shareholders’ equity. 
Borr owings	 ar e	 classified	 as	 curr ent	
liabilities unless the Group has an 
unconditional right to defer settlement 
of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the reporting date.
2.18 Current and deferred income
tax
T ax	 expense	 r ecognised	 in	 pr o fit	 or	
loss comprises the sum of deferred 
tax and current tax not recognised 
in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity. 
The current income tax charge is 
calculated on the basis of the tax laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date in the countries 
where the Company’s subsidiaries 
operate and generate taxable income. 
Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with 
respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject 
to interpretation and establishes 
provisions where appropriate on the 
basis of amounts expected to be paid 
to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided in 
full, using the liability method, on 
temporary differences arising between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the 
consolidat ed	 financial	 stat ements.	
However, the deferred income tax 
is not accounted for if it arises from 
initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction other than 
a business combination that at the 
time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting	 nor	 taxable	 pr o fit/loss.	
Deferred income tax is determined  Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 45 44
using tax rates (and laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date and are 
expected to apply when the related 
deferred income tax asset is realised 
or the deferred income tax liability is 
settled.
Deferred income tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is 
pr ob able	 that	 futur e	 taxable 	 pr o fit	
will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on 
temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference is controlled by 
the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
2.19 Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses, social 
security contributions, paid annual 
leave and sick leave are accrued in 
the period in which the associated 
services are rendered by employees 
of the Group. The Group operates two 
r etir ement	benefit	plans.
a) Gratuity plan
The	 Gratuity	 Plan	 is	 a	 defined	 benefit	
plan that, at retirement or termination 
of employment, provides eligible 
employees with a lump sum payment, 
which is a function of the last drawn 
salary and completed years of 
service. The liability recognised in 
the	 stat ement	 o f	 financial	 position	
in respect of the gratuity plan is the 
pr esent	 v alue	 o f	 the	 defined	 benefit	
obligation at the reporting date 
less the fair value of plan assets, if 
any, together with adjustments for 
unrecognised past–service costs. 
The	 defined	 benefit	 obligation	 is	
calculated annually by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. The present value 
o f	 the	 define d	 benefit	 obligation	
is determined by discounting the 
estimat ed	 futur e	 cash	 outflow s	 using	
interest rates of Government of India 
securities that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the 
related gratuity liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from 
experience adjustments and changes 
in actuarial assumptions are charged 
or	 cr edit ed	 t o	 the	 pr o fit	 or	 loss 	 in	 the	
period in which they arise.
b) State administered Provident Fund
Under Indian law, employees are 
entitled	 t o	 r eceiv e	 benefits	 under	
the Provident Fund, which is a 
defined	 contrib ution	 plan.	 Both	 the	
employee and the employer make 
monthly contributions to the plan at a 
predetermined rate (currently 12.0 per 
cent.) of the employees’ basic salary. 
The Group has no further obligation 
under the Provident Fund beyond its 
contribution, which is expensed when 
accrued.
c) Share-based compensation
The Group operates an equity-
settled, share-based compensation 
plan, under which the entity 
receives services from employees as 
consideration for equity instruments 
(options) of the Group. The fair value 
of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options 
is recognised as an expense. The total 
amount to be expensed is determined 
by reference to the fair value of the 
options granted, including the impact 
of market conditions. Non-market 
vesting conditions are included in 
assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to vest. The 
total amount expensed is recognised 
on a graded vesting basis over the 
vesting period, which is the period 
ov er	 which	 all	 o f	 the	 specified	 v esting	
conditions	 ar e	 t o	 be	 satisfied.	 A t	 each	
reporting date, the entity revises its 
estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to vest based on 
the non-market vesting conditions. It 
recognises the impact of the revision 
t o	 original	 estim at es,	 if	 any ,	 in	 pr o fit	 or	
loss, with a corresponding adjustment 
to equity. If the terms of an equity-
settled	 awar d	 ar e	 modified,	 at	 a	
minimum an expense is recognised as 
if	 the	 t er ms	 had	 not	 been	 modified.	 	
An additional expense is recognised 
for	 any	 modification	 that	 incr eases	
the total fair value of the share-based 
payment arrangement, or is otherwise 
beneficial	 t o	 the	 employ ee,	 as	
measur ed	at	the	dat e	o f	modification.
The proceeds received net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs 
are credited to share capital (nominal 
value) and share premium when the 
options are exercised.
2.20  Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the 
Group has a present obligation (legal 
or constructive) as a  result of a past 
ev ent,	 it	 is	 pr ob able	 that	 an	 outflow	
of resources embodying economic 
benefits	 will	 be	 r equir ed	 t o	 settle	 the	
obligation, and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. Where the Group expects 
some or all of a provision to be 
reimbursed, for example under an 
insurance contract, the reimbursement 
is recognised as a separate asset 
but only when the reimbursement is 
virtually certain. The expense relating 
to any provision is presented in the 
statement of comprehensive income 
net of any reimbursement. If the 
effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future 
cash	 flows	 at	 a	 pr e-tax	 rat e	 that	
r eflects	 curr ent	 mark et	 assessm ents	 o f	
the time value of money and, where 
appr opriat e,	 the	 risks	 specific	 t o	 the	
liability. Where discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to 
the passage of time is recognised as 
other	finance	expense.
2.21 Revenue recognition
a) Sale of electricity
Revenue from the sale of electricity 
is recognised on the basis of the 
number of units of power exported in 
accordance with joint meter readings 
undertaken on a monthly basis by 
representatives of the buyer and the  Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 45 44 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 45
Group at the rates prevailing on the 
date of export as determined by the 
power purchase agreement. 
b) Sale of emission reductions
Revenue from sale of CER is 
recognized after registration of 
the project with United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC), generation of 
emission reductions, execution of a 
fir m	 contract	 o f	 sale	 and	 billing	 t o	 a	
customer.
VER are emission reductions achieved 
by the power generation plants before 
the effective date of registration by 
the UNFCCC. The quantity of the 
VER is based on the estimation of 
the	 management,	 v erification	 by	 an	
independent assessor and subject to 
the satisfaction of the buyer. Revenue 
is	 r ecognized	 upon	 ex ecution	 o f	 a	 fir m	
contract of sale and on billed VER to 
the customers
c) Sale of REC
Revenue from sale of RECs is 
recognized after registration of 
the project with central and state 
government authorities, generation of 
power and execution of a contract for 
sale through Indian Energy Exchange 
(IEX).
d) Interest income
Interest income is recognised as the 
interest accrues to the net carrying 
amount	 o f	 the	 financial	 asset	 using	
the net effective interest rate method.
2.22 Leases
Leases	 in	 which	 a	 significant	 por tion	
of the risks and rewards of ownership 
ar e	 r etained	 by	 the	 lessor	 ar e	 classified	
as operating leases. Payments made 
under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lessor) 
ar e	 char ged	 t o	 the	 pr o fit	 or	 loss	 on	 a	
straight-line basis over the period of 
the lease.
2.23  Government grants
Grants from the government are 
recognised at their fair value where 
there is a reasonable assurance that 
the grant will be received and the 
Group will comply with all attached 
conditions. The Group follows the 
capital approach under which a grant 
is credited directly to equity when 
the grants received by the Group 
represent incentives provided by 
government, unrelated to costs, to 
promote power generation based on 
certain renewable energy sources.
Other government grants are 
recognised as income over the period 
necessary to match them with the 
costs for which they are intended to 
compensate, on a systematic basis. 
Government grants that are receivable 
as compensation for expenses or 
losses already incurred or for the 
purpose	 o f	 giving	 immediat e	 financial	
support to the Company with no 
future related costs are recognised in 
pr o fit	 or	 loss	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	
they become receivable.
2.24  Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition, construction or 
production of a qualifying asset are 
capitalised during the period of time 
that is necessary to complete and 
prepare the asset for its intended use 
or sale. Other borrowing costs are 
expensed in the period in which they 
ar e	 incurr ed	 and	 r epor t ed	 in	 finance	
costs.
3. New standards and interpretations    
 not yet adopted
At the date of authorisation of 
these	 financial	 stat ements,	 cer tain	
new standards, amendments and 
interpretations to existing standards 
have been published by the 
International Accounting Standards 
Board (“IASB”) but are not yet effective, 
and have not been adopted early by 
the Group.
Management anticipates that all of 
the relevant pronouncements will be 
adopted in the Group’s accounting 
policies	 for	 the	 fir st	 period	 beginning	
after the effective date of the 
pronouncement. Information on 
new standards, amendments and 
interpretations that are expected to 
be	 r elev ant	 t o	 the	 Gr oup ’ s	 financial	
statements is provided below. 
Certain other new standards and 
interpretations have been issued but 
are not expected to have a material 
imp act	 on	 the	 Gr oup ’ s	 financial	
statements.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
(IFRS 9)
The IASB aims to replace International 
Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement in its entirety. IFRS 
9 is being issued in phases. To date, 
the chapters dealing with recognition, 
classification,	 measur ement	 and	 de-
r ecognition	 o f	 financial	 assets	 and	
liabilities have been issued. These 
chapters are effective for annual 
periods beginning 1 January 2015. 
Chapters dealing with impairment 
methodology and hedge accounting 
are still being developed. 
Further, in November 2011, the 
IASB tentatively decided to consider 
making	 limit ed	 modifications	 t o	
IFRS	 9’ s	 financ ial	 asset	 classi fication	
model to address application issues. 
The Group’s management have yet 
to assess the impact of this new 
standard on the Group’s consolidated 
financial	 stat ements.	 How ev er ,	 the	
management does not expect to 
implement IFRS 9 until all of its 
chapters have been published and 
they can comprehensively assess the 
impact of all changes.
Consolidation Standards
A package of new consolidation 
standards is effective for annual 
periods beginning or after 1 January 
2013. Information on these new 
standards is presented below. 
Management is in the process of its  Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 47 46
assessment of the impact of these new 
and revised standards on the Group’s 
consolidat ed	financial	stat ements.
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial 
Statements’ (IFRS 10)
IFRS 10 supersedes IAS 27 
‘Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements’ (IAS 27) and SIC 12 
‘Consolidation – Special Purpose 
Entities’ .	 IFRS	 10	 r evises	 the	 definition	
of control and provides extensive 
new guidance on its application. 
These new requirements have the 
potential to affect which of the 
Group’s investees are considered to 
be subsidiaries and therefore change 
the scope of consolidation. However, 
the requirements on consolidation 
procedures, accounting for changes 
in non-controlling interests and 
accounting for loss of control of 
a subsidiary remain the same. 
Management’s provisional analysis 
is that IFRS 10 will not change the 
classification	 (as	 subsidiaries	 or	
otherwise) of any of the Group’s 
existing investees at 31 March 2013.
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ (IFRS 
11)
IFRS 11 supersedes IAS 31 ‘Interests in 
Joint Ventures’ (IAS 31). It aligns more 
closely the accounting by the investors 
with their rights and obligations 
relating to the joint arrangement. 
In addition, IAS 31’s option of using 
proportionate consolidation for joint 
ventures has been eliminated. IFRS 
11 now requires the use of the equity 
accounting method, which is currently 
used for investments in associates. As 
at 31 March 2013 the Group’s does not 
have any joint arrangement within the 
scope of IFRS 11. 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in 
Other Entities’ (IFRS 12)
IFRS 12 integrates and makes 
consistent the disclosure requirements 
for various types of investments, 
including unconsolidated structured 
entities. It introduces new disclosure 
requirements about the risks to 
which an entity is exposed from its 
involvement with structured entities.
Transition guidance for IFRS 10, 11, 
12
Subsequent to issuing the new 
standards the IASB made some changes 
to the transitional provisions in IFRS 
10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12. The guidance 
confir ms	 that	 the	 entity	 is	 not	 r equir ed	
to apply IFRS 10 retrospectively in 
cer tain	 cir cumstances	 and	 clarifies	
the requirements to present adjusted 
comparatives. The guidance also 
makes changes to IFRS 11 and IFRS 
12 which provide similar relief from 
the presentation or adjustment of 
comparative information for periods 
prior to the immediately preceding 
period. Further, it provides additional 
relief by removing the requirement 
to present comparatives for the 
disclosures relating to unconsolidated 
structured entities for any period 
befor e	 the	 fir st	 annual	 period	 for	
which IFRS 12 is applied.
The new guidance is also effective for 
annual periods on or after 1 January 
2013.
Consequential amendments to IAS 
27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ 
(IAS 27) and IAS 28 ‘Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures’ (IAS 
28)
IAS 27 now only addresses separate 
financial	 stat ements.	 IAS	 28	 brings	
investments in joint ventures into 
its scope. However, IAS 28’s equity 
accounting methodology remains 
unchanged.
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ 
(IFRS 13)
IFRS	 13	 clarifies	 the	 definition	 o f	 fair	
value and provides related guidance 
and enhanced disclosures about fair 
value measurements. It does not affect 
which items are required to be fair-
valued. IFRS 13 applies prospectively 
for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2013. Management 
is in the process of reviewing 
its valuation methodologies for 
conformity with the new requirements 
and its assessment of their impact 
on	 the	 Gr oup ’ s	 consolidat ed	 financial	
statements.
Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation 
of Financial Statements’ (IAS 1 
Amendments)
The IAS 1 Amendments require an 
entity to group items presented in 
other comprehensive income into 
those that, in accordance with other 
IFRS:	 (a )	 will	 not	 be	 r eclassified	
subsequently	 t o	 pr o fit	 or	 loss	 and	 (b)	
will	 be	 r eclassified	 subsequently	 t o	
pr o fit	 or	 loss	 when	 specific	 conditions	
are met. It is applicable for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 
2012. The Group’s management 
expects this will change the current 
presentation of items in other 
comprehensive income; however, it 
will not affect the measurement or 
recognition of such items. 
Amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee 
Benefit’s (IAS 19 Amendments)
The IAS 19 Amendments include a 
number of targeted improvements 
throughout the Standard. The main 
changes	 r elat e	 t o	 defined	 benefit	
plans. They:
•	 elimin at e	 the	 ‘ corridor	 method’ ,	
requiring entities to recognise all gains 
and losses arising in the reporting 
period
•	 str eamline	 the	 pr esentation	 o f	
changes in plan assets and liabilities
•	 	 enhance	 the	 disclosur e	 r equir ements,	
including information about the 
charact eristics	 o f	 defined	 benefi t	 plans	
and the risks that entities are exposed 
to through participation in them.
The amended version of IAS 19 is 
effectiv e	 for	 financial	 y ear s	 beginning	
on or after 1 January 2013. The 
management does not expect the 
application of this revised standard 
to have any material impact on its 
financial	 stat ements	 when	 it	 becomes	
effective.
Offsetting Financial Assets and 
Financial Liabilities (Amendments 
to IAS 32)
The Amendments to IAS 32 add 
application guidance to address  Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 47 46 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 47
inconsistencies in applying IAS 32’s 
crit eria	 for	 o ffsetting	 financial 	 assets	
and	 financial	 liabilities	 in	 the	 following	
two areas:
•	 the	 meaning	 o f	 ‘ curr ently	 has	 a	
legally enforceable right of set-off’
•	 	 that	 some	 gr oss	 settlement	 syst ems	
may be considered equivalent to net 
settlement.
The Amendments are effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2014 and are required to be 
applied retrospectively. Management 
does not anticipate a material impact 
on	 the	 Gr oup ’ s	 consolidat ed	 financial	
statements from these Amendments.
Disclosures – Offsetting Financial 
Assets and Financial Liabilities 
(Amendments to IFRS 7)
Qualitative and quantitative 
disclosures have been added to IFRS 
7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ 
(IFRS 7) relating to gross and net 
amounts	 o f	 r ecognised	 financial	
instruments that are (a) set off in the 
stat ement	 o f	 financial	 position	 and	
(b) subject to enforceable master 
netting arrangements and similar 
agreements, even if not set off in 
the	 stat ement	 o f	 financial	 position.	
The Amendments are effective for 
annual reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2013 and interim 
periods within those annual periods. 
The required disclosures should be 
provided retrospectively. Management 
does not anticipate a material impact 
on	 the	 Gr oup ’ s	 consolidat ed	 financial	
statements from these Amendments.
Annual Improvements 2009-2011 
(the Annual Improvements)
The Annual Improvements 2009-
2011 (the Annual Improvements) 
made several minor amendments to 
a number of IFRSs. The amendments 
relevant to the Group are summarised 
below:
Clarification of the requirements 
for opening statement of financial 
position:
•	 clarifie s	 that	 the	 appr opriat e	 dat e	
for	 the	 opening	 stat ement	 o f	 financial	
position is the beginning of the 
preceding period (related notes are no 
longer required to be presented)
•	 	 addr esses	 comp arativ e	 r equir ements	
for the opening statement of 
financial	 position	 when	 an	 entity	
changes accounting policies or 
makes retrospective restatements or 
r eclassifications,	 in	 accor danc e	 with	
IAS 8.
Clarification of the requirements for 
comparative information provided 
beyond minimum requirements:
•	 clarifi es	 that 	 additional	 financial	
statement information need not be 
presented in the form of a complete 
set	 o f	 financial	 stat ements	 for	 periods	
beyond the minimum requirements
•	 r equir es	 that	 any	 add itional	
information presented should be 
presented in accordance with IFRS and 
the entity should present comparative 
information in the related notes for 
that additional information.
Tax effect of distribution to holders 
of equity instruments:
•	 	 addr esses	 a	 per ceiv ed	 inconsist ency	
between IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ (IAS 
12) and IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Presentation’ (IAS 32) with regards 
to recognising the consequences of 
income tax relating to distributions 
to holders of an equity instrument 
and to transaction costs of an equity 
transaction
•	 	 clarifi es	 that	 the	 int ention	 o f	 IAS	 32	
is to follow the requirements in IAS 12 
for accounting for income tax relating 
to distributions to holders of an equity 
instrument and to transaction costs of 
an equity transaction.
Segment information for total 
assets and liabilities:
•	 	 clarifies	 that	 the	 t otal	 assets	 and	
liabilities for a particular reportable 
segment are required to be disclosed 
if, and only if: (i) a measure of total 
assets or of total liabilities (or both) 
is regularly provided to the chief 
operating decision maker; (ii) there 
has been a material change from 
those measures disclosed in the last 
annual	 financia l	 stat ements	 for	 that	
reportable segment.
The Annual Improvements noted 
above are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
Management does not anticipate 
a material impact on the Group’s 
consolidat ed	 financial	 stat ements	
from these Amendments.
4.  Financial risk management
4.1 Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a 
v ariety	 o f	 finan cial	 risks;	 mark et	 risk ,	
credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s 
overall risk management programme 
focuses on the unpredictability 
o f	 financial	 mark ets	 and	 seeks	 t o	
minimise potential adverse effects on 
the	 Gr oup ’ s	 fina ncial	 per for mance.	 The	
financial	 instruments	 o f	 the	 Gr oup,	
other than derivatives, comprise loans 
fr om	 b anks	 and	 financial	 institutions,	
non-convertible bonds, demand 
deposits, short-term bank deposits, 
trade and other receivables, available 
for sale investments, trade and other 
payables.
4.1.1 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair 
v alues	 o f	 futur e	 cash	 flows	 o f	 a	
financial	 instrument	 will	 fluctuat e	
because of volatility of prices in the 
financial	 mark ets.	 Mark et	 risk	 can	
be further segregated as: a) Foreign 
exchange risk and b) Interest rate risk
a) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that 
the	 fair	 v alue	 or	 futur e	 cash	 flows	 o f	
a	 financ ial	 instrument	 will	 fluctuat e	
because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The Group has made 
borrowings denominated in US dollar 
(“$”)	 in	 r espect	 o f	 which	 it	 is	 exposed	
to foreign currency exchange risk.   Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 49 48
If the € had weakened or strengthened 
by	 0.50%	 against	 the	 $,	 with	 all	 other	
variables held constant, Property, plant 
and equipment for the year ended 31 
March 2013 would have been lower 
or higher by €273,105 as a result of 
foreign exchange gains or losses on 
translation	 o f	 the	 $	 denominat ed	
borrowings.
The sensitivity analysis is based on 
a reasonably possible change in 
the underlying foreign currencies 
computed from historical data.
b) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair 
v alue	 or	 futur e	 cash	 flows	 o f	 a	 financial	
instrument	 will	 fluctuat e	 because	 o f	
changes in market interest rates.  As 
the	 Gr oup	 has	 no	 significant	 int er est -
bearing assets other than investment in 
bank deposits, the Group’s income and 
operating	 cash	 flows	 ar e	 substantially	
independent of changes in market 
interest rates. The Company considers 
the impact of fair value interest rate 
risk on investment in bank deposits as 
not material. The Group’s interest rate 
risk arises from long-term borrowings. 
Borrowings issued at variable rates 
expose	 the	 Gr oup	 t o	 cash	 flow	 int er est	
rat e	 risk .	 Borr owings	 issued	 at	 fix ed	
rates expose the Group to fair value 
interest rate risk. During the year, 
the Group’s borrowings at variable 
rate were largely denominated in 
the functional currency of its Indian 
entities, being INR, although two 
lo ans	w er e	denominat ed	in	$.
If interest rates on borrowings had 
been 50 basis points higher or lower 
with all other variables held constant, 
post -tax	 pr o fit	 for	 the	 y ear	 w ould	 hav e	
been lower or higher by €544,358 
mainly as a result of the higher or 
lower interest expense on long term 
flo ating	rat e	borr owings.
The sensitivity analysis is based on 
a reasonably possible change in the 
market interest rates computed from 
historical data.
4.1.2 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counter-
party will not meet its obligations 
under	 a	 fina ncial	 instrument	 or	
customer contract, leading to a 
financial	 loss.	 The	 Gr oup ’ s	 cr edit	
risk arises from accounts receivable 
balances on sale of electricity, CER 
and REC. In respect of trade and 
other receivables, the Group is not 
exposed	 t o	 any	 significant	 cr edit	 risk	
exposure to any single counterparty 
or any group of counterparties having 
similar characteristics. The Indian 
entities have entered into PPA with 
transmission companies incorporated 
by the Indian State Governments 
and other electricity transmission 
and trading companies to export the 
electricity generated. The Group is 
therefore committed to sell power 
to these customers and regards any 
potential risk of default as being 
predominantly a governmental one. 
The Group is paid monthly by the 
transmission companies for the 
electricity it supplies. The CER are 
sold under contractual emission 
reduction purchase agreements 
(“ERPA”) concluded with the purchaser 
of the CER. The Group assesses the 
credit quality of the purchaser based 
on	 its	 financia l	 position	 and	 other	
information. 
The Group maintains banking 
relationships with only creditworthy 
banks which it reviews on an on–
going basis. The Group enters into 
deriv ativ e	 financial	 instruments	 wher e	
the counter-party is generally a bank. 
Consequently, the credit risk on the 
derivatives and bank deposits is not 
considered material.
4.1.3 Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management 
implies	 maintaining	 sufficient	 cash	
and cash equivalents and maintaining 
adequate credit facilities.
The Group intends to be acquisitive 
in the immediate future. In respect 
of its existing operations, the Group 
funds its activities primarily through 
long-term loans secured against 
each power plant. In addition, each 
of the operating plants has working 
capital loans available to it which are 
renewable annually, together with 
certain intra-group loans. The Group’s 
objective in relation to its existing 
operating business is to maintain 
sufficient	 funding	 t o	 allow	 the	 plants	
to operate at an optimal level and in 
particular purchase the necessary raw 
materials required.
In respect of each acquisition, the 
Group prepares a model to evaluate 
the necessary funding required. The 
Group’s strategy is to primarily fund 
such acquisitions by assuming debt 
in the acquired companies or by 
borr owing	 specific	 long-t er m	 funds	
secured on the power plant to be 
acquired. In relation to the payment 
towards equity component of 
companies to be acquired, the Group 
ordinarily seeks to fund this by the 
injection of external funds by debt or 
equity.
The	 Gr oup	 has	 identified	 a	 lar ge	 range	
of acquisition opportunities which it is 
continually evaluating and which are 
subject to constant change. In respect 
of its overall business the Group 
therefore does not, at the current 
time, maintain any overall liquidity 
forecasts. The table below analyses 
the	 Gr oup ’ s	 financial	 liabilitie s	 int o	
relevant maturity groupings based on 
the remaining period at the reporting 
date to the contractual maturity date. 
The Group manages its liquidity 
needs by monitoring scheduled 
debt  servicing payments for long-
t er m	 financial	 liabilities	 and	 the	 data	
used	 for	 analysing	 these	 cash	 flows	
is consistent with that used in the 
contractual maturity analysis below. Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 49 48 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 49
4.15   Fair value estimation
The	 fair	 v alue	 o f	 financial	 instruments	
that are not traded in an active 
market (for example, forward 
contracts) is determined by using 
valuation techniques. The Group 
uses its judgment to determine 
an appropriate method and make 
assumptions that are based on market 
conditions existing at each reporting 
date. The fair value of forward foreign 
exchange contracts is determined 
using quoted forward exchange rates 
at the reporting date.
The carrying value less impairment 
provision of trade receivables and 
payables are assumed to approximate 
their fair values due to the short-term 
natur e.	 The	 fair	 v alue	 o f	 financial	
liabilities for disclosure purposes is 
estimated by discounting the future 
contractual	 cash	 flows	 at	 the	 curr ent	
market interest rate that is available 
t o	 the	 Gr oup	 for	 similar	 financial	
instruments.
5.  Critical accounting estimates 
and judgements
The	 pr ep ara tion	 o f	 financial	
statements requires management 
to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the 
dat e	 o f	 the	 fina ncial	 infor mation	 and	
the reported amounts of revenue and 
expenses during the reporting period. 
Management bases its estimates and 
judgments on historical experience 
and on various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis for making judgments 
about the carrying value of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily available 
from other sources.
The Group makes estimates and 
assumptions concerning the future. 
The resulting accounting estimates 
will,	 by	 definition,	 seldom	 equal	 the	
related actual results. The estimates 
and assumptions that have a 
significant	 risk	 o f	 causing	 a	 mat erial	
adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial	y ear	ar e	discussed	below .

4.14   Capital risk management
The Group’s objective when 
managing capital is to safeguard 
the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern in order to provide 
r etur ns	 for	 shar eholder s	 and	 benefits	
for stakeholders. The Group also 
proposes to maintain an optimal 
capital structure to reduce the cost of 
capital. Hence, the Group may adjust 
any dividend payments, return capital 
to shareholders or issue new shares. 
Total capital is the equity as shown 
in the consolidated statement of 
financial	 position.	 Curr ently ,	 the	 Gr oup	
primarily monitors its capital structure 
in terms of evaluating the funding of 
potential acquisitions. Management 
is continuously evolving strategies to 
optimize the returns and reduce the 
risks. It includes plans to optimize the 
financial	lev erage	o f	the	Gr oup.
The capital for the reporting year under review is summarised as follows:
31 March 2013 31 March 2012
Total equity 266,476,162 233,858,484
Less: Cash and cash equivalents      (23,921,007) (48,513,270)
Capital 242,555,155 185,345,214
Total equity 266,476,162 233,858,484
Add: Borrowings 247,863,208 153,069,265

Capital	t o	ov erall	financing	ratio 47% 48% Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 51 50
in	 a	 number	 o f	 jurisdictions.	 Significant	
judgment is required in determining 
provision for income taxes. There are 
many transactions and calculations for 
which the ultimate tax determination 
is uncertain during the ordinary course 
of business. The Group recognises 
liabilities for anticipated tax issues 
based on estimates of whether 
additional taxes will be due. Where the 
final	 tax	 out come	 o f	 these	 matt er s	 is	
different from the amounts that were 
initially recorded, such differences will 
impact the income tax and deferred 
tax provisions in the period in which 
such determination is made.
b)   Estimated impairment of goodwill
In accordance with the accounting 
policy stated in note 2.6, the Group 
tests annually whether goodwill 
has suffered any impairment. The 
recoverable amounts of cash-
generating units have been determined 
based on value-in-use calculations. 
These calculations require the use of 
estimates including future operating 
margins and discount rates (note 7). 
No impairment charge was accounted 
during the year.
c)  Application of business combination 
accounting rules, including 
identification	 o f	 intangible	 assets	
acquired in a business combination
The Group allocates the purchase price 
of the acquired companies towards 
the tangible and intangible assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed based 
on their estimated fair values. The 
Group engages third-party external 
appraisal	 fir ms	 t o	 assist	 in	 det er mining	
the fair values of the acquired assets 
and liabilities. Such valuation requires 
the	 Gr oup	 t o	 mak e	 significant	 estimat e	
and assumptions, especially with 
r espect	 t o	 identification	 and	 v aluation	
of intangible assets.
d)  Useful life of depreciable assets
Management reviews the useful life of 
depreciable assets at each reporting 
date, based on the expected utility of 
the assets to the Group. The carrying 
amounts are analysed in note 8. Actual 
results, however, may vary due to 
technical obsolescence, particularly 
relating to software and IT equipment.
              
e) Application of lease accounting 
rules
Significant	 judgment	 is	 r equir ed	 t o	
apply lease accounting rules under 
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an 
Arrangement contains a Lease and IAS 
17 Leases. In assessing the applicability 
to arrangements entered into by the 
Group management has exercised 
judgment to evaluate customer’s right 
to use the underlying assets, substance 
of the transaction including legally 
enforced arrangements and other 
significant	 t er ms	 and	 conditions	 o f	 the	
arrangement to conclude whether the 
arrangements meet the criteria under 
IFRIC 4.
f) Application of interpretation for 
service concession arrangements
Management has assessed 
applicability of IFRIC 12: Service 
Concession arrangements for 
certain arrangements that are part 
of business combinations acquired 
during the year. In assessing the 
applicability the management has 
ex er cised	 significant	 judgement	 in	
relation to the underlying ownership 
of the assets, the ability to enter into 
power purchase arrangements with 
any customer, ability to determine 
prices etc in concluding that the 
arrangements don’t meet the criteria 
for recognition as service concession 
arrangements.
g)	 Classification	 o f	 financial	
instruments as equity or liability
Significant	 judgment	 is	 r equir ed	 t o	
apply the rules under IAS 32: Financial 
Instruments: Presentation and IAS 39: 
Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement to assess whether 
an	 instrument	 is	 equity	 or	 a	 financial	
liability . The management has exercised 
significant	 judgment	 t o	 ev aluat e	
the terms and conditions of certain 
financial	 instruments	 with	 r efer ence	
to the applicability of contingent 
settlement provisions, evaluation of 
whether options under the contract 
will be derivative or a non-derivative, 
assessing if certain settlement terms 
are within the control of the Company 
and if not whether the occurrence 
of these events are extremely rare, 
highly abnormal and very unlikely, 
clarifications	 betw een	 the	 p ar ties	 t o	
the agreement subsequent to the date 
of the agreement etc to conclude that 
the	 instruments	 be	 classified	 as	 an	
equity or liability instrument.

The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are as follows:
The recoverable amount of a CGU 
is determined based on value-in-
use calculations. These calculations 
use	 pr e-tax	 cash	 flow	 pr ojections	
prepared by management based on 
balance life of the license or the plant 
and equipment where the license has 
indefinit e	 life.	 The	 gr owth	 rat e	 does	
not exceed the long-term average 
growth rate for the business in which 
the CGU operates.
Management has determined gross margins based on industry trends and the existing PPA with the transmission 
companies. The PPA is a long-term contract with agreed price per unit of power sold, and the growth rates used are 
consist ent	with	those	contracts.	The	discount	rat e	used	is	pr e-tax	and	r eflects	the	specific	risks	associat ed	with	the	entity. Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 55 54

Advance for purchase of equity 
represents interest free amounts paid 
under memorandum of understanding 
with various parties which have 
been	 identified 	 as	 pot ential	 entities	
to be acquired in the future. These 
advances do not provide the Group 
with additional rights and are adjusted 
against the purchase consideration 
when the transaction is consummated 
else these amounts are refunded by 
the parties. Other receivables include 
advances against purchase of raw 
materials, advances for expenses, and 
other advance recoverable.  
Borrowings of €1,616,842 (31 March 
2012: €441,878) are secured against 
inventory and trade receivables.
With the exception of the non-current 
portion of trade and other receivables 
all amounts are short-term and their 
carrying values are considered a 
reasonable approximation of fair 
values. 
Trade receivables that are due for 
more than one month are considered 
past due. As at 31 March 2013, trade 
receivables of €5,315,514 (31 March 
2012: €4,174,829) were past due but 
not impaired. €169,919 (31 March 
2012: €172,903) relate to power tariff 
differences that are subject to judicial 
orders, and in the opinion of the 
management there is a reasonable 
certainty of realisation [note 26(a)].
The ageing analysis of past due trade receivables as at the reporting date is as follows:

entitled to a variable number of shares 
that provided for certain minimum 
returns on occurrence of a default 
event.

into Company’s ordinary shares on 
or after 1 July 2015 in line with the 
option granted to a new investor

public offer (IPO), or any subsidiaries 
of GEPL in case of such subsidiaries’ 
qualifying IPO. At the end of the third 
year, all unconverted loan amount 
shall be redeemed at a valuation 
which would deliver the agreed IRR 
to StanChart. The IRR is contingent 
upon future events. Further, interest 
is payable semi-annually on both 
the facilities. The facility is secured 
by pledge of 130 million (2012: 70 
million) equity shares of GM held by 
the Company. As at 31 March 2013, 
the Group had drawn down the 
sanctioned	amount	o f	$70	million.
16.7. GE Equity International 
Mauritius	 (“GE”)	 has	 inv est ed	 $50	
million  in the wind holding company

interest in Wind Power Projects

100 percent interest in Wind Power 
Generations (Mauritius) Limited 
(“WPG”) to GE for a consideration 
o f	 $24.42	 million	 (€	 18.05	 million).

preferential rights as to payment of 
dividends and on liquidation over the 
Group. The Company has an option 
to call on the WPG shares held by 
GE in WPG between February 2016 
to February 2017 while GE has an 
option to put any of the WPP and 
WPG shares to the Company between 
February 2017 to February 2018 or 
on the occurrence of certain events 
as mentioned in the agreements. The 
options should be exercised at such 
prices which would provide GE with 
certain protective returns as per the 
terms of the agreements. 
Based on the underlying character 
of the instruments, the Group has 
classified	 the	 arrangement	 as	 an	
equity transaction and the ownership 
interest of the GE has been arrived 
at 43.4percent, which as per the 
shareholders agreement will get 
reduced to 25.1percent on further 
infusion of equity by the Group. The

controlling interests in subsidiaries.
16.8. During  2012, Infrastructure 
Development Finance Company 
Limited (“IDFC”) has approved a 
credit facility to GEPL which includes 
subscription to Optionally Convertible 
Debentures (OCD) to the extent of 
INR375 million (€5.49 million). As at 
31 March 2012, IDFC has subscribed 
to OCDs amounting to INR 188 
million (€2.74 million). IDFC has the 
right, but not obligation, to convert 
all outstanding OCDs, along with 
accrued interest and other monies 
if any, either in part or in full, into 
equity share capital of GEPL between 
a period commencing from the 24th 
month from the investment date and 
ending on the 36th month from the 
investment date at the conversion 
price, based on fair market value of 
GEPL’s shares. On the OCD redemption 
date, all unconverted OCDs shall be 
compulsorily redeemed by GEPL at 
the OCD redemption price. OCD shall 
be converted or redeemed at such 
value which would provide IDFC an 
IRR of 19percent on its investment. 
OCDs are secured by the pledge on 
90 million fully paid unencumbered 
equity shares of GEPL held by GM. The 
entire credit facility was repaid and the 
OCD were redeemed during the year. 
As at 31 March 2013, the liability on 
account of the IDFC facility was nil (31 
March 2012: €10.97 million).

( Left blank intentionally ) Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 63 62
Deferred income tax assets are 
recognised for tax loss carry forwards 
to the extent that the realisation of the 
r elat ed	 tax	 benefit	 thr ough	 the	 futur e	
taxable	pr o fits	is	pr ob able.
The Company is subject to Isle of Man 
corporate tax at the standard rate of 
zero percent. Further, dividends are 
not taxable in India in the hands of 
the recipient. However, the Indian 
subsidiaries will be subject to a 
‘dividend distribution tax’ currently 
at the rate of 15% (plus applicable 
surcharge and education cess) 
on the total amount distributed 
as dividend. As at 31 March 2013 
and 31 March 2012, there was no 
recognised deferred tax liability for 
taxes that would be payable on the 
unremitted earnings of certain of 
the Group’s subsidiaries, the Group 
has determined that undistributed 
pr o fits	 o f	 its	 subsidiaries	 will	 not	 be	
distributed in the foreseeable future 
as the Group earnings will continue to 
be	 full	 r e-inv est ed	 t o	 finance	 the	 on-
going growth of the Group.

dilutive potential ordinary shares: 
share options issued under a share-
based payment plan and swap options 
issued to redeemable preference 
shareholders of a subsidiary company.  
For share options, a calculation is 
done to determine the number of 
shares that could have been acquired 
at fair value (determined as the 
average annual market share price of 
the Company’s shares) based on the 
monetary value of the subscription 
rights attached to and including the 
unrecognised compensation expense 
on outstanding share options.  The 
number of shares calculated as above 
is compared with the number of shares 
that would have been issued assuming 
the exercise of the share options.  For 
swap options, a calculation is done to 
determine the number of shares that 
could have been acquired at fair value 
(determined as the average annual 
market share price of the Company’s 
shares) based on the monetary value 
received on issuance of redeemable 
preference shares.  The number 
of shares calculated as above is 
compared with the number of shares 
that would have been issued assuming 
the exercise of the share options.

26. Commitments and contingencies
a) GEPL and Roshni Powertech Private 
Limited operate biomass power 
plants located in the State of Andhra 
Pradesh, India. These entities through 
the Biomass Energy Developers 
Association have challenged the 
order of Andhra Pradesh Electricity 
Regulatory Commission (“APERC”) 
effecting a downward revision in billing 
rates. The Supreme Court of India has 
upheld the original billing mechanism 
as binding on the customer and has 
remanded the case back to APERC 
t o	 det er mine	 the	 final	 tariff	 per	 unit.	
Since APERC could not issue an 
executable order, in an interim order 
the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity 
(Appellate Tribunal) has directed for 
payment of provisional amounts to 
the energy producers. Thereafter, in 
2012-13, Appellate Tribunal passed 
or der s	 r efixing	 cer tain	 p aramet er s	 and	
directing APERC to re-determine the 
tariff payable since April 2010. These 
orders are challenged before Supreme 
Court and the cases are pending.
Meanwhile, APERC has issued an 
order dated 22 June 2013 deciding 
the tariff which will result in the Group 
pot entially	 benefiting	 fr om	 mor e	 than	
the tariff recognised as per the Interim 
order.
b) In respect of certain power 
generation units of the Group situated 
in Andhra Pradesh, India, the Group 
has appealed to the Commissioner of 
Income-tax (Appeals) [CIT-(A)] against 
the orders passed by income-tax 
assessing	 o ffice r	 for	 the	 assessment	
years 2005-06 to 2009-10. CIT (A) has 
issued an order in favour of the Group 
for the assessment year 2005-06. The 
Income	 T ax	 assessing	 o fficer ’ s	 appeal	
against the order of CIT (A) for the 
assessment year 2005-06 has been 
dismissed by the Income tax appellate 
tribunal.
Further the Income Tax department 
has also appealed to Income tax 
Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) for the 
assessment years 2006-07 to 2009-
10 against the orders of the CIT (A) 
which were favourable to the Group. 
Subsequent to 31 March 2013 the ITAT 
has referred the matters in the appeal 
t o	 the	 Income-tax	 assessing	 o fficer	 for	
statistical purposes.
 In respect of certain power generation 
unit of the Group situated in Himachal 
Pradesh, India, for the assessment 
year 2009-10 the CIT (A) has given a 
favourable order against the Income 
tax	 assessing	 o fficer ’ s	 or der	 in	 r elation	
to recognition income for CERs. The 
income tax department has appealed 
against the CIT (A) order in ITAT. 
In respect of certain power generation 
unit of the Group situated in 
Karnataka, India, for the assessment 
year 2009-10 the CIT (A) has given a 
favourable order against the Income 
tax	 assessing	 o fficer ’ s	 or der	 in	 r elation	
to recognition income for CERs. The 
income tax department has appealed 
against the CIT (A) order in ITAT.
c) In December 2010,  Sai Spurthi 
Power Private Limited (SSPPL), an entity 
acquired by the Group in March 2010, 
received a letter from Punjab National 
Bank informing SSPPL that three 
corporate guarantees aggregating 
to €10,765,027  were given by 
SSPPL in respect of loans availed by 
Sagar Power (Neerukatte) Limited, a 
company promoted and owned by 
erstwhile management of SSPPL. On 
v erification	 o f	 r ecor ds	 and	 discussions	
with the erstwhile management, the 
management believes that only one 
corporate guarantee of €1,009,491 
was provided to the bank. The 
management	 is	 confident	 that	 the	
contingent liability of SSPPL under the 
corporate guarantees issued will not 
exceed €1,009,491. Further, as per the 
terms of share purchase agreement 
with the promoters/erstwhile seller-
shareholders of SSPPL, the promoters/
erstwhile seller-shareholders of SSPPL 
are required to have the corporate 
guarantee(s) released without any 
liability to SSPPL or the Group.
During the year SSPPL received a 
communication from IREDA informing 
that SSPPL had given a corporate 
guarantee of €1,725,626 for the credit 
facilities availed by M/s. Bhadragiri 
P ow er	 Priv at e	 Limit ed.	 On	 v erification	
of records and discussions with the 
erstwhile Managing Director, SSPPL 
came to an opinion that the said 
Corporate Guarantee was not executed 
on behalf of SSPPL and hence SSPPL is 
not responsible for any liability under 
those documents.  This is a matter 
o f	 disput e	 which	 needs	 t o	 be	 finally	
settled.  The promoters/erstwhile 
seller-shareholders are responsible 
and obligated to the Group to settle 
this.
d) Him Kailash Hydro Power Private 
Limited (HKHPPL) has given corporate 
guarantee in respect of a term loan 
of €2,085,131 sanctioned to Madhava 
Vasistha Hydro Power Private Limited, 
a company owned by erstwhile owners 
of HKHPPL. Pursuant to the terms 
of share purchase agreement with 
erstwhile owners of HKHPPL, erstwhile 
owners of HKHPPL are required to 
get the corporate guarantee released 
without any liability to HKHPPL or the 
Group.
e) Pursuant to the terms of the 
contract for supply of equipment with 
GE India Industrial Private Limited, the 
Group has agreed to purchase 200 
wind turbine generators (WTG) within 
a period of three years commencing 
from 1 January 2012 for a total 
consideration of €175,438,597. As 
at 31 March 2013, the Group is yet 
to purchase 136 WTGs amounting 
to €119,298,246. Subsequent to 31 
March 2013 the Group has entered 
into an understanding to terminate  Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 67 66

€143,673,336). Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 67 66 Greenko Group plc Annual Report 2013 67
RHPPL, KHPPL, MHPPL and RHP 
collectively hold licenses to develop 
320 MW of hydel projects in the 
state of Arunachal Pradesh. These 
pr ojects	 had	 obtained	 significant	
approvals to implement the projects 
and these projects were under various 
stages of development at the date 
of acquisition. These projects are 
hereinafter collectively referred as 
‘Arunachal Projects.
The Group has acquired 100% of the 
equity in ATHPL, CCPL, TPL, THEPL, 
HKHPPL, SSKHEPL and AHPPL which 
has operating hydel power projects 
of 5MW, 5MW, 5MW, 12MW, 5MW, 
10MW and 5 MW respectively in the 
State of Himachal Pradesh, India.
By virtue of the Group acquiring of 
SSKHEPL and HKHPPL which have 
a combined shareholding of 53.7% 
in RWPL, RWPL became a subsidiary 
of the Company. It has an operating 
hydel power project of 14MW in the 
State of Himachal Pradesh, India and 
the balance of 46.3% is shown as non-
controlling interests. Subsequently 
during the year the Group acquired the 
46.3% non-controlling interest. Excess 
of consideration over the fair value of 
non controlling interests is recognised 
in equity under other reserves.
Goodwill is primarily related to 
expect ed	 futur e	 pr o fitability ,	 the	
substantial skill and expertise of 
the workforce and expected cost 
synergies. Goodwill is not expected to 
be deductible for tax purposes.
The Group has also acquired 100% 
equity in KPPL which has a 24MW hydel 
power project under development 
in the state of Karanataka, India. The 
implementation of the project was in 
progress at the time of acquisition.
Generally, the total gestation period, 
starting from obtaining a licence 
till commencement of commercial 
operations, for these types of hydro 
pow er	 pr ojects	 is	 four	 t o	 fiv e	 y ear s.	
Hence,	 the	 pr ojects	 hav e	 significant	
value embedded in them, which is 
generally	 not	 r eflect ed	 in	 the	 books	
of account, and captured in the fair 
value of licences and power purchase 
agreements. The excess of the 
Group’s interest in the fair value of an 
acquiree’s assets and liabilities over 
cost resulting from the time value 
which the Group gained, the value in 
readiness for implementation and the 
negotiating skills of the Group.

27.2 Acquisitions of business during the year ended 31 March 2012
During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Group acquired the following companies to enhance the capacity of the

The Group has acquired 100% of the 
equity in AWPPL, BWIPL, GWECPL, 
RWECPL, RWPCPL and TWPVPL which 
have licences for the construction 
of wind power projects in the state 
of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and 
Rajasthan, India aggregating to 
650MW. The implementation of the 
projects was in progress at the time 
o f	 acqu isition.	 Significant	 appr ov als	
required to implement the power 
projects were obtained. 
Generally, the gestation period, 
starting from obtaining a licence 
till commencement of commercial 
operations, for wind power projects of 
this	 size 	 and	 model	 is	 fiv e	 t o	 six	 y ear s.	
Hence,	 the	 pr ojects	 hav e	 significant	
value embedded in them, which is 
generally	 not	 r eflect ed	 in	 the	 books	
of account captured in the fair value 
of licences. The excess of the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of an acquiree’s 
assets and liabilities over cost is due 
to the time value which the Group 
gained, the value of being able to 
start the commercial operations more 
swiftly, the value in ordering and near 
readiness of all required equipment, 
suppliers and contractors, and the 
negotiating skills of the Group.
27.3 Acquisition of non-controlling 
interests during    the year ended 31 
March 2012
In October 2011, the Group infused 
capital of €5,676,631 for allotment 
of 37,409,000 shares in Sneha Kinetic 
Power Projects Private Limited (SKPPL). 
Pursuant to the infusion of capital, 
the ownership interest of the Group 
in SKPPL increased from 99.88% to 
99.93% resulting in a 0.07% additional 
interest in the subsidiary. This 
transaction is accounted as an equity 
transaction, and accordingly no gain or 
loss is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. 
The difference of €4,876 between the 
fair value of the additional capital  
infused and the amount by which the 
non-controlling interest is adjusted 
and credited to ‘other reserve’ within 
consolidated statement of changes 
in equity and attributed to the equity 
holders of the Parent. 
The fair value of the acquiree’s assets and liabilities arising from the acquisition were as follows:

as outlined in IFRS 8. The Group 
operations predominantly relate to 
generation and sale of electricity. 
The chief operating decision maker 
evaluates the Group performance 
and allocates resources based on 
an analysis of various performance 
indicators at operational unit level. 
Accordingly there is only a single 
operating segment “generation 
and sale of electricity and related 
emission reductions”. Consequently 
no segment disclosures of the Group 
are presented.
The Group has all of its non-
curr ent	 assets,	 other	 than	 financial	
instruments, located within India, 
and earn its revenues from customers 
located in India, except €2,344,903 (31 
March 2012: €1,518,648) representing 
revenue from sale of ERs to customers 
located outside India.
Revenues from four major customers 
relating to power generating activities 
represent €25,726,495 (31 March 2012: 
€22,610,135) of the total revenue.

FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
 Chairman’ s statement
I am pleased to have joined FirstGroup as 
Chairman, at a key stage of its evolution. This is 
an important company, operating in five major 
divisions, providing services to millions of 
customers in the UK and North America, is 
one of the largest corporate employers, and a 
major contributor to the communities in which 
we operate.
Since taking on the role at the beginning of the year, I have reviewed the 
business plans and actively engaged on major decisions and forward 
plans with the senior team. Essentially, I have found the challenges and 
opportunities facing the Company to be broadly in keeping with my 
initial expectations. I have also met all of our major shareholders. It is fair 
to say that they are very supportive of the Group, but are disappointed 
we have not matched this support with appropriate returns. Turning this 
situation around is therefore the first priority of the Board.
I am encouraged that the Group has an attractive portfolio of transport 
businesses – each a leader in its market, and each with good growth 
and returns prospects, particularly as the economies recover from the 
global financial crisis. With the correct decisions and actions, we should 
be able to turn this into acceptable returns for shareholders in the form 
of appropriate dividends and capital growth that has eluded us 
more recently.
First Transit, Greyhound and UK Rail are delivering returns broadly  
in line with what I would expect, though clearly we have significant 
opportunity for further improvement. 
On the other hand, two of our businesses, First Student and UK Bus, 
have not performed, and are well short of their potential and delivering 
lower margins than their competitors. Although both divisions have 
faced challenging economic conditions in their respective markets, we 
cannot escape that we should have managed them better. Progress 
has been made in addressing the performance of these two divisions, 
with headway being made in UK Bus in particular, but there remains 
much to do still. Fixing these and delivering the business plans we 
announced recently is the Group’s key priority.
Also, as a result of past acquisitions, and notwithstanding the rights 
issue last year, Group leverage remains higher than its optimal long 
term level despite the good strides made to reduce it over the past 
five years, and the interest burden continues to weigh on the income 
statement. It will take some years of good operating cash flow to bring 
this down to a more prudent level, but we will consider ways to 
accelerate this. At the same time, some of the businesses have,  
in the past, suffered from a lack of appropriate capital investment  
and this has been boosted significantly in our business plans. 
The task of extracting greater 
value from First Student and 
UK Bus is fundamental. Turning 
around performance in both of 
these divisions would generate 
additional cash flow to enable 
us to reduce leverage and 
increase shareholder returns.

Strategic report
 Chairman’ s statement
Taking together the current stage of the First Student and UK Bus 
recovery programmes and our commitment to the capital investment 
programme, it will take some time before the Group is able to  
deliver a profile of consistent surplus cash that can be distributed to 
shareholders. As a result, the Board has decided that we should refrain 
from reinstating a dividend at this point. Having consulted with our 
major shareholders I am confident they will support this decision.  
We will keep shareholders advised of progress in this respect.
The task of extracting greater value from First Student and UK Bus is 
fundamental. Turning around performance in both of these divisions, as 
well as delivering profitability and returns at least in line with our peers, 
would generate additional cash flow to enable us to reduce leverage 
and increase shareholder returns. Central to this is the need to make 
disciplined decisions on pricing, productivity and capital allocation.  
I am confident these issues are resolvable over time and my own 
experience in corporate recovery situations should assist in this. 
Turning to performance for the year, while below our ultimate potential, 
the Group has performed broadly in line with expectations, once 
account is taken for the extraordinary weather particularly in North 
America. Excluding businesses sold this and last year, Group revenues 
have increased modestly, but more importantly from a strategic 
perspective, adjusted operating profit increased by 5.5%, adjusted 
profit before tax is 23. 1% greater, and adjusted profit attributable to 
ordinary shareholders has increased by 21.8%. Adjusted EPS has fallen 
by 31.8%, principally due to the increased number of shares following 
the rights issue. Capital investment increased as planned, and adjusting 
for the proceeds of the rights issue, Group cash flow was in line  
with guidance.
The Board was particularly encouraged by the performance of First 
Transit, Greyhound, UK Bus and UK Rail this year. UK Bus, while still 
working through its transformation programme, is beginning to show 
that it is on the right track. First Student’s slower progress however, 
which was heavily affected by the unusual winter weather, 
was disappointing. 
A strong, experienced and diverse Board with the right mix of skills 
and experience will be essential to the successful execution of the 
transformation programme, by providing strategic oversight to 
management as well as rigorous and robust challenge. 
It is a natural process after periods of long service for Directors to retire 
and for the Board to be refreshed. Accordingly, we have announced 
that John Sievwright, David Begg, and Colin Hood will retire from the 
Board, and Warwick Brady, Drummond Hall and Imelda Walsh will join 
the Board as Non-Executive Directors, with effect from 24 June 2014.  
I am pleased to welcome Warwick, Drummond and Imelda to the 
Board and I am delighted that such distinguished directors have  
placed their faith in us. Their backgrounds and experience are set  
out on page 52. I would like to thank John, David and Colin for their 
dedication and contribution to the Company, and particularly for their 
support to me as incoming Chairman. 
On behalf of the Board I would also like to pay tribute to my 
predecessor Martin Gilbert who stepped down from the Board on 
31 December 2013 and, having been involved with the Group since its 
formation, was instrumental in establishing its position as the leading 
transport operator in the UK and North America. 
I have been impressed by the commitment and dedication of our 
people who remain focused on the task of delivering high-quality 
services to our customers. The Board is grateful for the continued 
efforts and dedication of our 1 17 ,000 employees, particularly during 
what has been a challenging period for the Group. 
As I have spent time reviewing and challenging the strategy of the 
Group, my early impression is that this is the right one for current 
conditions. We will however continue to review other options that are 
financially compelling, as I work with management and the Board over 
the coming months. Clearly it is disappointing that we have not been 
in a position to declare a dividend for the year, but we ask for 
shareholders’ patience while we return the Group to a dividend 
paying position.
Looking forward, although it is early days for me as your Chairman,  
I believe we have correctly assessed the situation, are putting the right 
programmes in place, and are taking the appropriate action to improve 
profitability, cash generation and to strengthen the balance sheet. 
With a resolute focus on bringing these issues to a successful 
conclusion, I sincerely look forward to playing a pivotal role in the next 
stage of the Group’s evolution.

 Chief Executive’s strategic review
Tim O’Toole
Chief Executive
Our services help create strong, vibrant  
and sustainable local economies and our 
opportunity is to be the provider of choice  
for our customers and communities. 
We have a unique competitive advantage as a result of our scale and 
the diversity of our portfolio of market leading transport businesses:  
we design and operate more networks, we hire and train more 
employees, we procure, maintain and deploy more vehicles, and we 
work with more local communities than any other operator. Our vision  
is to provide solutions for an increasingly congested world, keeping  
people moving and communities prospering.
Our strategy
Our overall strategy is designed to leverage our scale by developing 
and sharing our global expertise for the benefit of our local markets.  
In recent years, although we have excelled in particular ways and at 
different times, we have not delivered the overall financial performance 
that would reflect our leading market positions. As a consequence, we 
are repositioning the Group for improved growth and to restore us to a 
profile of consistent financial returns. Last year, we strengthened the 
balance sheet to give us the flexibility to invest in our transformation 
programme and set out detailed medium term financial targets. Our 
strategic objectives under the transformation programme are: focused 
and disciplined bidding in our contract businesses, driving growth 
through attractive commercial propositions in our passenger revenue 
businesses, continuous improvement in operating and financial 
performance, prudent investment in our key assets (fleets, systems and 
people), and responsible partnerships with our customers and 
communities who rely on us and on whom, in turn, we depend. 
We are confident that successful execution of our strategy will deliver 
our key medium term financial targets, which are to increase Group 
revenue (excluding UK Rail) at a faster rate than the economies we 
serve, improve margins in First Student and UK Bus to double digit 
levels and in Greyhound to 12%, and to achieve a post-tax return on 
capital employed (ROCE) in the 10 to 12% range for the Group as a 
whole. As importantly, our plans will create a more robust company 
and one that is better placed to deliver on its potential.
In this strategic report we set out our business model, strategy and 
objectives in detail and review how we performed operationally and 
financially in the year against our plans. We explain how we measure our 
progress against a range of financial and non-financial indicators, and 
review the principal risks and uncertainties that we face, together with the 
approach we take to managing them. Effective transport links play a vital 
role in the prosperity of any economy, and responsible partnerships with 
our customers and communities are therefore one of our strategic 
objectives. Our 2014 Corporate Responsibility Report, which is available 
on our website, expands on the summary to be found in this report.
Year in review
The year to 31 March 2014 has been one of repositioning and investing 
in the Group to drive greater value from our market leading portfolio of 
businesses, focusing on our people, our divisional performance and 
priorities and our financial position. 
Our vision and values
Our vision is to provide solutions for 
an increasingly congested world... 
keeping people moving and 
communities prospering.
Committed to our customers  
We keep our customers at the heart  
of everything we do.
Dedicated to safety  
Always front of mind, safety is our  
way of life.
Supportive of each other  
We trust each other to deliver and  
work to help one another succeed.
Accountable for performance  
Every decision matters, we do the  
right thing to achieve our goals.
Setting the highest standards  
We want to be the best, continually 
seeking a better way to do things. 7
FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic report
 Chief Executive’s strategic review
UK Bus has achieved overall passenger volume growth for the first 
time in several years, as a result of the network transformations, fare 
reviews and significant investments in fleet and service during the year. 
Going forward, we will continue to improve our commercial proposition 
to drive passenger volume growth and revenues, while continuing to 
strengthen operational discipline as we make progress with our 
step-by-step plan to raise margins to double digits. 
During the year, UK Rail delivered continued revenue growth 
underpinned by robust passenger volume growth. Our train operating 
companies worked closely with our industry partners to deliver both 
planned infrastructure and fleet upgrades, and remedial work to restore 
services on parts of the network damaged by flooding. First Great 
Western and First Capital Connect extended their roles through direct 
awards from the Department for Transport (DfT) in the year. UK Rail is 
currently shortlisted for a number of new competitions. Going forward, 
UK Rail will participate in a range of franchise competitions to achieve 
profit on a par with the last round of franchising, with an acceptable  
level of risk.
Our financial position
In June 2013, we received the net £584m proceeds of the rights issue 
which strengthened our balance sheet and provided the necessary 
flexibility to continue our transformation programme and invest to create 
sustainable value.
In May 2014, we signed a five year, £800m revolving credit facility with 
our relationship banks. In addition to achieving better pricing and 
increased flexibility in certain areas, the new facility gives us strong 
liquidity and a stable financing platform to drive forward our 
transformation programme, with our next debt maturity in October 2016.

The Group is broadly on track to achieve our medium term targets and, 
while we are encouraged by progress so far, there remains a significant 
amount of work ahead. We are confident that we have the right plans 
underway to build on our market leading positions, strengthen the 
resilience of the Group, and return to a profile of sustainable cash 
generation and value creation for the long term.
Tim O’Toole
Chief Executive  
21 May 2014
Our people 
In December 2013 we were delighted to announce the appointment of 
John McFarlane as Chairman. The Group is already benefiting from his 
extensive international experience and track record of managing 
strategic change and value creation. The experience, skills and 
perspectives of our new Non-Executive Directors Warwick Brady, 
Drummond Hall and Imelda Walsh will also be invaluable to the Group 
as we drive forward our plans. 
In January 2014 Dennis Maple joined the Group as President of First 
Student. The wealth of experience that Dennis brings will be important 
as we build on the cost savings actions already taken and accelerate 
our contract repositioning programme to deliver double digit margins in 
the medium term. During the year, UK Bus restructured its senior 
leadership team to ensure that the necessary commercial and 
operational expertise is focused on our local operations and to bring in 
new talent (over 30% of the management within the division has been 
changed in the last two years). In the year, we have also launched 
important Group-wide employee professional development, 
engagement and diversity initiatives, which will strengthen our ability to 
deliver our transformation programme. 
Divisional performance and priorities 
In the year, we made satisfactory progress with our key divisional 
priorities, with good performances in four of our divisions partially offset 
by slower progress in First Student. We also have clear plans in place 
for each of the divisions to contribute to the Group’s overall progress 
towards its medium term targets: 
First Student made progress in its recovery plan, achieving the 
$100m per annum in cost savings as planned. However, current cost 
inflation that marginally exceeds the pricing adjustments provided for in 
our multi-year contracts, together with an unprecedented amount of 
school closures due to the severity of the North American winter 
season, meant that our rate of progress toward our medium term 
objective of double digit margins was slower than we had targeted. 
Going forward, First Student is accelerating its programme to address 
contract portfolio pricing and focus capital on higher returning 
opportunities, and is targeting a further $50m per annum of identified 
cost efficiencies. 
First Transit delivered another year of strong growth and good 
margins, with continued bid success across all segments. Going 
forward, First Transit will continue to invest in its market leading people 
and solutions to deliver further growth with attractive returns.
Although its reported results were negatively affected by the severe 
weather which caused significant disruption to the network this winter, 
the underlying performance in Greyhound indicates signs of a 
modestly improving market for our traditional coach services. Our 
Greyhound Express and BoltBus point-to-point brands continued to 
achieve strong profitable growth, benefiting from the unique feed from 
our national network. Going forward, the modernisation of Greyhound’s 
IT infrastructure and web presence will deliver improved ticketing, 
real-time pricing and yield management, and this, together with the 
continued profitable growth of our point-to-point brands, will deliver  
our medium term margin target of 12% for the division.  8

 Business model
Our services help to create strong,  
vibrant and sustainable local economies  
and our opportunity is to be the provider  
of choice for our customers and the  
communities we serve.
Effective transport systems are essential to 
allow ever more people to live closer together, 
keeping them moving, providing vital links and 
enabling economic activity. 
With an increasing global population and 
relentless and rapid urbanisation, there can be 
no doubt that congestion will be a permanent 
feature of the future. The challenges this presents 
mean the need for effective transport solutions is 
becoming all the more critical and complex. 
Governments are increasingly turning to private 
sector operators to deliver innovative and 
efficient local transport solutions in order to 
keep communities flourishing. We are ideally 
placed to provide those solutions by leveraging 
our immense breadth and scale and our 
collective expertise and knowledge across a 
range of transport modes and systems 
throughout the UK and North America. That is 
why our vision is to provide solutions for an 
increasingly congested world, keeping people 
moving and communities prospering.
How we generate revenue 
FirstGroup’s unique portfolio of businesses 
addresses this opportunity by providing 
sustainable, integrated transport services that 
are safe, reliable and meet the needs of the 
customers and the communities we serve.
Our five divisions are exposed to different 
geographies, customers, revenue models, 
demand drivers and competitors within the 
overall transport industry. We review the key 
divisional drivers in detail in the divisional 
business reviews on pages 12-31, but in  
broad terms, half of our revenues are derived 
directly from our passengers, spread across 
business, commuting, social and recreational 
travel purposes, and across a diverse 
demographic mix.
The other half of our revenues are backed by 
contracts or franchise agreements with the 
national government, regional and local 
authorities in the UK, and state and municipal 
authorities, local school boards, universities 
and private companies in North America. 
Overall, our revenues are balanced between 
the UK (57%) and North America (43%), 
together with some minor activities in other 
European countries. This diversity of revenues 
typically makes the overall Group relatively 
resilient through the business cycle.
How we run our business
A critical driver of success in all of our divisions is 
the focus on the needs of our customers and 
local communities. We therefore run the business 
in a decentralised way, with our five divisional 
heads having significant responsibility and scope 
for entrepreneurial thinking at the divisional level, 
underpinned by rigorous strategic, operational 
and financial parameters set at Group level.
The fundamental skills and capabilities needed 
to run a transport business are the same across 
all the divisions, which is why the corporate centre 
supports and challenges the divisions to share 
best practice and expertise with each other , and 
coordinates Group-wide operational initiatives and 
actions where appropriate. In this way our divisions 
benefit from the breadth and scale of the Group 
as a whole when delivering the most appropriate, 
efficient solutions to the transport challenges of 
their local customers and communities.
At Group level, we have a lean corporate centre 
with a number of key functions as set out on 
page 60. In addition to fostering a high 
performance culture which delivers on our 
vision and values (page 6), Group also sets the 
strategic direction, establishes key targets and 
standards, monitors performance and provides 
challenge. Group is also responsible for raising 
and allocating capital in order to drive 
sustainable returns.
Key divisional responsibilities
Local market and customer knowledge, 
and relationships with stakeholders: 
Being market leaders in their respective fields 
ensures that our divisions are well placed to 
anticipate opportunities and challenges in  
their businesses.
Contract bidding and management: 
Formulating successful bids with an 
appropriate level of risk, and managing the 
delivery of the resulting contracts for as long  
as 15 years, are key capabilities of our  
contract businesses.
Marketing and ticketing: Driving passenger 
volumes through engaging with potential 
customers and offering compelling travel 
options – such as multi-operator and season 
tickets, real-time pricing to maximise yield, 
customer loyalty schemes and greater use  
of mobile technologies – is increasingly 
important to our businesses.
Hiring, supporting and managing 
employees: Our largest operating cost  
and core asset is our 1 17 ,000 people – our 
businesses rely on having the best people  
to ensure we deliver high-quality services.
Vehicle investment and maintenance:  
We have substantial capital invested in nearly 
60,000 vehicles across First Student, UK Bus, 
Greyhound and First Transit’s shuttle segment, 
and manage or maintain a further 48,000 
vehicles. 
Operational and financial efficiency: 
The divisions manage employee productivity, 
asset/fuel efficiency, parts procurement, 
overheads, and insurance and other risks to 
improve financial performance whilst delivering 
on their operational responsibilities. 
Safety: By its nature, the transport industry 
involves the risk of injury to employees, 
passengers and third parties. It is central to 
our culture to keep safety front of mind, ensure 
lessons are learned and constantly reinforce 
standards and best practice.

Continuous improvement culture: In the 
areas of service standards (punctuality, 
reliability, cleanliness, etc.) and sustainability, 
our divisions have ever more stretching 
improvement targets.
Risk management: Our divisions face a 
broad spectrum of risks, some of which are 
unique to their particular business. As part of 
the Group’s overarching risk management 
framework, they own and manage the 
principal risks they face to enable agile and 
tailored responses.
Key Group responsibilities
Capital allocation: Review and monitor 
divisional fleet and technology procurement 
programmes and other significant transactions 
to ensure the best use of our available capital. 
Capital structure and financing: Secure 
appropriate financing for the Group’s needs 
under a range of future scenarios. 
Sustainable value creation: Challenge  
and monitor the divisions to balance near term 
cash generation and long term reinvestment in 
the future of the business.
Budgeting, planning and cash 
management: Agree budgets, medium  
term plans, and ensure appropriate liquidity  
is available to the divisions.
Control systems: Manage lines of  
authority and delegated responsibilities,  
and appropriate systems and procedures,  
in order to plan, execute, control and  
monitor the Group’s progress.
Risk management: Facilitate risk identification 
and management throughout the Group and 
review the adequacy of mitigating controls.
Safety, ethics and sustainability: Set policy 
standards and embed best practice behaviours 
to ensure a continuous improvement culture. 
Employee development and benefits: 
Ensure the Group and our divisions hire, retain, 
manage and develop the best people for  
the job.
Operational best practice: Lead  
and coordinate sharing of divisional skills, 
experiences and capabilities (including safety 
and IT solutions) throughout the Group, and 
develop new expertise.

First Student
Market overview
First Student is the largest provider of student 
transportation in North America – over twice 
the size of the next largest competitor.
Market review and trends
School buses provide home to school transportation for millions of 
students in the USA and Canada. There are more than 15,000 school 
districts in North America, which deploy more than 500,000 school 
buses. The total North American market is estimated to be worth 
around $24bn per annum, of which school districts directly operate 
approximately 64%, with 36% outsourced to private operators. Charter 
services are also operated on an ad hoc basis, separate from 
scheduled school runs, and are typically of limited duration and scope. 
The economic downturn put significant pressure on customer budgets, 
leading to some organic retraction and price pressure, and atypical 
levels of contract churn. In the longer term, these pressures will drive 
demand for higher quality, higher efficiency providers. In the last two 
years, the market has shown signs of stabilisation and some positive 
but limited organic growth. 
Customers
School districts provide transportation for students depending on 
varying criteria determined at state level. Contracts typically specify 
either fixed or annually indexed pricing, meaning that private operators 
bear cost risk. These contracts are typically three to five years in 
duration, after which they are competitively retendered. School  
districts receive their funding from state and local sources, including  
tax receipts, and their budgets for all expenditure, including 
transportation, tend to be linked to economic factors. In addition to 
school districts outsourcing student transportation (known as 
‘conversion’), growth is driven by increased student numbers leading  
to additional routes being driven for a given school and inflation related 
escalators built into some contracts.
As the market leader, we 
must drive high standards 
and innovation, while 
achieving pricing that 
balances value and cost  
for customers.

Financial performance
Revenue in our First Student division was $2,339.3m or £1,467 .4m 
(2013: $2,378.6m or £1,503. 1m), 1.7% lower on a US Dollar basis, 
principally due to an unprecedented number of school closures due to 
the abnormal weather conditions across North America in the second 
half of our financial year. Operating profit was $152.8m or £93.5m 
(2013: $175.2m or £1 10. 1m), resulting in a margin of 6.5% (2013: 7 .4%), 
which also reflects school closures and the higher associated operating 
costs during the unusually severe weather. 75% of our territory suffered 
some impact from the extraordinary snow falls and extremely cold 
conditions, with more than 4,000 school days lost, approximately twice 
the impact we would expect to see in a typical year. A number of the 
lost operating days may potentially be recovered in the summer term, 
which occurs in our 2014/15 financial year. On an underlying basis, 
excluding the approximately $25m of net weather impact for the year, 
First Student’s margin would have been flat compared with the prior 
year, reflecting the achievement of the $100m run rate in annual cost 
savings as planned, offset by cost inflation running slightly ahead of 
price indexation in our multi-year contracts. 
Our strengths
Clear market leader (bigger than next four competitors combined) 
– scale economies in buying, insurance, fleet management, 
technology development, etc. 
Differentiated offering – technology, safety programme, strong 
customer relationships and satisfaction scores 
Recovery plan is progressing – cost efficiency, uniform practices 
and disciplined contract portfolio management will drive margins 
and value creation

continued
Focused and disciplined bidding 
State and local finances have continued to improve modestly in the 
year; over the 2013 bid season we achieved organic growth from within 
existing contracts of more than 470 buses, almost double the rate of 
organic growth in the prior year and equating to approximately 1% 
growth. We continue to be competitive in the conversion market from 
in-house to the private sector, winning 55% of the contracts bid-for-
and-awarded. We remain cautious about conversion growth however, 
as only a small proportion of contracts put out to tender convert to the 
outsourced sector, a trend we do not envisage changing in the medium 
term. A number of our share shift contract wins were cost-effective 
expansions of existing operations, such as for the Los Angeles Unified 
School District and for Kansas City, Missouri. Our continuing focus on 
returns resulted in some contract losses including several where, 
although the numbers of buses operated were significant, their 
contribution to profits was limited. Overall contract retention for the 
2013 bidding season was around 90%, and the number of buses 
operated fell by around 550. 
Continuous improvement in operating and 
financial performance 
We have continued to focus on delivering cost efficiencies during the 
year, an area which remains an important component of First Student’s 
recovery plan. Having delivered a $100m run rate in cost savings in the 
year – through implementing uniform best practice in driver operating 
procedures, maintenance, fuel use and procurement – the business  
is enhancing its ability to generate returns, despite continued cost 
inflation in the industry. The next phase of cost savings, amounting to 
approximately $50m, have been identified, and focus on optimising  
the overhead structures of the business, together with ensuring full 
compliance of ever more consistent operating procedures throughout 
our more than 500 locations. Two-thirds of our engineering workshops 
have now achieved silver or gold ‘lean’ certification, up from a quarter in 
the prior year. Although non-school charter results were impacted by 
the weather, growing 9.5% in the period, we are pleased with the 
progress of our more structured approach to this business, which 
delivers a very strong incremental return on capital employed.
Prudent investment in our key assets 
We continue to invest in technology to differentiate our offering, raise 
customer service levels and promote environmental benefits. The roll 
out of our FOCUS GPS system (which links onboard data to back office 
systems) has been completed and is delivering savings to plan, and the 
DriveSMART system (which provides real-time fuel use feedback to 
drivers) is being fitted throughout the fleet. In the second half we 
launched the MyFirstPass system (also known as ZPass) in selected 
locations, which gives parents and customers real-time information 
about student ridership as they swipe on and off the bus. We invested 
approximately $300m in new buses, refurbishments, onboard 
technology and facilities improvements in the year; our average fleet 
age remains around 7 .5 years.
Responsible partnerships with our customers  
and communities 
First Student achieved a fifth consecutive year of improved customer 
service scores, with particularly pleasing results in the important 
start-up phase of the school year. 
We are achieving fuel efficiency improvements of around 5% across  
the division through the DriveSMART system and related driver 
behaviour initiative, and added approximately 500 alternative fuel buses 
(mainly propane) to the fleet in the year. First Student’s safety 
performance is both a source of competitive advantage and, more 
fundamentally, is deeply embedded in our culture and values. 
For the last two years, First Student has won the Occupational 
Excellence Achievement Award from the National Safety Council.
Future priorities
First Student is a leader in its market in terms of both its size and the 
quality and safety of the services it provides. Although the recovery plan 
continues to make progress, more work remains to be done to ensure 
the division delivers its medium term double digit margin target. At 
present, the division deploys significant capital across parts of its 
contract portfolio that do not attract a fair margin for the quality of 
service provided or an appropriate rate of return on that capital. 
Working together to keep children safe
First Student 
For the start of the new school year, 
First Student partnered with the 
National Safety Council (NSC) to 
share important safety information, 
allowing parents, students and 
motorists to understand the role 
they play in getting students to and 
from school safely. The online 
programme covered a wide range 
of topics including playground 
safety, safety in and around buses, 
pedestrian safety and tips for 
motorists.  15

Therefore the division is working through a programme to address 
contract portfolio pricing, focus capital on higher returning opportunities 
and continues to drive further cost efficiencies through the business. 
We remain confident in the ability of our detailed recovery plan to 
improve margins to double digits over the medium term. In the longer 
term, First Student will be increasingly well placed for growth through 
further share shift, in-fill acquisitions and organic opportunities.
Outlook
During the 2014 bid season, First Student is intensifying its focus on 
retaining or winning contracts that deliver an appropriate level of return 
on capital employed, which may result in some further losses of lower 
margin contracts. To the extent this is the case, the division will cascade 
the freed up vehicles to other opportunities, with a commensurate 
saving in capital expenditure. Although this approach may result in a 
modestly smaller revenue base and some short term costs, over the 
medium term this approach – coupled with the further cost savings 
– will result in a more sustainably attractive contract portfolio, which will 
deliver double digit margins and better returns on capital.

Market review and trends
The transit market is worth around $24bn per annum in North America, 
of which approximately 30% is outsourced. The market includes the 
provision of fixed route bus services (an approximately $15bn segment 
per annum, of which around 10% is outsourced), paratransit bus 
services (approximately $4bn segment, of which three-quarters is 
outsourced), private shuttle services (approximately $2bn segment,  
of which around 90% is outsourced) and transit system management 
contracting (an approximate $3bn per annum segment, of which 
around one-third is outsourced). Private transportation companies 
manage, operate, maintain and organise transportation services under 
contracts which typically last for three to five years or longer. 
Although the North American economic environment has been 
challenging overall, state and local governments have chosen not  
to reduce transportation spending – and have increased interest in 
outsourcing certain services, where private contractors can reduce 
overall cost. Ageing populations, increasing congestion and private 
companies seeking to offer additional services to their own customers 
continue to support growth in each segment. The market continues  
to attract new entrants, though reputation and track record remain 
important differentiators in the bidding process.
Customers
A wide range of customers contract out transportation services, 
including transit authorities, federal, state and local agencies, as well  
as private institutions including universities, hospitals and airports.  
The vehicle fleet maintenance services market includes contracting  
for private and public sector clients, including municipalities, and fire 
and police departments.  17

Competitors
First Transit has over 15% of the outsourced market in the United 
States, which accounts for approximately 30% of the total market.  
The outsourced transit market is fragmented although First Transit  
has two large competitors, MV Transportation, Inc., and Veolia 
Transportation. The outsourced fleet maintenance market is highly 
competitive and our First Vehicle Services segment is estimated to  
be one of the largest providers in the market, with Penske and Ryder 
being the principal competitors. A number of small and medium sized 
companies represent a significant proportion of the outsourced market.

Financial performance
Revenue in our First Transit division was $1,290.5m or £81 1.9m (2013: 
$1,286.8m or £814.6m). Adjusting for the disposal of First Support 
Services (FSS), US Dollar revenue increased by 8.0%, reflecting 
continued new business wins and organic growth within existing 
contracts. All key segments saw growth in the year, led by fixed route, 
paratransit and shuttle. Operating profit was $95.7m or £60.3m (2013: 
$77 .7m or £49. 1m), resulting in a margin of 7 .4% (2013: 6.0%), which 
reflects a strong operating performance and the absence of the 
significant historic legal claim settlement in the prior year.
Focused and disciplined bidding 
During the year, First Transit continued to leverage its longstanding 
management reputation and expertise to win new work. At the same 
time, through its collaborative approach with its public transit authority 
and private customers, the division also generated growth from 
increased utilisation of its services under existing contracts. Contract 
retention remained above 90%, reflecting high customer regard for  
our capabilities and the competitive pricing of our services.

The largest award in the year was a paratransit contract for PACE,  
part of the regional transport authority of Chicago, Illinois. We were  
also successful in expanding our call centre work with an important win 
for the Chicago Regional Transit Authority’s Travel Information Center.  
Our shuttle business continues to be successful, with further contract 
wins at Auburn University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham 
joining other recent contracts including for the University of Tennessee 
Knoxville and Brown University in our market leading university 
portfolio. First Transit transitioned several large contracts from other 
operators including the newly unified fixed route contract for Valley 
Metro RPTA in Mesa/Tempe, Arizona, the MetroACCESS paratransit 
contract in Washington, DC, and the Maryland Transit Administration 
paratransit contract in Baltimore, MD. Important contract retentions this 
year included fixed route services for the Potomac and Rappahannock 
Transportation Commission in Woodbridge, VA, fixed route and 
paratransit services for Johnson County, Kansas, and shuttle services 
at the Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Collaborating with 
our Fort McMurray oil industry partners resulted in further revenue 
growth under existing contracts.
Continuous improvement in operating and 
financial performance 
A significant proportion of First Transit’s opportunities will continue to 
arise from business outsourced to the private sector for the first time, 
where our national service platform, technology infrastructure and 
management expertise can deliver substantial cost savings compared 
to public provision. Through a culture of continuous improvement and 
technology insertion, First Transit has continued to maintain our ability 
to provide both exceptional service and low cost for new and existing 
customers. For example, First Transit has continued to improve 
operational efficiencies, including through the refinement of our fixed 
route mileage optimisation programme which results in reduced 
non-revenue time and mileage, paratransit productivity which  
improves  vehicle routing and scheduling efficiency, and direct and 
indirect cost reductions through the negotiation of more competitive 
purchasing agreements. 
Prudent investment in our key assets 
First Transit focuses investment spending on three principal areas: 
people, technology solutions and on vehicles for the shuttle segment, 
where typically we own the fleet as well as delivering a service.  
To ensure we maintain the depth and breadth of expertise required  
to consistently deliver high-quality bid submissions and a subsequent 
service that meets customer expectations, we maintained our 
significant investment in recruitment, retention and continuous training 
of our people. 
The division successfully initiated the roll out throughout the US of its 
management IT system providing automated operational, maintenance 
and financial information in the year, which will deliver significant cost 
savings. This system will also allow us to offer real-time vehicle location 
information to our customers. In shuttle, we continue to invest in 
state-of-the-art buses through a combination of direct investment  
and operating leases, where commercially appropriate.
Responsible partnerships with our customers  
and communities 
Our customer service trends continue to be positive, with our 
commitment to safety, technical and operational knowledge and 
professionalism particularly recognised by our customers. 
We have enhanced our industry leading safety programme through the 
continued roll out of DriveCam technology, an event capture and driver 
behaviour monitoring system, which has the added benefit of improving 
fuel efficiency. 
Leader in shuttle bus services  
First Transit
The US shuttle bus market 
(estimated $2bn in annual revenue), 
serves the increasing need for 
organisations — principally 
universities, airports (including car 
rental consortia serving airports)  
and private companies in other 
industries — to offer attractive 
services to their students, travellers 
and employees. We are a leader in 
this market with more than 50 
multi-year contracts, under which 
we typically provide both the bus 
fleets and operate the service for our 
clients.Our portfolio of shuttle bus 
contracts includes universities, 
airports and supporting clients 
active in the Alberta oil sands. 19

Future priorities
The continued success of First Transit depends on maintaining our 
competitive advantage, which resides in the expertise of our people 
and the quality of our technology. Both are vital components in 
delivering services that continue to innovate and to deliver cost 
efficiencies, which in turn ensures we will be the low cost supplier  
of choice for our customers. We see continued growth potential in  
all of our existing segments, together with emerging outsourcing 
opportunities in light rail, commuter rail, high speed rail and Bus Rapid 
Transit (BRT) in the US and internationally. In the future, we anticipate 
there could also be opportunities for targeted acquisitions of 
complementary businesses, which would immediately increase market 
share, leverage our scale and enhance profits and returns. We look 
forward to leveraging our market position and reputation to deliver 
continued growth at attractive margins.
Outlook
The pipeline of potential new business remains attractive, with a wide 
range of bid opportunities to add to our portfolio of over 370 contracts. 
As we look ahead to next year, current identified opportunities are 
weighted to fixed route, paratransit and shuttle segments.

the US transit industry uses an 
independent certification group 
called the National Institute for 
Automotive Service Excellence,  
or ASE, to certify engineering 
technician qualification. We 
estimate we have more ASE-
certified technicians than all  
of our competitors combined. 20

Greyhound
Market overview
Greyhound is the only national operator of 
scheduled intercity coach services in the  
US and Canada, serving 48 US States and  
10 Canadian Provinces and T erritories.
Market review and trends
The US intercity coach transportation industry has been growing every 
year since 2006 – a reversal of the position in the preceding 25 years, 
when the industry declined by an average of 2.9% a year. The size of 
the potential market presents a significant opportunity for growth, with 
42m people considering coach travel every year, of whom around a 
quarter currently use Greyhound. Even regular coach users choose 
other modes 75% of the time, but new offerings and better products, 
services and price have the potential to grow this market and frequency 
of use.
As well as passenger revenues, income is generated from package 
express services, charter and tour organisation and also catering 
outlets in terminals. Partnerships between Greyhound and independent 
bus lines, known as interlining, extends the reach of the national 
network. Greyhound also partners with Amtrak to offer passengers  
a through ticket to their final destination if not served by rail.
Value-focused customers, who form a substantial portion of 
Greyhound’s traditional customer base, remain cautious as they 
continue to feel the effects of the prolonged economic downturn, 
although conditions improved modestly in the second half of the year.
Customers
North American intercity coach firms serve a wide customer base, who 
prioritise value and whose primary purpose is to visit friends and family. 
Direct, point-to-point services, such as Greyhound Express which  
now serves 120 markets across North America, are spurring a coach 
renaissance and encouraging a new, younger, passenger 
demographic. Traditionally customers bought walk-up tickets but 
recent developments in technology are encouraging new habits.
We are uniquely positioned 
to take advantage of the 
resurgence in the intercity 
coach market through 
the rebuilding of an iconic 
American brand.

Financial performance
Greyhound’s overall US Dollar revenue was $990.6m or £624.6m 
(2013: $1,022.0m or £647 . 1m) with the reduction of 3. 1% including  
the impact of severe weather which caused significant disruption  
to the network in the fourth quarter. Excluding weather, like-for-like 
revenue over the financial year was approximately 0.7% lower, although 
the revenue growth trajectory improved over the course of the year. 
Adjusted operating profit was $73.2m or £46.4m (2013: $85.2m  
or £54.3m), resulting in a margin of 7 .4% (2013: 8.3%). This margin 
performance in part reflects the modestly improving economic 
conditions over the course of the year and the continued profitable 
growth of our point-to-point services, offset by the impact of weather-
related disruption and higher associated operating costs in the  
final quarter. 
Driving growth through attractive commercial propositions 
Greyhound’s iconic brand is synonymous with long distance coach 
travel in North America and our unique national network provides a 
significant competitive advantage and an established base for future

Whilst traditional Greyhound remains a largely cyclical business,  
our programme of expansion in Greyhound Express and our other 
point-to-point brands continued even during recent periods of 
economic fragility in North America. Greyhound Express continues to 
perform well, with like-for-like revenue increasing by more than 10% for 
the year. The multiple price points we now offer give us broader market 
potential and help us to attract users back to coach travel as well as 
encouraging new customer demographics. Greyhound Express now 
covers more than 30% of our US network including most of the major 
city pairs. During the year we launched Greyhound Express in 
additional markets including routes around Vancouver, Edmonton to 
Grand Prairie, Dallas to Memphis, and from Jacksonville to Miami and 
New Orleans. Our BoltBus services also expanded in California, adding 
Los Angeles to San Francisco, San Jose to Oakland and Los Angeles 
to Las Vegas, and our YO! Bus brand, which links Chinatowns in the 
north east, saw positive year on year performance.
We are taking the experience from our point-to-point services and 
introducing best practice across our traditional network. Greyhound is 
re-engaging with our customers through increased marketing and has 
improved the onboard amenities of our fleet with multiple new and 
refurbished vehicles that provide leather seats, Wi-Fi and power 
sockets. We are further developing our dynamic pricing proposition 
and opening up innovative ways to interact with both new and existing 
customers through additional sales channels, such as our mobile-
enabled website which came online in 2013/14 with print at home 
ticketing functionality, and the ability to book online and pay cash for 
tickets in more than 10,000 7-Eleven and ACE Cash Express kiosks.  
In the last two years, the proportion of tickets purchased online has 
increased from one-third to half. 
Continuous improvement in operating and 
financial performance 
Over the last five years we have significantly improved our operating 
flexibility, in part through depot and location rationalisation. Our ongoing 
efforts to right size our terminal footprint continues, and over the next 
few months we expect to open new terminals in Miami, Seattle  
and Baltimore. 
We are restructuring our Canadian business, have launched our 
Greyhound Express product in four Provinces, and are improving  
our package delivery offering, which over time will deliver a more 
commercially viable service. 
Prudent investment in our key assets 
Our disciplined fleet investment has led to improved onboard amenities 
for our customers and prolonged the life of our coaches, enabling us to 
reduce maintenance costs and become more coordinated in the 
scheduling of preventive maintenance programmes. Our move towards 
a revitalised fleet continues with three-quarters of our vehicles now 
either new or refurbished and an average fleet age of ten years. We 
continue to introduce new vehicles from our April 2013 order of 220 
coaches, and during 2014/15 we will complete our refurbishment 
programme.
Our investment in information technology will allow us to offer many 
new ways to better leverage and monetise the existing network 
capacity through yield and capacity optimisation, including the 
development of new dynamic pricing and yield management systems 
across our core network. We are developing the architecture needed  
to introduce a loyalty programme and increasing our marketing, helping 
us to engage further with our customers.
Responsible partnerships with our customers  
and communities 
With an increased emphasis on customer service training across the 
division, our customer satisfaction scores have maintained their long 
term improving trend.
Our new fleet now operates using some of the most fuel efficient 
engines in the industry, and we continue to promote initiatives including 
a focus on reduced idling and, through DriveCam, a more effective fuel 
consumption strategy. DriveCam’s event capturing and driver behaviour 
monitoring also provides us with safety data. New terminals that we 
have opened recently or will open in the short term have the most up  
to date environmental credentials and are LEED certified by the US 
Green Buildings Council. 
Future priorities
Since FirstGroup acquired Greyhound in 2007 we have transformed 
the operating model, making the business more flexible and introducing 
a reduced cost base and improved capital profile, which means that  
we are now poised for growth both within our existing network and  
with new demographics through Greyhound Express and our other 
point-to-point brands. We are on track with our investment programme, 
which will transform our offering principally through applying the yield 
management, real-time pricing and more consumer friendly ticketing

UK Bus
Market overview
UK Bus is one of the largest bus operators  
in the UK, with around a fifth of the 
deregulated market.
Market review and trends
Local bus services in the UK (outside London) have been deregulated 
since the 1980s, with most services being provided by private 
operators, although a small number of local authority owned operators 
still exist. Bus markets are local and services operate on a flexible 
model with operators setting fares, frequencies and routes on a 
commercial basis and operating ‘socially necessary’ services under 
contract to local authorities. Around 2.8bn passenger journeys are 
made on local bus services outside of London, generating revenues  
of approximately £4.4bn a year.
Economic weakness continues in some of the UK’s larger urban areas, 
to which the provision of bus services remain crucial for recovery.  
The impact of reductions in Government funding for local authorities 
continues to cause pressure on local transport budgets. Partnership 
with local authorities remains a core principle for both the bus industry 
and central Government in order to deliver service improvements 
without increasing council tax payer spending. The DfT promotes this 
agenda through initiatives including Better Bus Area grants and the 
Green Bus Fund. Tailored local brands and services, including premium 
high-quality routes serving distinct markets, remain important, as does 
the focus on development of new technology including smart ticketing 
and improved passenger information.
Customers
Revenues in the bus market principally comprise passenger ticket sales 
and concessionary fare schemes (payments by local government 
authorities for services for which passengers pay reduced or no fees). 
Significant proportions of passengers use bus services for commuting 
– to work, school, college or university – for shopping and for leisure 
purposes. Income may also be generated through tendered services. 
We are creating a robust 
business model that will deliver 
revenue growth, underpinned 
by sustained volume growth 
and a rigorous focus on 
operating discipline.

Competitors
The UK bus market (outside London) is deregulated and highly 
competitive with more than 1,200 bus operators; we face competition  
in all markets in which we operate. A number of multi-regional operators 
have increased market share through acquisitions during the year and 
a number of operators have both entered and left the market. The main 
competitor to bus services in the UK, however, remains the private car.

Financial performance
Revenue in our UK Bus division was £930.2m (2013: £1, 128.2m) and 
like-for-like passenger revenue growth (adjusting for the sale of our 
London business) was 1.8%. Adjusted operating profit was £44.4m 
(2013: £50.8m), resulting in a margin of 4.8% (2013: 4.5%). This 
encouraging performance is despite the continued challenges posed 
by economic conditions in some of our local markets as well as further 
reductions in public funding.
During the year we completed the first stages of our transformation 
plan, including the previously announced disposals of certain bus 
businesses in order to rebalance the portfolio. As a result of this we 
exited the London market in order to focus on our commercial 
deregulated businesses elsewhere. Our transformation plans to return 
the division to double-digit margin performance in the medium term 
are focused on: stimulating passenger volume through improving our 
customer proposition (fares, networks, local partnerships); delivering 
improved service quality and cost savings through rigorous focus on 
disciplined operations and investment in our employees’ capabilities; 
and investing in our fleet, ticketing and other customer-facing 
technologies to stimulate growth and loyalty.

Driving growth through attractive commercial propositions 
A typical approach in a market is to rebase certain fares products  
to ensure competitiveness and value for money, which encourages 
volume growth and maintains revenue levels in the early stages.  
This acts as a platform from which to build further volume and pricing 
growth in future years. Following our success in the first half of the  
year principally in markets in the north region, the full year passenger 
volume growth across the division of 2.6% is the first full year of 
commercial passenger volume growth for a decade. Tailored fares 
reductions in Manchester have persuaded an extra 150,000 people per 
week to travel on our services and contributed to an improvement of 
more than 30% in customer perceptions of our value for money. In the 
second half of the year we expanded our fares reviews to other markets 
including Leeds, Portsmouth, Southampton and Bristol, where we 
worked with the elected Mayor of Bristol to undertake a wide ranging 
consultation that we used to inform our new fares structure introduced 
in November.
In many areas we coupled changes to the fares structure with 
improved network designs, allowing us to maximise growth 
opportunities and increase market share. We have completed ten 
major redesigns so far, including our SimpliCITY network in Glasgow 
which has restored frequencies of ten minutes or better to core 
services and coordinated these routes to create simpler links to the city 
centre. Against the backdrop of an economy that struggled in 2013/14, 
SimpliCITY outperformed the rest of the network, delivering a growth 
rate 1.0% higher.
Effective partnerships, which foster better and stronger coordination 
with local authorities and other stakeholders, are hugely important for 
us in terms of our customer proposition. We are a key partner in two 
new Better Bus Areas announced in 2013, York and the West of 
England Partnership, receiving enhanced funding from the DfT. 
Working closely with our partners, we seek to align agendas and 
through this deliver greater passenger growth to the networks. Of the 
five areas across the country that have now secured this funding, we 
have been at the forefront of three, reflecting how important we 
consider fostering powerful partnerships is to the future success of 
local bus services.
We are working hard with local authorities to ensure they make best 
use of their limited funds, particularly for tendered services. In Cornwall, 
we have worked with the council to ensure that the network maximises 
the coordination between commercial and tendered services. In West 
Yorkshire we, along with other local operators, have developed a 
compelling proposition to enable buses to support the growth of the 
local economy, which will now be considered by the newly formed 
combined authority. In Portsmouth we have worked closely with the 
city council to introduce bus priority measures including bus lanes and 
a park and ride system.
Continuous improvement in operating and 
financial performance 
We have continued to focus on cost optimisation and disciplined 
operations during the year. Adoption of best practice operating 
procedures and standards have led to cost efficiencies including a  
27% reduction in breakdowns and lost mileage reducing by 21%.  
This focus on disciplined operations has also delivered an increase  
in punctuality and reliability standards. 
With the optimisation of our depot operations making good progress, we 
have intensified our focus on leadership development. Our programmes 
aim to give our management teams the support to develop local 
initiatives, seek development opportunities and stimulate commercial 
initiatives. During the year, the division restructured its senior leadership 
team to refresh talent and ensure that the necessary commercial and 
operational expertise is in place to support our local operations. 
Better Bus Area partnerships  
UK Bus
In October 2013 the Government 
revealed further investment in local 
bus services through the designation 
of four new Better Bus Areas (BBAs), 
including two where we are a key 
partner: York and the West of 
England Partnership region 
(comprising Bath, Bristol and  
South Gloucester). This follows the 
announcement in February 2013  
of the first BBA in Sheffield, where 
First is also a lead operator.
Bus passengers in Sheffield are 
benefiting from improved and better 
value services. Working closely with 
our partners in the region, we are 
helping to make bus travel more 
attractive and, as a result, more 
passengers are using the bus. We 
are seeing very encouraging levels of 
passenger growth, whilst reliability 
and customer satisfaction scores 
have increased in the area. We are 
developing our plans for the delivery 
of improved services for bus users in 
York and the West of England. We 
are determined to foster powerful 
relationships with our partners 
everywhere we operate which can 
help us unlock the full potential of the 
bus. 27

Prudent investment in our key assets 
In January we announced our biggest ever investment in vehicles 
outside London. We plan to introduce 425 vehicles during the 2014/15 
financial year at a cost of £70m, taking our total investment in new 
vehicles to £310m invested in 2,000 new vehicles over four years. 
Almost all of these buses will be manufactured in the UK, with 27 4 
Wrightbus StreetLite Micro Hybrid buses forming the bulk of the latest 
order. These diesel-based vehicles incorporate an innovative onboard 
hybrid system which improves fuel efficiency by around 10%, and we 
will be the first company to operate these new buses. Capital 
investment into our fleet will continue in the coming years, further 
reducing our average fleet age (currently nine years) and improving 
customer experience.
In both Aberdeen and Worcester we launched mobile ticketing during 
the year and through 2014 all of our networks will be equipped with this 
technology. We are also introducing smartcard schemes, with 
multi-operator capability where appropriate, allowing us to offer a more 
sophisticated pricing model and giving us more information about who 
our customers are and how they use our services. This will give us a 
strong platform from which to launch customised loyalty initiatives 
based on a detailed understanding our customers’ needs.
Responsible partnerships with our customers  
and communities 
Our efforts to improve the quality of our fleet and the reliability of our 
services were recognised in the recent independent Passenger Focus 
Autumn 2013 survey of customer satisfaction. The results showed a 
5% rise in overall passenger satisfaction across our services to 86%, 
including an increase in score in 34 of the 35 variables measured. We 
were particularly pleased that our Glasgow network achieved an overall 
satisfaction score of 91% following the launch of the SimpliCITY 
network this year. 
Our close partnership working also extends to ensuring our services 
are accessible for all. For example, in Glasgow we are offering job 
seekers significant discounts on single fares, our child fare of 60p in the 
same city is one of the cheapest in the UK, while in Bristol we offer a 
30% discount to all young people under 21. We became the first 
national bus operator to pledge our support for a charter, developed by 
the Royal National Institute of Blind People, to ensure services are 
accessible for customers with sight loss. Our ongoing partnership with 
Disability Rights UK, and other disability organisations, is helping our 
drivers meet the needs of those living with disability and health 
conditions. We also support Greener Journeys’ annual Catch the Bus 
Week initiative, which promotes the benefits of bus travel including 
environmental considerations and the importance of bus services to 
local economies.
We were pleased to be awarded the contract to provide bus services for 
the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Our SimpliCITY network 
across the city will be supplemented by new services and shuttles 
linking principal Games venues with the city centre. We will also be 
providing bus and coach services for all client groups during the Games 
including the athletes, technical officials, media and sponsors.
Future priorities
In the 2013/14 year we saw each component of our transformation 
plans coming together to enable the full potential in each market to 
begin to be realised. Each of our core initiatives is being rolled out 
across our bus businesses in a tailored local way. Our customers are 
beginning to recognise and welcome the improvements we are making 
to services across our operations, and we are seeing positive signs of 
passenger satisfaction scores improving and passenger volumes 
increasing. In combination, our strategies are building a more resilient 
business and we continue to move towards achieving double digit 
margins over the life of the plan.
Outlook
In 2014/15 we will continue to work through our network and fares 
optimisation programmes, and will be embedding the benefits of 
changes already made as some of the early schemes reach their first 
anniversary during the first half of the financial year. During 2014/15 the 
introduction of smart and mobile ticketing, together with enhancements 
to customer information channels, are designed to spur further volume 
growth. Although the local economies in some of our markets continue 
to be challenging, and local authority concessionary fare budgets 
remain under pressure, we have confidence that we will harness our 
compelling market positions to deliver sustained volume and revenue 
growth underpinned by tight cost disciplines over the coming years.

UK Rail
Market overview
UK Rail is the UK’ s largest rail operator with  
almost a quarter of the passenger rail network, 
carrying more than 330m passengers  
per year.
Market review and trends
Passenger rail services are primarily provided by private train operating 
companies through franchises awarded by the relevant authority,  
but may also be provided on an ‘open access’ basis. Operators are 
responsible for the day-to-day management and operation of train 
services. Many elements of the service provided to passengers are 
mandated as part of the franchise contract and others are left to 
commercial judgment. Total franchised passenger revenues in the UK 
are around £8bn per annum. Rail tracks and infrastructure (signalling 
and some major stations) are owned and managed by Network Rail. 
Operators typically lease rolling stock from leasing companies. 
Passenger growth across the industry remains at historically high levels, 
despite recent macro-economic pressures, as a result of improved 
rolling stock, marketing initiatives and additional services. During the 
year the Government made progress against its revised refranchising 
timetable with a third generation of competitions now fully under way, 
whilst, following devolution, the Scottish Government is also making 
progress with its two franchise competitions. The Government 
continues to invest in infrastructure and new rolling stock across the 
country to deliver visible improvements for passengers, funded in part 
by regulated fare increases. To facilitate infrastructure and rolling stock 
work, closer partnerships between Network Rail and operators are 
positively encouraged by Government. Innovations such as smart 
ticketing, social media and mobile phone technology are being 
introduced across the sector.
We have experience running 
all types of rail operations in 
the UK and, by participating 
in a range of franchise 
competitions, we look forward 
using our expertise to provide 
more and better rail services 
across the UK.

Customers
Rail markets differ but are generally categorised into three sectors: 
London and south east commuter services; regional; and long 
distance. For our franchises in London and the south east of England, 
the majority of our passengers are commuters to and from the capital.  
First Great Western and First Hull Trains also have a large proportion  
of long distance and leisure travellers. First ScotRail and First 
TransPennine Express carry a large number of commuters into the 
major towns and cities on their networks, and also serve a significant 
leisure market. 
Competitors
The main competitor to rail services in the UK is the private car.  
We also face competition on some of our passenger flows from  
other rail services and, to a lesser extent, from long distance coach 
services and airlines. Our UK Rail division bids for franchises against 
other operators of current UK rail franchises and rail operators from 
other countries.

Financial performance
Our UK Rail division saw like-for-like passenger growth of 5.9% during 
the year (2013: 7 .4%) as the strong demand that has been seen across 
the industry since privatisation continued into 2013/14. Revenue during 
the year was £2,870. 1m (2013: £2,795. 1m), with the increase principally 
due to the strong passenger volume growth across all of our train 
operating companies. Adjusted operating profit was £55.2m (2013: 
£19.3m), representing a margin of 1.9% (2013: 0.7%), in part reflecting 
First Great Western moving from a loss-making position to normal 
commercial terms under the direct award agreed in October 2013 and 
the successful delivery of a number of important fleet and infrastructure 
projects in conjunction with industry partners.
Focused and disciplined bidding 
This year the DfT and Transport Scotland have made significant 
progress in the third generation of their rail refranchising programmes, 
which will see £8bn per annum of long term contract-backed 
passenger revenue available through 19 major franchise opportunities 
in the coming years. We are shortlisted for a number of competitions  
in the current round of franchising.

We submitted compelling bids for the first four of these which 
demonstrate value for money for passengers, the taxpayer and our 
shareholders, and expect to submit a competitive bid for the InterCity 
East Coast competition in the summer. We are also investigating 
contract opportunities from other franchising authorities, and during  
the year we were pleased to be shortlisted for the tender to operate  
the Luas light rail system in Dublin by the Railway Procurement Agency 
of the Republic of Ireland. The contract award decision is expected in 
the autumn of 2014.
Following the review of the refranchising programme completed in 
2012/13, the DfT announced a new timetable in March 2013 which was 
subsequently updated in April 2014. As part of this new timetable, we 
agreed shorter direct awards with the DfT to run our First Capital 
Connect franchise for an additional six months until September 2014 
and our First Great Western franchise for an additional two years until 
September 2015, securing continuity of rail services for passengers 
and retaining our experience in managing the impact of the multi-billion 
pound investment programmes already underway on these networks. 
We are progressing negotiations with the DfT to continue operating our 
First TransPennine Express franchise until February 2016, and working 
with the Department to explore whether a longer direct award with First 
Great Western may offer better value for money and better services for 
passengers during the significant programme of works to improve 
services on the Greater Western network.
Continuous improvement in operating and 
financial performance 
Our UK Rail teams have a depth of expertise and a record of delivery. 
Our operating companies have outperformed the industry in delivering 
punctuality and customer satisfaction improvements since 2006, 
despite infrastructure challenges. We continue to work closely with 
Network Rail where we can in order to both help them reduce 
infrastructure issues, which in some of our operating areas accounts  
for two-thirds of delays, and also to ensure upgrades are delivered in  
an efficient manner which causes the least possible disruption to our 
passengers. By far the most visible impact of infrastructure failures 
were the various incidents associated with the severe winter weather  
in December 2013 and February 2014, which led to significant and high 
profile damage to the Great Western Mainline at Dawlish, Bridgwater 
and Maidenhead. We worked closely with Network Rail as they 
undertook repairs to the line at Dawlish, during which time trains were 
unable to travel between Exeter and Plymouth. We introduced a revised 
timetable and our rail replacement bus teams were able to provide 
comprehensive support including a direct coach link between Exeter 
and key Cornish towns and cities. The line reopened on 4 April 2014.
Amongst the infrastructure upgrades we are currently involved in  
is the £7 .5bn Great Western Mainline upgrade in preparation for the 
introduction of the InterCity Express Programme, Crossrail and a new 
fleet of local electric trains. This upgrade includes the £850m Reading 
station remodelling project, which is due to finish a year ahead of 
schedule thanks in part to excellent working relationships with our 
industry partners. Following our success at securing additional services 
in Wiltshire in partnership with the DfT and local authorities, we began a 
consultation on improving the timetable between London and the 
South West for introduction later in the year.
First Capital Connect was involved in the unveiling of brand new Class 
700 trains which will be introduced from 2016 and the beginning of 
significant work to improve the busy London Bridge station, as part of 
the £6bn Thameslink Programme which will double capacity on the key 
cross-London route. 
We are also a key partner within the industry to deliver rolling stock and 
capacity upgrades with four successful fleet introductions in recent 
years. We are currently involved in programmes to deliver a further 
1,500 new vehicles. The previously announced investment in 40 new 
carriages for First TransPennine Express saw the first new longer 
electric trains run on the Manchester-Scotland route in December, as 
part of the Government’s Northern Hub electrification project. By May 
2014 all of the new vehicles will be in service, permitting an improved 
timetable and in turn freeing up carriages to increase capacity on the 
popular Manchester-Leeds route. 
Prudent investment in our key assets 
First Capital Connect’s fleet of Class 365 trains is being transformed 
with fresh interiors and enhanced accessibility features as part of a 
£31m investment by Eversholt Rail, whilst we are deep cleaning 221 
carriages to a high standard. More than 20 First ScotRail trains have 
been upgraded with new fittings and lighting by Eversholt, with another 
21 vehicles set to be refurbished and repainted by 2016.

Overcoming the impact  
of severe weather 
UK Rail 
Severe weather in both December 
and February caused significant 
problems for national rail 
infrastructure, with all of our 
operating companies affected to 
some extent. Flooding disrupted 
First Great Western’s network at 
both Maidenhead and in Somerset, 
whilst the sea wall at Dawlish 
collapsed in February, severing the 
line between Exeter and Plymouth. 
We worked closely with Network 
Rail as they rebuilt the section of 
track to re-open in April. In the 
meantime, we operated a fleet of 
replacement buses as well as direct 
coaches between Exeter and key 
locations in Cornwall. We eased 
ticket restrictions at times of the 
worst disruption and enhanced our 
provision of customer assistance 
personnel. We also created an 
online microsite to provide 
customers with updates on 
disruption works. Employees from 
all of FirstGroup’s train operating 
companies and other parts of the 
Group volunteered to help station 
and onboard colleagues. 31

retailing capabilities. Our First ScotRail smart ticketing trial is proving 
successful, and we are using the outputs to determine how best to 
introduce smart ticketing across our other franchises.
Between First ScotRail and First Great Western we are leading  
the largest roll out of free Wi-Fi on the UK rail network. Our Class  
180 trains at both First Great Western and First Hull Trains are  
already Wi-Fi equipped. First ScotRail launched a new responsive 
website in mid-March and more people are visiting the website  
using smartphones than computers for the first time ever.
Responsible partnerships with our customers  
and communities 
The latest twice-yearly Passenger Focus survey was completed during 
the autumn. Amongst the results were some notable improvements for 
our train operating companies – as scores for our stations have 
increased across the board, our employees at First ScotRail and First 
TransPennine Express saw increased satisfaction scores, and specific 
initiatives such as our refreshed train interiors at First Capital Connect 
saw improved results. We have studied all of these findings and are 
acting on what our customers tell us is important. 
First ScotRail is the Official Supporter – Passenger Rail Services for the 
Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games and has been preparing the 
timetable with Glasgow 2014 and industry partners for more than two 
years, with more than a million extra journeys expected on our trains 
during the Games. 
First ScotRail secured the UK’s most recognised people award during 
the year for its sustained investment in staff training, being accredited 
with Investors in People (IiP) Gold status. First ScotRail is now the 
largest IiP Gold-accredited company in the UK, measured by the 
number of people employed.
We became the first UK rail operator to partner with a national loyalty 
points scheme during the year as we joined Nectar, the country’s 
largest such programme. This allows us to reward our customers by 
giving them additional incentives when booking online.
During the year we were recognised for our successes, with First 
ScotRail winning the national Rail Business of the Year Award and First 
TransPennine Express awarded European InterCity Operator of the 
Year at the European Rail Congress.
Future priorities
We have been running rail services in the UK since 1997 and currently 
operate around a quarter of the rail market, with the delivery of rail 
services aligned with our customers’ needs at the heart of our offer.  
We are the only UK rail owning group whose services include long 
distance, regional, commuter and sleeper operations. Our 
management team has strong commercial, rolling stock and major 
infrastructure project upgrade expertise and we have a highly 
experienced bidding team. Our objective is to replenish our franchise 
portfolio to deliver profit on a par with the last round of franchising, with 
an acceptable level of risk.
Outlook
Rail passenger volumes across the industry continue to see strong 
growth, with passenger numbers more than doubling since 1996. We 
have seen consistent strong performance and have a highly successful 
record of delivery, outperforming the industry in achieving punctuality 
and customer satisfaction improvements. We remain committed to our 
goal of providing more and better rail services across the UK and have 
a clear focus on meeting the needs of passengers, taxpayers and 
delivering an economic return for shareholders.

First Bus and First ScotRail are proud  
to be official supporters of the Glasgow 
2014 Commonwealth Games, providing 
passenger rail and bus services. We are 
proud of our Scottish heritage and the 
important role we play connecting people 
and communities up and down Scotland. 
First ScotRail is planning the most 
extensive train timetable that Scotland 
has ever seen in support of the Games 
with additional carriages and more

media and sponsors during the Games, 
and will operate additional buses around 
the city in order to transport the large 
numbers of spectators expected. 
The Games provides an important 
opportunity for Scotland to promote itself 
around the world, and we are pleased 
that our employees will be playing an 
integral role, in partnership with local 
authorities and Games organisers. 32

never complacent and continue to work to improve our injury prevention 
programme. During 2014/15 we will be reinvigorating our programme to 
build on the progress we have made and continue the momentum that 
we have seen in previous years. Our aim is to reinforce safety as a 
personal core value of each of our employees, and create an even 
stronger culture and climate of safety across all of our operations.
Valuing our people
With 1 17 ,000 employees, our people are a key asset for the Group,  
and strengthening our teams is vital to our ability to deliver our 
transformation programme. 
During the year, we launched a Group-wide diversity action plan to  
drive forward our aspiration to be a diverse and inclusive organisation. 
We believe that diversity brings benefits for our customers, communities 
and our people. Valuing our differences and drawing on our collective 
knowledge and experience helps us develop new services, open up new 
markets and broaden our customer base. Transport is not traditionally a 
diverse sector, but our diversity action plan is designed to address this in 
a systematic way over the coming years.
Continued investment in our employees is fundamental to positioning 
FirstGroup as an employer of choice. In 2013/14 we launched a 
comprehensive development offering for our top 350 leaders across 
the business in the UK and North America, designed to support and 
accelerate the delivery of our vision, strategy and values. Significant 
work was also undertaken in 2013/14 to further develop and improve 
our driver training approach, with particular focus on safe driving and 
improved customer service. The programme, which piloted this year 
and will be rolled out across the business in 2014/15, is expected to 
deliver significant improvements in accident rates (particularly amongst 
new drivers) and to reduce customer complaints. 
2013/14 has also been an important year of progress in raising 
employee engagement across the Group, with additional plans for 
2014/15 underway. We want to inspire, develop and recognise our 
people because we know that organisations with engaged employees 
deliver higher quality customer service and are safer, more profitable, 
productive and innovative.
Greener, cleaner futures for our communities
We take a systematic approach to managing our impacts on the 
environment, with Group-wide policies, standards and robust targets 
for our most material impacts, including energy and climate change, air 
emissions, waste and water. Notably, we generate a significant amount 
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through our operations; a major 
contributor to climate change. More than 94% of our emissions come 
from powering our road and rail fleets (with the remainder from energy 
use in our buildings and from business travel), so the focus of our 
climate change mitigation strategy is on innovation and investment in 
energy efficiency and low carbon vehicle technology. 
The following table provides a summary of the emissions for which we 
are responsible. Our absolute carbon emissions reduced by 2.86% this 
year to 2,836,758 tonnes of CO
2
(e). This is a 3.48% reduction against 
our 2010/1 1 baseline, and a result of our ongoing focus on fuel 
efficiency. Our normalised emissions reduced by 0.20% to 422 tonnes 
of CO
2
(e) per £1m of revenue and the longer term trend shows a 7 .80% 
reduction against our 2010/1 1 baseline. All divisions are on track to 
Our approach
Alongside the unrelenting march towards urbanisation and  
increasing congestion, we are responding to the emerging challenges 
of climate change and resource scarcity, population growth and global 
connectivity, shifting consumer expectations, and the ever increasing 
role of technology in modern life. 
Leveraging our scale and global expertise to respond to our social, 
economic and environmental risks and opportunities as they arise over 
the long term will help drive operating and financial performance and 
allow us to maintain responsible partnerships with our customers and 
communities. We are already innovating through the use of low carbon 
vehicle technology, finding new ways to meet changing customer 
expectations, doing more with fewer resources and investing in the  
future potential of our people and our communities.
In this section we highlight our corporate responsibility priorities and 
performance this year. Further information can be found in our 2014 
Corporate Responsibility Report, available on our website.
Dedicated to safety
Always front of mind, safety is our way of life. Our goal is zero injuries 
and we continue to evolve and develop our safety programmes to 
achieve this across FirstGroup. We also recognise that work, health 
and wellbeing are closely linked, and we collaborate with our 
employees to create safe, supportive work environments and  
promote the broader benefits of a healthy lifestyle. 
After seeing improvement over a number of years, and very strong 
performance in 2012/13, the rate of progress against our safety targets 
has slowed this year. Performance has been affected by a number of 
issues, not least the historically severe winter weather conditions 
experienced by our divisions in North America in the last quarter of 
2013/14. This can be seen, for example, in the increased rate of vehicle 
collisions compared with the same three months of the previous year.
There were no employee fatalities in 2013/14, although sadly there  
were three passenger fatalities; one in Greyhound and two in UK Bus. 
The impact of tragic incidents such as these cannot be overestimated  
and they reaffirm the importance of our goal of zero injuries. We are

Helping our communities to prosper
With our knowledge of local issues, and strengthened by our wider 
expertise, insights and skills, we maintain responsible partnerships with  
our customers and communities and aim to be their primary source  
of solutions for the ever growing problem of congestion. We believe  
that excellence in community engagement is critical to sustaining and 
improving the long term partnerships we have with our key stakeholders, 
including our industry partners, customers, government and political 
stakeholders, and all those within our local communities. Drawing on  
our global expertise in this area we have now developed a consistent 
framework for community engagement, supported by best practice tools 
and case studies. During 201 4/15 we will continue to roll out the framework 
across the Group.
One of the ways we engage with our communities is by developing 
long term partnerships with charitable organisations. Our charitable 
programmes focus on those areas where we believe we can deploy 
our scale and expertise to achieve the greatest impact and deliver the 
maximum shared value to our business and local communities. For 
example, through our partnership with leading charity, Guide Dogs,  
we have developed bespoke training for our 17 ,000 UK Bus drivers, 
helping to increase the confidence of people who are blind or partially 
sighted to use the bus. During 2013/14 we carried out a robust 
consultation across our business to review the focus of our charitable 
giving programmes and will launch a refreshed programme in 2014/15.
Human rights
FirstGroup recognises all human rights as defined in the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and supports the principles  
set out in the International Labour Organization Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises established by the Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD). Our Corporate Responsibility 
Policy (available on our website) is aimed at translating that support  
into guidelines and standards that set a common approach  
for the Group and provide practical guidance for our managers and 
employees on the ground. We are committed to ensuring that our 
operations do not infringe human rights, in particular: 
■ ■
We will conduct every aspect of our business with honesty, integrity 
and openness, respecting human rights and the interests of our 
employees, customers and third parties, as detailed in our Code  
of Business Ethics
■ ■
We are committed to creating and maintaining a safe and healthy 
working environment for our employees, customers and the community
■ ■
We recognise our employees’ rights to freedom of association and 
have a high degree of unionisation across our businesses both in 
the UK and North America
■ ■
Through our procurement processes (enshrined in our Supplier Code 
of Conduct, and Procurement and Supplier Management Policy), we 
seek to ensure that goods and services are from sources that do not 
jeopardise human rights, safety or the environment, and expect 
suppliers to adhere to business principles consistent with our own.

The reporting period is defined as 1 April to 31 March, in line with the 
Company’s financial year. However, emissions from energy consumption 
within buildings in our North American operations are reported by calendar 
year due to availability of consumption data. In addition, scope 2 emissions 
from electricity consumption in North America were calculated using CO

Risks and uncertainties
 
Our risk management approach
We have a well-established risk management methodology which we 
use throughout the business to allow us to identify and manage the 
principal risks that could:
■ ■
adversely impact the safety or security of the Group’s employees, 
customers and/or assets
■ ■
have a material impact on the financial or operational performance 
of the Group
■ ■
impede achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives and 
financial targets; and/or
■ ■
adversely impact the Group’s reputation or stakeholder 
expectations
As set out on pages 59 and 60, the Board has overall responsibility for 
the Group’s systems of internal control. 
Risk management structure
Whilst some risks such as fuel costs and treasury risk are managed at 
a Group level (see pages 38 and 39), all of our businesses own and 
manage the risks they face with appropriate assistance from the Group 
functions as necessary. This assistance includes the facilitation of the 
risk identification and management process. Each division has a 
designated Risk Champion who maintains a divisional risk register. 
These are reviewed and consolidated into a Group Risk Register which 
is kept under review on a quarterly basis by the Risk Group which is 
made up of a number of members of the senior management team. 
The Risk Group also oversees the Group’s risk management activities. 
As such, the Risk Group is part of the leadership structure as outlined 
on page 54. The Internal Audit team works closely with the Risk Group 
to ensure that the audit plan is appropriately risk-based.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group’s principal risks are set out overleaf. These risks have been 
assessed taking into account their potential impact, the likelihood of 
occurrence and any change to this compared to the prior year and the 
residual risk after the implementation of controls. A description of each 
principal risk, its potential impact on the Group, any movement in the 
risk during the year and risk mitigation measures are provided. Each 
risk is linked to the relevant strategic objectives, which are detailed  
on page 10.
The risks listed do not comprise all those highlighted by our risk 
management processes or those that may otherwise affect the Group 
or any particular division, nor are those that are listed set out in any 
order of priority. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known 
to us, or that we currently believe to be less material, may also impact 
our business. Any movement shown does not necessarily indicate a 
change in the overall net risk associated with the particular issue during 
the current or future years after mitigating factors and actions have 
been taken into account.

5
Economic conditions, political 
developments and changes in 
government policy affecting the 
markets in which the Group 
operates, whether at a global, 
regional or national level, could 
have a negative impact on the 
Group’s businesses and its ability 
to grow existing businesses and 
retain or win new contracts. The 
same factors could also affect our 
key suppliers.
Reduced demand for public 
transportation. 
Reduced funding for and spending 
by local and national governments 
and other customers on public or 
student transport. 
Changes to market structure or 
dynamics resulting in lost business 
or loss of future opportunity.
Inability to pass on fully to 
customers the impact of increased 
costs.
Supplier failure, or non-
performance, resulting in supply 
chain disruption.
Economic recovery  
in the UK and North 
America is variable by 
state and region.
Some areas of the Group’s business offer a  
degree of protection against economic conditions 
in specific geographic markets.
Certain current rail franchises have revenue 
support and profit sharing arrangements in place. 
Some (but not all) of the new franchises currently 
being let also contain a degree of protection from 
macro-economic factors.
To an extent, our UK Bus operating companies  
are able to modify services in reaction to economic 
and political impacts.
Our Greyhound operations have flexibility to  
modify services in response to reduced demand, 
particularly in the United States.
The Group monitors the financial health of key 
suppliers and identifies alternatives to ensure 
Group supply chain resilience.
We regularly engage with senior policy makers in 
the UK and North America to discuss the emerging 
policy landscape in respect of our core business 
activities. We do this directly and indirectly through 
industry organisations and trade associations.
Attraction and retention of key management 
4
Attracting and retaining key 
members of senior management is 
vital in ensuring that the Group 
continues to have the necessary 
expertise and continuity to execute 
its strategy.
Inability to execute Group strategy 
resulting in reduced profitability  
and growth.
Whilst attraction and 
retention of key 
management may 
become more 
challenging as the 
economy recovers, our 
defined business plans, 
including development 
of more attractive 
commercial propositions, 
have enabled us to 
attract and retain high- 
quality management.
The Group-wide succession planning process and 
performance development approach is designed 
to identify talented individuals, set development 
goals for progression to other roles and to assess 
the depth of talent and any gaps throughout the 
leadership of FirstGroup. The Group also offers 
market-based compensation packages consisting 
of an appropriate mix of long and short term 
incentives.
Rail refranchising 
1
As discussed on page 29, we are 
involved in a number of rail franchise 
competitions. Competition for new 
rail franchises is expected to be 
intense. We bid against operators 
of current UK rail franchises and 
rail operators from other countries, 
principally from within the 
European Union. 
Lower UK Rail division contribution 
and profitability.
Incorrect bid assumptions leading 
to greater than anticipated costs  
or losses. 
All of the Group’s UK 
Rail franchises will 
expire between 2014 
and 2016. Direct 
awards have been 
made in the year to 
extend the First Capital 
Connect and First Great 
Western rail franchises.
The Group has an experienced and dedicated  
rail bid team which will continue to compete for 
franchises as they are re-let.
The Group also has a comprehensive review 
process for bids as they are developed and 
finalised involving a number of divisional and  
Group functions as well as formal Board  
sign off.

Contracted businesses 
1
 
The Group is required to comply 
with certain conditions as part of its 
UK Rail franchise agreements. 
The Group’s First Student and First 
Transit businesses are contracted 
businesses dependent on the 
ability to renew and secure new 
contract wins on profitable terms.
Potential termination of the relevant 
rail franchise agreement and 
possibly others if cross-default is 
invoked, resulting in loss of revenue 
and cash flow as well as some or all 
of the amounts set aside as security 
for performance bonds and season 
ticket bonds.
Loss of business, or failure to 
renew, leading to reduced revenue 
and profitability. 
Incorrect bid assumptions leading 
to greater than anticipated costs  
or losses.
Whilst First Transit’s 
contract retention rate 
remained stable during 
the year, First Student’s 
retention rate was 
slightly reduced 
reflecting our focus on 
improving contract 
portfolio returns.
Compliance with rail franchise conditions is closely 
managed and monitored on a monthly basis by 
senior management and procedures are in place  
to minimise the risk of non-compliance.
The relevant divisions have experienced and 
dedicated bid teams who undertake careful 
economic modelling of contract bids and,  
where possible, seek to negotiate risk sharing 
arrangements with the relevant customer or 
contracting authority.
In First Student, as described on pages 14 and 15,  
we have accelerated the contract portfolio  
pricing programme to focus capital on higher 
returning opportunities.
Competitive pressures 
1
 
2
 
3
 
4
 
5
 
All of the Group’s businesses 
compete in the areas of pricing 
and service and face competition 
from a number of sources.
Our main competitors include the 
private car and existing and new 
public and student transport 
operators across all our markets. 
As mentioned on page 29, 
competition for UK Rail franchises 
remains intense including from 
a number of other large public  
and state-owned entities active in  
the market.
Reduced passenger numbers and 
revenues.
No material change 
during the year.
The Group continues to focus on service quality 
and performance as priorities in making our 
services attractive to passengers and other 
customers. 
In our contract businesses, contract compliance,  
a competitive bidding strategy and a strong 
bidding team are key. 
In addition, wherever possible, the Group  
works with local and national bodies to promote 
measures aimed at increasing demand for public 
transport and the other services that we offer.
Treasury risks 
3
As set out in further detail in note 24 
to the financial statements on 
pages 125 to 130, treasury risks 
include liquidity risks and risks 
arising from changes to foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates. 
The Group is credit rated by 
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. 
Foreign currency and interest rate 
movements impact profit, balance 
sheet and cash flows of the Group. 
Ineffective hedging arrangements 
may not fully mitigate losses or may 
increase them.
A downgrade in the Group’s credit 
ratings to below investment grade 
may lead to increased financing 
costs and other consequences and 
affect the Group’s ability to invest in 
its operations.
The rights issue 
announced in May 2013 
decreased the Group’s 
liquidity risk but its 
credit rating remains 
subject to the 
methodology and 
metrics adopted by the 
credit ratings agencies.
The Group’s treasury policy and delegated 
authorities are reviewed periodically to ensure 
compliance with best practice and to control  
and monitor these risks appropriately. 
The Group is continuously focused on improving 
operating and financial efficiency as part of  
our strategic objectives as outlined on page 10. 39

Pensions 
3
 
4
 
The Group sponsors or participates 
in a number of significant defined 
benefit pension schemes. 
Future cash contribution 
requirements may increase or 
decrease based upon financial 
markets, notably investment 
returns/valuations, the rates used to 
value the liabilities and through 
changes to life expectancy.
Material changes in the accounting 
cost and cash contributions required.
No material change 
during the year.
Through diversification of investments, hedging  
of liabilities, amendment of the defined benefit 
promises and the introduction of defined 
contribution for new starts in UK Bus and Group, 
the Group has reduced these risks. 
Under the UK Rail franchise arrangements,  
the Group’s train operating companies are not 
responsible for any residual deficit at the end of a 
franchise so there is only short term cash flow risk 
within a particular franchise.
Fuel costs 
3
Fuel is a significant component of 
the Group’s operating costs. Fuel 
prices and supply levels can be 
influenced significantly by 
international, political and 
economic circumstances.
High prices, increased volatility of 
fuel prices or supply restrictions, 
shortages or interruptions could 
adversely impact the Group’s 
operations, cash flow and 
profitability. 
The Group may be unable to pass 
increased costs on fully to customers.
Ineffective hedging arrangements 
may not fully mitigate losses or may 
increase them.
No material change 
during the year.
The Group regularly enters into forward hedging 
contracts providing fixed fuel prices. In addition, 
the Group may limit the impact of unexpected fuel 
price rises through efficiency and pricing 
measures.
Terrorism 
5
The threat from terrorism is 
enduring and continues to exist in 
the countries in which we operate. 
Public transport has previously 
been subject to attack and it 
remains important that we take all 
reasonable steps to help guard 
against such activity on any of the 
services we operate. 
Reduced public confidence in 
public transportation, and/or 
specifically in the Group’s security 
and safety record.
Reduced profits resulting from 
reduced demand for our services, 
increased costs or security 
requirements and/or business 
disruption. 
No material change 
during the year.
We continue to develop and apply good practice, 
and train our employees so that they can identify 
and respond effectively to any potential threat  
or incident.

Information technology 
3
 
4
 
The Group relies on information 
technology in all aspects of its 
business. Any significant disruption 
or failure, caused by external 
factors, denial of service, computer 
viruses or human error could result 
in a service interruption, accident 
or misappropriation of confidential 
information (including credit card 
and personal data). Process  
failure, security breach or other 
operational difficulties may also 
lead to revenue loss. 
Successful delivery and 
implementation of the Greyhound 
IT transformation plan is required 
to improve yield management and 
drive future growth.
Loss of revenue and increased 
operating costs due to increased 
capital, security, fines, penalties or 
insurance requirements.
Prolonged failure of our sales 
websites could adversely affect 
revenues.
Failure to manage properly 
implementation of new IT systems 
may result in increased costs and/
or lost revenue.
Web and mobile sales 
channels are of 
increasing importance 
across many of 
our businesses.
As a result of the continuing threat of cyber-attacks 
the Group has increased its dedicated IT security 
resource which, in conjunction with policies and 
procedures and extensive security controls, is 
designed to enhance the resilience and security  
of the Group’s information technology systems  
and the data they contain.
The Group has strengthened its IT project 
management capability during the year.
Customer service

5
The Group’s revenues are at risk if 
it does not continue to provide the 
level of service expected by 
customers.
Contracts not renewed, revenue 
levels reduced or negative impact 
on brand image.
No overall material 
change in the year 
although, as noted  
on page 27 , UK Bus 
achieved an 
improvement in the 
annual independent 
Passenger Focus 
survey.
Customer service is one of our five core values  
(see page 6). The relevant employees undertake 
intensive training programmes to ensure that they 
are aware of, and abide by, the levels of service 
that are required by our customers in each 
business.
Ongoing engagement with customers and 
community stakeholders takes place across the 
Group, including through ‘meet the manager’ 
events, customer panels, consultations and local 
partnerships.
The Board also monitors customer service KPIs  
to ensure that strict targets are being met.
Legislation and regulation 
3
 
4
 
5
Our businesses are subject to 
numerous laws and regulations 
covering a wide range of matters 
including health and safety, 
equipment, employment (including 
working time, wage and hour and 
legislation covering mandatory 
breaks), competition and anti-trust, 
environmental, insurance coverage 
and other operating issues. These 
laws and regulations are constantly 
subject to change.
Increased costs of compliance with 
existing or changes in regulation or 
legislation.
Reduction in operational flexibility  
or efficiency. 
Financial and reputational impact  
of failure to comply.
Negative impact on ability to bid for 
future business.
Our businesses 
continue to experience 
changes in the 
legislative and 
regulatory environment.
The Group has embedded operating policies and 
procedures in all our businesses to ensure 
compliance with existing legislation and regulation.
We have dedicated legal teams in the UK and North 
America who oversee the Group’s compliance and 
training programmes and advise on emerging issues.
The Group closely monitors the impact of changes in 
the regulatory and legal environment and actively 
engages with Government and transport bodies to 
help ensure that we are properly positioned to 
respond to any proposed changes. 41

Litigation and claims 
5
The Group has three main insurable 
risks: third party injury and other 
claims arising from vehicle and 
general operations, employee 
injuries and property damage. 
The Group is also subject to other 
litigation, particularly in North 
America, which is not insured, 
including contractual claims and 
those relating to employee wage 
and hour matters.
Increased costs, reduced 
availability of insurance cover, 
or reputational impact. 
A large single claim or a large 
number of smaller claims may 
negatively affect profitability 
and cash flow.
The claims environment, 
particularly in our North 
American businesses 
remains a challenge 
despite our continued 
focus on safety.
The Group has a very strong focus on safety and, 
as described on page 6, it is one of our five core 
values. The Group self-insures third party and 
employee injury claims up to a certain level 
commensurate with the historical risk profile.  
It purchases insurance above these limits from 
reputable global insurance firms. Claims are 
managed by experienced claims handlers. 
Non-insured claims are managed by the Group’s 
dedicated in-house legal team with external 
assistance as appropriate.
Employee costs and relations 
3
 
4
 
5
Employee costs represent the 
largest component of the Group’s 
operating costs. Labour shortages 
or decreasing unemployment rates 
could hinder the Group’s ability to 
recruit and retain qualified 
employees. 
Our employees are key to service 
delivery and therefore it is 
important that good employee 
relations are maintained.
High employee turnover leading to 
higher than expected increases in 
the cost of recruitment, training  
and our employee costs.
Operational disruption and reduced 
cash flow and profitability from 
industrial action.
No material change 
during the year.
The Group seeks to mitigate these risks by its 
recruitment and retention policies, training 
schemes and working practices. 
Our working practices include building 
communication and engagement with trade  
unions and the wider workforce. Examples  
of this engagement include regular leadership 
conferences, employee surveys and the  
presence of Employee Directors (Directors voted  
for by the employees to represent them) on many  
of the Group’s UK divisional boards and  
the Board.
Environmental 
3
 
4
 
5
The Group’s operations store and 
manage large quantities of fuel at 
our maintenance sites, which 
presents a potential regulatory and 
financial risk in the event of 
significant loss or spillage and are 
subject to ongoing changes in 
environmental regulations.
Along with all businesses we face 
the challenge of addressing climate 
change, both through managing its 
impact and reducing emissions. 
Environmental, reputational or 
financial loss resulting from 
remediation of incidents, 
prosecutions and/or penalties.
Increased costs of compliance due 
to regulatory requirements.
No material change 
overall during the year.
To mitigate these risks, the Group’s storage 
facilities are subject to regular inspection and  
we have detailed fuel handling procedures which  
are regularly audited. 
Robust environmental policies, strategies and 
management systems are maintained across  
the Group.
The Group continues to target reductions in its 
emissions, including through behaviour change 
initiatives and investment in new technology.
Severe weather and natural disasters 
4
 
5
Many of our operations are 
experiencing greater and more 
frequent adverse weather 
disruption leading to reduced or 
cancelled services and reduced 
customer demand.
Reduced profits resulting from 
lower demand for our services, 
increased costs, business 
disruption and increased accidents. This year, our North 
American businesses 
experienced 
unprecedented severe 
weather, affecting 
operational and financial 
performance.
The geographic spread of the Group’s businesses 
offers some protection. In addition, some of our 
contract based businesses have force majeure 
clauses in place. We have severe weather action 
plans and procedures to manage the impact on 
our operations.

Group Finance Director
During the year we have made good 
progress in improving the financial 
stability of the Group as we continue 
our transformation programme and 
invest to create sustainable value.
 Financial r eview
In June 2013, we received the net £584m 
proceeds of the rights issue, and in May 2014 
we signed a five year, £800m revolving credit 
facility which ensures we can progress our 
plans to meet our medium term financial 
targets with greater confidence. 
Financial performance in the year
Group revenue was £6,717 .4m (2013: £6,900.9m), a decrease of 2.7%. 
Adjusting for the UK Bus portfolio changes, the disposal of FSS in First 
Transit and the non-recurring London 2012 Games, like-for-like Group 
revenue increased by 1.2%. Adjusted operating profit increased 5.5% 
to £268.0m (2013: £254. 1m), reflecting higher profits in UK Rail and  
First Transit partially offset by reductions in the other divisions,  
including £14m profit impact of unprecedented weather conditions  
on First Student and Greyhound in the fourth quarter. Group margins 
increased, with improvements in UK Bus, First Transit, and UK Rail 
more than offsetting declines in First Student and Greyhound. Statutory 
operating profit was £232.2m (2013: £139.8m) reflecting the increased 
adjusted operating profit and a much reduced charge for exceptional 
items this year. Adjusted basic EPS decreased to 7 .5p (2013: 1 1.0p), 
reflecting the increased number of shares in issue following the rights 
issue, whereas attributable profit for the adjusted EPS calculation 
increased by 21.8% from £65. 1m to £79.3m in the year. EBITDA 
decreased 1.0% to £579.8m (2013: £585.7m). ROCE improved to 
8.2%, compared with 7 .0% (as restated) for the year to 31 March 2013.

 Financial r eview
The Group has reviewed its treatment of exceptional items, in particular 
generally recurring costs associated with UK Rail bids and profit/(loss) 
on property disposals. As a result, these items have been included in 
our measure of adjusted results in this document and the prior year has 
also been restated accordingly. 
The net cash inflow for the year, excluding the net proceeds of £584.4m 
from the rights issue, was £26.9m (2013: outflow of £7 4.4m). The net 
debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.2 times (2013: 3.4 times). The average debt 
duration at 31 March 2014 was 6. 1 years (2013: 5.4 years) and there 
was £988.5m (2013: £1,215.5m) of headroom under committed 
facilities and free cash. 
During the year gross capital expenditure of £464.7m (2013: £404.3m) 
was invested in our business to continue the transformation 
programme and invest in future growth. We continue to anticipate 
investing approximately £400m per annum in capital expenditure over 
the next three financial years in our businesses.
The Group is broadly on track to achieve our medium term targets and, 
while we are encouraged by progress so far, there remains a significant 
amount of work ahead. We are confident that we have the right plans 
underway to build on our market leading positions, strengthen the 
resilience of the Group, and return to a profile of sustainable cash 
generation and value creation for the long term. 
Key medium term financial targets
Increase Group revenue (excluding UK Rail) at a faster rate than  
the economies we serve
Improve First Student and UK Bus margins to double-digit levels
Improve Greyhound margins to approximately 12%
Increase Group ROCE to between 10%-12%
Return the Group to being a reliable, consistent cash generative 
business and re-establish a progressive and sustainable dividend 
policy at the appropriate time 
Treasury objectives

UK Bus depot sales and closures
UK Bus depot sales and closures relate to measures taken by the 
Group to rebalance its portfolio in the UK Bus operations, which 
included selling or closing certain operations. The principal amount 
represents a £16.5m gain on the disposal of the eight London bus 
depots, which completed during the year, offset by £3.5m of losses  
on depots sold or closed.
UK Rail First Great Western contract provision
The total loss in the final seven periods of the franchise was not as high 
as initially projected partly due to contractual changes agreed with the 
DfT. As a result £4.6m has been released as an exceptional credit. 
UK Rail bid cost recoveries
The Group received £12.7m of bid cost recoveries during the year to  
31 March 2013 representing cost reimbursement from the DfT following 
the cancellation of the InterCity West Coast Franchise process. 
Amortisation charges
The charge for the year was £53.4m (2013: £52.0m) with the increase 
mainly due to the amortisation of the First Great Western contract 
intangible recognised as a result of the contract extension, partly offset 
by the impact of foreign exchange movements.  45

 Financial r eview
continued
Ineffectiveness on financial derivatives
There was a £17 .6m non-cash charge (2013: £5.5m) to the income 
statement during the year due to ineffectiveness on financial derivatives. 
The principal component of this non-cash charge relates to certain  
US Dollar interest rate swaps, which are no longer required as the 
underlying US Dollar debt was repaid from the proceeds of the  
rights issue.
Tax
The tax credit as a result of these amortisation charges and exceptional 
items was £24.9m (2013: £39.4m). In addition there was a one-off 
deferred tax credit of £3.2m (2013: £2.0m) as a result of the reduction  
in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 20% (2013: 24% to 23%).
Finance costs and investment income
Adjusted net finance costs were £156. 1m (2013: £163.2m) with the 
reduction principally reflecting the lower level of debt as a result of 
repayments following the rights issue, partly offset by the additional 
£8.7m of interest on pensions due to the impact of IAS 19 (revised). 
Profit before tax
Adjusted profit before tax was £1 1 1.9m (2013: £90.9m) with the 
increase due principally to higher adjusted operating profit and lower 
net finance costs. An overall charge of £53.4m (2013: £1 19.8m) for 
exceptional items and amortisation charges resulted in statutory profit 
before tax of £58.5m (2013: loss of £28.9m).
Tax
The tax charge, on adjusted profit before tax, for the period was 
£22.4m (2013: £17 .5m) representing an effective rate of 20.0% (2013: 
19.3%). There was a tax credit of £24.9m (2013: credit of £39.4m) 
relating to amortisation charges and exceptional items. There was also 
a one-off credit adjustment of £3.2m (2013: £2.0m) to the UK deferred 
tax liability as a result of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate 
from 23% to 20% (2013: 24% to 23%), which will apply from April 2016. 
This resulted in a total tax credit of £5.7m (2013: £23.9m) on continuing 
operations. The actual tax paid during the period was £8.2m (2013: 
£6.3m). North American cash tax remains low due to tax losses 
brought forward and tax depreciation in excess of book depreciation. 
We expect the North American cash tax rate to remain low for the 
near term. 
EPS
The adjusted basic EPS was 7 .5p (2013: 1 1.0p). Basic EPS was 5. 1p 
(2013: (3.0)p), with the improvement primarily due to higher operating 
profit, lower net finance costs and lower net exceptional items 
compared to last year.

Cash flow
The net cash inflow for the year was £26.9m (2013: outflow £7 4.4m). The cash inflow combined with the £584.4m net proceeds from the rights 
issue and the movements in debt due to foreign exchange contributed to a net debt decrease of £675.3m (2013: increase £141.6m) as

The net cash inflow compared to the outflow last year was primarily 
due to:
■ ■
No equity dividend payments (2013: £114.0m) 
■ ■
Proceeds from sale of businesses were £37 .1m higher, reflecting the 
London depots disposal completion in the year 
■ ■
Working capital excluding First Great Western provision movement 
was £15.5m favourable to the prior year principally due to the timing 
of certain receipts in UK Rail.
Partly offset by:
■ ■
Higher planned First Great Western provision utilisation of £18.3m 
during the year
■ ■
Higher interest and tax payments of £12.8m primarily due to the 
timing of interest payments on the bonds, offset by a lower bank 
interest charge as a result of the rights issue
■ ■
Higher movement in other provisions of £23.9m due to the benefit 
last year of First Student and First Transit legal claims provided for 
but not paid in the year 
■ ■
Higher dividends payable to non-controlling minority shareholders  
of £10.6m

Capital expenditure
Cash capital expenditure was £334.5m (2013: £338. 1m) and comprised 
First Student £130.8m (2013: £127 .7m), First Transit £18. 1m (2013: 
£18.0m), Greyhound £45.8m (2013: £51.3m), UK Bus £67 .4m (2013: 
£72.4m), UK Rail £68.5m (2013: £66. 1m) and Group items £3.9m  
(2013: £2.6m). 
In addition during the year we entered into operating leases for 
passenger carrying vehicles in First Student with capital values of 
£25.2m (2013: £nil), First Transit with capital values of £19.5m (2013: 
£12.5m), Greyhound with capital values £14.7m (2013: £nil) and UK Bus 
with capital values of £24.3m (2013: £21.6m).
Gross capital investment was £464.7m (2013: £404.3m) and comprised 
First Student £194.3m (2013: £150.8m), First Transit £37 .2m (2013: 
£30.5m), Greyhound £60.5m (2013: £51.3m), UK Bus £101.7m (2013: 
£103.0m), UK Rail £69.4m (2013: £63.9m) and Group items £1.6m 
(2013: £4.8m).
Funding and risk management
Liquidity within the Group has remained strong. At 31 March 2014 there 
was £988.5m (2013: £1,215.5m) of committed headroom and free 
cash, being £796.2m (2013: £821.6m) of committed headroom and 
£192.3m (2013: £393.9m) of free cash. Largely due to seasonality in the 
North American school bus business, committed headroom typically 
reduces during the financial year through October and increases 
thereafter. Treasury policy requires a minimum of £250m of committed 
headroom at all times.
During the year the 2013 £300m bond was repaid in full as planned.  
As at 31 March 2014, the Group’s average debt maturity was 6. 1 years 
(2013: 5.4 years). In May 2014, we signed a five year, £800m revolving 
credit facility with our relationship banks. The Group does not enter into 
speculative financial transactions and uses only authorised financial 
instruments for certain risk management purposes. 
Interest rate risk
The Group reduces exposure by using a combination of fixed rate debt 
and interest rate derivatives to achieve an overall fixed rate position over 
the medium term of more than 75% of net debt.
Fuel price risk
The Group uses a progressive forward hedging programme to manage 
commodity risk. In 2013/14 in the UK, 93% of the ‘at risk’ crude 
requirements (2.2m barrels p.a.) were hedged at an average rate of 
$105 per barrel. At the end of the period we have hedged 92% of our 
‘at risk’ UK crude requirements for the year to 31 March 2015 at $101 
per barrel and 58% of our requirements for the year to 31 March 2016 
at $98 per barrel.
In North America 69% of 2013/14 ‘at risk’ crude oil volumes (1.6m 
barrels p.a.) were hedged at an average rate of $93 per barrel. At the 
end of the period we have hedged 55% of the volumes for the year to 
31 March 2015 at $90 per barrel and 39% of our volumes for the year 
to 31 March 2016 at $87 per barrel.
Foreign currency risk
Group policies on foreign currency risk affecting cash flow, profits and 
net assets are maintained to minimise exposures to the Group by using 
a combination of natural hedge positions and derivative instruments 
where appropriate. Translation risk relating to US Dollar earnings arising 
in the US is largely offset by US Dollar denominated costs incurred in 
the UK, principally UK fuel costs, US Dollar interest and tax costs so 
that exposure to EPS on a year to year basis is not significant. 48

Under the terms of the UK Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be 
distributed by the TOCs either up to the lower amount of their retained 
profits or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios. The 
ring-fenced cash represents that which is not available for distribution 
or the amount required to satisfy the liquidity ratio at the balance 
sheet date.
Shares in issue
As at 31 March 2014 there were 1,204.2m shares in issue (2013: 
481.8m), excluding treasury shares and own shares held in trust for 
employees of 0.7m (2013: 0.3m). The weighted average number of 
shares in issue for the purpose of basic EPS calculations (excluding 
treasury shares and own shares held in trust for employees) was 
1,059.3m (2013: 590.8m).
Balance sheet
Net assets have increased by £408.5m since the start of the period. 
The principal reasons for this are the net proceeds from the rights issue 
of £584.4m, the retained profit for the year of £64.2m, favourable 
hedging reserve movements of £40.4m partly offset by unfavourable 
translation reserve movements of £231. 1m and actuarial losses on 
defined benefit pension schemes (net of deferred tax) of £30.5m.
Goodwill
The carrying value (net assets including goodwill but excluding 
intercompany balances) of each cash generating unit (CGU) was tested 
for impairment during the year and there continues to be sufficient 
headroom in all of the CGUs.  49

Pensions
Comparative figures for the year to 31 March 2013 have been restated 
for IAS 19 (revised) as explained in note 2. 
The Group has updated its pension assumptions as at 31 March 2014 
for the defined benefit schemes in the UK and North America. The net 
pension deficit of £247 .8m at the beginning of the year has increased to 
£260.9m at the end of the year, principally due to a lower net discount 
rate in the UK. 
The main factors that influence the balance sheet position for 
pensions and the sensitivities to their movement at 31 March 2014 
are set out below:
Movement Impact
Discount rate +0.1% Reduce deficit by £29m
Inflation +0.1% Increase deficit by £21m
Seasonality
The First Student business generates lower revenues and profits in the 
first half of the year than in the second half of the year as the school 
summer holidays fall into the first half. Greyhound operating profits are 
typically higher in the first half of the year due to demand being stronger 
in the summer months. 
Going concern
The Group has established a strong balanced portfolio of businesses 
with approximately 50% of Group revenues secured under medium 
term contracts with government agencies and other large organisations 
in the UK and North America.
The Group has a diversified funding structure with average debt 
duration at 31 March 2014 of 6. 1 years (2013: 5.4 years) and which  
is largely represented by a medium term to committed long term 
unsecured bond debt and finance leases. As at 31 March 2014 the 
Group had a $1,250m committed revolving banking facility of which 
$1,200m (2013: $1, 1 13m) was undrawn at the year end. This facility  
was refinanced in May 2014 and now has a maturity of June 2019.
The Directors have carried out a detailed review of the Group’s budget 
for the year to 31 March 2015 and medium term plans, with due regard 
for the risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed, the 
uncertain economic climate and the impact that this could have on 
trading performance. Based on this review, the Directors believe that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Cautionary statement
This strategic report has been prepared solely to provide additional information to shareholders to assess the Company’s strategies and 
the potential for those strategies to succeed.
The strategic report contains certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made by the Directors in good faith based on the 
information available to them up to the time of their approval of this report and such statements should be treated with caution due to the 
inherent uncertainties, including both economic and business risk factors, underlying any such forward-looking information.
The Directors, in preparing this strategic report, have complied with s414C of the Companies Act 2006.
This strategic report has been prepared for the Group as a whole and therefore gives greater emphasis to those matters which are significant to 
FirstGroup plc and its subsidiary undertakings when viewed as a whole. 50

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
 Directors’ and corporate governance report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce FirstGroup’s Directors’ and corporate 
governance report for 2013/14 and my first as Chairman of  
the Company.
The Group is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance in respect of leadership, effectiveness, accountability, 
remuneration and relations with shareholders as identified by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’). This commitment and the 
alignment of the Group’s framework of controls and corporate 
governance with the tactical delivery of our strategic objectives as 
outlined on page 10 will contribute to the long term success of the 
Group. In this section of the report we provide details of our 
governance structures and processes which should provide 
assurance that the key constituents are in place to deliver sustainable 
long term value for shareholders.
New reporting requirements
This year new legislation has amended the structure and contents of 
the Annual Report. The new strategic report on pages 1 to 49 
includes, amongst other matters, the Group’s strategy, progress and 
performance for the year. Disclosures in the Directors’ and corporate 
governance report comply with changes to the Code that came into 
force for the financial year and include expanded disclosures on the 
work of the Audit Committee on pages 62 to 65. Changes to 
remuneration reporting are significant and are fully covered in the 
Directors’ remuneration report on pages 70 to 92.
Board Composition
As noted in my review on pages 2 and 3, Martin Gilbert retired as 
Chairman during the year and John Sievwright, Senior Independent 
Director, David Begg, Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and Colin Hood, Non-Executive Director 
and Chairman of the Board Safety Committee will retire from the 
Board on 24 June 2014, after a period of long service. I would like to 
thank all of the retiring Directors for their contribution and support to 
me as incoming Chairman.
Three new Directors will join the Board for the June 2014 meeting. 
Warwick Brady, Drummond Hall and Imelda Walsh will join as 
Non-Executive Directors. Biographical details for all three new

Governance
 Directors’ and corporate governance report
The Company complies with all the main and supporting principles of good governance set out in the Code issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council.
Following the Board changes, John McFarlane, Drummond Hall, 
Brian Wallace, Imelda Walsh and Jim Winestock will thereafter 
constitute the members of the Nomination Committee.
It is a natural process for Directors who cease to become 
independent to retire from the Board and for the Board to be 
refreshed. It is an essential part of good governance that we maintain 
a strong Board with a majority of independent Directors and a good 
gender balance.
Director induction
In January 2014, at the start of my appointment as Chairman and as 
part of my induction process, I had the opportunity to meet with 
investors who control over 40% of the issued equity. I welcomed this 
opportunity and found the exercise beneficial and a valuable way to 
commence my tenure as Chairman. Further details of my induction 
can be found on page 58.
Diversity
The Board has previously highlighted that it is an advocate of diversity 
in the boardroom and a supporter of Lord Davies’ aim to raise the 
proportion of women on UK Boards, as reflected in the 2013 Women 
on Boards report. The Board is pleased that, going forward, we are 
moving towards our aspiration of 20% of board positions being filled 
by women by 2015. The Board remains of the opinion that 
appointments to the Board should be made relative to a number of 
different criteria including diversity of gender, background and 
personal attributes, alongside the appropriate skill set, experience and 
expertise. Future appointments to the Board must also complement 
the balance of skills that the Board already possesses. Further details 
of the Group’s approach to diversity and inclusion can be found on 
page 32 and in the Group’s 2014 Corporate Responsibility Report.
Board evaluation
Towards the end of the year the Board undertook an external review 
of Board and Committee effectiveness that also included a review of 
each member of the Board. The review highlighted strengths but also 
areas for improvement and a programme to address these going 
forward was agreed by the Board.
Scottish independence
The Company, as a Scottish registered company, has its 
headquarters and registered office in Scotland. The Scottish 
Government is holding a referendum in September 2014 on the 
question of Scottish independence from the UK. The outcome of  
the referendum is unknown and the implications of an affirmative  
vote are not currently possible to assess with any degree of certainty. 
Those uncertainties and the full implications of an affirmative vote will 
become clearer after the vote and the Board will therefore continue  
to monitor the situation in the meantime.

Governance
Leadership
The role and structure of the Board 
The Board is collectively responsible for the long term success of  
the Company. The Board provides entrepreneurial leadership of  
the Company within a framework of prudent and effective controls  
for risk assessment and management. The Board’s role is to set the 
Company’s strategic objectives, ensure that the necessary financial 
and human resources are in place for the Company to meet these 
objectives and to review management performance. The Board also 
sets the Company’s values and standards and ensures that its 
obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders are understood 
and met. The Board operates within the terms of its written authorities 
but also delegates authority to Committees of the Board to assist in 
meeting its objectives whilst ensuring a sound system of internal 
control and risk management.
The Board currently consists of the Chairman, two Executive Directors 
and six Non-Executive Directors. Changes to Board membership that 
will take place on 24 June 2014 are set out on page 52.
The Board met on 15 occasions in 2013/14. Nine of these meetings 
were regular scheduled Board meetings and six were ad hoc Board 
meetings called at short notice, the majority of which dealt with the 
rights issue and UK rail bids. The table below shows the Directors’ 
attendance at the Board and Committee meetings they were eligible 
to attend in 2013/14.
In addition to regular Board meetings, the Board took part in an 
annual strategy day at which it considered the future direction of the 
Company at the start of the business planning process. The annual 
Board meeting timetable was arranged so that Board meetings were 
held in London, Aberdeen and the US over the year which gave the 
Directors the opportunity to visit different Group operations. All 
Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board and  
of those Committees on which they serve and to devote sufficient 
time to the Company’s affairs to enable them to fulfil their duties as 
Directors. When Directors are unable to attend a meeting, their 
comments on papers to be considered at the meeting may be 
provided in advance to the Chairman. The Chairman sets the Board 
agenda and ensures that important matters and, in particular, 
strategy, performance, value creation and accountability, receive 
adequate time and attention at meetings. The roles and 
responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive, as set out  
on page 56, are clearly defined, documented and approved by  
the Board.

such communications would be inappropriate. Biographical details  
and the dates of appointment of the current Directors are provided  
on pages 50 and 51.
The main responsibilities of the Board 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s strategy and for  
its overall management. The Board sets and reviews the Company’s 
objectives and strategy, reviews the financial and operational 
performance of each of the business units, agrees and reviews 
progress against the Group’s annual budgets and sets and reviews 
longer term business plans. It also approves the half year and full  
year financial statements, financing arrangements, material capital 
commitments, relationships with regulatory authorities and the  
Group’s operating policies. 
Information is supplied to the Directors in a manner that enables  
them to fulfil their responsibilities. This includes the circulation of 
comprehensive briefing papers several days prior to Board and 
Committee meetings. Presentations on business, financial and 
operational issues are made regularly to the Board by senior 
management.

Board Committee structure
The Board Committee structure and reporting lines are set out  
on page 54. Specific responsibilities are delegated to the Audit, 
Remuneration, Nomination and Board Safety Committees, each  
of which has written terms of reference. The terms of reference deal 
clearly with the authorities and duties of each Committee. Copies  
of the terms of reference for these Committees are available on the 
Company’s website. Apart from the Board Safety Committee, each  
of these Committees comprises independent Non-Executive Directors 
of the Company. The Board Safety Committee comprises two 
Non-Executive Directors, the Chief Executive and Group Safety 
Director. Members of the Committees are appointed by the Board on 
the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. The Company 
Secretary is secretary to each Committee. The Chairman of each 
Committee reports the outcome of meetings to the Board.
Effectiveness
Board balance and independence
The effectiveness of the Board and its Committees is vital to the 
success of the Company. Therefore, care is taken, through the 
Nomination Committee, to recruit and appoint Directors who can 
provide and maintain an appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence, knowledge and diversity. The Board complies with the 
Code provisions that at least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, 
is made up of Non-Executive Directors who are considered by the 
Board to be independent.
In considering the independence of its Directors the Board takes into 
account the guidance provided by the Code. The Board considers 
David Begg, Colin Hood, Brian Wallace and Jim Winestock were 
independent during the year. Notwithstanding John Sievwright’s long 
tenure on the Board, the Board agrees with the NAPF Corporate 
Governance Policy and Voting Guidelines in that it views the UK Code 
nine year ‘rule’ as a milestone rather than a cut off and therefore 
considers that John Sievwright continues to be independent in 
character and judgment and his input of significant value to the Board. 
As set out on pages 52 and 53, he will be succeeded as Senior 
Independent Director on 24 June 2014 by Drummond Hall. The 
Chairman, John McFarlane, was independent on his appointment to 
the Board. 
Mick Barker is an employee of one of the Group’s subsidiaries and 
therefore cannot be considered independent in accordance with the 
Code criteria. The Board considers, however, that it is extremely 
beneficial for its employees to be represented on the Board in this  
way as it enables employee related issues to be raised directly at the 
Board and provides a two-way communication between the Board  
and employees.
The Board is satisfied that all the current Non-Executive Directors are 
able to exercise independent judgment and that their experience, 
gained from varied commercial backgrounds, enables them to bring 
specific insights and make valuable contributions to the Company. 
They also challenge assumptions constructively and effectively and 
help the executive management to develop their thinking. 
Commitment
The Board is satisfied that each of the Non-Executive Directors is able 
to devote sufficient time to the Company’s business. Non-Executive 
Directors are advised on appointment of the time required to fulfil the 
role and are asked to confirm that they can make the required 
commitment. The Chairman’s other significant business commitments 
are described in his biography on page 50. One of the criteria 
considered for the appointment of the new Chairman was whether the 
candidate would be able to devote sufficient time to the role. It was 
noted in particular that John McFarlane was Chairman of Aviva plc but 
the Nomination Committee took the view that this would not adversely 
impact his ability to carry out the role. 
Executive Directors are encouraged to take non-executive positions in 
other companies and organisations to broaden their experience. The 
appointment to such positions is subject to the approval of the Board 
which considers, in particular, the time commitment required.  58
FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s conflict of interest procedures are reflected in the 
Articles of Association. In line with the Companies Act 2006 the 
Company’s Articles of Association allow the Directors to authorise 
conflicts and potential conflicts of interest where appropriate. The 
decision to authorise a conflict can only be made by non-conflicted 
Directors. The Board considers conflicts or potential conflicts at each 
Board meeting. Directors do not participate in decisions concerning 
their own remuneration or interests. Colin Hood has declared to the 
Board his appointment to the Board of the Glasgow 2014 
Commonwealth Games. First Bus and First ScotRail are official 
supporters of the Games, providing passenger rail and bus services.  
He therefore does not participate in any discussions or approvals 
relating to this matter.
Development
There is an induction programme in place for new Directors. The 
Chairman is responsible for ensuring induction and training programmes 
are provided. All Directors are kept informed of changes in relevant 
legislation and regulations and changing financial and commercial risks 
with the assistance of the Company’s legal advisers and auditor where 
appropriate. Individual Directors, with the support of the Company 
Secretary, are also expected to take responsibility for identifying their own 
training needs and to ensure that they are adequately informed about the 
Group and their responsibilities as a Director. 
Chairman’s induction
An extensive induction process was put together for John McFarlane 
who joined as the Group’s new Chairman in January 2014. This 
included the following elements:
■ ■
Full pack of Company policies and Board procedures provided and 
explained where required
■ ■
Meetings with senior managers and key members of staff
■ ■
Schedule of meetings with major shareholders 
■ ■
Schedule of meetings with key stakeholders for the forthcoming year
■ ■
Site visits including Greyhound facilities in Texas and schedule of 
visits planned for the forthcoming year.
Information and support
The Board receives detailed papers on the business to be conducted 
at each meeting well in advance and all Board members have direct 
access to senior management should they wish to receive additional 
information on any of the items for discussion. The head of each 
operating division attends Board meetings on a regular basis to ensure 
that the Board is properly informed about the performance of that 
division and the issues that it currently faces. 
Directors have access to independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense and to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary who is responsible to the Board for advice on corporate 
governance matters and for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed and that the Company and the Board operate within 
applicable legislation, rules and regulations. The Company Secretary is 
also responsible for facilitating the programme of Directors’ induction 
for enabling appropriate training and development needs to be 
identified and addressed and for Board performance evaluation. 
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
requiring approval of the Board. A new Company Secretary, Robert 
Welch, was appointed by the Board to succeed the retiring Company 
Secretary, Paul Lewis, with effect from 19 May 2014.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertakes regular evaluations of its own performance  
as well as that of the various Board Committees. As mentioned in  
the Chairman’s letter, an evaluation was carried out by Independent 
Board Evaluation at the end of this year.
Choice of evaluator
The choice of external evaluator was a key consideration for the 
Company. Independent Board Evaluation (IBE) carried out an external 
evaluation in December 2012 and was chosen again this year to 
conduct the process due to their flexibility of approach and ability  
to engage meaningfully with the Directors. They are therefore able to 
assess progress on issues raised. IBE’s knowledge of the background 
and development of FirstGroup was also an important factor enabling 
them to carry out an effective and targeted process.
Evaluation focus
The aim of the evaluation was to establish a benchmark against which 
future change can be assessed by the new Chairman.
Evaluation process
A comprehensive brief was given to the IBE assessment team by the 
Company Secretary and the Chairman in February 2014. The lead 
evaluator also observed main Board and Committee meetings. Support 
materials for briefing purposes were provided by the Company.
Detailed interviews were conducted with every Board member with 
participants being interviewed according to a set agenda, tailored for 
the Board. In addition, the team interviewed some of the senior 
management team and the Company Secretary.
Draft conclusions were discussed with the Chairman and subsequently 
with the Board at its meeting in May 2014. Following the Board 
meeting, the evaluation team gave feedback to Committee Chairmen 
on the performance of each Committee. The Chairman, John 
McFarlane received a report with feedback on individual Directors and 
John Sievwright received a report with feedback on the Chairman.
Conclusions
The report indicated that the culture of the Board is changing and it is 
becoming more effective. As well as highlighting certain strengths, the 
report also identified areas for improvement, including Board diversity, 
with steps taken for this to be addressed. As a result of the evaluation  
a programme of actions was agreed by the Board in May 2014 and will 
be reported on in next year’s Annual Report.
Re-election of Directors at the Annual General Meeting
In accordance with the Articles of Association and the Code, all  
the then Directors will be offering themselves for annual election  
or re-election at the forthcoming AGM to be held on 16 July 2014.

FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Governance
Accountability 
Financial and business reporting
The Directors have a commitment to best practice in the Group’s 
external financial reporting in order to present a balanced and 
comprehensive assessment of the Group’s financial position and 
prospects to its shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and 
other third parties. This commitment encompasses all published 
information including, but not limited to, the year end and half yearly 
financial statements, regulatory news announcements and other public 
information. The quality of its reporting is ensured by having in place 
procedures for the review of information by management. There are 
also strict procedures set out in the Board’s delegated authorities 
determining who has authority to release information. A statement of 
the Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial statements can 
be found on page 93.
The Group adopts a financial reporting and information system which 
complies with generally accepted accounting practice. The Group 
Finance Manual, circulated by the Group Finance function to all 
subsidiaries and finance functions, details the Group’s accounting 
policies and procedures with which subsidiaries must comply. Budgets 
are prepared by subsidiary company management which are then 
consolidated into divisional budgets. These are subject to review by 
both senior management and the Executive Directors followed by 
formal approval by the Board. Regular forecast updates are completed 
during the year and compared against actions required. Each 
subsidiary unit prepares a monthly report of operating performance 
with a commentary on variances against budget and prior year. Similar 
reports are prepared at a Group level. Key performance indicators, 
both financial and operational, are monitored on a weekly basis. In 
addition, business units participate in strategic reviews which include 
consideration of long term financial projections and the evaluation of 
business alternatives.
Review of effectiveness of financial controls
The Directors confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness of the 
system of internal controls for the year under review and to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts through the Audit 
Committee’s review of reports prepared by Internal Audit.
Treasury operations
The Board has set a policy for management of the risks from treasury 
operations and this is set out in more detail in note 24 to the financial 
statements. A Group Treasury Policy has been formulated and adopted 
to ensure compliance with best practice and to control and monitor 
effectively the risks attendant upon treasury and banking operations.
Risk management and internal control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for determining the nature and 
extent of the risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. 
The Board regularly reviews its procedures for identifying, evaluating 
and managing risk and meeting the requirements of the Code and its 
related guidance on internal controls. A sound system of internal control 
is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The principal risks identified as a result of the Group’s risk management 
procedures are shown on pages 36 to 41. The responsibility for 
establishing detailed control and risk management procedures within 
each subsidiary lies with the Executive Directors and divisional 
managing directors.
The Board sponsors the Risk Group as part of the Group’s risk 
management procedures. The Risk Group comprises representatives 
from Finance, IT, Legal, Insurance, Internal Audit, Company Secretariat, 
Corporate Communications, HR, Corporate Responsibility and 
Security and is also attended by relevant divisional senior management. 
The divisions present their matrix and controls at least yearly. 
The Risk Group meets at least four times annually and reports to the 
Audit Committee which in turn reports to the Board with the express 
purpose of reviewing the risk and control procedures in each of the 
business areas and support functions. As a result of the reports 
submitted to it by the Risk Group, the Audit Committee is able to keep 
under regular review the major risks facing the Group and the adequacy 
of mitigating controls. 
Further details of the Group’s risk management approach, risk 
management structure and principal risks and uncertainties are set  
out on pages 36 to 41.
Control environment
The Board is committed to business integrity, high ethical and moral 
values and professionalism in all its activities, principles with which all 
managers and employees are required to comply. The Group has  
a Code of Business Ethics, which is part of the Group’s Corporate 
Responsibility Policy. A copy is available on the Company’s website.
In addition, the Board has effective controls in place (including an 
Anti-Bribery Policy) to address the requirements of relevant anti-
corruption legislation including the UK Bribery Act 2010 and the US 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 . Internal Audit maintains a Group 
Hospitality and Gifts Register which records all hospitality or gifts given 
or received by all Board and Executive Management Board members 
(including all hospitality or gifts offered but not accepted), the value of 
which exceeds a de minimis amount. Additional Hospitality and Gift 
Registers are also maintained at divisional level. 
The Group has a defined divisional organisational structure with lines  
of authority and delegated responsibility which allows the Board to 
plan, execute, control and monitor the business in a manner consistent 
with the Group’s objectives. The day-to-day business management is 
delegated to the Executive Directors and divisional management under 
the overall direction of the Chief Executive. As noted above, the Board 
reserves to itself a number of specific items, which ensures that it 
 Directors’ and corporate governance report
continued 60
FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
retains control over key business decisions and significant transactions 
in terms of size, type or risk. A number of the Group’s key functions 
including Treasury, Taxation, Insurance, Finance, Legal, Internal Audit, 
Corporate Communications, Pensions and Procurement are dealt with 
centrally. Each of these functions is monitored by an Executive Director.
Whistleblowing
The Group has well established procedures whereby employees may,  
in confidence, raise concerns relating to personal or employment issues, 
potential fraud, health and safety, harassment, discrimination, security  
or any other matter. The confidential hotline covers all businesses across 
the Group in each country in which it operates. The Audit Committee 
reviews whistleblowing arrangements as part of its responsibilities.
The Group is confident that these whistleblowing arrangements are 
satisfactory and enable proportionate and independent investigation  
of such matters and appropriate follow up action to be taken.
Monitoring
Throughout the year Internal Audit conduct a comprehensive 
programme of reviews of internal controls within the operating units. 
These reviews have sometimes highlighted minor control weaknesses 
which are discussed with management and remedial action plans are 
agreed. Where appropriate, follow up visits to the operating entity then 
confirm that the action plans have been completed and that the 
controls that have been put in place are working effectively. No material 
losses, contingencies or uncertainties that would require disclosure in 
the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts have been identified during 
the year by this process.
Nomination Committee 
My role as Chairman of the Nomination Committee complements 
my role as Chairman of the Board.
I strongly believe that good governance and strong balanced Board 
leadership are critical to creating shareholder value. Having made 
the changes to the Board referred to on pages 52 and 53, the 
Committee will renew the membership of the other Board 
Committees as appropriate. We will continue to take account of the 
Board’s aims in relation to diversity whilst ensuring that we have the 
right people with the right skills on the Board and in senior 
management positions in the coming years.
John McFarlane 
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
Membership and meetings
Composition of the Committee and attendance by individual members

Role of the Nomination Committee
The terms of reference of the Committee set out the Committee’s 
responsibilities. These were updated in March 2013. They are available 
on request and are also published on the Company’s website. 
The key responsibilities of the Nomination Committee are to:
■ ■
review the structure, size and composition of the Board (including 
the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity (including 
gender)) and ensure that all members of the Board have devoted 
sufficient time to their duties
■ ■
identify and nominate for approval by the Board, candidates  
to fill vacancies as and when they arise, including utilising  
search consultants where appropriate
■ ■
oversee the succession planning process for the Board and  
senior management
■ ■
make recommendations to the Board regarding the continuation in 
office of any Director, including their proposed re-election.
The Employee Director is elected by the Employee Directors’ forum, 
which comprises the Employee Directors of the Company’s UK 
subsidiaries, and serves a maximum of three, three-year terms.

Recruitment of Chairman of the Board
Following the announcement by Martin Gilbert that he would be 
standing down as Chairman of the Board the Nomination Committee 
put in place a process for finding a successor. John Sievwright, as 
Senior Independent Director, led the process. Martin Gilbert, as 
outgoing Chairman, did not participate. The Committee appointed JCA 
Group to act as the recruitment agent for the new Chairman. JCA 
Group has no other connection with the Group apart from the provision 
of senior executive recruitment services. The Committee decided on 
the key attributes, specifications and time commitment required for the 
role. A role specification was also drafted and approved. 
JCA Group prepared a list of potential candidates for the role, each of 
which was discussed and considered in detail by the Committee. A 
number of interviews and meetings were then held with interested parties. 
Engagement with major shareholders was ongoing throughout the 
recruitment process in order to obtain their feedback. At the conclusion  
of that process the Nomination Committee unanimously recommended  
to the Board that John McFarlane be appointed as the new Chairman of  
the Company. 
Diversity
In 201 1 the Board approved the following commitment to diversity: 
“We are supporters of diversity in the boardroom and we are 
supportive of the Financial Reporting Council’s aims to encourage 
diversity in the boardroom. We are also supportive of Lord Davies’ aim 
to raise the proportion of women on UK boards and will work towards 
an aspiration of 20% of Board positions filled by women by 2015, 
subject to availability of candidates with the right skills and experience. 
We remain of the opinion that appointments to the Board should be 
made relative to a number of different criteria including diversity of 
gender, background and personal attributes, alongside the appropriate 
skill set, experience and expertise.”
As described in the Chairman’s letter, with the appointment of Imelda 
Walsh, the Board is moving towards its aspiration to raise the 
proportion of Board positions filled by women (subject to her election 
by shareholders at the AGM on 16 July 2014). 
To further support the Group’s diversity ambition, an action plan has 
been developed which includes launching our new Equality, Diversity 
and Inclusion Policy (and supporting framework), setting diversity and 
inclusion priorities for each of our divisions and running employee  
focus groups in the UK to collect views of the employee experience  
at FirstGroup. 
Nomination Committee evaluation
The performance of the Nomination Committee was reviewed as  
part of the external evaluation of the Board and its Committees.  
Some action items were identified for the Nomination Committee 
including a stronger emphasis on succession planning for senior 
management. This will be addressed during the coming year.

Audit Committee 
I am pleased to introduce to you the Audit Committee report for the 
year ended 31 March 2014. I joined the Committee in January 2013 
and succeeded John Sievwright as Chairman of the Committee on 
29 October 2013. I would like to thank John on behalf of the Audit 
Committee for his hard work and effective chairmanship over  
the years. 
As well as its core activities the Audit Committee has focused on 
risk management and the review of significant judgments that 
impact the Group’s financial statements to ensure that these are 
properly addressed. The Committee has also reviewed the new 
reporting requirements for audit committees introduced by  
the Code. 
The Audit Committee intends to maintain its focus on ensuring the 
appropriate management of risk and the integrity of the Group’s 
financial reporting processes and procedures in the year ahead.  
In addition we will keep under review expected developments in  
going concern reporting and legislative proposals from the EU  
and Competition & Markets Authority on audit tendering.
Brian Wallace 
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Membership and meetings
Composition of the Committee and attendance by individual members 
at Audit Committee meetings is detailed in the following table. The 
Committee met four times during the year. The Committee is 
scheduled to meet at least four times during the year at times set 
according to the financial reporting calendar. 
Notwithstanding his resignation as Chairman of the Committee, John 
Sievwright remained as a member of the Committee. John Sievwright 
was considered by the Board to be independent during the year 
despite having served over nine years as a Non-Executive Director.  
His continued membership of the Committee was considered to be  
of key importance at this time of transition due to his experience of the 
Group and previous chairmanship of the Audit Committee. The Board 
therefore believes that membership of the Committee is compliant with 
the Code. Brian Wallace has held executive positions within a number 
of large organisations as Group Finance Director and other senior 
finance roles and is a chartered accountant. 
The Group Director of Internal Audit and the Group’s external auditor 
regularly attend Audit Committee meetings. Executive Directors and 
other senior managers also attend when requested and as appropriate. 
Meetings were held with the external auditor and the Committee 
without management being present during the year. The Group 
Director of Internal Audit has the right of direct access to the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. Committee meetings may be requested by the 
external or internal auditors if they consider it necessary.

 Directors’ and corporate governance report

FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Governance
Internal Audit
The Group has an Internal Audit function which reports to the Audit 
Committee. Internal Audit reviews internal controls and reports to the 
Audit Committee on these controls, any areas of weakness identified 
and whether the controls are operating effectively. Internal Audit reports 
are presented at each Audit Committee meeting. 
Internal Audit operates under an Audit Charter which was reviewed 
during the year. The Audit Charter sets out the purpose, organisation, 
authority, responsibilities and standards of practice for the Internal  
Audit function.
Each year an Internal Audit Plan is prepared and approved by the 
Committee and the Board which identifies areas of priority as identified 
by risk analysis. Progress against the plan is monitored by the Audit 
Committee. The outcome of Internal Audit work is monitored, reports 
are sent to senior executives of the Group and subsidiary units and 
there is a follow up process to ensure that actions to resolve any 
identified control weaknesses are implemented. 
The effectiveness of the Internal Audit function is reviewed by the Audit 
Committee. This is done by the review of the Internal Audit Plan of work 
for the year and monitoring progress against the plan and actions 
identified in the plan.
External auditor
The Committee assesses the independence of the external auditor  
and the effectiveness of the external audit process before making 
recommendations to the Board in respect of its appointment or 
re-appointment. 
In assessing independence and objectivity, the Committee considers 
the level and nature of service provided by the external auditor as well 
as confirmation from the external auditor that it has remained 
independent within the meaning of the APB Ethical Standards of 
Auditors. Deloitte LLP confirmed its independence to the Committee  
at various stages throughout the year and at the end of the external 
audit process for the financial year. 
The current auditor, Deloitte LLP , has been the Group’s auditor since 
1999 and the Senior Statutory Auditor (SSA) is rotated every five years. 
The current SSA was appointed in the 2010/1 1 financial year  
and therefore a new SSA is due to be appointed for the 2015/16 
financial year. 
The Committee is aware of the new Code requirement for the external 
audit contract to be re-tendered at least once every ten years. The 
Financial Reporting Council has also recommended transitional 
arrangements in this respect. In addition there are forthcoming 
changes to European Union regulations concerning the audit market.  
In view of the uncertainty regarding the form and impact of these 
regulations, the Committee will recommend a course of action to the 
Board during the year in respect of the tender of the external  
audit contract.
The majority of non-audit work is put out to tender, with the exception 
of audit-related assurance services. In such cases, the current auditor’s 
knowledge of the Company’s business processes and controls means 
that it is usually best placed to undertake this work on a cost-effective 
basis on the Company’s behalf. The major item of non-audit fees during 
this year was for work surrounding the rights issue. The Deloitte LLP 
teams working on non-audit projects also included partners with no 
involvement or responsibility for the external audit to ensure that the 
objectivity of Deloitte LLP was maintained. The Committee took the 
view that the expertise and in-depth knowledge of the business meant

that Deloitte LLP were best placed to provide these services. Details  
of the audit and non-audit fees, including a further breakdown of the 
non-audit fees, are set out in note 6 to the financial statements. 
The Committee concluded that the nature and extent of the non-audit 
fees did not compromise the independence of the external auditor. 
The effectiveness of the external audit process is first assessed by 
reviewing delivery and performance against the External Audit Plan  
for the year, which includes the reports and updates provided to the 
Committee. An annual assessment is then carried out by the 
Committee, taking into account the results of questionnaires completed 
by each of the divisions and Group management. These questionnaires 
cover a variety of topics including: the audit partners and team; the 
planning and execution of the audit approach; and insights and added 
value provided by the audit process. Feedback from the annual 
assessment was shared with the external auditor so that any areas for 
improvement could be followed up. The Committee concluded that the 
external audit process was effective overall. 
Following the assessment of the independence of the external auditor 
and the effectiveness of the external audit process, the Committee 
recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP be reappointed as  
the Group’s auditor. A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP will  
therefore be put to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming  
Annual General Meeting.
Significant issues 
The external audit process identifies significant issues and accounting 
judgments which are reviewed by the Audit Committee. These are 
summarised in the table below. Management prepared papers and 
analysis on the significant issues and judgments which were discussed 
in Committee meetings during the year. The Committee also discussed 
these issues with the external auditor at the half year and year end. All 
the significant issues were also areas of focus for the external auditor  
as detailed in the auditor’s report on pages 150 to 152.
 Directors’ and corporate governance report

Significant issues  
and judgments
How the Audit Committee addressed these issues
Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets
Management exercises a significant amount of judgment during the 
impairment testing process as it is based on an estimation of future 
cash flows and a suitable discount rate.
The Committee has considered the inputs for the impairment test model. 
The cash flow forecasts have been reviewed alongside past 
performance and expected operational changes to the business.  
The discount rate has been benchmarked to externally available data. 
The growth rate assumptions have been applied in line with both market 
data and the macro-economic environment in the UK and North 
America. Sensitivities to the model inputs have been tested for 
reasonableness.
Legal provisions
Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the 
likelihood and valuation of the expense required to settle the relevant 
obligation and, where applicable, the discount rate used to calculate  
expected settlement.
The Committee has considered the assumptions used for estimating the 
valuation of provisions. The legal issues are regularly reviewed with the 
related provisions being based on advice from external legal counsel.
Self-insurance provisions
Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the likely 
settlement of all known incidents. A valuation of the expense required 
to settle the obligation and, where applicable, the discount rate is used 
to calculate the expected settlement.
The Committee has reviewed the provision and considered the 
assumptions used to calculate the liability. Independent actuarial expert 
advice on the adequacy of the provisions against such liabilities is sought 
on a regular basis and the discount rate has been benchmarked against 
external data.
Pensions 
The Group participates in a number of defined benefit pension 
schemes. Management exercises significant judgment when 
determining the assumptions used to value the pension liabilities as 
these are materially sensitive to changes in the underlying 
assumptions.
Management has engaged with external experts and the Committee has 
considered the assumptions used for calculating the liability. Sensitivity 
analysis has been performed on the key assumptions which are the 
discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, the inflation rate and 
mortality rates, and the overall liability has been assessed for 
reasonableness.
Revenue recognition 
Management must exercise judgment when determining the 
recoverability of amounts due and the carrying value of related assets 
and liabilities arising from franchises and long term service contracts.
The Committee has reviewed the revenue recognition policies. These 
policies and their application are in line with accounting standards. 
Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcome of these types of 
franchises and contracts to assess the reasonableness of the 
assumptions applied. 65

Fair, balanced and understandable
New reporting requirements introduced by the Code require the Board 
to state that the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance. The Audit Committee was requested to 
assist the Board in analysis in order to confirm this statement. As part 
of its review, the Audit Committee took into account the preparation 
process for the Company’s Annual Report.

Themes are identified surrounding strategic and business objectives 
which set the context for the whole of the Annual Report
■ ■
Different sections of the Annual Report are drafted and reviewed  
by appropriate senior management who have visibility of the 
Company’s objectives and performance
■ ■
A thorough review process is undertaken to ensure that the 
information presented is supported and factually correct
■ ■
Reviews of the drafts of the annual report are carried out by the 
Executive Directors and other members of senior management
■ ■
Advice is received by the Audit Committee on the content of  
the Annual Report from external advisors, in particular the  
external auditor
■ ■
A final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee before 
recommendation to the Board for approval.
Audit Committee evaluation 
The performance of the Audit Committee was externally assessed 
during the year as part of the Board and Committee evaluation 
process. Positive areas were highlighted such as the appointment  
of the new Chairman to the Committee who was considered to have 
the requisite skills and expertise to steer the Committee through its 
demanding remit. Some areas for review were also identified which  
will be addressed during the forthcoming year.
Board Safety Committee 
The Board Safety Committee was set up in 2013/14 to provide 
greater oversight and governance of safety throughout the Group. 
The Committee challenges the Group continuously to review its 
operational safety performance and culture. As a consequence, we 
have reviewed how we look at serious incidents and a plan is in 
place to enhance the engagement of employees and leadership in 
injury prevention. An assessment of the safety culture throughout 
the Group will take place in 2014/15 with the aim to develop and 
implement interventions to reinforce safety as a personal core value 
for employees.

Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders
We are keen to promote open and transparent communications with 
our shareholders and potential investors. We recognise that regular 
dialogue is particularly important during challenging times. 
Investors are kept informed on an ongoing basis of key business 
activities, decisions, appointments and key announcements via the 
regulatory news service and press releases. The Company’s website 
www.firstgroupplc.com contains this information together with financial 
reports, presentations and other information on the Group’s operations. 
There is also regular dialogue with institutional shareholders throughout 
the year and general presentations are made by the Chief Executive 
and Group Finance Director following the announcement of the half 
and full year results. Other Directors, including Non-Executive Directors, 
attend meetings with major shareholders as requested. An investor  
day was held in January 2014 at which the divisional management 
presented to investors and financial analysts. Specific consultations 
have been carried out with leading shareholders during the year on the 
appointment of a new Chairman and the Remuneration Policy. 
On his appointment as Chairman, John McFarlane met with our major 
institutional investors. Discussions were held on a wide range of topics 
such as:
■ ■
Delivery of the business plans
■ ■
Dividend policy
■ ■
Progress within First Student
■ ■
Board composition
■ ■
Balance sheet and leverage.
Regular reports on investor relations activity and feedback from 
investors are submitted to the Board and senior management.
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on Wednesday 16 July 2014 
at The Marcliffe Hotel, North Deeside Road, Pitfodels, Aberdeen AB1 5 9Y A. 
The AGM gives shareholders the opportunity to put questions to the 
Company’s Directors. A business presentation is also given at the 
AGM. Voting is carried out by poll at the AGM which the Company 
believes is the fairest way to represent the views of all shareholders.  
The final voting results are announced via a regulatory news service 
and are posted to the Company’s website as soon as practicable  
after the meeting. The Notice of AGM, setting out the business to be 
considered, is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before  
the meeting and is also available on the Company’s website. 
Additional Information
A number of the reporting requirements under section 415 of the 
Companies Act 2006 are included in this report by cross reference  
to the strategic report on pages 32 to 35, such disclosures being:
■ ■
Information on environmental matters (including greenhouse gas 
emissions)
■ ■
the Company’s employees (including a breakdown of Group-wide 
diversity data)
■ ■
Social, community and human rights issues.
The Company did not make any political donations during the year. 
The Company also publishes a separate Corporate Responsibility 
Report, available on the Company’s website at www.firstgroupplc.com 
covering social, environmental and health and safety issues.
Employee involvement
We take an informed and consultative approach to employee 
communication across our business. As well as more traditional forms 
of communication, employees can also access online facilities and our 
redesigned internal employee portal was launched in May 2014.  
In addition management teams work to ensure that communication  
is cascaded face to face throughout their business areas.  
Employees are encouraged to discuss any issues with management  
at any time and events, such as an executive roadshow series in 
Greyhound, have been arranged at regular intervals to allow employees 
the chance to feed back to senior management.
A significant proportion of our workforce belongs to trade unions,  
with our employees represented by approximately 30 different unions. 
The majority of our employees in North America, approximately 7 4%  
of our UK Bus employees, and a significant proportion of our UK Rail 
employees are represented by unions.
We have a regular dialogue with employees and representatives from 
trade unions. Each division has its own information and consultation 
arrangements and levels of employee involvement in the business differ. 
In the UK, we have worked with trade unions on a number of key 
workplace matters and initiatives.  67

As well as gathering feedback throughout the year through formal and 
informal channels, all employees are also given the opportunity to make 
their voice heard through our regular employee surveys. These surveys 
at Group, divisional and local level provide a useful insight into what our 
people think about the Company. The priorities identified by our own 
people help to shape our future employee strategy. 
Policies concerning disabled employees
Full and fair consideration is given to applications for employment  
by disabled persons. We are committed to supporting disabled 
employees including employees who become disabled persons during 
their employment with regards to training, career development and 
promotion.
Results and dividends
The results for the year are set out in the consolidated income 
statement on page 94. The Directors are not recommending payment 
of a final dividend this year.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by a special 
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Share capital
Details of the Company’s issued share capital, are set out in note 28  
to the financial statements. The Company has one class of ordinary 
shares which carry no right to fixed income. During the year the share 
capital was increased by 722,859,586 new ordinary shares as a result 
of the rights issue announced on 20 May 2013. As at 21 May 2014, 
there were 1,204,926,756 ordinary shares of 5 pence each in issue 
including 159,531 ordinary shares of 5 pence each held in treasury.  
The ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and  
are governed by the Company’s Articles of Association and UK law.
Ordinary shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at any general 
meeting of the Company. Those who are present at a general meeting 
and duly appointed proxies or duly authorised corporate 
representatives, shall have one vote each on a show of hands and on a 
poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy will have one vote 
for every share held. The Notice of the 2014 Annual General Meeting 
accompanying this document specifies the deadlines for exercising 
voting rights. All proxy votes are counted and the number for, against 
and withheld in relation to each resolution are announced at the 
meeting and published on the Company’s website after the meeting.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the 
transfer of shares which are both governed by the general provisions of 
the Company’s Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The 
Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the 
Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights at any meeting of the Company.
The Company operates a number of employee share schemes details 
of which are set out in note 34 to the financial statements. Kleinwort 
Benson (Guernsey) Trustees Limited, as trustee of the FirstGroup plc 
Employee Benefit Trust, holds shares in the Company in trust in order 
to satisfy awards made to participants in the Company’s LTIP , ESOS 
and EABP and abstains from voting. Under the rules of the FirstGroup 
plc Share Incentive Plan (BAYE), employees buy shares and receive 
free matching shares in the Company. In order to preserve certain tax 
benefits these shares are held in a trust by Yorkshire Building Society 
for employees. Whilst these shares are held in trust, the voting rights 
attached to them are exercised by the trustee but only at the direction 
of the employees. The trustee does not vote on the shares if no 
direction is given to it.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share 
capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
Authority for the Company to purchase its own shares
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company in 2013 authority was 
granted for the Company to purchase up to 10% of its ordinary shares. 
During the year no ordinary shares were purchased. Under the existing 
authority the Company may purchase up to 48,000,000 ordinary 
shares. This authority remains in place until the AGM on 16 July 2014 
when it is intended to seek a renewal.
Directors
The Directors of the Company who served during the year and their 
biographical details are shown on pages 50 and 51. Martin Gilbert also 
served on the Board and retired as a Director on 31 December 2013. 
Having been appointed by the Board on 5 December 2013, the 
Company’s Articles of Association require John McFarlane to seek 
election at the Annual General Meeting on 16 July 2014. As detailed on 
pages 52 and 53 David Begg, Colin Hood and John Sievwright will 
retire from the Board and three new Non-Executive Directors, Warwick 
Brady, Drummond Hall and Imelda Walsh will be appointed as 
Non-Executive Directors with effect from 24 June 2014. The 
Company’s Articles of Association require the new Directors to seek 
election at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
In accordance with the Code all other serving Directors will put 
themselves forward for re-election at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. 
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the 
Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Code, the

not required to be exercised by the shareholders of the Company by 
voting in general meeting.
Senior executives of FirstGroup America and its operating units have 
executive service agreements that provide, in part, some compensation 
for any termination other than a termination for cause. Severance 
payments range from one to two years in duration. This is customary 
practice in the US market. 68

Change of control – significant agreements
(a) Financing agreements
The Group has a £800m multi-currency revolving credit and guarantee 
facility between, amongst others, the Company and The Royal Bank of 
Scotland plc dated 15 May 2014. This refinanced the Group’s existing 
revolving credit and guarantee facility. Following any change of control 
of the Company, individual lenders may negotiate with the Company 
with a view to resolving any concerns arising from such change of 
control. If the matter has not been resolved within 30 days an individual 
bank may cancel its commitment and the Company must repay the 
relevant proportion of any drawdown.
The US$150m 4.26% notes due in three instalments of US$50m from 
2016 to 2017 , the £250m 6. 125% bonds due 2019, the £300m 8. 125% 
bonds due 2018, the £350m 8.750% bonds due 2021, the £200m 
6.875% bonds due 2024 and the £325m 5.250% bonds due 2022 
issued by the Company may also be affected by a change of control  
of the Company. A change of control in respect of the £250m 6. 125% 
bonds due 2019 may result in an increase of 1.5% per annum in the 
interest rate payable on those bonds. However, the interest rate on the 
bonds will only be so increased if certain further thresholds in relation  
to the credit rating of the bonds are also met. In respect of the £300m 
8. 125% bonds due 2018, the £350m 8.750% bonds due 2021, the 
£200m 6.875% bonds due 2024 and the £325m 5.250% bonds due 
2022, upon a change of control of the Company, provided that certain 
further thresholds in relation to the credit rating of the bonds are met, 
the bondholders have the option to require the Company to redeem the 
bonds. In respect of the US$150m 4.26% notes due from 2016 to 2017 , 
upon a change of control, the Company must make an offer to 
noteholders to prepay the entire unpaid principal amount of the notes 
held by each bondholder (at par) together with interest accrued thereon 
but without any ‘yield maintenance’ amount.
(b) UK Rail
The Group’s franchised passenger rail operators, First Capital Connect, 
First ScotRail, First TransPennine Express and First Great Western, are 
each party to a franchise agreement with the Scottish Ministers (in 
respect of First ScotRail) and with the Secretary of State for Transport 
(in respect of the other operators). These franchise agreements are 
subject to termination clauses which may apply on a change of control. 
These operators and the Group’s non-franchised rail operator, First Hull 
Trains, each hold railway licences as required by the Railways Act 1993 
(as amended); these licences may be revoked on three months’ notice 
if a change of control occurs without the approval of the Office of Rail 
Regulation. All of these operators also require and hold track access 
agreements with Network Rail Infrastructure Limited under which they 
are permitted to access railway infrastructure. Failure by any of the 
operators to maintain its railway licence is a potential termination event 
under the terms of the track access agreements. The Group’s railway 
operators also lease rolling stock from specialist rolling stock leasing 
companies such as Eversholt Rail Group, Porterbrook Leasing 
Company Limited and Angel Trains Limited. A material number of the 
individual leasing agreements include change of control provisions. The 
Group is also involved from time to time in bidding processes for UK 
Rail franchises and transport contracts further afield which customarily 
include change in circumstance provisions which would be triggered 
on a change of control and could result in termination or rejection from 
further participation in the relevant competitions. 69

(c) Joint venture agreements
The Company has joint venture agreements with Keolis (UK) Limited in 
relation to First TransPennine Express and with DSB in relation to DSB/
First Aps and DSB Sverige AB. As is customary, these joint venture 
agreements include provisions addressing change of control.
Financial risk management
The Company’s policies on financial risk management, including the 
Company’s exposure to liquidity risk, credit risk and certain market 
based risks including foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel 
prices, can be found in note 24 to the financial statements. 
Audit information 
In the case of each of the persons who are Directors of the Company at 
the date when this report was approved: so far as each of the Directors 
is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware; and each of the Directors has taken all the steps 
that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information (as defined) and to establish  
that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with 
section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP has indicated its willingness to continue in office and a 
resolution seeking to reappoint it will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
Going concern 
The Directors have acknowledged the guidance on going concern  
and financial reporting published by the Financial Reporting Council  
in October 2009.
Whilst the Group is affected by macro-economic developments,  
it has a strong balanced portfolio of businesses with approximately  
half of Group revenues secured under medium term contracts with 
government agencies and other large organisations in the UK and 
North America.
While any changes in economic activity will impact UK Bus and Rail 
passenger numbers this potential risk is reduced in UK Bus by the 
ability of the Group to modify services giving 56 days’ notice (70 days  
in Scotland) of such modifications. In North America, the First Student 
and First Transit businesses are highly contracted and, whilst 
Greyhound is more susceptible to the economy, its costs are  
largely variable.
The Group has a diversified funding structure which is largely 
represented by medium term unsecured committed bank facilities and 
long term unsecured bond debt. The Group has a £800m committed 
revolving banking facility dated 15 May 2014 which refinanced  
the Group’s existing revolving credit and guarantee facility.  
This facility expires on 28 December 2019.
The Group’s management of exposure to financial risk, including 
liquidity, currency, interest rate and commodity risks, is disclosed in 
note 24 to the financial statements.
The Directors have carried out a detailed review of the Group’s 2014/15 
budget and medium term plans, with due regard to the risks and 
uncertainties to which the Group is exposed (of which the principal 
items are set out on pages 36 to 41), the uncertain economic climate 
and the impact that this could have on trading performance.
Based on this review, the Directors believe that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis.
Forward-looking statements
Where the Directors’ report contains forward-looking statements these 
are made by the Directors in good faith based upon the information 
available at the time of their approval of this report. 
These statements will not be updated or reported upon further. 
Consequently, such statements should be treated with caution due to 
the inherent uncertainties, including both economic and business risk 
factors, underlying such forward-looking statements or information and 
nothing in this report should be construed as a profit forecast. 
Post balance sheet events
There have been no material post balance sheet events as at the date

 Directors’ remuneration report
Dear Shareholder
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to introduce the 
Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2014.
In line with the new remuneration reporting requirements introduced by the 
Department for Business, Innovation & Skills, the report has been split into  
two parts:
■ ■
Remuneration Policy report. This sets out Remuneration Policy for the 
Directors for the next three years. The Policy report is subject to a binding 
vote of the Company shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 July 
2014. If approved by shareholders the policy as outlined in the Policy report 
will come into effect on the day following the Annual General Meeting. If there 
is any change to Remuneration Policy, the new policy will be re-submitted to 
shareholders for approval
■ ■
The Directors’ annual report on remuneration sets out how the 
Remuneration Policy has been implemented during the year. This  
is subject to an annual advisory vote of shareholders.
Context for decisions on remuneration
We have made good progress during the year in most areas of our operations 
although results have been hit by extreme weather conditions, particularly in North 
America. We have nevertheless increased adjusted operating profit in the year by 
5.5% to £268m. The Group has entered into a multi-year transformation 
programme which sets out a detailed series of financial targets, the aim of which  
is to deliver improved earnings growth and value creation on a sustainable basis. 
The programme will require consistent focus by the Executive Directors and 
management team in order to deliver the Group’s strategic objectives and the 
performance targets we have set and it is against this background that the 
Remuneration Committee has formulated its Remuneration Policy.
Key areas of focus for the Committee during the year
A thorough review of remuneration policy has been undertaken by the 
Remuneration Committee during the year in preparation for the creation of  
the Remuneration Policy report. This included, in particular, a review of the 
operation of the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Executive Annual 
Bonus Plan (EABP) and the relevant performance targets.
After consideration of various options for the LTIP , including a possible Return  
on Capital Employed (ROCE) target as an alternative to the TSR and/or EPS 
measures used in previous years, and following consultation with a number of 
the Company’s largest institutional shareholders, it was agreed that TSR and 
EPS targets would be retained. However, for the awards made in the year, even  
if the EPS and TSR metrics are met, if the underlying performance of the Group 
(for example in relation to ROCE) during the performance period does not justify 
vesting, the Committee retained discretion to adjust vesting of the awards. In 
these circumstances, awards would only vest to the extent considered 
appropriate by the Committee taking into account that underlying performance. 
That discretion has been retained for the awards to be made in the coming year.
The comparator group for the TSR element of LTIP awards made during the 
year was also changed. The previous comparator group was composed of the 
Travel and Leisure sector and it was felt that as it included only three companies 
that were closely comparable to FirstGroup, a more meaningful comparator 
group would be the FTSE 250 (excluding financial services and extraction 
companies). Again, this change was made after consulting the Company’s 
largest institutional shareholders. The Committee considers that this comparator 
group remains appropriate for the awards to be made in the coming year.
The Committee also decided that both LTIP and EABP awards should, going 
forward, include malus provisions which allow for reduction or forfeiture of 
unvested awards in the event of misconduct or a material misstatement in the 
Group’s accounts.
Other than as outlined above, no major changes were made to the Company’s 
remuneration policy from prior years.
Our philosophy on remuneration
With the challenges ahead, it is as important as ever to ensure that we have in 
place the highest quality management motivated to deliver outstanding 
performance. However, we strongly support the view that failure to deliver 
should not be rewarded. Remuneration practice has been restrained over the 
most recent difficult trading years with no pay increases for Executive Directors 
in 2013/14. There will again be no pay increases for Executive Directors in the 
coming year. The maximum opportunity under the LTIP for Executive Directors 
was reduced from 150% to 120% of basic salary for the two financial years 
ended 31 March 2014 and the maximum LTIP opportunity will again be kept at 
120% for the coming year.
In setting the Company’s Remuneration Policy, we have sought to provide a 
strong and demonstrable link between incentives and the Company’s strategic 
objectives and medium term financial targets (more details of which are set out 
in the Chief Executive’s strategic review on page 6 and on pages 10 and 1 1 of 
the strategic report) and to set a performance-biased framework for 
remuneration which is consistent with the Group’s scale and unique 
circumstances and which enables Executive Directors and senior managers to 
share in the long term success of the Group without delivering excessive 
benefits or encouraging short term measures or excessive risk taking. 
Our EABP contains annual profit and cash generation targets which provide an 
incentive for management to focus on the strategic objectives which year-on-year 
should lead to achievement of our medium term financial targets. This is reinforced 
by the targets chosen for our LTIP (as outlined above) which will maintain that focus 
over the longer term. The reservation of discretion to reflect underlying 
performance notwithstanding achievement of EPS and TSR targets described 
above provides a mechanism for ensuring that management are also focused on 
other key issues such as ROCE.
Our core values of safety and customer service, both of which also have a key 
part to play in achieving our strategic objectives, are also reflected by specific 
targets in our EABP .
Shareholder engagement
The Committee has actively engaged with certain major shareholders on 
remuneration issues including consulting on LTIP performance measures and 
the Remuneration Policy during the year.

 Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Introduction
This section of the report sets out the details of the Remuneration 
Policy for Executive and Non-Executive Directors of the Company and 
will be proposed for approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company to be held on 16 July 2014. Our policy which, 
except as set out above, is largely unchanged from that applied in 
recent financial years, will take effect from the day following the Annual 
General Meeting, subject to it being approved by shareholders at that 
meeting. Unless it is changed before then, it will operate for the period 
up until the Company’s Annual General Meeting to be held in 2017 .
This report is compliant with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
and Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended)  
(the ‘Regulations’).
In this section, we describe FirstGroup’s Remuneration Policy for 
Executive Directors (Table 1) and Non-Executive Directors (Table 4).  
We set out both the overall structure and the details of the Policy.  
We also explain how the Policy aligns to business strategy and the 
interests of shareholders. In setting the Policy, the Remuneration 
Committee has sought to balance the need to provide a high level  
of clarity for shareholders whilst allowing the Committee sufficient 
freedom, within appropriate limits, to respond to future events.  
The information set out in this section is not subject to audit. 
Further details on how the policy will be implemented in the financial 
year ending 31 March 2015 including incentive performance measures 
are set out on pages 90 to 92.
Table 1: Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors
Basic salary
Purpose and how it supports the Group’s 
strategic objectives
Salary is the core reward for the role and enables the Group to recruit and retain individuals of 
the calibre required to deliver its strategic objectives and lead its management team. It reflects 
the individual’s skills, expertise, experience and role within the Group.
Operation Salary is paid monthly in cash.
Salary levels take into account: 
■ ■
the outside market for executives with comparable seniority, experience and responsibilities 
employed by the Group’s peers in the passenger transport sector and in other companies  
of comparable scale, complexity and geographic spread 
■ ■
market data, which is used by the Committee to inform rather than drive its decisions 
■ ■
relative differences in the size, responsibility and complexity of the roles performed by each  
of the Group’s Executive Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee will review salaries for the Executive Directors annually with 
changes normally taking effect from 1 April each year. The Committee may also review  
salaries on an ad hoc basis if an individual is promoted and/or there is an increase in  
their responsibilities.
Maximum Opportunity Details of the salaries for each of the Executive Directors to be paid from 1 April 2014 are 
shown on page 90.
The Committee will make no increase which it believes is inconsistent with the three 
parameters above. Increases will take into account and will generally not exceed the general 
level of pay awards around the Group, in particular with reference to employees who are not 
within collective bargaining arrangements. However, higher increases may be provided at the 
Committee’s discretion where an individual is promoted and/or if there is an increase in their 
responsibilities. 
Link to Performance Increases are subject to affordability and satisfactory performance.  72
FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Annual performance related bonus 
Purpose and how it supports the Group’s 
strategic objectives
The Executive Annual Bonus Plan (EABP) exists to incentivise and reward annual financial 
performance and performance against key financial and other objectives that underpin the 
future value of the Group. It focuses the executives on the key priorities for the coming year. 
The EABP also aligns pay costs to affordability and the value delivered to shareholders. The 
compulsory deferral of a proportion of bonus into shares aligns the individuals’ incentives to 
longer term value creation and shareholder interests.
Operation Bonus payments are made annually following the year end and are not pensionable.
Bonus payments are based on the achievement of specified financial and non-financial targets 
over a one year period.
Any annual bonus award will be made at least 50% in the form of deferred shares although the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to require a higher level of deferral. The balance  
is paid in cash. The deferral period is normally three years.
Maximum Opportunity The maximum potential bonus is 120% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for 
other Executive Directors although, under the rules of the EABP , the Committee has discretion 
to make higher awards in exceptional circumstances. The Committee would not normally  
expect to exercise that discretion without consulting with the Company’s major shareholders  
in advance.
Link to Performance Bonus payments are linked to a range of relevant financial and non-financial objectives 
including targets related to safety and customer service and to performance against certain 
personal objectives. These objectives may also relate to the specific responsibilities of each 
individual Executive Director. Where an Executive Director is also responsible for one or more 
operating divisions, payment of a proportion of the bonus may be linked to the performance  
of those divisions.
The objectives are set by the Committee at the beginning of each financial year with payout 
determined after year end following the Committee’s assessment of the extent to which the 
objectives have been met.
Each bonus element has a threshold level of performance below which no bonus is payable. 
Payment of maximum bonus requires the achievement of very stretching levels of 
performance. Bonus in respect of non-financial performance may be subject to a financial 
performance threshold.
The Committee has discretion to reduce unvested deferred awards at any time during the 
three year vesting period in the event of misconduct or a material adverse misstatement in the 
Group’s accounts. 
The rules of the EABP also give the Committee discretion to vary the terms of unvested 
deferred share awards in certain circumstances – further details are provided in Table 3 on 
page 78.
Details of performance targets and performance achieved will be disclosed on a retrospective 
basis in the Directors’ annual report on remuneration to the extent that the information is not 
considered commercially sensitive.
Details of the bonus parameters for the financial year ending 31 March 2015 are set out on 
pages 90 and 91.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Purpose and how it supports the Group’s 
strategic objectives
The LTIP exists to align the rewards paid to Executive Directors to shareholder interests. It 
achieves this by linking remuneration to the longer term financial success of the Group in terms 
of explicit vesting targets and to the Group’s share price. 
Operation The LTIP provides a conditional award of shares or options to acquire shares, the vesting of 
which depends on Group performance against certain targets and continued employment 
(subject to “good leaver” provisions as described on page 78) over a three year period, or such 
longer period as is determined by the Committee. Awards are made annually.
Awards may be paid in cash or shares and may also include the right to accrue dividend 
equivalent payments during the vesting period.
Maximum Opportunity The maximum annual award is generally 150% of basic salary although the plan rules permit 
the award of up to 200% of basic salary in exceptional circumstances.
Link to Performance Performance measures for the LTIP will be a combination of financial and/or shareholder 
return/share price-based measures, measured over at least three years. 
For achievement of threshold performance (i.e. the minimum level at which any part of an 
award vests) no more than 25% of the award may vest. For measures based on relative 
performance against a peer group or index, the performance threshold will be at least equal  
to the median of the peer group or the performance of the index.
The Committee has discretion to vary the proportion of awards vesting if it considers the 
outcome would otherwise not be a fair and complete reflection of the underlying performance 
of the Group over the plan cycle. The Committee is aware that investors have particular 
concerns about the use of upwards discretion in LTIPs. It would only expect to exercise this 
discretion within the stated maximum opportunity and then only in exceptional circumstances. 
In these circumstances it would normally consult with shareholders in advance and would 
reflect the broad consensus of shareholder views in exercising it. 
The Committee also has discretion to reduce unvested awards in the event of misconduct  
or a material adverse misstatement in the Group’s Accounts. 
The rules of the LTIP also give the Committee discretion to vary the terms of unvested awards 
in certain circumstances – further details are provided in Table 3 on page 78.
Details of the performance conditions for LTIP awards to be made in the financial year ending 
31 March 2015 are set out on page 91.
The Committee may set different performance targets for future awards if it considers it 
appropriate based on relevant market conditions. Details of such performance targets will be 
disclosed on a retrospective basis in the Directors’ annual report on remuneration provided 
that the Committee determines that the information is not commercially sensitive.

Pension or cash allowance
Purpose and how it supports the Group’s 
strategic objectives
Pension provision allows executives to build long term savings for their retirement and is a 
competitive requirement for recruiting and retaining executive talent with the necessary skills 
and experience. 
Operation and Maximum Opportunity The Group operates various pension arrangements including both defined benefit and defined 
contribution arrangements. Eligibility for these arrangements depends on country location, 
employing division and date of joining the Group. 
The current UK defined benefit scheme includes a scheme earnings cap and Executive 
Directors who participate in these arrangements receive a cash allowance of 20% of basic 
salary in excess of that cap.
The defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants so Executive Directors who are not 
currently in this scheme either participate in a defined contribution scheme or receive a cash 
allowance on a basis that is in line with the contribution made to the defined contribution 
pension. For UK-based Executive Directors, the maximum cash pension allowance is 20% of 
basic salary or, where applicable, 20% of basic salary in excess of any scheme earnings cap. 
Contributions are made on a monthly basis.
In the event of further changes to the pension tax regime adversely affecting individuals’ 
pension benefits and/or to the Group’s pension arrangements, the Committee may amend  
the pension benefits available but only on a basis which would not cost the Company  
materially more than that Executive Director’s current arrangements in terms of percentage  
of basic salary.
Link to Performance N/A
Benefits in kind
Purpose and how they support the Group’s 
strategic objectives
Benefits in kind are provided where these are a competitive necessity, are a practical benefit  
to the business and/or are offered to other Group employees. 
Operation and Maximum Opportunity Benefits may include those currently provided and disclosed in the Directors’ annual report  
on remuneration. Core benefits for Executive Directors include a car benefit, private medical 
insurance for themselves, their spouse or partner and any dependants and death in service 
and long term sickness benefits. They may also receive reimbursement for professional body 
membership subscriptions. Executive Directors who are overseas citizens may also receive an 
allowance to cover tax advisory fees. 
Executive Directors may be eligible to receive any other benefits made available to the Group’s 
employees more generally, including discounted travel on the Group’s services. They may also 
become eligible for any new benefits introduced for a wider set of other Group employees. 
If, in the opinion of the Committee, it were to be necessary for one of the Executive Directors  
to relocate then relocation and/or expatriate benefits might be paid, including housing, travel, 
taxation advice, moving costs and (in the case of an international relocation) education for 
family members. The Committee would also consider the equalisation of tax payments,  
if appropriate. An Executive Director based outside the UK would be eligible to participate  
in insurance and other benefit arrangements in line with local practice.
The Group actively monitors, reviews and seeks to control the cost of benefits provided. 
However costs will vary from year to year in accordance with insurance premia and other 
factors outside the Group’s direct control.

All-employee share plans
Purpose and how they support the Group’s 
strategic objectives
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in HMRC approved all-employee schemes which 
encourage share ownership.
Operation and Maximum Opportunity Executive Directors may participate in these plans in line with HMRC guidelines currently 
prevailing (where relevant), on the same basis as other eligible employees.
Link to Performance Participation levels operate in accordance with HMRC limits as amended from time to time. 
Share ownership
Purpose and how it supports the Group’s 
strategic objectives
Requiring Executive Directors to hold shares helps to align their financial interests with those  
of shareholders.
Operation The Company has guidelines which require an Executive Director over a period of up to five 
years to build a holding of shares in the Company representing a market value (calculated by 
reference to purchase price) equal to 100% of basic salary.
These guidelines further require Executive Directors to retain at least 50% of the shares, net  
of tax, vesting under an LTIP or any other executive share award or plan or otherwise acquire 
shares in the Company until the guideline shareholding is achieved. The Remuneration 
Committee reserves the right to relax or waive the application of the guidelines where it 
believes it is justified by the circumstances.
Link to Performance The value of shares held by Executive Directors will fluctuate in line with the Group’s share 
price, creating alignment to shareholder interests.
 Directors’ Remuneration Policy
continued
Changes to policy since the last remuneration report
The main changes in the Remuneration Policy since the Directors’ 
remuneration report in the 2013 Annual Report are that a malus 
provision was added to the EABP and the LTIP comparator group was 
changed from the FTSE All Travel and Leisure Index to the FTSE 250 
(excluding financial services and extraction companies).
Choosing performance metrics and targets
As outlined in the strategic report, the Group is going through a 
multi-year transformation programme to ensure that it delivers 
sustainable long term growth and value creation over the plan period. 
In setting the Company’s Remuneration Policy, we have sought to 
provide a strong and demonstrable link between management 
incentives and the Company’s strategic objectives and medium term 
financial targets (more details of which are set out in the Chief 
Executive’s strategic review on page 6 and on pages 10 and 1 1 of the 
strategic report). We have also sought to set a performance-biased 
framework for remuneration which is consistent with the Group’s scale 
and unique circumstances and which enables Executive Directors and 
senior managers to share in the long term success of the Group 
without delivering excessive benefits or encouraging short term 
measures or excessive risk taking and aligns their interests with those 
of our shareholders.
The choice of performance measures for the L TIP and EABP are therefore 
based on a mixture of financial and operational targets with a clear 
alignment to those strategic objectives and medium term financial targets 
and also to our core values of safety and customer service whilst providing 
(through the L TIP) an incentive to deliver superior shareholder returns and 
EPS growth. Further details are set out in the letter from the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee on page 70 and details of the specific 
metrics chosen for each of the EABP and L TIP for the coming year are set 
out on page 91 . 
Differences in Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors 
compared to other employees
The Group aims to provide competitive remuneration packages across 
the whole employee population and where remuneration is not subject 
to collective bargaining arrangements, the Group operates to similar 
principles to those which apply to Executive Directors. In particular, 
remuneration reflects the performance of the Group and the 
contribution made by the individual. Any differences that exist arise 
either because of local market practice and/or the Committee’s 
assessment of business need and commercial necessity.
Participation in the EABP and LTIP is open to other senior managers  
at the discretion of the Board. However, the proportion of pay that  
is performance-related is higher for Executive Directors and  
divisional leaders.
Remuneration Policy on recruitment
On appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee would seek  
to align the remuneration package for the relevant individual with the 
Company’s Remuneration Policy and would take into account the 
package as a whole. It would not pay more than necessary to secure 
the right candidate and the package would take into account the 
experience and calibre of the individual concerned.  76
FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Where a newly appointed Executive Director is required to relocate,  
the Group may pay the costs of relocation including housing, travel, 
taxation advice, shipping costs and education for family members.  
The Committee would also consider the equalisation of tax payments, 
to allow flexibility in employing overseas nationals. Any Executive 
Director based outside the UK will be eligible to participate in pension  
or pension allowance, insurance and other benefit programmes in line 
with local practice. 
Any Executive Director promoted internally may remain eligible for 
payments under incentive plans joined and/or contractual 
arrangements entered into before joining the Board. However the 
Committee will have regard to best practice in reviewing the treatment 
of any such entitlements.
In some circumstances it may be necessary to compensate Executive 
Directors for incentives lost from their previous employers. In these 
circumstances the level and timing of such compensation will normally 
seek to reflect or take account of the term and performance conditions 
of the payments or awards forgone on a “like for like” basis. 
Compensation will normally take the form of conditional awards of  
or options over Group shares but cash and/or time-vested payments 
may be made where the Committee believes these would offer better 
value-for-money for shareholders. The Committee is sensitive to 
investor concerns about such arrangements and will endeavour to take 
cost-effective approaches. 
Illustration of application of Remuneration Policy for 
Executive Directors
A significant proportion of Executive Directors’ potential remuneration is 
performance-related. This comprises annual bonuses under the EABP 
and long term incentives under the LTIP . 
The charts that follow illustrate the remuneration opportunity provided 
to each Executive Director at different levels of performance for the 
financial year ending 31 March 2015. The performance scenarios 
illustrated are below threshold, on-target and maximum performance, 
with remuneration split between fixed remuneration, the EABP and  
the LTIP.

■ ■
Basic salary is salary for the financial year ending 31 March 2015 
(Chief Executive: £845,625, Group Finance Director £450,000)
■ ■
The value of benefits for each Executive Director is assumed to be  
in line with that for the financial year ended 31 March 2014, as set 
out in the table on page 82
■ ■
The value of the Chief Executive’s pension benefit and allowance  
is assumed to be in line with that for the financial year ended

The value of the Group Finance Director’s pension allowance is 20% 
of his basic salary for the financial year ending 31 March 2015.
Target
Based on what the Director would receive if the target performance 
was achieved:
■ ■
Annual bonus pays out 50% of maximum (120% of basic salary for 
the Chief Executive, 100% of basic salary for the Group Finance 
Director)*
■ ■
Long term incentive pays out at 50% of maximum (120% of basic 
salary).

Service agreements and loss of office payments
The Directors’ service agreements and letters of appointment are kept  
for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office. A 
summary in respect of Executive Directors is set out in Table 2 below. 
Provisions for Non-Executive Directors are summarised in Table 4  
on page 80.
The general principle is that there should be no payment for failure. 
More specifically, there are no contractual entitlements to incentive 
payments that have not vested and these will, in normal circumstances, 
only vest for “good leavers” in a defined list of circumstance as set  
out below.
Table 2 – Service agreements for Executive Directors
Notice Period Not more than 12 months (rolling). 
Termination payments (salary and benefits) The contracts contain a provision, exercisable at the discretion of the Company, to pay an 
amount in lieu of notice on early termination of the contract. Such payments are limited to  
basic salary (plus, in certain cases, benefits) only and would be subject to mitigation.
Where the Executive Director participates in one or more of the Group’s all-employee share 
schemes, his awards may vest upon termination in accordance with applicable scheme rules. 
Additional expenses In the event that an Executive Director’s employment is terminated for any reason other than 
gross misconduct, reasonable outplacement and legal fees may be paid by the Group, at the 
discretion of the Committee. In the event that an Executive Director has been required to 
relocate, reasonable repatriation costs (including possible tax exposure costs) may be paid  
at the discretion of the Committee. 78
FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Table 3 – Summary of treatment of leavers and discretions available to the Committee under the EABP and LTIP rules
Treatment of leavers under the EABP Executive Directors who are under notice are not normally eligible for payments under the 
EABP . The rules of the EABP do give the Committee discretion to make an award in these 
circumstances but the Committee would only consider exercising such discretion if this were 
justified by the circumstances of the Executive Director’s departure. Any such payment would 
normally be in cash with no deferral, would reflect the period of time served from the start of 
the performance period to the date of termination and would be based on the level of 
performance achieved.
Any unvested deferred EABP awards will normally lapse on leaving the Group before the 
vesting date. However, awards may instead vest if the Executive Director leaves the Group  
as a result of ill-health, injury, disability, retirement, a transfer of employing company outside  
of the Group, redundancy or for any other “good leaver” reason the Committee deems 
appropriate. In these circumstances, awards are normally subject to a pro-rata reduction, 
although the plan rules give the Committee discretion to waive the pro-rating. Vesting  
will normally occur at the normal vesting date but may be accelerated at the discretion  
of the Committee.
In the event of death, deferred EABP awards vest immediately in full. 
Treatment of leavers under the LTIP Unless the Committee is satisfied that special circumstances exist, LTIP awards will not 
normally be granted to any Executive Director who has given or received notice of termination 
of employment.
Unvested LTIP awards will normally lapse on leaving the Group before the vesting date. 
However, awards may instead vest if the Executive Director leaves the Group as a result of 
ill-health, injury or permanent disability, retirement, a transfer of employing company outside  
of the Group, redundancy or for any other “good leaver” reason the Committee deems 
appropriate. In these circumstances, awards will be subject to a pro-rata reduction to reflect 
the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed. Vesting will normally be delayed 
until the applicable performance conditions have been assessed, but may instead occur 
immediately at the discretion of the Committee, having regard to performance achieved  
to the date of exit. 
In the event of death, LTIP awards will vest subject to a pro-rata reduction.
Discretions available to the Committee  
under the EABP and LTIP
Under the rules of the relevant plan, the Committee retains certain discretions with regard to 
the operation and administration of the EABP and LTIP including:
■ ■
the timing and size of awards, subject to policy maximums
■ ■
amending the plan rules in accordance with their terms
■ ■
adjustments required in certain circumstances (for example rights issues, corporate 
restructuring events and special dividends)
■ ■
decisions in relation to a change of control of the Group and other corporate events such as 
a demerger or other transaction which would affect the current or future value of any awards
■ ■
vesting of awards as a result of a transfer of an Executive Director to work in another country, 
where there would be a tax disadvantage in relation to awards or the ability to exercise those 
awards or to hold or deal in the shares
■ ■
in relation to the LTIP , to include the right to receive a dividend equivalent amount on any 
shares subject to awards and to satisfy awards in cash.

External appointments
Where Board approval is given for an Executive Director to accept an 
outside non-executive directorship, unless the appointment is in 
connection with Group business, the individual Director is entitled to 
retain any fees received. There are no limits on the number of external 
directorships an Executive Director could take on but in considering 
any request for approval, the Board would consider the extent to which 
the external role would affect that individual’s ability to perform his or 
her role at the Company (whether in terms of time commitments, 
conflicts of interest or otherwise).
Exceptions to the Remuneration Policy
Notwithstanding the restrictions laid out in this Policy, where the Group 
has made a commitment to a Director which:
■ ■
was in accordance with the then prevailing Remuneration Policy  
at the time that the commitment was made; and/or
■ ■
was made before the Director became a Director; and/or
■ ■
was made before the rules on binding votes on remuneration 
policies came into effect,
the Company will continue to give effect to it, even if it is inconsistent 
with the policy which is in effect at that time. For example, earlier 
remuneration policies of the Group may continue to apply in relation  
to LTIP awards, deferred EABP awards and awards under employee 
share plans that may be or have been granted under one 
Remuneration Policy and vest or be exercised under a later one. 
The Committee may also exercise any of the discretions available to  
it under any of the employee share schemes in which an Executive 
Director may participate which were adopted prior to the date of  
this Policy.
The Committee also reserves the right to make either minor or 
administrative amendments to this Policy to benefit its operation  
or to make more material changes in order to comply with new  
laws, regulations and/or regulatory guidance. The Committee  
would only exercise this right if it believed it was in the best interests 
of the Company to do so and where it is not possible, practicable  
or proportionate to seek or await shareholder approval in  
General Meeting.
Setting pay policy
Employee context
Mick Barker as Group Employee Director attends meetings at the 
invitation of the Chairman of the Committee to represent the Group’s 
employees. As such, the Committee believes it is well-informed on the 
attitudes and concerns of employees. The Committee takes into 
account the terms and conditions of Group employees when 
determining pay policy for Executive Directors and in determining their 
salary increases, recognising that many employees fall under collective 
labour agreements. The Committee also takes into account information 
provided by the HR function and external advisers.
Shareholder engagement
When reviewing the remuneration framework of Executive Directors, 
the Committee takes into account the views and guidance expressed 
by institutional shareholders and shareholder bodies.
The Company consulted with a number of its major shareholders on 
this Remuneration Policy. It also received feedback from the ABI. All the 
feedback it received has been taken into consideration when finalising 
this Policy.
 Directors’ Remuneration Policy

FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Table 4: Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
Basis of appointment The Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment. The appointment 
of each of the Non-Executive Directors is subject to early termination without compensation if 
he or she is not re-appointed at a meeting of shareholders where he or she is up for re-election. 
These letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Group’s registered office during 
normal business hours and will be made available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Notice periods under the letters of appointment are generally three months on either side. 
Payment of fees for any portion of that period may be made in lieu of notice.
Each Non-Executive Director is required to give sufficient time to meet the expectations of their 
role and is required to obtain the prior consent of the Chairman before taking on any additional 
commitment that might affect the time they are able to devote to their role. The Chairman must 
seek approval from the Senior Independent Director for any outside directorships which might 
give rise to a conflict of interest or duty or might impact on the time that he is able to devote to 
his role.
Fee structure The Chairman is paid an all-inclusive fixed fee for all Board responsibilities. Other  
Non-Executive Directors receive a basic fee for Board membership with supplementary fees 
payable for additional responsibilities including chairing Board Committees. Travel expenses 
and hotel costs (including any tax thereon) are also paid, where necessary. 
Other than the Group Employee Director, the Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any 
of the Group’s incentive arrangements or share schemes and are not eligible for pension or 
other benefits.
The Group Employee Director receives a normal remuneration package for his regular duties 
appropriate to his role. The Employee Director’s fee as a Director is payable in addition to his or 
her normal remuneration and any additional fee he or she may receive for acting as employee 
director of one of the Company’s subsidiaries.
Fee levels are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the Group can attract individuals with 
the requisite experience, capability and commitment. Reviews take into account the structure 
and level of fees payable by listed companies of similar scale, complexity and geographical 
spread and increases for the Group’s workforce. Fees may also be revised on an ongoing  
or temporary basis to take into account changes to the working of the Board.
Fees are payable in cash and/or shares at the discretion of the individual Director. 
Fee levels Annual fee levels for current incumbents for the financial year ending 31 March 2015 are  
as follows.
■ ■
Non-Executive Chairman: £250,000
■ ■
Non-Executive Director Base Fee: £52,500
■ ■
Group Employee Director: £39,375 
■ ■
Supplementary fee for Senior Independent Director (unless chair of a Committee): £7 ,500
■ ■
Supplementary fee for Chairing the Audit Committee: £12,000
■ ■
Supplementary fee for Chairing the Remuneration and Board Safety Committees: £10,000.
The level of fee for a newly appointed Chairman or Non-Executive Director would take into 
account fee levels at other companies along with the nature of time commitment required and 
the calibre and experience of the individual. 
The aggregate maximum fees for Non-Executive Directors are limited as set out in the Articles 
of Association.

The Board considers each of the members of the Committee to be 
independent in accordance with the Code. Mick Barker, as Group 
Employee Director, attends meetings at the invitation of the Chairman of 
the Committee to represent the Group’s employees. The Chairman of 
the Board, as well as the Chief Executive, also attend meetings of the 
Committee by invitation, but neither was present when matters relating 
to their own remuneration were discussed. 
Role of the Remuneration Committee
Key responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are to determine 
the Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors, Chairman and 
other members of senior executive management as follows:
■ ■
In line with the agreed policy, determine the total remuneration 
package of each Executive Director, including as appropriate, 
bonuses, share awards and pension arrangements
■ ■
Approve the design and targets for any performance related pay 
schemes, approve the total annual payments made under such 
schemes and review the design of all share incentive plans
■ ■
Oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures 
throughout the Group
■ ■
Determine the policy for Executive Directors’ service agreements 
and termination payments
■ ■
Agree the policy for authorising claims for expenses from  
the Directors.
In carrying out its duties the Remuneration Committee takes into 
account any legal requirements, the Code and UK Listing Rules. 
Determining the fees of the Non-Executive Directors is a matter for  
the Board as a whole.
The terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee were last 
reviewed and updated in March 2013 and are available on the 
Company’s website, www.firstgroupplc.com.

Deloitte LLP was engaged to provide advice to the Committee until the 
end of August 2013 with KPMG LLP engaged thereafter. KPMG LLP 
does not have any other connection with the Group and therefore the 
Committee was satisfied that it provided objective and independent 
advice. Deloitte LLP are the Company’s auditor but provided 
remuneration services in compliance with the Ethical Standards of the 
Auditing Practices Board which restrict the provision of certain services 
in order to maintain auditor independence. Advisory partners and staff 
have no involvement in audit and are not involved in the preparation of 
audited information. The Committee is satisfied that the safeguards in 
place ensure that the remuneration advice it received from Deloitte LLP 
was independent. KPMG LLP and Deloitte LLP are members of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and abide by the voluntary code of 
conduct of that body which is designed to ensure that objective and 
independent advice is given to remuneration committees.
The Committee also receives advice and guidance on senior executive 
remuneration from the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group 
HR Director and Group Reward and Pensions Director. The Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee, ensures that the 
Remuneration Committee fulfils its duties under its terms of reference 
and provides regular updates to the Remuneration Committee on 
relevant regulatory developments in the UK.
Remuneration Committee evaluation
The performance of the Remuneration Committee was externally

Executive Directors’ Pension
Tim O’Toole participates in a defined benefit pension scheme.  
His contributions to this scheme are paid via salary sacrifice with  
an equivalent contribution being paid directly to the pension scheme  
by the Company. This currently provides him with 
1
/50
th
 accrual for  
each year of service, based on average pensionable salary for the  
three tax years prior to retirement. He has chosen a normal retirement 
age of 60 and can receive his benefits unreduced at that time. There is  
a scheme earnings cap and he receives an allowance of 20% of basic 
salary in excess of that cap.
Each Executive Director employed after 1 April 201 1 receives a 
‘pension allowance’ equal to 20% of their basic salary.
The allowances paid during the year to Tim O’Toole and Chris Surch 
were £141,724 and £90,000 respectively.
Information in the table below includes the total accrued benefit at  
31 March 2014 which represents the annual pension that is expected 
to be payable on eventual retirement given the length of service and

Whilst details of actual targets set by the Remuneration Committee 
have not been disclosed as they are deemed to be commercially 
sensitive, given the close link between performance measures and the 
Company’s long term strategy, details of the applicable metrics are set 
out below for the Executive Annual Bonus Plan. 
Executive Annual Bonus Plan (EABP)
For the year under review, bonuses were payable for Group normalised 
profit performance between 95% and 107% against target. Below the 
relevant threshold, the bonus would have been nil. 70% of any bonus 
payable was dependent on Group financial performance against target 
and the 30% balance was payable upon the achievement of safety, 
customer service and personal objectives. The maximum potential 
bonus which can be awarded to Executive Directors is 100% of basic 
salary and 120% of basic salary in the case of the Chief Executive. 84

In 2013 the Remuneration Committee granted the following share awards to the Executive Directors under the LTIP:

Chris Surch 12.12.2013 120% 539,999 25% 100% 1.4.13 to 31.03.2016
Tim O’Toole was granted 871,329 shares structured as conditional awards for nil payment and Chris Surch was granted 463,678 shares 
structured as nil cost options. Face value was calculated using the average of the 5 days’ middle market closing prices of the Company’s  
shares prior to the date of the award. The awards are exercisable at the end of a three-year performance period subject to the satisfaction of 
performance conditions and continued employment. 50% of the award is subject to the growth in the Company’s earnings per share (EPS) and 
the remaining 50% of the award is subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR). In respect of the LTIP 2013 the Committee also has 
discretion to determine that the underlying performance of the Group during the performance period does not justify the vesting of the awards, 
even if specific performance conditions are met in whole or in part. In such case the awards may vest to such extent as determined by the 
Committee.
Details of the performance measures and targets for the 2013 LTIP award are set out below. 
In respect of the half of the award which is subject to EPS growth:
EPS Growth Target Portion vesting
< 1 1p 0%
11p 25%
≥ 15p 100%
Between 25% and 100% will vest on a straight line apportionment basis if EPS at the end of the performance period is between 1 1p and 15p.
The half of the 2013 award which is subject to TSR will vest if the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period falls within the top half 
of a ranking of the TSR of the companies within a comparator group. The TSR comparator group for 2013 was selected to provide performance 
measurement against an index of which the group is a constituent part being the FTSE 250 (excluding financial services and extraction 
companies). This was a change to the previous year’s comparator group which was composed of the then current Travel and Leisure sector.  
The change was made in order to provide a more meaningful comparator group as the Travel and Leisure sector contained only three  
companies that were closely comparable to FirstGroup. This change was approved by the Remuneration Committee after consultation with  
major institutional shareholders. 85

Below Median 0%
Median 25%
Upper quartile 100%
Between median and the upper quartile of the comparator group, vesting will be on a straight line apportionment basis between 25% and 100%.
Awards will lapse at the end of the performance period to the extent that the performance conditions have not been satisfied. There will be no 
re-testing.
As with the previous awards, the foregoing vesting targets for the 2013 award and the level of the award as a multiple of salary in relation to the 
Executive Directors were agreed by the Committee following consultation with a number of the Company’s major institutional shareholders.  
The award for 2013 was set lower than the normal 150% of basic salary at 120% of basic salary, reflecting the low share price. 
The Remuneration Committee has certain discretions in relation to LTIP vesting which are set out in the Remuneration Policy Report on  
pages 71 to 80.
Following the approval of the rights issue at a general meeting held on 10 June 2013 the Remuneration Committee determined that in accordance 
with the rules of the LTIP , a standard rights issue adjustment formula would be applied to adjust the outstanding options or conditional share awards 
granted under the LTIP . Details of these adjusted awards are set out in the table on page 88.
EABP Awards
Chris Surch received a bonus of £172,816 in respect of the 2012/13 financial year of which a portion (£86,408) was received in the form of share 
awards structured as nil cost options deferred for three years which are due to vest on 1 April 2016. Chris Surch was therefore granted 73,875 
share awards (adjusted for the rights issue) under the EABP 2013 on 10 June 2013 at a price of 143.46 pence (using the average of the middle 
market closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the five working days from the date of the preliminary results and capital restructuring 
announcement on 20 May 2013) which was used to determine the number of shares awarded. Tim O’Toole waived his bonus for 2012/13 and 
therefore did not receive any deferred shares under the EABP in respect of that year. 86

Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited information)
Share ownership guidelines
Following the establishment of the LTIP in 2008, shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors were introduced. These require Executive Directors  
to retain at least 50% of the shares, net of tax, vesting under the LTIP award, or any other vesting of an award under any other executive share plan,  
or otherwise acquire shares in the Company over a period of five years until a shareholding with a market value (calculated by reference to the 
purchase price) equal to 100% of basic salary is achieved. The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to relax or waive the application of  
such guidelines in certain circumstances, including the impending retirement of any Executive Director.

 Tim O’Toole waived his bonus for 2011/12 and 2012/13. In respect of the deferred share element of the 2013/14 bonus award, Tim O’Toole will receive an award of 
223,554 shares structured as conditional awards for nil payment and Chris Surch an award of 99,137 shares structured as nil cost options. These will be deferred for 
three years from 31 March 2014.

 The figure shown represents the number of share awards structured as conditional share awards for nil payment which were granted under the deferred share 
element of the EABP in respect of 2010/11 to Tim O’Toole, with Tim O’Toole electing to take all this bonus in the form of deferred shares. The EABP 2011 vested on 
21 May 2014.

 The figures shown represent the number of share awards which were granted under the LTIP in the relevant financial year and are subject to the performance targets 
and deferral periods as set out above and discussed in previous remuneration reports for earlier grants.

 The retention share award took the form of a conditional share award for nil payment. It vested and was released on 6 November 2013 at a market value of 122.90 
pence per share. 
6
 The Remuneration Committee met on 13 May 2014 and determined that the performance conditions of the LTIP 2011 had not been met. Therefore Tim O’Toole’s 
entitlement under the 2011 LTIP has now lapsed.
Percentage change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive
The table opposite sets out the percentage change in base salary, value of taxable benefits and bonus for the Chief Executive compared with the 
average percentage change for UK employees (including UK Bus and UK Rail but excluding Group). The UK workforce was chosen as a suitable 
comparator group as the Executive Directors are predominantly based in the UK. In addition this avoids complicated exchange rate adjustments 
that would have to be used if employees based in the Group’s overseas operations were included and the fact that a large proportion of the North 
American workforce works part time. 89

 The 2008, 2009 and 2010 LTIP awards lapsed. Following testing of the performance conditions for vesting of the 2011 award at 31 March 2014 the Committee 
determined on 13 May 2014 that neither the EPS nor the TSR targets had been met and accordingly the award has lapsed.
External Board Appointments
Where Board approval is given for an Executive Director to accept an outside non-executive directorship, unless the appointment is in connection 
with the Group business, the individual Director is entitled to retain any fees received. For serving as a Director of CSX Corporation, Tim O’Toole 
receives a fee of $70,000 which is taken in CSX common shares and an annual grant of $150,000 also in CSX common shares. Both elements 
are deferred until Tim O’Toole leaves the board of CSX Corporation and therefore he does not receive any current compensation. 
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors for 2015
The policy will apply to any remuneration paid on or after 16 July 2014. 
Salary
The basic salary for Tim O’Toole at £845,625 per annum and Chris Surch at £450,000 per annum remain unchanged. 
Benefits
These will remain as a car allowance, private medical insurance (for himself and spouse) and reimbursement of advisory fees relating to tax advice 
for Tim O’Toole and private medical insurance for Chris Surch (for himself and spouse).
Pension
The current pension arrangements described above will remain in place for the forthcoming financial year.
Annual Bonus – EABP
The annual bonus for 2014/15 will operate on the same basis as in 2013/14. The Committee has approved a maximum bonus opportunity  
of 100% of salary for Chris Surch and of 120% for Tim O’Toole. 50% of any bonus will be payable in cash with the remaining 50% in the form  
of deferred shares.

Proposed target levels have been set to be challenging relative to the budget for the year. The threshold is 94% of Group budget operating profit 
target with maximum paid at 105%. Specific targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive and therefore will not be published until such time 
that the Committee is confident that there will be no adverse impact on the Company of such disclosure. The maximum potential bonus is 120% 
for the Chief Executive and 100% for the Group Finance Director.

LTIP
For 2014, the LTIP will continue to operate on the same basis as in the 2013 LTIP . Executive Directors will each receive an award of 120% of salary 
with 50% of the award subject to the growth in the Company’s earnings per share and the remaining 50% of the award subject  
to the Company’s total shareholder return.
Details of the performance measures and targets for the LTIP 2014 are set out below. 
In respect of the half of the 2014 award which is subject to EPS growth the following targets apply:
EPS Growth Target Portion of award vesting
<10p 0%
10p 10%
12p 25%

Between 10% and 25% will vest on a straight line apportionment basis if EPS at the end of the performance period is between 10p and 12p. 
Between 25% and 100% will vest on a straight line apportionment basis if EPS at the end of the performance period is between 12p and 16p.
The half of the 2014 award which is subject to TSR will vest if the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period falls within the top half 
of a ranking of the TSR of the companies within a comparator group. The FTSE 250 (excluding financial services and extraction companies) is the 
comparator group for 2014 awards, which remains unchanged from 2013.

Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees
In May 2014, the Board reviewed Non-Executive Directors’ fees. Following consideration of actual and proposed salary increases across the 
Group and indicative fee increases at sector and FTSE comparators, the Board determined that the base fee should be increased from £50,000 
p.a. to £52,500 p.a. and that additional fees should be increased by a similar rate. The Committee approved a fee payable to the new Chairman 
on his appointment of £250,000 p.a. A summary of fee increases, which are effective from 1 April 2014, is set out in the table below. Fee levels are

Feedback from shareholders indicated that the votes against the Directors’ remuneration report at last year’s AGM were largely a result of two 
main factors. The first was the decision that the Executive Directors would be eligible to receive a bonus in a year when operating profit was 
reduced compared with the prior year. As noted above, Tim O’Toole waived his bonus for the year. However, much of the profit reduction was due 
to specific issues that were known in advance of the financial year and which were already reflected in external market forecasts for the year. 
These included a reduction in UK Rail earnings, principally as a result of the First TransPennine Express franchise entering a three year extension 
period at margins closer to the industry average, and a reduction in UK Bus earnings, where Government funding available to the industry was 
reduced. The Group’s North American operations were also adversely affected during the year by Hurricane Sandy. The Remuneration 
Committee therefore had to take these structural non-trading issues into account when setting bonus targets. To do otherwise would have 
resulted in unrealistic targets being set, which would have been demotivating to the executive team. The other issue on which we received 
shareholder feedback was the payment of a cash bonus to Chris Surch on joining the Company. This was compensation for a cash bonus he 
would have received had he stayed with Shanks Group plc. The amount of the bonus and terms on which it would have been paid were verified 
with Shanks Group plc. The Company’s position was explained to leading shareholders prior to the AGM. 
Engagement with Shareholders on Remuneration
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee regularly engages with relevant organisations concerning the Company’s approach to remuneration 
and reports back to the other members of the Remuneration Committee on such dialogue as necessary. In particular the Remuneration Committee 
consulted extensively with major institutional shareholders in respect of the operation of the LTIP scheme and in respect of the policy for inclusion in 
this Directors’ remuneration report. The Chairman of the Board also received feedback on remuneration issues when he met shareholders as part of 
his induction programme. Further details may be found on page 66 of the Directors’ and corporate governance report.
Approval
This report was approved by the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, on 21 May 2014 and signed on its 
behalf by:

 Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing  
the Annual Report and the financial  
statements in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have chosen to prepare 
the parent company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors  
are required to:
■ ■
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
■ ■
make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent
■ ■
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements
■ ■
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis  
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will  
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
■ ■
properly select and apply accounting policies
■ ■
present information including accounting policies, in a manner  
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and  
understandable information
■ ■
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on 
the entity’s financial position and financial performance
■ ■
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
■ ■
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole
■ ■
the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken  
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s  
and the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 General information
FirstGroup plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is 395 King 
Street, Aberdeen AB24 5RP. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 49.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2.
2 Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted and endorsed for use in the European Union and therefore 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, and on a 
going concern basis as described in the going concern statement in the Directors’ report on page 69. The principal accounting policies adopted 
are set out below.
The figures for the year to 31 March 2014 include the results of the rail business for the year to 31 March 2014 and the results of all the other 
businesses for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2014. The figures for the year to 31 March 2013 include the results of the rail businesses for the 
year to 31 March 2013 and the results of all the other businesses for the 52 weeks ended 30 March 2013. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so  
as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity interest therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be 
measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of their fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice 
of measurement is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ 
share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-
controlling interests having a deficit balance.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used 
by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Restatement of prior year numbers
The following tables show the restated prior year comparative figures for the divisions and for the Group for the financial year ended 31 March 
2013. The restatement reflects (a) the retrospective adjustment from the adoption of the changes in IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (revised), (b) the 
reclassification of certain exceptional items and (c) the retrospective adjustment of earnings per share figures as required by IAS 33 ‘Earnings Per 
Share’, reflecting the rights issue completed in June 2013. 
(a) IAS 19 (revised) 
IAS 19 (revised) applies to financial years beginning on 1 January 2013 or later. The key impact on the Group from the revised standard will be to 
remove the separate assumptions for expected return on plan assets and discounting of scheme liabilities and replace them with one single 
discount rate for the net deficit. The actual benefits and the cash contributions for these plans are not impacted by IAS 19 (revised).
(b) Exceptional items
The Directors have decided to reclassify certain generally recurring costs that were previously treated as exceptional. Principally these relate to 
costs incurred relating to bidding for rail franchises and the profit/(loss) on disposal of properties. 
(c) Rights issue
Pursuant to the rights issue, on 10 June 2013, 722,859,586 new ordinary shares of 5 pence each were issued, with three new ordinary shares 
issued for every two existing ordinary shares held. As a result the total issued share capital increased to 1,204.9m ordinary shares. For the 
calculation of earnings per share, the number of shares held prior to 10 June 2013 has been increased by a factor of 1.227 to reflect the bonus 
element of the rights issue.  FirstGroup

 IAS 19 (revised) increases the accounting losses on the First Great Western contract. The incremental loss for the year to 31 March 2013 of £10.5m has been treated  
as a prior year adjustment as at 1 April 2012 with utilisation of £10.5m in the year to 31 March 2013 respectively. 
2
 The incremental loss on the First Great Western contract of £6.0m for the 7 period extension to October 2013 has been included in the restatement of the exceptional 
charge for the year to 31 March 2013. 
Business segments and geographical information 
The presentation of total assets and total liabilities by business segment for March 2013 has been restated to be consistent with how the 
Directors view the business. Segment assets and liabilities are determined by identifying the assets and liabilities that relate to the business  
of each segment but excluding intercompany balances, net debt and taxation.

Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisitions method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, with the exception of deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to 
employee benefit arrangements, liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment 
and non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholder’s proportion of the net fair value 
of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant 
influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not constitute control or joint control 
over those policies. As a general rule, significant influence will be presumed to exist when the Group holds, directly or indirectly through 
subsidiaries, 20% or more of the voting power, of the investee. However, where it is clear that the Group, although holding 20% or more of the 
voting power, does not have significant influence, the investment is not accounted for as an associate. The Group has a 30% holding in DSBFirst 
but does not have significant influence and therefore the holding is treated as an investment.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when 
the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations. 
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate 
in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net 
investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments  
on behalf of the associate.
Assets held for sale
Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.  
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the date 
of classification.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of 
the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs), which are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the 
carrying amount of the CGU, the impairment loss is allocated to the goodwill of the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the 
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or 
loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested 
for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in 
determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
The existing finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised over their useful economic lives as follows:
Customer contracts – over the estimated life of the contract (9 to 10 years)
Greyhound brand and trade name – over the estimated life of the brand (20 years)
Franchise agreements – over the initial term of the franchise (2 to 10 years) 
In the event of a franchise extension a new intangible asset is set up and is amortised over the term of the extension on a straight-line basis.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue principally comprises revenue from train passenger services, road passenger transport, and certain management and maintenance 
services in the UK and North America. Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers’ travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as 
the proportion of total services to be provided. Receipts for season tickets and travel cards are deferred within trade and other payables under 
the heading of season ticket deferred income and recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the relevant ticket.

Revenue in UK Rail includes franchise subsidy receipts from the Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport Scotland and amounts receivable 
under franchise revenue support arrangements. Franchise premium payments to the DfT for amounts due under the terms of a franchise are 
included in operating costs. Revenue also includes amounts attributable to the Train Operating Companies (TOCs), predominantly based on 
models of route usage, by the Railway Settlement Plan in respect of passenger receipts. 
UK Bus revenue principally comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales and concessionary fare schemes. Concessionary amounts are 
recognised in the period in which the service is provided based on a predetermined formula as agreed with the relevant local authority. 
Greyhound coach revenue mainly comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales. 
Other Bus, including First Student and First Transit, and services revenue from contracts with government bodies and similar organisations is 
recognised as the services are provided.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All 
other leases are classified as operating leases and the rental charges are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet 
as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs (see below).
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group 
company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Group, and the presentation currency for the consolidated 
financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the 
rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the 
period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period 
except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. 
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group holds currency swaps and borrowings in foreign currencies (see  
note 24 for details of the Group’s policies in respect of foreign exchange risks). 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at the closing exchange rates on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during 
that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising from the average or actual 
exchange rates used and the period end rate, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take  
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after amortisation charges and exceptional items but before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are material items of income or expenditure which due to their size, nature, relationship to current trading activities and/or 
infrequency, require separate identification on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of the underlying financial 
performance in the year, in comparison to prior years. 
Subsequent revisions to the same exceptional items are also recognised as an exceptional item in future periods. In the current year exceptional 
items principally relate to business disposals and the residual release of the First Great Western provision, which was previously recognised as 
exceptional, but is now no longer required. In the prior year exceptional items principally related to aged legal claims associated with previous 
acquisitions, business disposals, revisions to onerous contract provisions previously recognised as exceptional items and the isolated recovery of 
UK rail bid costs. FirstGroup

Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes, which include both defined benefit schemes and defined contribution 
schemes.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. There is no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay additional contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees’ benefits 
relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial updates being 
carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised 
outside the income statement and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit position recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for 
unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past 
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme. 
Various TOCs in the UK Rail business participate in the Railways Pension Scheme, which is an industry-wide defined benefit scheme. The Group 
is obligated to fund the relevant section of the scheme over the period for which the franchise is held. The full liability is recognised on the balance 
sheet, which is then reduced by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability reflects the Group’s obligations to fund the scheme over the 
franchise term.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance  
sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of the deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities  
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on  
a net basis. 
Property, plant and equipment
Properties for provision of services or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes 
professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these 
assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Passenger carrying vehicles and other plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment 
loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets 
in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings   50 years straight-line
Long leasehold buildings   50 years straight-line
Short leasehold properties   period of lease
Passenger carrying vehicles   7 to 17 years straight-line 
Other plant and equipment   3 to 25 years straight-line
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the 
term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in income.

Capital grants
Capital grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected 
useful lives of the assets concerned. Capital grants are not recognised until there is a reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the 
conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated  
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately 
except in the case of goodwill, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is 
treated as a revaluation increase.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
The Group measures financial assets on initial recognition at fair value, and determines the classification of such assets at initial recognition and 
on any subsequent reclassification event.
Where there is no active market for a financial asset, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions 
and discounted cash flows. Otherwise financial assets are carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are classified into one of four primary categories:
Fair value through profit and loss
This covers any financial asset designated on initial recognition to be measured at fair value with fair value changes to go through the profit and 
loss, and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of trading in the short term.
Held to maturity investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified here when the Group has the intention and 
ability to hold to maturity. These financial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables 
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market have not been designated as either 
fair value through profit or loss or available for sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost. Gains and losses are recognised in the income 
statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation. 
The most significant financial assets under this category are trade receivables and bank deposits.
Trade receivables are measured at fair value, i.e. original invoice amount, less an allowance for uncollectable amounts. Appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Bank deposits are included within cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash 
in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from 
the date of inception and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents exclude bank overdrafts. Bank 
overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities. All are carried 
on the balance sheet at cost. Cash and cash equivalents includes ring-fenced cash. The most significant ring-fenced cash balances are held by 
the Group’s UK Rail subsidiaries. Under the terms of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the TOCs up to the lower of 
the amount of retained profits or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios. The ring-fenced cash represents that which is not available 
for distribution or the amount required to satisfy the contractual liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date. FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014

2 Significant accounting policies continued
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified in any of the other 
categories. After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of 
equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain 
or loss is included in the income statement. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued 
by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Sterling bonds and loan notes
These are measured either on an amortised cost basis or at fair value, if adopted.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks. Use of such financial 
instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments  
for speculative purposes. 
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps, fuel swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps. Such 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date. The fair values are 
calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counterparty confirmations. 
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges for interest rate risk on certain floating rate debt, and fair value hedges for fair value 
risk relating to the LIBOR element of a fixed rate financial liability. The fuel swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of fuel price risks or 
otherwise used as economic hedges of such risks. The cross currency swaps are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk relating  
to part of the Group’s net investment in US Dollar denominated assets. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency 
hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the income statement as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred  
to the income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses 
reported in the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required  
to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Amounts due within 12 months of the balance sheet date are 
considered to be reliably measured and are therefore included within accruals.
Self-insurance
The Group’s policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses. In addition there are typically a smaller number of 
major claims during a financial year which may be subject to an insurance deductible. To provide protection against these major losses, cover  
is obtained through third party insurance policies. Provision is made under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets for the 
estimated cost of settling uninsured claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.

Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value  
at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest and is adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
New standards and interpretations not applied
The International Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) have issued the 
following standards and interpretations for annual periods beginning on or after the effective dates as noted below:

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the Group’s accounts in the period of initial 
application.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of new and revised IAS/IFRSs. None of these have resulted in a material impact with the 
exception of IAS 19 (revised), which has had a material impact on the consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with the amendments to IAS 1, 
the Group has presented a third balance sheet as at 31 March 2012 without the related notes except for the disclosure requirements of IAS 8 
Accounting Polices, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors as shown in note 2. The application of IFRS 13 has not had a material impact on 
the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements other than the additional disclosures that are required under this IFRS. This has 
been disclosed in note 24.
Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies which are described above, management has made the following judgments and 
estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of intangible assets (including goodwill)
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.  
The value in use requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate present value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £1,509.5m (2013: £1,665.8m; 2012: £1,599.3m) as set out 
in note 12 and the carrying amount of other intangible assets at the balance sheet date was £217.9m (2013: £281.8m; 2012: £318.8m) as set out 
in note 13.  FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Contract and franchise accounting
Judgments are made on an ongoing basis with regards to the recoverability of amounts due and the carrying value of related assets and liabilities 
arising from franchises and long term service contracts. Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcome of these types of franchises and 
contracts, which require assessments and judgments relating to the expected level of revenues and costs and, in cases where options exist, the 
life of the contract or franchise.
The useful economic lives of assets are determined by reference to the length of a franchise and matched to the franchise end date. The residual 
value of assets is determined by their condition at the franchise end date and by the amount of maintenance that has been carried out during the 
period of operation.
In particular UK Rail has a number of contractual relationships including those with the DfT and Network Rail. Due to the regulated nature of the 
UK Rail industry, disputes and claims typically arise with such bodies as well as other Train Operating Companies (TOCs) where one or more 
TOCs have access to common infrastructure such as railway lines. Judgment is required by management as to the amounts receivable and also 
payable taking account of the information available at the time.
In the current year particular judgments related to the First Great Western contract provision (see note 5) and the evaluation of other potential 
onerous contracts.
Defined benefit pension arrangements
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of a suitable discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, 
expected rate of inflation of future salary and pension costs along with assumptions about mortality rates. The most significant of these are the 
discount rate and inflation rate assumptions. A 0.1% movement in the discount rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position 
by approximately £3m and £29m respectively. A 0.1% movement in the inflation rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position 
by approximately £3m and £21m respectively. The net pension deficit as at the balance sheet date was £260.7m (2013: £247.8m; 2012: £267.9m) 
as set out in note 35. 
Self-insurance
Provision is made for all known incidents for which there is self-insurance using management’s best estimate of the likely settlement of these 
incidents. The estimated settlement is reviewed on a regular basis with independent actuarial advice and the amount provided is adjusted as 
required. The Group’s total self-insurance provisions, including those classified within accruals, as at the balance sheet date were £294.8m (2013: 
£332.6m; 2012: £336.0m) as set out in note 26.

UK Bus depot sales and closures
UK Bus depot sales and closures relate to measures taken by the Group to rebalance its portfolio in the UK Bus operations, which included 
selling or closing certain operations. The principal amount in the period represents a £16.5m gain on the disposal of the eight London bus depots, 
which completed during the year, offset by £3.5m of losses on depots sold or closed. 
UK Rail First Great Western contract provision
The total loss in the final seven periods of the franchise was not as high as initially projected partly due to contractual changes agreed with the 
DfT. As a result £4.6m has been released as an exceptional credit. 
UK Rail bid cost recoveries
The Group received £12.7m of bid cost recoveries during the year to 31 March 2013 representing cost reimbursement from the DfT following the 
cancellation of the InterCity West Coast Franchise process. 
Amortisation charges
The charge for the year was £53.4m (2013: £52.0m) with the increase mainly due to the amortisation of the First Great Western contract intangible 
recognised as a result of the contract extension partly offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements. 
Ineffectiveness on financial derivatives
There was a £17.6m non-cash charge (2013: £5.5m) to the income statement during the year due to ineffectiveness on financial derivatives. The 
principal component of this non-cash charge relates to certain US Dollar interest rate swaps, which are no longer required as the underlying US 
Dollar debt was repaid from the proceeds of the rights issue.
Tax
The tax credit as a result of these amortisation charges and exceptional items was £24.9m (2013: £39.4m). In addition there was a one-off 
deferred tax credit of £3.2m (2013: £2.0m) as a result of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 20% (2013: 24% to 23%).

Impairment testing
At the year end, the carrying value of net assets, including goodwill, was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of 
Assets. For the purposes of this impairment review goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising  
in each relevant CGU. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budget for 2014/15 and Five Year Plan projections up to 2018/19 which 
take account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments. The projections for First Student assume the 
incremental benefits of the existing recovery plan, and the programme to address contract portfolio pricing together with an economic recovery. 
Cash flows in 2018/19 are extrapolated using estimated growth rates of 2.5% (2013: 2.5%) for the United Kingdom and 3.0% (2013: 3.0%) for 
North America which do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the market. A risk adjustment is then made using a pre-tax discount 
rate of 9.0% (2013: 10.0%) for the United Kingdom CGUs and 10.0% (2013: 10.0%) for the North American CGUs to arrive at the value in use. The 
pre-tax discount rates applied are derived from a market participant’s weighted average cost of capital. The assumptions used in the calculation 
of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The Directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on the historic performance of each CGU and to be realistic in light of economic 
and industry forecasts. 
The calculation of value in use for each CGU is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, growth rates and margins achievable. 
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the calculations and confirms that no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause 
the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount in respect of the First Transit, Greyhound, UK Bus and UK Rail divisions.
The value in use of the First Student division exceeds its carrying amount by £127.4m (2013: £258.9m). The sensitivity analysis indicates that the 
First Student margin or growth rates would need to fall in excess of 69 or 55 basis points respectively compared to future projections for there to 
be an impairment to the carrying value of net assets in this business. An increase in the discount rate in excess of 45 basis points would lead to 
the value in use of the division being less than its carrying amount.
Following their review of goodwill the Directors have concluded that there is no further impairment to any of the CGUs.

The rail franchise agreements’ intangible asset represents the part of the economic benefit that is realised as a result of recognising our share of 
the rail pension deficit on the date of commencement of each respective franchise and is amortised on a straight-line basis over the initial term of 
each respective franchise. The addition in the year relates to the new First Great Western franchise and the disposals relate to the ending of the 
old First Great Western and First Capital Connect contracts. The largest element of the franchise intangible relates to the First Great Western 
£10.4m (2013: £nil) and First ScotRail franchise £0.9m (2013: £2.0m).

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from failure by a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract.
Credit risk exists in relation to the Group’s financial assets, which comprise trade and other receivables of £663.6m (2013: £641.0m; 2012: 
£601.9m), cash and cash equivalents of £553.9m (2013: £682.1m; 2012: £499.7m) and derivative financial instruments of £51.9m (2013: £86.6m; 
2012: £116.1m).
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for all financial assets at the balance sheet date was £1,271.5m (2013: £1,409.7m; 2012: £1,217.7m). 
The exposure is spread over a large number of unconnected counterparties and the maximum single concentration with any one counterparty 
was £70.0m (2013: £51.3m; 2012: £81.1m) at the balance sheet date.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for 
doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic 
environment. The provision for doubtful receivables at the balance sheet date was £2.9m (2013: £3.2m; 2012: £4.5m).
Most trade receivables are with public or quasi public bodies, principally the DfT, Network Rail, Transport for London, Transport Scotland, and 
city councils in the UK and school bus boards and city municipal authorities in North America. The Group does not consider any of these 
counterparties to represent a significant credit risk. Each division within the Group has a policy governing credit risk management on trade 
receivables. FirstGroup

The counterparties for bank balances and derivative financial instruments are mainly represented by large banks with a minimum of ‘A’ credit 
ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. These counterparties are subject to approval by the Board. Group treasury policy limits 
the maximum deposit with any one counterparty to £75m, and limits the maximum term to three months.

There are also First Student yellow school buses which are surplus to requirements and are being actively marketed on the Internet. Gains or 
losses arising on the disposal of such assets are included in arriving at operating profit in the income statement. The Group expects to sell such 
yellow school buses within 12 months of them going onto the ‘for sale’ list. The value at each balance sheet date represents management’s best 
estimate of their resale value. There are no liabilities associated with these held for sale assets.
The 2013 balance comprises mainly the fixed assets of the eight London depots which were disposed of on 22 June 2013 (note 30).

appropriate credit timeframe. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.

the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by these subsidiaries up to the lower of the amount of their retained profits or the 
amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios. The ring-fenced cash represents cash which is not available for distribution and any additional 
amounts required to satisfy the liquidity ratios at the balance sheet date. Ring-fenced cash balances of £0.7m (2013: £14.4m; 2012: £12.5m) are

Borrowing facilities
The Group had £796.2m (2013: £821.6m; 2012: £631.8m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities as at 31 March 2014. Total bank borrowing 
facilities at 31 March 2014 stood at £856.1m (2013: £1,302.9m; 2012: £1,221.3m) of which £826.3m (2013: £1,259.4m; 2012: £1,178.2m) was 
committed and £29.8m (2013: £43.5m; 2012: £43.1m) was uncommitted.
Capital management
Overall the Group’s objective is to achieve a post-tax return on capital employed (ROCE) in the range of 10% to 12% in the medium term.  
We also aim to maintain an investment grade credit rating and appropriate balance sheet liquidity headroom. The Group has net debt: EBITDA  
of 2.2 times (2013: 3.4 times) as at March 2014 and is targeting net debt: EBITDA of 2.0 times in the medium term. 
ROCE is calculated by dividing adjusted operating profit after tax by net assets, excluding debt items.
Liquidity within the Group has remained strong. At 31 March 2014 there was £988.5m (2013: £1,215.5m) of committed headroom and free cash. 
Largely due to seasonality in the First Student school bus business, committed headroom typically reduces during the financial year through 
October and increases thereafter. The Group’s treasury policy requires a minimum of £250m of committed headroom at all times.
The Group’s net debt, excluding accrued bond interest at 31 March 2014, was £1,303.8m (2013: £1,979.1m) as set out on page 48 of the  
Financial review.

The Group considers there to be no material difference between the fair values of the Sterling and Canadian Dollar finance leases and the 
carrying amount in the balance sheet. The US Dollar finance leases have a fair value of £277.7m (2013: £304.1m; 2012: £225.8m). The fair value  
is calculated by discounting future cash flows that will arise under the lease agreements.

The loan notes have been classified by reference to the earliest date on which the loan note holder can request redemption. Loan notes of £8.7m 
(2013: £8.7m; 2012: £8.7m) are supported by unsecured bank guarantees.
The loan notes have an average effective borrowing rate of 10.1% (2013: 10.1%; 2012: 10.1%) and an average remaining term of 6 years (2013:  
7 years; 2012: 8 years) assuming that the holders do not request redemption. The fair value of the loan notes has been determined to be £13.6m 
(2013: £15.0m; 2012: £15.8m). This has been calculated by discounting future cash flows that will arise under the loan notes.

Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to financial risks including liquidity risk, credit risk and certain market-based risks principally being the effects of changes in 
foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices. The Group manages these risks within the context of a set of formal policies established by 
the Board. Certain risk management responsibilities are formally delegated by the Board, principally to a sub-committee of the Board and to the 
Group Finance Director.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. The objective of the 
Group’s liquidity risk management is to ensure that sufficient committed liquidity resources exist. The Group has a diversified debt structure 
largely represented by medium term unsecured syndicated committed bank facilities, medium to long term unsecured bond debt and finance 
leases. It is a policy requirement that debt obligations must be addressed well in advance of their due dates.
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of £250m of committed liquidity headroom at all times within medium term bank facilities and such 
facilities must be renewed or replaced well before their expiry dates. At 31 March 2014, the total amount of these facilities stood at £826.3m 
(2013: £1,259.4m; 2012: £1,178.2m), and committed headroom was £796.2m (2013: £821.6m; 2012: £631.8m), in addition to free cash balances  
of £192.3m (2013: £393.9m; 2012: £164.0m). In May 2014, the Group signed a five year, £800.0m revolving credit facility with our relationship 
banks. Largely due to the seasonality of the First Student school bus business, headroom tends to reduce from March to October and increase 
again by the following March.
The average duration of net debt (excluding ring-fenced cash) at 31 March 2014 was 6.1 years (2013: 5.4 years; 2012: 5.5 years). FirstGroup

No derivative financial instruments had collateral requirements or were due on demand in any of the years.
Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk of financial loss to foreign currency net assets, earnings and cash flows reported in pounds Sterling due to movements in 
exchange rates.
The Group’s principal operations outside the UK are in the US and Canada, with the US being the most significant. Consequently the principal 
currency risk relates to movements in the US Dollar to pounds Sterling. 
Group treasury policy aims to protect EPS from currency movements. US Dollar earnings arising in the US are substantially protected by US 
Dollar denominated costs incurred in the UK, principally UK fuel costs, US Dollar interest costs and US Dollar tax costs so that exposure to EPS 
on a year to year basis is not material. Cash flow exposures are not material.

IFRS 7 requires the Group to show the impact on profit after tax and hedging reserve on financial instruments from a movement in exchange 
rates. The following analysis details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in Sterling against the US Dollar. The analysis has been 
prepared based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and being held constant throughout the reporting period.  
A positive number indicates an increase in earnings or equity where Sterling strengthens against the US Dollar.

Interest rate risk
The Group has variable rate debt and cash and therefore its net income is exposed to the effects of changes to interest rates. The Group treasury 
policy objective is to maintain fixed interest rates at a minimum average of 75% of on-balance sheet net debt over the medium term, so that 
volatility is substantially reduced year on year to EPS. The policy objective is primarily achieved through fixed rate debt. The main floating rate 
benchmarks on variable rate debt are US Dollar LIBOR and pounds Sterling LIBOR.
At 31 March 2014, 85% (2013: 88%; 2012: 81%) of gross debt was fixed. This fixed rate protection had an average duration of 6.3 years (2013:  
5.5 years; 2012: 5.7 years). 
Interest rate risk within operating leases is hedged 100% by agreeing fixed rentals with the lessors prior to inception of the lease contracts.
Fair value changes in the £250.0m pounds Sterling bond relating to the LIBOR element are hedged with coupon swaps. These swaps offset the 
fair value movements in the bond in the income statement and have the same term as the bond. Interest income is received in January and 
payments are made in March and September each year.
The following sensitivity analysis details the Group’s sensitivity to a 100 basis points (1%) increase in interest rates throughout the reporting period 
with all other variables held constant.

Interest rate hedges 
The following table details the notional amounts of interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow or fair value hedges which were 
outstanding at the reporting date. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the reporting date. The fair value of interest 
rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis. The differences between the fixed and floating rates are settled on  
a net basis.

Fuel price risk
The Group purchases diesel fuel on a floating price basis in its UK Bus, UK Rail, US and Canadian bus operations and therefore is exposed to 
changes in diesel prices, of which the most significant element is crude oil price risk. The Group’s policy objective is to maintain a significant 
degree of fixed price protection in the short term with lower levels of protection over the medium term, so that the businesses affected are 
protected from any sudden and significant increases and have time to prepare for potentially higher costs, whilst retaining some access to 
potentially lower costs over the medium term. The Group primarily uses fixed rate swap instruments to achieve significant fixed price certainty. 
During the year to 31 March 2014, the Group was hedged 83% on fuel price risk.
The Group has also entered into swaps for periods from April 2014 to March 2016 with the majority of these swaps relating to the year to  
31 March 2015. The swaps give rise to monthly cash flow exchanges with counterparties to offset the underlying settlement of floating price 
costs, except where they have a deferred start date. Gains or losses on fuel derivatives are recycled from equity to the income statement on 
qualifying hedges to achieve fixed rate fuel costs within operating results.

The insurance claims provision arises from estimated exposures for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date. It is anticipated that the 
majority of such claims will be settled within the next six years although certain liabilities in respect of lifetime obligations of £17.7m (2013: £20.0m) 
can extend for up to 30 years. The utilisation of £176.1m (2013: £173.1m; 2012: £162.8m) represents payments made largely against the current 
liability of the preceding year. 
Legal and other provisions relate to estimated exposures for cases filed or thought highly likely to be filed for incidents that occurred prior to the 
balance sheet date. It is anticipated that most of these items will be settled within 10 years. Also included are provisions in respect of costs 
anticipated on the exit of surplus properties which are expected to be settled over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
The pension’s provision relates to unfunded obligations that arose on the acquisition of certain UK Bus companies. It is anticipated that this will  
be utilised over five to 10 years.

To support subsidiary undertakings in their normal course of business, the Company and certain subsidiaries have indemnified certain banks and 
insurance companies who have issued performance bonds for £504.8m (2013: £566.2m; 2012: £532.5m) and letters of credit for £303.3m (2013: 
£321.7m; 2012: £299.3m). The performance bonds relate to the North American businesses of £337.8m (2013: £354.7m; 2012: £314.2m) and the 
UK Rail franchise operations of £167.0m (2013: £211.5m; 2012: £218.3m). The letters of credit relate substantially to insurance arrangements in the 
UK and North America.
The Company is party to certain unsecured guarantees granted to banks for overdraft and cash management facilities provided to itself and 
subsidiary undertakings. The Company has given certain unsecured guarantees for the liabilities of its subsidiary undertakings arising under 
certain loan notes, hire purchase contracts, finance leases, operating leases and certain pension scheme arrangements. It also provides 
unsecured cross guarantees to certain subsidiary undertakings as required by VAT legislation. UK Bus subsidiaries have provided unsecured 
guarantees on a joint and several basis to the Trustees of the UK Bus Pension Scheme.
Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have issued unsecured guarantees to the Company’s pounds Sterling bondholders, to lenders 
participating in the Group’s £751.3m (2013: £822.5m; 2012: £780.8m) syndicated unsecured bank facility and to certain bilateral bank facilities for 
£75.0m (2013: £436.9m; 2012: £397.3m) and to senior unsecured loan notes for £89.9m (2013: £98.3m; 2012: £93.3m).
The Group has issued guarantees of £4.0m (2013: £7.0m; 2012: £7.0m) to the Danish and Swedish authorities in respect of DSBFirst. These 
guarantees relate to the operational performance of the Danish rail activities and certain train maintenance activities in Sweden.
The Group is party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business, including but not limited to employment and 
safety claims. The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and counterclaims. No provision is made where due to 
inherent uncertainties, no accurate quantification of any cost, or timing of such cost, which may arise from any of the legal proceedings can be 
determined.
In its normal course of business UK Rail has ongoing contractual negotiations with government and other organisations.

(d) Buy As You Earn (BAYE)
BAYE enables eligible employees to purchase shares from their gross income. The Company provides two matching shares for every three 
shares bought by employees, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of £20 per employee per month. If the shares 
are held in trust for five years or more, no income tax and national insurance will be payable. The matching shares will be forfeited if the 
corresponding partnership shares are removed from trust within three years of award.
At 31 March 2014 there were 7,903 (2013: 8,306; 2012: 8,354) participants in the BAYE scheme who have cumulatively purchased 9,201,084 
(2013: 6,159,479; 2012: 6,869,043) shares with the Company contributing 2,998,927 (2013; 1,936,789; 2012: 2,128,810) matching shares on a

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous five years. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and 
behavioural considerations.
Allowances have been made for the SAYE schemes for the fact that amongst a group of recipients some are expected to leave before an 
entitlement vests. The accounting charge is then adjusted over the vesting period to take account of actual forfeitures, so although the total 
charge is unaffected by the pre-vesting forfeiture assumption, the timing of the recognition of the expense will be sensitive to it. Fair values for  
the SAYE include a 10% p.a. pre-vesting leaver assumption whereas the Executive, LTIP and deferred share plans exclude any allowance for 
pre-vesting forfeitures.

35 Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution plans
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. There is no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay additional contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees’ benefits 
relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
UK
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all Group and UK Bus division employees who have joined a pension 
arrangement from January 2011 and April 2013, respectively. They will receive a company match to their contributions, which varies by salary 
level. The default member contribution rate is 5%, which is matched by the company, although auto-enrolees are stepping up to this level from an 
initial 2% matched contribution. 
Auto-enrolment legislation has been implemented which requires employees to be automatically entered into a pension scheme. This has resulted 
in an increase in contributions to defined contribution arrangements during the financial year compared to 2012/13.
North America
Employees in the US have been able to join a defined contribution arrangement for many years. They will receive a company match to their 
contributions, which varies by employment status. The company match is 50% of member contributions, to a company maximum of 3% for 
full-time employees and $250 per annum for part-time employees. 
All new employees in Canada join a defined contribution arrangement. Union employees join the Eastern or Western plan, dependent upon their 
geographical location, whilst managers and supervisors join the Supervisory plan, for non-union employees. Members of the Western and 
Supervisory plans can contribute 2%, 3%, 4% or 5%, and receive a 50% company match. New members of the Eastern plan from 3 October 
2013 may contribute 2%, 3% or 4%, and receive a 100% company match.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement of £13.6m (2013: £8.4m) represents contributions payable to these plans by 
the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit plans
The Group sponsors 18 funded defined benefit plans across its operations, covering approximately 80,000 former and current employees.
UK
The majority of defined benefit provision is through Trust based schemes. With the exception of the Railways Pension Schemes, these 
arrangements are now closed to new entrants. In these arrangements the assets of the schemes are invested separately from those of the Group, 
and the schemes are run by independent Trustee boards. The Trustee board of the pension schemes is required by law, or by their Articles of 
Association, to act in the best interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme, i.e. active employees, inactive employees, 
retirees, beneficiaries and employers. There is a requirement for the Trustee board to have member representation with the other Trustees being 
company appointed.
The Trustee board is responsible for the investment policy in respect of the assets of the fund, although the Company must be consulted on this, 
and typically has some input into the investment decisions.
Schemes are valued at least triennially, when the cost of future service is calculated and the funding position established. The Company and 
Trustee board are required to agree on assumptions for the valuation and to agree the contributions that result from this. The contributions may 
need to incorporate deficit recovery contributions in addition to future service contributions, if a deficit position is determined through the 
valuation. If a surplus is shown at the valuation, this may be used to reduce future service contributions. In agreeing contribution rates, reference 
must be made to the affordability of contributions by the employer.
In most arrangements, any surplus after benefits have been paid/secured, can be repaid to the employer.
The First UK Bus Pension Scheme
This predominantly provides pension benefits to employees in the UK Bus division. Historically the Scheme provided final salary benefits and 
career average benefits. However, with effect from April 2012, the Scheme only provides career average benefits with a retirement age linked to 
State Pension age and a cap on the pensionable pay on which defined benefits can be built. For 2013/14 this was £30,660.
The cost of future service is split so that the employer meets 60% of the cost and the employees 40%, subject to caps and collars around 
employee contributions. These caps and collars have never been utilised.
In addition there is a smaller Group scheme which provided defined benefit pensions to Group employees and executives. This closed to new 
entrants in 2011.
The Railways Pension Scheme
The Group currently sponsors six sections of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS), relating to its franchising obligations for its TOCs, and for Hull 
Trains, its Open Access operator.
Under this scheme members build a 1/60th pension and 1/40th lump sum based upon their pensionable pay. Some members of the Railways 
Pension Scheme are subject to Protected Persons legislation, which requires individual consent to changes to benefits, and certain rights upon 
transfer between sections of the scheme.
The RPS is a shared cost arrangement. All costs, and any deficit or surplus is shared 60% by the employer and 40% by the members. 
Furthermore, under the franchising obligations, the responsibility of the employer is to pay the contributions requested of the Trustee whilst  
it operates the franchise. There is no residual liability or asset for any deficit, or surplus, which remains at the end of the franchise period.  FirstGroup  
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
140
35 Retirement benefit schemes continued
In calculating the Group’s pension obligations in respect of the RPS, the Group has calculated the total pension deficits in each of the RPS 
sections in accordance with IAS 19. These deficits are reduced by a ‘franchise adjustment’ which is that portion of the deficit which is projected 
to exist at the end of the franchise and for which the Group will not be required to fund. The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated by 
the Group’s actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the financial performance, position and cash 
flows of the Group’s obligations. Allowance is also made in the preparation of the financial statements for the cost sharing nature of the benefit and 
in particular, only 60% of the total profit and loss charge and balance sheet position are attributed to the Group and recognised in the accounts.
Hull Trains is not subject to franchising obligations, and as such it is accounted for under IAS19 as a Defined Benefit scheme, although subject to 
the same cost sharing obligations as for the franchised sections.
Local Government Pension Schemes
The Group participates in five Local Government Pension Schemes (LGPS), three in England and two in Scotland. These differ from Trust based 
schemes in that their benefits are prescribed by legislation, and they are administered by Local Authorities, and pension committees consisting  
of local councillors. Typically the Group has less control over the investment strategy adopted by the LGPS compared to the UK Trust based 
schemes.
Historically benefit accrual in these schemes has been based on final salary. However the benefit structure is changing to a 1/47th career average 
benefit in England in April 2014 and in Scotland in 2015. Normal pension age will be aligned with State Pension Age from that time. Some 
members have a right to receive some of their benefits on an unreduced basis, conditional on age and service. 
As with the Trust based schemes, valuations take place at least triennially. Generally contribution rates are agreed for the three year period until 
the next valuation. Whilst these are balance of cost schemes, at termination there is no right for the Company to receive any surplus in the 
schemes, although there is an obligation on the Company to fully fund the benefits. To reflect this, the Group only recognise existing surpluses 
relating to the LGPS when determining the balance sheet position, to the extent that these surpluses could be recouped by the reduction of future 
company contributions. 
North America
US
The Group operates two defined benefit arrangements in the US. These are legacy arrangements with benefit accrual having ceased some years 
ago. The schemes are valued annually, when the funding position and minimum and maximum contributions are established. 
Changes in funding position create new surplus or deficit each year, which is normally spread over seven years, as required by legislation. 
However, funding relief passed by Congress in 2010, and again in 2012, has allowed greater flexibility following the global financial crisis. The most 
recent funding relief passed in 2012 had the short term effect of increasing the funding discount rate, which acts to lower liabilities, deficits and 
contributions. This effect will reduce over time.
Greyhound Canada
There are three plans, relating to Eastern, Western and Supervisory employees. All these plans are now closed to new members, although benefit 
accrual continues for existing members. Small executive arrangements also exist.
The plans are valued annually, where the cost of future service and the funding position are identified. Future service costs are shared in 
proportion between the members and the Company, although there are caps on the member rates. Deficit contributions are met entirely by the 
Company. Cash contributions are required to fund the plans on a ‘going concern’ basis, whilst the (usually higher) ‘solvency’ deficit can be made 
good through a Letter of Credit. There is a cap on the value of the Letter of Credit, which cannot exceed 15% of the value of the assets held  
in the plan.
At their last triennial valuations, the defined benefit schemes had funding levels between 70.5% and 101.9% (2013: 61.0% and 101.9%;  
2012: 61.0% and 101.9%). The market value of the assets at 31 March 2014 for all defined benefit schemes totalled £3,902m (2013: £3,777m; 
2012: £3,397m). 
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is 
actuarially valued.

The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the financial year to 31 March 2015 is £137.4m  
(year to 31 March 2014: £122.2m)
Risks associated with defined benefit plans:
Generally the number of employees in defined benefit plans is reducing rapidly, as these plans are largely closed to new entrants, and in many 
cases to future accrual. Consequently, the number of defined contribution members is increasing.
Despite remaining open to new entrants and future accrual, the risks posed by the Railways Pension Scheme are limited, as under the franchise 
arrangements, the UK Rail TOCs are not responsible for any residual deficit at the end of a franchise. As such, there is only short term cash flow 
risk within this business.
The key risks relating to the defined benefit pension arrangements and the steps taken by the Group to mitigate them are as follows:
Risk Description Mitigation
Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference 
to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will 
create a deficit. Most of the defined benefit arrangements hold a 
significant proportion of return-seeking assets (equities, diversified 
growth funds and global absolute return funds) which, though 
expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create 
volatility and risk in the short term.
Asset liability modelling has been undertaken 
recently in all significant plans to ensure that 
any risks taken are rewarded.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the UK benefit obligations are linked to 
inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The business has certain inflation linking in its 
revenue streams, which helps to offset this 
risk. In addition, the investment strategy 
reviews have led to inflation hedging, whether 
through swaps or holding Index Linked Gilts in 
the UK schemes. 
Uncertainty over level 
of future contributions
Contributions to defined benefit schemes can be unpredictable and 
volatile as a result of changes in the funding level revealed at each 
valuation. 
The Group is engaging with the Trustees to 
consider how contribution requirements can 
be made more stable. The level of volatility 
and the Group’s ability to control contribution 
levels varies between arrangements. 
Life expectancy The majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for 
the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the liabilities.
Linking retirement age to UK State Pension 
Age (as in the UK Bus Pension Scheme and 
LGPS) should mitigate this risk to some extent.
Trapped surplus At termination of LGPS arrangements there is no right for the 
Company to receive any surplus that exists within the scheme. 
Therefore there is a risk of overfunding the schemes.
The Group takes professional advice in 
relation to this issue although there is limited 
scope to mitigate the risk. 
Legislative risk Future legislative changes are uncertain. In the past these have led 
to increases in obligations, through introducing pension increases, 
and vesting of deferred pensions, or reduced investment return 
through the ability to reclaim Advance Corporation Tax.
We are aware that the UK Government has already legislated to end 
contracting out in 2016 and that there is an intention to implement 
legislation which could result in an increase in the value of 
Guaranteed Minimum Pension. If this legislation is implemented,  
this would increase the defined benefit obligation of the  
UK arrangements.
The UK Bus Pension Scheme and the main 
section of the FirstGroup Pension Scheme are 
now contracted into the State Second 
Pension reducing the impact of the cessation 
of contracting out on the Group.
The Group takes professional advice to keep 
abreast of legislative changes. FirstGroup

adopted by the European Union;
■ ■ the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
■ ■ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement, and the related notes 1 to 36, the 
parent company balance sheet, and the related notes to the parent company balance sheet 1 to 11. The financial reporting framework that has

Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ and corporate governance report on 
page 69 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
■ ■ we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and
■ ■ we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets 
The annual impairment test is a complex process 
requiring significant management judgment and is 
based on assumptions about future profitability.  
The Cash Generating Unit (CGU) most sensitive to 
variation in assumptions is the First Student CGU  
as disclosed in note 12 to the financial statements.
We assessed management’s assumptions used in the impairment model for goodwill and 
intangible assets, described in note 12 to the financial statements, specifically including 
the cash flow projections, discount rates and growth rates applied. 
Our procedures included reviewing forecast cash flows with reference to historical trading 
performance, using our valuation specialists to challenge the discount rates applied and 
through review of underlying calculations and comparison of inputs to market data. In 
addition we have benchmarked key assumptions such as growth rates and discount rates 
to external macro-economic and market data. We have re-run the sensitivities applied by 
management and considered their reasonableness. 
Valuation and completeness of third party claims 
and associated provisions and assets
The valuation and completeness of both legal and 
self-insurance provisions are a source of estimation 
uncertainty, which require management’s best 
estimate in assessing the likeliness and valuation of 
settlement and where applicable the discount rate 
applied to the expected settlement values.
We worked with our own actuarial experts to test the range of estimates determined by 
management and their external actuary considering the methodologies employed, 
comparing assumptions used to the Group’s historical experience. We independently 
developed an actuarial calculation and compared the provision recorded to the actuarial 
range calculated by the external actuary.
We also tested a sample of the underlying data used to develop the provision for 
completeness and accuracy and challenged the appropriateness of the discount rate 
used through comparison to previous years and those used by similar entities. 
As part of our assessment of legal provisions, we obtained confirmations from internal 
and independent external legal counsel. 
Valuation of pension scheme liabilities
The Group operates in a labour intensive industry 
with large membership to a number of defined 
benefit pension schemes. The gross pension 
liabilities as disclosed in note 35 to the financial 
statements are materially sensitive to changes  
in the underlying assumptions adopted. 
Management exercise significant judgment when 
determining those assumptions, particularly the 
discount rate, inflation and mortality rates.
We worked with our own actuarial experts to test the assumptions used by management 
in valuing the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme liabilities such as the discount rate, 
inflation and mortality rate, performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions and 
compared them to industry benchmarks and prior years’ rates adopted.
Revenue recognition including contract accounting
The Group operates a number of long term contracts 
including UK rail franchises and certain North 
American passenger and service contracts.
Management exercise judgment in determining the 
appropriate timing and valuation of revenue 
recognised, valuation of associated deferred and 
accrued income and the evaluation of the overall 
profitability of these contracts.
We have assessed the judgments taken by management in determining the valuation and 
timing of revenue recognition and associated deferred and accrued income with reference 
to the underlying contract terms and applicable accounting standards. 
We considered the completeness of onerous contract provisions by challenging profit 
forecasts prepared by management with reference to the historical trading performance 
and forecasting accuracy.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 64 of the Directors’ and corporate governance report.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to 
express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks 
described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be £5.6m, which is 5% of adjusted pre-tax profit (as defined on page 94 to the financial statements), 
and below 1% of equity. The adjusted pre-tax profit measure has been used to exclude the volatility of non-recurring items. In addition, the 
exclusion of amortisation and the income statement effect of ineffective and unhedged financial derivative valuation is consistent with the key 
measure used by the Group for internal and external reporting purposes. This measure has been used to facilitate a better understanding of the 
trading performance of the Group.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £100,000 as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters 
that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily on the four UK Bus 
operating regions, four significant Train Operating Companies, the operations in North America and the Group, Rail Division and Bus Division 
corporate head office functions as well as the UK Shared Service Centre. These locations were subject to full audit procedures. First Rail 
Holdings was subject to specified audit procedures on rail franchise bid costs based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and 
of the materiality of the Group’s operations at that location. The locations, subject to full audit procedures, represent the principal business units 
and account for 89.2% of the Group’s net assets, 98.0% of the Group’s revenue and 99.7% of the Group’s profit before tax. They were also 
selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work 
at these locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual location which was lower than Group materiality. 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were 
no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of 
specified account balances.
We include all component audit teams in our team briefing, discuss their risk assessment and a senior member of the Group audit team has 
visited all locations to review documentation of the findings from their work.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
■ ■ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
■ ■ the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
■ ■ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
■ ■ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
■ ■ the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been made 
or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to 
report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
■ ■ materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
■ ■ apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; 
or
■ ■ otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and 
the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have 
not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements. FirstGroup

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit 
methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team, strategically focused second partner reviews and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

The table above has been restated to reflect (a) the retrospective adjustment from the adoption of the changes in IAS 19 Employee Benefits 
(revised), (b) the reclassification of certain exceptional items and (c) the retrospective adjustment of earnings per share figures as required by  
IAS 33 Earnings Per Share, reflecting the rights issue completed in June 2013. 
(a) IAS 19 (revised) 
IAS 19 (revised) applies to financial years beginning on 1 January 2013 or later. The key impact on the Group from the revised standard will be  
to remove the separate assumptions for expected return on plan assets and discounting of scheme liabilities and replace them with one single 
discount rate for the net deficit. The actual benefits and the cash contributions for these plans are not impacted by IAS 19 (revised).
(b) Exceptional items
The Directors have decided to reclassify certain generally recurring costs that were previously treated as exceptional. Principally these relate  
to costs incurred relating to bidding for rail franchises and the profit/(loss) on disposal of properties. 
(c) Rights issue
Pursuant to the rights issue, on 10 June 2013, 722,859,586 new ordinary shares of 5 pence each were issued, with three new ordinary 
shares issued for every two existing ordinary shares held. As a result the total issued share capital increased to 1,204.9m ordinary shares. 
For the calculation of earnings per share, the number of shares held prior to 10 June 2013 has been increased by a factor of 1.227 to 
reflect the bonus element of the rights issue.  FirstGroup

1 Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and on a going 
concern basis as described in the going concern statement in the Directors’ report on page 69. 
The following accounting policies have been used consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in accordance with UK GAAP. 
Cash flow statement
The Company has taken the advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 (revised) not to disclose a cash flow statement.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less any provision for impairment. For investments in subsidiaries 
acquired for consideration, including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the 
shares issued. Any premium is ignored.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds Sterling are recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet 
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the relevant balance 
sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of non-monetary items at each balance 
sheet date are included in the profit or loss for the accounting period.
Tax
The charge for tax is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account tax deferred because of timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. Provision is made for deferred tax on all timing differences except those arising from 
the revaluation of fixed assets for which there is no binding agreement to sell on property gains if it is anticipated that rollover relief will be available 
and on the undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is 
estimated the tax will arise. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
The deferred tax provision is not discounted to net present value.
Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and then for reporting purposes are re-measured to fair value at each 
subsequent balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks. Use of such financial 
instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments 
for speculative purposes. In relation to fuel price risks, the Company’s profit and loss account is affected by transactions with affiliated companies 
that give rise to cash flow volatility associated with fuel price risk.
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Company are interest rate swaps and collars, fuel swaps and collars, and cross currency 
interest rate swaps. Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet 
date. The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by 
counterparty confirmations.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency 
hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to 
the profit and loss account for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses 
reported in the income statement.
Related party transactions
As permitted under FRS 8, Related party transactions, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption not to disclose transactions between 
Group companies.
Debt
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the deduction of issue costs. The carrying amount is increased by the amortisation 
of debt issuance fees in respect of the accounting period and reduced by repayments made in the period.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

2 (Loss)/profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. 
FirstGroup plc reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 March 2014 of £140.2m (2013: profit £65.3m).
Proposed final dividend per share for the year ended 31 March 2014 of Nil p (2013: Nil p).
Fees payable to the Company’s auditor for the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements are disclosed in note 6 on page 113. 
The Company had no employees in the current or preceding financial year.

Electronic communication
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Company to  
use electronic communication when sending information to its 
shareholders. Using electronic communications helps us reduce  
the environmental impact of our business by limiting the amount  
of paper we use and it assists us in managing our costs. We 
periodically consult with shareholders to check how they wish  
to receive information from us and a shareholder is taken to  
have agreed to website communications if a response has not  
been received.
Any document or information required to be sent to shareholders  
is made available on the Company’s website and a notification of 
availability is sent. Shareholders who receive such a notification are 
entitled to request a hard copy of the document at any time and 
may also change the way they receive communications at any time 
by contacting Equiniti.
FirstGroup plc’s policy on discounts for shareholders
Shareholders are reminded that it is not Group policy to offer travel 
or other discounts to shareholders, as they may be used only by a 
small number of individuals. The Group is focused on overall  
returns which are of benefit to all shareholders.

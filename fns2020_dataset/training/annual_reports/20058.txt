Rightmove is the marketplace for property in the UK. 
This has been built from both the consumer’s desire to 
search for property habitually with us and our leadership in 
property listings. The latter has substantially increased 
in early 2015. We are committed to the never-ending need 
to evolve and innovate to continue to drive our clear 
leadership position.
The Board and I are grateful for the confidence of our 
19,300 Agency and New Homes customers and also to our 
employees whose efforts have positioned Rightmove as the 
essential marketplace for home hunters to find their next 
home and for property advertisers to reach by far the widest 
possible audience.
Financial results
The strength of our business model and core value 
proposition underpin record financial results in 2014. 
Underlying operating profit
(1)
 was up 20% to  
£124.6m (2013: £104.0m) driven by strong organic 
revenue growth of 19% to £167.0m (2013: £139.9m) 
and continued focus on cost control. Underlying basic 
earnings per share (EPS)
(2)
 was up 24% to  
100.3p (2013: 81.0p), even greater than the percentage 
increase in profits and in part attributable to £73.9m of 
share repurchases as part of our policy of returning cash 
to shareholders.
I am pleased to present Rightmove plc’s results for the year 
ended 31 December 2014.
Rightmove has demonstrated a characteristic and 
unwavering focus on improving its market leading customer 
proposition and consumer experience. It has proven a wise 
strategy as customers continue to invest more for greater 
returns, reflecting the value of our immense and growing 
popularity with Britain’s property searching public, our 
customers’ customers.
We have built our brand over 15 years and become the 
undisputed leader in the online property marketplace by 
providing consumers with one place to search and research 
UK property and by providing our customers one place to 
reach all home hunters. We at Rightmove take no greater 
satisfaction than providing a great value service to the 
organised property industry, by connecting them to most 
vendors and home searchers efficiently and effectively. 
Rightmove is perennially ranked as one of the top ten most 
popular websites in the UK. This popularity was highlighted 
when Google identified Rightmove as the most searched 
for business in the UK in 2014. The attraction of our more 
than 15 billion and growing page impressions demonstrates 
how compelling Rightmove is to consumers and ultimately to 
our customers.

Board changes
During the past year, we welcomed Peter Williams and Rakhi 
Parekh to the Board. Peter and Rakhi have already made 
substantial contributions drawing upon their collective 
consumer and digital experience and Peter’s extensive board 
experience. During an overlapping transition period, the 
Board continued to benefit from the sage contributions of 
Jonathan Agnew and Judy Vezmar as we have for each of the 
past nine years. Having completed three terms and no longer 
deemed independent, Jonathan and Judy will not stand for 
re-election to the Board in May 2015. We are grateful for their 
insights throughout their service, perhaps most nostalgically 
during Rightmove’s early days as a public company when 
online marketing was less accepted as the norm and best 
way to reach home movers.
Outlook
Our results for 2014 show us continuing to outperform 
expectations. Based upon strong customer numbers, traffic 
and healthy growth in average spend per advertiser at the 
start of the year, the Board remains confident of continued 
success in 2015. 
Scott Forbes
Chairman
Returns to shareholders
Our commitment to return excess cash promptly to investors 
continues to be as strong as ever. Cash conversion remains 
in excess of 100% of operating profit. In 2014, we returned 
a further £103.4m (2013: £85.6m) to shareholders through 
dividends and share buybacks while retaining only 
£11.2m (2013: £6.8m) at the end of the year. This brings 
the total cash returned to shareholders since our flotation 
in March 2006 to £482.1m.
Dividend
The Board previously announced that it would increase the 
interim dividend to 13p (H1 2013: 11.0p) per ordinary share, 
which was paid on 7 November 2014. Consistent with our 
policy of increasing the total dividend for the year broadly in 
line with underlying operating profit, the Board proposes to 
pay a final dividend of 22.0p (2013: 17.0p) per ordinary share 
for a total dividend for the year of 35.0p (2013: 28.0p), an 
increase of 25%. The final dividend, subject to shareholder 
approval, will be paid on 5 June 2015 to all shareholders on 
the register on 8 May 2015.
Google identified Rightmove 
as the most searched for 
business in the UK in 2014  6  rightmove.co.uk
Our culture, of course, comes from our people and I am 
proud of the business we have built together. We strive to 
make Rightmove a great place to work and this enables us 
to attract and retain the best talent and provide the best 
service for consumers and customers. I am delighted that in 
our 2014 ‘Have Your Say’ people survey, again over 90% of 
respondents think Rightmove is a great place to work. I would 
like to thank everyone for everything they have done over the 
past year .
We have seen increased adoption of our additional 
advertising products and packages as customers invest 
more to drive their brand exposure and gain the competitive 
edge. Average revenue per advertiser (ARPA) increased by 
13% in 2014 with around 70% of the ARPA growth driven by 
customers spending more on these products and packages. 
Spending on additional products and packages now 
accounts for 40% of Agency and New Homes revenue. 
With an increase in both the number of agency offices 
and the number of new home developments, our 
membership base grew by 5% in the last 12 months. 
This, coupled with the increase in ARPA, has driven our 
significant revenue and profits growth in the year.
Business model
Rightmove is the UK’s largest property portal and operates  
a two-sided model that benefits from strong network effects. 
On the one side we have the UK’s largest and most engaged 
property audience and on the other side we have the largest 
inventory of properties from over 19,300 advertisers.
Consumers engage with Rightmove when searching and 
researching the property market and when selling or letting 
their property. Rightmove is a free consumer service that is 
compelling to buyers and renters as they can see nearly the 
whole of the market and is compelling to sellers and landlords 
as it is where nearly all buyers and renters are searching and 
researching the market. 
Rightmove’s popularity with the British home moving  
public has gone from strength to strength, as more home 
movers visited more often and spent more time on 
Rightmove than ever in 2014. Today they come to search 
and research the only marketplace with over one million 
properties in the UK.
We count nearly every agent in the UK as a customer 
and we care about all of our customers’ business success 
and focus on building strong relationships that support their 
ambitions. This approach continues to serve us well as we 
have grown our customer base by 5% during 2014 to a 
record high. 
The importance and trust in our brand was highlighted by 
figures released by Google showing that Rightmove was the 
most searched for business in the UK in 2014 and a national 
survey showing that 94%
(1)
 of home sellers expect their 
property to be marketed on Rightmove. The ubiquity of our 
brand coupled with our commitment to ongoing innovation 
has significantly increased consumer engagement. Traffic 
increased by 10% to 15.4 billion pages and consistent with 
being a multi-platform digital leader, over half of our visits 
now come from mobile devices.
On the back of this record traffic the number of leads we 
generated for our customers increased to 43 million, up 
19% on 2013 and more than double the number of leads we 
generated in 2012. Our market share of leads has increased 
and the share of sales from our leads remains at over 80% 
meaning vendors are five times more likely to find a buyer  
on Rightmove than any other website.
Our culture of restlessness has driven further 
improvement and innovation in the year. We launched 
Instant Property Alerts which alert home movers within 
minutes of a property coming to the market. We send over 
one million alerts every day and a quarter of our registered 
users with property alerts have already signed up to get 
them instantly. We also launched a number of new products, 
including Property Alert Sponsor to enable agents to 
advertise in our Property Alerts, in addition to a series of 
enhancements to our existing products.

We also have a number of smaller business units, including 
advertising overseas and commercial properties, providing 
property related data and valuation services, and providing 
a platform for property related advertisers such as mortgage 
providers and removal companies.
Our strategy 
We have a disciplined focus on the UK property advertising 
market. We focus on increasing the size and engagement 
of our audience of property consumers to provide great 
value for our customers. We focus on growing organically 
through our customers investing more in their presence on 
Rightmove and by broadening our offering to cover more of 
the consumer journey.
Our brand
Our strong brand recognition with the public and the 
simplicity of the core service we provide make Rightmove 
the public’s first choice to help them find their next home. 
Much of our success comes from the positive experience  
that home hunters have in using our services in addition to 
our considerable investment over 15 years in promoting the 
Rightmove brand.
We have continued to invest in our brand in 2014 with our 
new ‘find your happy’ campaign. The campaign plays on the 
theme that finding the ‘right’ home creates one of life’s most 
positive emotions…happiness. And there’s a happy out there 
for everyone. A ‘walk to work’ happy, a ‘close to a good 
school’ happy, a ‘smell the sea air’ happy. We are using the 
campaign to empower people to search and research homes 
on Rightmove that means they will ‘find their happy’.
Our brand building has focused on national TV , more 
recently through our partnership with Channel 4 across all of 
their property content. We also specifically target London 
through additional outdoor media, 400 Rightmove branded 
taxis and our Time Out partnership. We launched refreshed 
material at the start of 2015 across all our media, including 
national TV , building on the largest consumer themes of ‘more 
indoor space’, ‘more outdoor space’, ‘a place of my own’ 
and ‘minimal commute time’.
Our customers are primarily estate agents, lettings agents 
and new homes developers advertising properties for sale 
and to rent in the UK. We offer the most significant and 
effective exposure for their brand and properties, the largest 
source of high quality leads together with best in class tools, 
market insight and support.
Our principal sources of revenue are the monthly 
subscription fee paid by customers to advertise all their 
properties and the monthly subscription fee paid for 
additional advertising products and packages that promote 
their properties, brand and proposition more strongly.
Our model benefits from a strong network effect with the 
growth of home movers and property advertisers providing 
a ‘virtuous circle’ enhancing the Rightmove value proposition.
Our growth potential comes from continuing to realise 
the value embedded in our market leading audience through 
product innovation and pricing, helped by the ongoing 
structural shift of property advertising spend from offline 
to online with further opportunity afforded from a cyclical 
recovery in the UK housing market.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Rightmove’s position is strong when measured by traditional 
classified advertising metrics, with brand awareness close to 
90% and over ten million unique users. Our commanding 
position is revealed when one looks at how often consumers 
visit and what they do. The depth of consumers’ engagement 
with Rightmove not only leads to more consumers turning to 
Rightmove first and spending more time on Rightmove, but 
most importantly to more and better quality leads leading to 
better outcomes and value for our customers.
We have over 60% market share of visits and leads, over 
70% share of page impressions, over 80% share of sales 
generated from our leads compared to our  nearest competitor 
and over 90% of sellers expecting their property to be 
marketed on Rightmove.
Innovation
Our mission is to empower the UK’s decisions around  
property. We want to continue to be the place that consumers 
turn to first and engage with the most when searching and 
researching property to ensure we are the brand they insist on.
To that end, in addition to our ongoing investment in our 
brand, we continue to innovate and invest in our market 
leading desktop, mobile and tablet platforms to deliver the 
most engaging experience for consumers. Our focus is on 
having the largest, most up to date and accurate property 
inventory in the UK coupled with the best search and research 
capability and fastest property alerts.
We are the most up to date site and over one third of  
our agents are now using the real-time data feed, which we 
built last year and has become the industry standard, to get 
their vendors’ properties onto Rightmove immediately. To 
complement this we launched Instant Property Alerts to alert 
consumers within minutes of a property coming to market. 
Via Property Alerts alone, we have 1.4 million highly engaged 
subscribers to whom we delivered over a quarter of a billion 
property alerts in 2014.
We serve by far the most pages of property pricing 
information in the UK and we have an opportunity to grow this 
advantage further by extending our offering to consumers 
researching the market. We added our popular ‘Sold Prices’ 
functionality to our mobile and tablet platforms in 2014. 
This functionality is unique in that it matches our unrivalled 
catalogue of current and archived properties, containing over 
two billion property images, to Land Registry sold prices.
We also launched a new ‘Market Info’ section to help 
consumers better understand their local market. In the first 
month alone this new content was viewed over two million 
times. Looking forward, our innovation lab is launching a 
new valuation app early in 2015. 
The infrastructure that underpins Rightmove is critical 
to our success and in 2014 the team achieved an enviable 
99.995% for availability and a webpage load time of 
just over one second which is twice the speed of our 
nearest competitor.
Competitive edge
We want to offer the most significant and effective exposure 
for our customers’ brands and properties, be the largest 
source of high quality leads and empower our customers’ 
decisions through best in class tools, market insight 
and support.
In addition to the valuation opportunities within the 
43 million leads we generated, over 70,000 individual  
home sellers used our Local Valuation Alert product to 
request a valuation directly from their local agents.
We launched an upgrade to our popular market 
intelligence tools under the banner of ‘Rightmove Intel’ to 
provide further insight into local markets for our agents and 
ensure they have the competitive edge. Drawing on the 
most comprehensive dataset available, Rightmove Intel 
builds on our existing set of tools which are used by 90% of 
our customers who generate over half a million reports using 
these tools every month.

We care about our customers’ business success and building 
strong relationships is vital in order to support their ambitions. 
We are spending more time with customers than ever before 
as we expand and segment our account management team 
and increase their efficiency through better sales and 
administrative tools and back-office support. We have also 
provided more training and introduced new tools to facilitate 
better conversations with customers.
We refreshed our ever popular seminar programme 
focusing on the 21st century home mover, their digital 
footprint, and how agents can use Rightmove to better 
identify and understand the consumer and their evolving 
property-related needs. We ran over 25 seminars across the 
country for more than 2,000 participants and also introduced 
more specialised content in the form of webinars. Already in 
2015 we’ve run six seminars across the country from Torquay 
to Inverness.
Other businesses
Our overseas homes advertising business has grown strongly 
with customer numbers up 70% in the year to over 2,000. 
Audience figures set new records with over 80 million 
overseas searches, up 33% on last year. Rightmove now has 
170,000 overseas homes advertised for sale, an increase of 
over 50% compared to a year ago.
Our commercial property advertising business has 
established itself as the UK’s largest commercial property site 
with over 45,000 properties advertised and close to 70 million 
commercial searches in 2014, up 75% on last year.
Our data services business continues to grow as we help 
a wide range of customers, including banks and surveyors 
to leverage Rightmove’s UK property database, which is the 
largest of its kind covering nearly two-thirds of the UK owner 
occupied and privately rented housing stock.
Current trading and outlook
The outlook for the UK online property advertising market 
remains positive as consumers and customers become ever 
more digital and the market continues to shift from traditional 
advertising channels. We are well positioned to benefit from 
this transition due to our market leading position which is 
strengthening on both sides of the network.
Our customers choose to spend money with Rightmove 
based on the value we deliver. We are delighted that nearly  
every agent in the UK has chosen to remain on Rightmove 
following the recent launch of a new entrant, OnTheMarket.com, 
cementing Rightmove as the best property advertising option in 
the UK. As at the end of February customer numbers were 
unchanged from our record year end position.
With our market leading position strengthening, average 
spend per advertiser continuing to grow and record January 
traffic numbers, the Board remains confident of making 
further progress in growing the business organically in 2015 
and beyond.

Share-based payments and National Insurance (NI)
In accordance with IFRS 2, a non-cash charge of £2.7m 
(2013: £2.4m) is included in profit or loss representing the 
amortisation of the fair value of share-based incentives 
granted, including Sharesave options.
NI is being accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8% 
on the potential employee gain on share-based incentives 
granted. Based on a year on year reduction in the closing 
share price at 31 December 2014 from £27.40 to £22.48 
in respect of the outstanding share-based incentives 
granted, together with the actual NI cost on share-based 
incentives exercised in the year, there is a credit of 
£0.2m (2013: charge of £4.5m).
Taxation
The consolidated tax rate for the year ended 
31 December 2014 was 21.2% (2013: 23.4%).  
The effective tax rate was lower than the UK enacted 
rate of 21.5% due to research and development relief 
claimed in relation to previous years.
We are committed to being a responsible tax payer 
acting in a straightforward and open manner in all tax 
matters. The total tax payable in respect of 2014 was 
£66.2m (2013: £73.5m). £28.6m (2013: £20.2m) related 
to corporation tax and Employers NI borne by the 
Group while the remaining £37.6m (2013: £53.3m) was 
collected in respect of payroll taxes and VAT. 
Earnings per share (EPS)
Underlying basic EPS
(2)
 increased by 24% to 100.3p 
(2013: 81.0p). Basic EPS increased by 32% to 97.7p  
(2013: 74.1p). The growth in EPS was driven by the increase 
in profitability in the year together with the benefit from our 
continued share buyback programme which reduced the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to 
98.4m (2013: 100.3m).
Revenue
Revenue grew strongly in 2014 up 19% to £167.0m  
(2013: £139.9m). Our Agency business was the main 
contributor to the revenue growth with a year on year increase  
of £22.3m (2013: £14.9m), up over 20%. Whilst we experienced 
a pleasing 4% growth in Agency customer numbers, helped 
by a better UK housing market, the majority of the revenue 
increase has come from ARPA growth, primarily through 
discretionary sales of additional advertising products together 
with increases to core membership prices. Agency continues to 
be by far our largest business contributing 78% (2013: 77%) of 
our total revenue.
Revenue from our New Homes business grew by 9% to 
£26.4m (2013: £24.2m). Growth was primarily driven by the 
sale of additional advertising products and by increases to 
core membership prices; revenue was less impacted by the 
increase in the number of developers, as the gain in developer 
numbers was weighted to the second half of the year. 
Other revenue across our data services, overseas, 
commercial and non-property advertising streams increased 
by £2.6m to £11.0m (2013: £8.4m), constituting 7% 
(2013: 6%) of our total revenue in the year. 
Underlying operating profit
Underlying operating profit

 for the

74.6% (2013: 74.3%).
 This was driven by continued strong revenue growth 
coupled with a slightly lower percentage increase in 
underlying operating costs
(1)
. Underlying operating costs
(1)
 
increased by £6.4m to £42.4m (2013: £36.0m). £2.4m of the 
increase related to salary costs attributable to general wage 
inflation and an increased average headcount of 388  
(2013: 349), up 11% reflecting investment in both sales and 
technical staff during the year and the full year impact of staff 
recruited during 2013. Marketing spend also increased by 
£2.7m year on year as we continued to invest in promoting 
the Rightmove brand. 
Rightmove continues to see 
strong cash generation and 
to return all the free cash 
generated to shareholders.

Strategic report | Financial review continued 16  rightmove.co.uk
Strategic report | Financial review continued
During 2014, £73.9m was invested in the repurchase of  
our own shares (2013: £60.5m) whilst a further £29.5m  
(2013: £25.1m) was paid in dividends reflecting the 
 increased final dividend for 2013 and the 2p increase in  
the interim dividend this year. This brings the total cash 
returned to shareholders in the year to £103.4m and 
£482.1m since our flotation in March 2006.
The closing Group cash balance for the year was  
£11.2m (2013: £6.8m).
Going concern
The Group entered into a 12 month agreement with HSBC for 
a £10.0m committed revolving loan facility on 10 February 2014. 
This agreement has been extended for a further 12 months 
and will expire on 9 February 2016. To date no amount has 
been drawn under this facility. During the year £103.4m of 
cash was returned to shareholders.
The Board is confident that with the existing cash resources 
and banking facilities in place, coupled with the strength of the 
underlying business model, the Group and the Company will 
remain cash positive and will have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Board’s priorities for the use of cash continue to be: 
investment in the business; payment of dividends; and the 
return of cash to shareholders via share buybacks. The Board 
believes that the future working capital and capital expenditure 
requirements of the business will continue to be low and that 
the business will be in a position to return surplus cash to 
shareholders during 2015 through a combination of dividends 
and share buybacks.

(2)  Before share-based payments charge of £2,728,000 (2013: £2,408,000) and 
NI credit of £194,000 (2013: £4,538,000 charge) on share-based incentives 
and no related adjustment for tax. 
Balance sheet
Rightmove’s balance sheet at 31 December 2014 reflects 
total equity of £2.4m (2013: £8.9m) reflecting the continuing 
return of capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks 
and dividends during the year.
In line with stronger revenue, trade receivables increased 
by 14% to £21.8m (2013: £19.1m). Trade and other payables 
increased by £2.6m to £27.6m (2013: £25.0m) principally  
due to an increase in deferred revenue. Our deferred tax 
asset, representing future tax benefits from share-based 
incentives, is lower at £4.5m (2013: £5.6m) due to a lower 
potential tax benefit being recognised in relation to 
outstanding share-based incentives as a result of the  
decline in the year on year share price.
Cash flow 
Rightmove continues to see strong cash generation and 
to return all the free cash generated to shareholders. 
Predictable cash flows reflect the subscription nature of the 
business coupled with low working capital requirements. 
Cash generated from operating activities was £125.4m 
(2013: £99.2m) representing an operating cash conversion 
in excess of 100%.
Tax payments increased to £17.1m (2013: £16.1m) and 
£0.1m (2013: £0.1m) was paid in relation to bank charges 
and facility fees resulting in net cash from operating activities 
of £108.2m (2013: £83.0m).
Capital expenditure was in line with last year at £1.1m 
(2013: £1.1m) reflecting ongoing investment in our  
website infrastructure. 
Proceeds of £0.2m (2013: £3.7m) were received on the 
exercise of share-based incentives and £0.9m was applied to 
purchase shares to fund the Rightmove Share Incentive Plan 
which was introduced in January 2015. Rightmove plc annual report 2014      17

 Description Impact Monitoring and mitigation
Change from 
prior year
UK housing market downturn
•  Substantially fewer housing 
transactions than the norm may 
lead to a reduction in the number 
of agent branches or new homes 
developments
•  Reduction in the size of the UK 
property advertising market 
leading to fewer customers
Underperformance as the number of 
agents and new homes developments 
are a major determinant of Rightmove’s 
revenue
•  Monitoring of housing market leading 
indicators and trends in Rightmove 
membership
•  Rentals advertising is counter-cyclical 
and mitigates recessionary 
decreases in estate agency revenue
•    Cost reduction resulting from selling 
and servicing fewer customers
•  Developing revenue streams in 
related and adjacent markets
Competition
•  Increased competition from 
existing entrants
•  Increased competition from 
new entrants including 
OnTheMarket.com, which 
launched in January 2015 
and requires its members to 
list on a maximum of only 
one other portal

Our people
Our people are our most highly valued asset, they are critical to 
our success and our growth. We are proud of our people and 
the mixture of talent and experience that they bring. We depend 
on their skills and commitment to achieve our objectives.
Our cultural style is open and honest. We invest in  
ensuring that all employees understand Rightmove’s core 
values and goals. We achieve this through a combination of  
a rigorous selection process, including technical skills testing, 
an off-site residential course to ensure all ‘Rightmovers’ 
understand our core values, ongoing coaching and mentoring, 
and cross-functional team building events involving all 
employees. Given the specialised technical nature of the work 
we do and the services we provide, we also support ongoing 
external professional development where appropriate.
We encourage employee involvement and place emphasis 
on keeping employees informed of the Group’s activities via 
bi-monthly staff forums and business performance updates 
with senior management and quarterly sales conferences.  
In 2014 we held a Company day, which allowed the whole 
Company to get together and enjoy a day of business 
updates, team building and inspirational speakers. 
During 2014, our employee recognition scheme, which is 
based around ‘the Rightmove behaviours’ which reflect our 
unique blend of values and ways of working and which is an 
opportunity to nominate colleagues who have demonstrated 
these behaviours in action, continued to prove popular with up 
to eight awards presented every two months at our bi-monthly 
staff forums.
As a result of last year’s ‘Have your Say’ people survey 
feedback, our employee appraisal process was reviewed and 
updated with new continual feedback sessions introduced in 
their place, which provide a dynamic culture of personal 
development. All employees received training on how to use 
the new feedback process in order to gain the maximum 
impact from it. Also as a result of the 2013 survey feedback, 
we carried out a refreshment of the activities and content  
of our off-site residential course concentrating on providing 
people related activities to develop positive working 
relationships, which can be carried forward from the course 
into a work environment. 
The careers section of our Corporate website continues to 
provide a successful direct approach to recruiting great people 
to Rightmove. We have received positive feedback that the 
site provides a useful insight into our business for those 
looking to join us. 
We offer all employees a range of additional benefits, which 
continue to help us both attract and retain staff. Rightmovers 
are made aware of these benefits through our induction 
process and intranet. 
In 2014 we complied with new pension auto enrolment 
regulations, certifying the Rightmove Group stakeholder 
pension plan and auto enrolling those employees not already 
members of the plan. We communicated auto enrolment  
by holding employee seminars and offering the opportunity  
for one to one briefings with external benefits advisers.  
We have been delighted to have had very low opt out rates  
and currently 91% of employees are now members of the 
pension plan. 
We also offer private healthcare complimented by a cash 
plan scheme. In November 2014, the Company’s sixth 
Sharesave contract matured allowing employees to benefit 
from the success of the Group over the last three years. 60% 
of our employees currently participate in the Sharesave Plan.
Strategic report | Corporate responsibility 20  rightmove.co.uk
We recognise that a diverse workforce will provide a wide 
array of perspectives that promote innovation and business 
success and drawing on what is unique about individuals 
adds value to the way we do business and helps us anticipate 
and provide what our customers want from us. 
Our gender diversity throughout the Group remains  
strong especially at the Director level for the year ended  
31 December 2014, with one out of three executive directors 
being female. Our female representation on the Board 
increased during the year to 30%, with the appointment of 
a third female Board member as a non-executive director 
in July 2014, although this number will reduce to 25% as 
various Board changes take place in 2015 as detailed in  
the Chairman’s Statement on page 5. 
Having made substantial progress with gender diversity at 
Board level, the Board continues to focus on the next level of 
senior management in order to develop potential within this 
team to step up to Board level at the appropriate time and to 
identify and develop potential within the wider organisation 
with a view to strengthening the female representation within 
the senior management team. In 2014, 28% (2013:14%) of 
our senior management team were female. 
A breakdown by gender of the number of persons who 
were directors of Rightmove, senior managers and other 
employees as at 31 December 2014, is set out below:
Human rights
Whilst Rightmove does not have a specific human rights 
policy, it does have policies such as Equal Opportunities and 
Anti-bribery policy that adhere to internationally proclaimed 
human rights principles. 
In November 2014, we introduced the Rightmove Share 
Incentive Plan with an award of 100 free shares to all 
qualifying employees in January 2015, as a thankyou for all 
the hard work and dedication shown over the last few years 
of the Rightmove journey. 
We offer flexible working arrangements, supporting part 
time working and reduced hours to allow our employees to 
balance their work and family commitments. 
As it’s important to us to know what our employees think 
and having received such valuable feedback last year, we ran 
our annual ‘Have your Say’ people survey, with 94% of 
respondents saying Rightmove is a great place to work and 
96% of respondents committed to making a real contribution 
to the success of Rightmove.
In 2014 we celebrated 18 people being at Rightmove for 
10 years or more and in 2015, 20 more people will reach 10 
years’ service, figures which back up our impressive people 
survey results.
Equality and diversity 
Rightmove has a strong commitment to equality of 
opportunity in all our employment policies, practices and 
procedures. We take a proactive approach throughout our 
recruitment and selection process to ensure that we attract, 
hire and retain a diverse and talented workforce and this is 
kept under close and regular scrutiny. No existing or potential 
employee will receive less favourable treatment due to their 
race, creed, nationality, colour, ethnic origin, age, religion or 
similar belief, connections with a national minority, sexual 
orientation, gender, gender reassignment, marital status, 
member or membership of a trade union, disability, or any 
other classification as prescribed by law.

Charitable activity
We continue to encourage all our employees to devote time 
and fundraising efforts to charitable causes of particular 
importance to them as individuals. During 2014 many of  
our staff have been active in raising money or supporting 
fundraising activities across a wide range of charities for 
which Rightmove matches the donations raised.
Our employees are also able to donate directly from  
their monthly salary to any charity or recognised good  
cause registered within the UK through the Charities  
Trust. This provides a tax efficient means of giving. 
In 2014, in conjunction with Agents Giving, we launched a 
charitable sponsorship fund where we contribute to the costs 
of setting up a charitable activity carried out by our 
customers, for example paying for the kit to be used at  
a charity football match. This allows for more of the money 
raised by our customers to go directly to the charity they are 
fundraising for. We have put aside a fund of £100,000 to 
support customer initiatives via Agents Giving of which 
£10,000 was contributed in 2014. To date the related fund 
raising activities by our customers will raise over £100,000 
for UK charities. 
Environment
Rightmove actively considers its environmental impact and 
we are conscious of playing our part in tackling climate 
change. Traditional ways of finding a home tend to involve 
large amounts of paper and printing, whether in the form of 
newspaper advertising, property particulars mailed to 
applicants through the post or leaflet drops by agents. 
Rightmove reduces the need for print media and the 
environmental damage that goes with it. Rightmove takes 
care to design the layout of property particulars to reduce the 
total number of pages that need to be printed out in those 
cases where a home hunter does want a physical copy.
Enhanced information on properties also reduces the  
amount of time home hunters waste in visiting properties  
that rapidly turn out to be inappropriate. As a high proportion 
of viewings involve a car journey, any reduction in wasted 
viewings has an environmental benefit. Rightmove has 
worked hard to increase the number and size of photographs 
of each property, improved the size and added functionality 
to property floor plans and has introduced more 
comprehensive map searches and aerial photographs 
which help home hunters to identify the specific location 
of a property. Rightmove has added information on which 
schools are closest to the properties listed and the 
Broadband speed for the area, all of which combined, 
provides high quality information about properties, to reduce 
the carbon footprint generated by prospective buyers 
making wasted journeys. 
The rightmove.co.uk website includes functionality for our 
customers to display Energy Performance Certificates which 
allow prospective buyers to evaluate the energy efficiency  
of a property they are considering buying and to identify 
opportunities to improve the energy efficiency once they  
have purchased the property.
As an internet-based Group with most staff employed  
in two office locations, we believe our own environmental 
footprint is small. We encourage our staff to take steps to 
address our environmental responsibilities. For instance,  
we continue to operate recycling schemes which were  22  rightmove.co.uk
Group but that occur at sources owned or controlled by  
other entities. 
Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions controlled by the 
Group arising from Company cars, which whilst leased, we 
are responsible for the emissions and therefore we report 
these under Scope 1.
Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions attributable to the 
Group due to its consumption of purchased electricity.
Scope 3 emissions: Other indirect emissions associated 
with activities that support or supply the Group’s operations, 
we include emissions arising from our third party run  
data centres.
The Group is required to report Scope 1 and 2 emissions for 
its reporting year to 31 December 2014. Scope 3 is not yet 
mandatory, however the Group has again chosen to report 
Scope 3 emissions as it relates to electricity used in data 
centres, in which the Group rents space to house and 
operate various servers, which host our website platforms.

established in consultation with local authorities and recycling 
partners. All waste bins were removed from the desks in our 
London and Milton Keynes offices which encourages and 
increases the amount of recycling we do. 
As an operator of an online property portal, the main 
environmental impact is the power usage of our data centres. 
Our procurement policy is to purchase hardware with the  
best computational performance which uses the least 
electrical power. 
We encourage our employees to use alternatives to car  
travel, by promoting the use of public transport in particular 
when travelling between our two office locations and by 
encouraging participation in our Cycle to Work scheme. 
As an online business, our culture emphasises a paperless 
environment. We also recognise that our responsibilities do 
not stop with how we operate internally; we encourage all our 
customers, business partners and suppliers not to 
unnecessarily print out emails sent by us in the signature of  
all our emails. We also continue to focus on streamlining 
processes and replacing paper-based services with online 
services and communications, wherever possible. Steps 
introduced in recent years include e-communications to 
shareholders and online customer membership forms and 
product documentation.
Greenhouse gas reporting
Since 1 October 2013, the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 has required 
all UK quoted companies to report on their greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, which are classified as either direct or 
indirect and which are divided further into Scope 1, Scope 2 
and Scope 3 emissions.
Direct GHG emissions are emissions from sources that are 
owned or controlled by Rightmove. Indirect GHG emissions 
are emissions that are a consequence of the activities of the 
Strategic report | Corporate responsibility continued Rightmove plc annual report 2014      23
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
We do not have responsibility for any emission sources that 
are not included in the above information. 
Health and safety
The Group considers the effective management of health and 
safety to be an integral part of managing its business. During 
2014, we continued our fire safety, first aid and work place 
safety training. The Group’s ongoing policy on health and 
safety is to provide adequate control of the health and safety 
risks arising from work activities, through further consultation 
with, and training of, employees, the provision and 
maintenance of plant and equipment, safe handling and use 
of all substances and the prevention of accidents and causes 
of ill health.
Emissions have also been calculated using an ‘intensity 
metric’, which will enable the Group to monitor how well we 
are controlling emissions on an annual basis, independent of 
fluctuations in the levels of their activity. As Rightmove is a 
‘people’ business, the most suitable metric is ‘Emissions per 
Employee’, based on the average number of employees 
during the year. The Group’s emissions per employee are 
shown in the table below.

Emissions per employee remain broadly the same year  
on year. We will continue to monitor and look for ways to 
improve energy efficiency. As we meet the qualification 
criteria for the Government’s Energy Savings Opportunity 
Scheme (ESOS) we will be required to carry out a mandatory 
energy assessment during 2015 and this will help us to 
identify any areas of potential improvement.
Methodology 
We have reported on all of the emission sources required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. We have used the 
GHG’s Protocol’s Operational Control consolidation method.  24  rightmove.co.uk

Introduction 
The following sections explain how the Company applies 
the main provisions set out in the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code, (the Code) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC), as required by the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and meets the 
relevant information provisions of the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules of the FCA.
The statement of corporate governance covers the following 
areas:
• The structure and role of the Board and its committees;
•  Relations with the Company’s shareholders and the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM); and 
•  The reports of the Audit Committee and Nomination 
Committee including Board effectiveness and evaluation.
The report of the Remuneration Committee is set out separately 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 52.
The Group’ s risk management and internal control framework 
and the principal risks and uncertainties are described on 
pages 17 and 34 to 35. The Directors’ Report on pages 37 to 
39 also contains information required to be included in this 
Statement of corporate governance.
Statement of compliance
The Code sets out the principles and provisions relating to 
good governance of UK listed companies. We are pleased 
to confirm, that for the year under review, the Group has 
complied fully with the principles and provisions of the Code.
Further information on the Code can be found on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk
The Board’s role
The Board is collectively responsible to shareholders for the 
overall direction and control of the Group and has the powers 
and duties set out in the relevant laws of England and Wales 
and the Company’s Articles of Association. The Board 
delegates certain matters to the Board committees and 
delegates the detailed implementation of matters approved 
by the Board and the day to day operational aspects of the 
business to the executive directors. The Board’s main 
responsibilities and the key actions carried out during the 
year are set out below: Rightmove plc annual report 2014      27

Incentive Plan 
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters 
requiring specific approval. 
These include:
• The approval of the annual business plan; 
• Review of Group strategy;
• Changes to the Group’s capital structure; 
• Approval of the dividend policy;
• Acquisitions and disposals;
• Appointment and removal of officers of the Company; 
•  Approval of annual and half-year results and shareholder 
communications; and
• System of internal control and risk management.
The Board normally schedules seven or eight meetings each 
year although meetings can be scheduled at short notice 
at the request of any director, if required. In addition to formal 
Board meetings, there is regular informal dialogue between 
all directors.
The Board receives meeting papers sufficiently in advance 
of the meetings to allow time for review and consideration of 
the documents beforehand. If any director has a concern 
about any aspect of the business conducted at any Board 
meeting, the Company Secretary shall discuss this with the 
director concerned and record their concern or comments 
in the Board minutes. The Board receives monthly 
management and financial reports on the operational and 
financial performance of the business setting out actual and 
forecast financial performance against approved budgets 
in addition to other key performance indicators. The Board 
also receives copies of broker reports and press releases 
relating to the Group. 
Board committees
The Board has established three principal committees, 
the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and 
the Nomination Committee, to assist it in the execution of its 
duties. The chairman of each committee provides a report 
or update of each meeting of the respective committee to 
the Board at the subsequent Board meeting.
The Committees’ terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s corporate website, plc.rightmove.co.uk or by 
request from the Company Secretary.
Each of the Committees is authorised, at the Company’s 
expense, to obtain legal or other professional advice to assist 
in carrying out its duties. No person other than a Committee 
member is entitled to attend the meetings of these 
Committees, except by invitation of the Chairman of that 
Committee. 
Current membership of the Committees is shown on 
page 30. The composition of these Committees is reviewed 
regularly, taking into consideration the recommendations of 
the Nomination Committee (refer page 28 for further planned 
changes in 2015).  28  rightmove.co.uk

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Division of responsibilities
The posts of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and there are clear written guidelines to support their division 
of responsibilities. The key responsibilities of the Board members are summarised below:
Chairman • The leadership and governance of the Board;
•  Ensuring its effectiveness by creating and managing constructive relationships between  
the executive and non-executive directors;
•  Ensures there is ongoing and effective communication between the Board and its key 
shareholders; and
•  With the assistance of the Company Secretary, setting the Board’s agenda and ensuring that 
adequate time is available for discussions and that the Board receives sufficient, pertinent, 
timely and clear information.
Chief Executive Officer •  Responsible for the day to day management of the Group;
•  Responsible for the operations and results of the Group;
•  Developing the Group’s objectives and strategy and following Board approval, the successful 
execution of strategy;
•  Responsible for the effective and ongoing communication with shareholders; and
• Chairing the Executive Committee.
Non-executive directors •  Constructively challenge the executive directors; and
•  Monitor the delivery of the strategy within the risk and control framework set by the Board.
The non-executive directors bring wide and varied commercial experience and independent 
judgement to the Board and the Committees’ deliberations.
 
The breadth of management, financial and listed company experience of the non-executive 
directors is described in the biographical details on pages 24 and 25 and demonstrates a range 
of business expertise that provides the right mix of skills and experience given the size of  
the Group.
Senior Independent Director • Acting in an advisory capacity to the Chairman;
• Deputising for the Chairman if required;
• Serving as an intermediary for other directors when necessary;
•  Being available to shareholders if they have concerns which they have not been able to 
resolve through the normal channels of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or other 
executive directors for which such contact is inappropriate; and
•  Conducting an annual review of the performance of the Chairman and, in the event it should 
be necessary, convening a meeting of the non-executive directors.
Company Secretary • Monitoring compliance with appropriate Board procedures; 
• Advising the Board on corporate governance matters;
•  Assisting the Chairman in ensuring that all the directors have full and timely access to relevant 
information; and
•  Assisting the Chairman by organising induction and training programmes.
In addition to her duties as Company Secretary to the Board, the Company Secretary also acts 
as Secretary to the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is one of the matters reserved  
for the Board. 30  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Corporate governance report continued
Board diversity 
We are committed to a Board comprised of directors from 
different backgrounds, diverse and relevant experience, 
perspectives, skills and knowledge. We believe that diversity, 
including gender diversity, amongst directors contributes 
towards a high performing and effective Board. We strive to 
maintain the optimal balance.
We have made further progress in terms of gender diversity, 
with 28% (2013: 14%) of women now filling senior management 
positions across the Group. As at 31 December 2014, 30% 
(2013: 25%) of Board members were female and the Board was 
therefore aligned with the minimum target representation level to 
be achieved by 2015, as recommended by the Davies Review.
Board independence 
The Code provides that the Board should identify in the 
Annual Report each non-executive director that it considers to 
be independent. That is, to determine whether the director is 
independent in character and judgement and whether there 
are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, 
or could appear to affect, the director’s judgement.
The Board reviews non-executive director independence 
on an annual basis taking into account such factors as their 
contribution to unbiased and independent debate during 
meetings. The Board considers that there is an appropriate 
balance between the executive (33%) and non-executive 
directors (67%) and that all non-executive directors are fully 
independent of management and independent in character 
and judgement. 
To safeguard their independence, a director is not entitled 
to vote on any matter in which they may be conflicted or have 
a personal interest. Where necessary, directors are required to 
absent themselves from a meeting of the Board while such 
matters are being discussed. In cases of doubt, the Chairman 
of the Board is responsible for determining whether a conflict 
of interest exists. 
Neither the Chairman nor the executive directors hold any 
other non-executive directorships or commitments requiring 
disclosure under the Code.

Re-election to the Board
Directors are appointed and may be removed in accordance 
with the Articles of Association of the Company and the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. All directors are 
subject to election at the first AGM following their appointment 
and to re-election at intervals of no more than three years in 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. 
However, following changes to the Code, all directors, other 
than Jonathan Agnew and Judy Vezmar who are retiring, will 
seek re-election at the 2015 AGM, in accordance with the 
Code provision B.7.1.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Any director’s absence from Board meetings or meetings of 
the Remuneration, Audit or Nomination Committees was 
previously agreed with the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer or the Chairman of the relevant committee.
In addition to the above meetings, the Chairman conducts 
meetings with the non-executive directors without the 
executive directors being present when required. Jonathan 
Agnew, the Senior Independent Director, chaired a meeting  
of the Board at which the performance of the Chairman was 
also reviewed (without the presence of the Chairman).
Indemnification of directors
The Articles of Association of the Company allow for a 
qualifying third party indemnity provision between the 
Company and its directors and officers, which remains in  
force at the date of this report. The Group has also arranged 
directors’ and officers’ insurance cover in respect of legal 
action against the directors. Neither our indemnity nor the 
insurance provides cover in the event that a director is proven 
to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently.
The Group has written policies in compliance with an 
internal code of securities dealings in relation to the process 
and timing for dealing in shares, which is equivalent to the 
Model Code published in the Listing Rules. The Code applies 
to all directors, other persons discharging managerial 
responsibility and other relevant employees.
Shareholder relations
The Board is accountable to shareholders for the performance 
and activities of the Company and welcomes the opportunities 
to engage with shareholders.
Within the terms of the regulatory framework, the 
Company has conducted regular dialogue with institutional 
shareholders through ongoing meetings with institutional 
investors and research firms to discuss strategy, operating 
performance and financial performance. Contact in the UK 
is principally with the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance 
Director. The Chairman attends certain investor meetings in 
the UK and typically participates in the USA investor meetings. 
The Senior Independent Director, is also available to 
shareholders if they wish to supplement their communication, 
or if contact through the normal channels is inappropriate.
The Board is kept informed of the views and opinions of 
those with an interest in the Company through reports from 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance Director, as well  
as reports from the Company’s joint brokers, UBS and Numis.
Shareholders are also kept up to date with the Group’s 
activities through the half year results statement and Annual 
Report and the investor relations section of its website, at 
plc.rightmove.co.uk, which provides details of all the directors, 
latest news including financial results, investor presentations 
and Stock Exchange announcements. 
Annual General Meeting
The AGM is an opportunity for shareholders to vote on certain 
aspects of the Company’s business, and to ask questions 
of the directors, who will also be available for discussions 
with shareholders prior to and after the meeting. The AGM 
will be held on 7 May 2015 at the offices of UBS Limited at 
100 Liverpool Street, London, EC2M 2RH.
The Company will arrange for the Annual Report and 
related papers to be available on the Company’s corporate 
website at plc.rightmove.co.uk or posted to shareholders 
(where requested) so as to allow at least 20 working days for 
consideration before the AGM. 
The Company also complies with the Code with the 
separation of all resolutions put to the vote of shareholders. 
The Company proactively encourages shareholders to vote  
at general meetings by providing electronic voting for 
shareholders who hold their shares through the Crest system 
and provides personalised proxy cards to ensure that all votes 
are clearly identifiable. The Company presently takes votes  
at general meetings on a show of hands on the grounds of 
practicality due to the limited number of shareholders in 
attendance. Votes are taken by a poll at any shareholder 
meeting where legally required. All proxy votes are counted 
and the level of proxy votes including abstentions lodged  
for each resolution are reported after each resolution and 
published on the Company’s website. 32  rightmove.co.uk

Audit Committee report
Ashley Martin
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Dear shareholder
The Audit Committee (the Committee) is an essential part of 
Rightmove’s governance framework to which the Board has 
delegated oversight of the Group’s financial reporting, internal 
controls and compliance and the quality of the external audit 
process. The Committee also regularly reviews and considers 
the requirement for an internal audit function within the Group. 
In addition to our normal activities set out below, the 
Committee has in 2014, focused on business continuity and 
cyber risk including a review of the Disaster Recovery and 
Business Continuity Plan for our Milton Keynes office, a 
discussion of the results of a Cyber Maturity Assessment 
performed by KPMG LLP (KPMG) and the approval of 
updated Information and System Security Policies designed 
to protect our knowledge and intellectual property. In 2015 
this work will be extended to include a review of the London 
office Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan.
Historically, the Committee has assessed that the need for 
an internal audit function would be of limited benefit, given the 
simplicity of the Group structure, the simple financial model 
and strong system of internal controls. However, in addition to 
the assurance obtained from management and the external 
auditors, the Committee has increasingly over the past few 
years obtained extended assurance from work performed by 
external consultants in certain specialist risk areas. 
As Rightmove continues to grow and expand the breadth 
of its service offering, the Committee has recommended to  
the Board that for 2015, it now transitions to an outsourced 
internal audit function to be known as ‘Rightmove Assurance’. 
The decision to fully outsource has been made on the basis 
that it will be more cost effective, provide access to a greater 
depth of expertise covering a broad range of risks and will 
also be scalable allowing Rightmove to increase resource as 
and when required.
During November and December 2014 we conducted  
a tender process for these services, and in December 
confirmed the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(PwC) as the service provider for Rightmove Assurance. PwC 
will perform an initial two year cycle of work commencing in 
January 2015, focusing on both core financial processes and 
controls and specialist reviews of key risk areas.
This report provides an overview of the work of the Committee 
and details how it has discharged its duties during the year.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions 
about the work of the Audit Committee.
Ashley Martin
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Composition and attendance at meetings
Committee members Number of meetings attended
Ashley Martin (Chairman of the Committee) 5 out of 5
Judy Vezmar 5 out of 5
Jonathan Agnew 5 out of 5
The Committee is comprised entirely of independent 
non-executive directors, the biographical details which 
can be found on pages 24 to 25. The Board is satisfied that 
Ashley Martin has recent and relevant financial skills and 
experience necessary to fulfill his role as Chairman of 
the Committee. 
The Finance Director and the Head of Finance are  
normally invited to attend the meetings as well as the external 
auditor, KPMG. Other relevant people from the business  
are also invited to attend certain meetings in order to  
provide a deeper level of insight into certain key issues  
and developments. During the year Peter Williams and 
Rakhi Parekh, non-executive directors, attended three 
meetings and one meeting by invitation, respectively. 
The Committee regularly meets separately with the external 
auditors without others being present.
The quorum for meetings of the Committee is two members. 
Appointments to the Committee are for a period of up to three 
years, extendable by no more than two additional three year 
periods, so long as members continue to be independent.
Principal activities of the Committee during the year
The principal activities of the Committee through the year,  
and the manner in which it discharged its responsibilities  
were as follows:
Financial reporting
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial 
reporting is to review with both management and the external 
auditor the appropriateness of the half year results statement 
and the Annual Report and financial statements including, 
amongst other matters: Rightmove plc annual report 2014      33
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
•  The quality and appropriateness of accounting policies  
and practices;
•  The clarity of the disclosures and compliance with relevant 
financial reporting standards and governance reporting 
requirements;
•  Key accounting issues or matters in which significant 
judgements have been applied; and
•  Whether the Annual Report and accounts taken as a  
whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provide  
the information necessary for shareholders to assess  
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
At the request of the Board, the Committee was asked to 
consider whether the 2014 Annual Report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and 
capable of being understood by shareholders, and has 
concluded that this is the case. 
The significant areas of judgement considered by the 
Committee in relation to the 2014 Annual Report and how 
these were addressed were:
Revenue recognition
The timing of revenue recognition in relation to the billing of 
subscription fees and additional products and services and 
the accounting for any membership offers to customers with 
discounted or free periods. This was a prime area of audit focus 
with KPMG performing detailed analytical procedures using 
computer assisted audit techniques throughout the year on 
amounts billed to the two largest customer groups (Agency and 
New Homes), investigating any anomalies and outliers identified 
and providing detailed reporting to the Committee in this regard. 
The Committee discussed any reported anomalies 
highlighted by KPMG ensuring that adequate explanations 
were received from management in line with their business 
understanding.
In addition the Committee received regular updates from 
management discussing current customer offers and their 
impact on revenue recognition. 
Share-based incentives and the related deferred  
tax balances
It is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee to 
address, and report upon, compensation matters including 
share-based incentives granted to directors and employees  
of the Group. However, the Committee considers in its review 
of the financial statements the measurement and accounting 
treatment relating to such schemes as more fully explained  
in Note 24 to the accounts due to the choice of valuation 
method and judgement required in calculating inputs used  
to calculate fair value under IFRS 2. 
Schemes subject to external performance conditions 
were valued using the Monte Carlo model by the Company’s 
remuneration advisors, New Bridge Street, a trading name 
of Aon plc. They also provided an external source of key 
inputs used to calculate the initial fair value of new grants, 
such as volatility, dividend yield and risk free rates. 
Key management assumptions such as leaver provisions 
and achievement of performance conditions were reviewed 
and discussed by the Committee. 
The assumptions used in calculating the closing 
deferred tax asset were reviewed and the reasons for the 
decrease discussed and the financial disclosures reviewed 
by the Committee. 
As these are both areas of higher audit risk the Committee 
also received detailed verbal and written reporting from KPMG 
on this matter.
Internal audit
The Group did not have an internal audit function during 2014. 
As part of its review of risk management in late 2013, the 
Committee considered the need for an internal audit function 
and concluded that, given the simplicity of the Group 
structure, its single country focus, the open and accountable 
culture with clear authority limits, the straightforward financial 
model and strong system of internal controls, that it was  
not yet appropriate for the business. During the year the 
Committee has gained assurance from reports from 
management and the external auditors with regard to internal 
control and risk management, supplemented by extended 
assurance reviews by external consultants in key risk areas.
This decision has however been kept under regular review, 
and given the growth in the size and breadth of the business, 
as set out in the Chairman of the Committee’s letter, 
Rightmove will be transitioning to a fully outsourced internal 
audit model for 2015. 
External audit
KPMG has been the Group’s auditors since 2000. Following 
the 2012 revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code by 
the Financial Reporting Council, a decision was made by  
the Committee to formally tender the provision of audit and 
taxation services to the Group. A comprehensive tender  
and review process was concluded in March 2013. The 
Committee was satisfied that the skills and depth of industry 
knowledge in the team remained very strong and combined 
with the fresh perspective of the new audit partner decided 
that KPMG should be re-appointed as the Group’s auditor.
The external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group audit every five years. The current 
lead partner has been in place for two years.
The effectiveness of the external audit process is 
dependent on a number of matters. These include the quality 
of processes for recruitment and training of staff within the 
audit firm and the degree of rigour applied in the review 
processes of the work undertaken, together with appropriate 
audit risk identification at the start of the audit cycle.  34  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Corporate governance report continued
KPMG submitted a detailed audit plan, identifying their 
assessment of key risks. For the 2014 financial year the 
primary risks identified were in relation to:
•  Revenue recognition due to the value billed and the variety 
of differing contract terms; and 
•  Share-based incentives and the related deferred tax 
balances due to the choice of valuation method and inherent 
management judgement required in these areas.
The Committee challenged the work undertaken by the external 
auditors to test management’s assumptions and estimates 
around these areas. The Committee also assessed the 
effectiveness of the audit process in addressing these matters 
through the reporting it received from the auditors at both the 
half year and year end. In addition the Committee also sought 
feedback from management, without the auditors present, on 
the effectiveness of the external audit process. For the 2014 
financial year, management were satisfied that there had been 
appropriate focus and challenge on the primary areas of audit 
risk and the Committee concurred with this view. 
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of KPMG’ s 
overall internal processes to deliver a high quality audit service 
and concurred that appropriate processes were in place and 
being followed.
Non-audit services
The Committee also discussed its responsibilities to safeguard 
audit objectivity and independence as well as the needs of the 
business and agreed that it was practical in certain limited 
cases for the auditor to be assigned to other non-audit project 
work due to their knowledge and expertise of the business. 
The Committee agreed a policy that management be given 
authority to incur non-audit fees up to 50% of the annual 
agreed audit and tax fee in any financial year without the prior 
approval of the Committee. In 2014 the non-audit fees were 
£7,000 in relation to other advisory services and were £11,000 
in relation to tax compliance and advice and are fully disclosed 
in Note 6 of the financial statements.
Internal controls 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal controls and has established a framework of financial 
and other controls which is periodically reviewed in 
accordance with the FRC Internal Control: Guidance to 
Directors publication for its effectiveness.
The Board has taken, and will continue to take, appropriate 
measures to ensure that the chances of financial irregularities 
occurring are reduced as far as reasonably possible by 
improving the quality of information at all levels in the Group, 
fostering an open environment and ensuring that the financial 
analysis is rigorously applied. Any system of internal control is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement  
or loss.
The Group’s management have established the 
procedures necessary to ensure that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks to the Group. These procedures have 
been in place for the whole of the financial year ended 
31 December 2014 and up to the date of the approval of 
these financial statements and they are reviewed regularly.
During the year, the Committee has overseen 
a comprehensive review and update of the Disaster Recovery 
and Business Continuity Plan for the Milton Keynes office.  
This included an unannounced disaster recovery test with  
only a small number of follow up actions identified. 
KPMG performed a Cyber Maturity Assessment review 
comparing Rightmove with what is considered to be best 
practice across a number of comparable listed businesses. 
The outcome of this assessment was that the core  
processes are considered good with some minor 
improvements recommended.
The Committee has also approved updated Information 
and System Security Policies, known collectively as 
‘Protecting our Knowledge’. These have been communicated 
throughout the business with ongoing initiatives in place to 
maintain awareness.
The key elements of the system of internal control are:
•  Major commercial, strategic, competitive and financial risks 
are formally identified, quantified and assessed, discussed 
with the executive directors, after which they are considered 
by the Board; 
•  A comprehensive system of planning, budgeting and 
monitoring Group results. This includes monthly 
management reporting and monitoring of performance 
against both budgets and forecasts with explanations 
for all significant variances;
•  An organisational structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority;
•  Clearly defined policies for capital expenditure and 
investment exist, including appropriate authorisation levels, 
with larger capital projects, acquisitions and disposals 
requiring Board approval;
•  A comprehensive disaster recovery plan based upon 
co-hosting of the rightmove.co.uk website across three 
separate locations, which is regularly tested and reviewed;
•  A treasury function which manages cash flow forecasts and 
cash on deposit and counterparty risk and is responsible for 
monitoring compliance with banking agreements, where 
appropriate; and Rightmove plc annual report 2014      35
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
•  Whistleblowing and bribery policies of which all employees 
are made aware, to enable concerns to be raised either with 
line management or, if appropriate, confidentially outside the 
line management.
Through the procedures outlined above, the Board, with 
advice from the Committee, has considered all significant 
aspects of internal control for the year and up to the date  
of this Annual Report. No significant failings or weaknesses 
were identified during this review. However, had there been 
any such failings or weaknesses, the Board confirms that 
necessary actions would have been taken to remedy them.
Going concern 
The Board is required under the Code to consider whether or 
not it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Group and the Company financial statements.
As part of its normal business practice the Group prepares 
annual and longer term financial plans. In addition, a going 
concern paper was prepared and presented to the Committee 
in February 2015 prior to it recommending the approval of the 
financial statements and notes to the accounts for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 to the Board.
After making enquiries, the Board has a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate 
cash resources and banking facilities to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. During the year £103.4m 
of cash was returned to shareholders. Accordingly, the Board 
continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report and financial statements. Further information is 
provided in Note 1 to the financial statements. 
Nomination Committee report
Scott Forbes
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
Dear shareholder
In 2014 the Nomination Committee’s (the Committee’s) focus 
has been on organisation and succession planning, in 
response to the fact that three of our non-executive directors 
were in their third term of service to the Board. 
Following an externally facilitated Board strategy review 
and evaluation conducted in 2012, a Board refreshment plan 
was recommended by the Committee and agreed by the 
Board. The plan was implemented to ensure that the non-
executive directors’ range of skills and experience were 
appropriate and relevant to those required by the Group. The 
plan also considered the timing of appointments to avoid gaps 
in time when any necessary skills and experience were 
temporarily absent. Korn/Ferry International, an executive 
search firm, referenced the Board strategy review and 
commenced a search for two new non-executive directors 
during 2013; one with consumer digital experience and the 
other with significant plc board and business to consumer 
experience with a preference for candidates that would 
continue to support the Group’s diversity policy. 
Peter Williams and Rakhi Parekh were appointed to the 
Board in February 2014 and July 2014, respectively. Their 
collective skills and experience reflect the requirements 
identified in the Board strategy review and agreed by the 
Board. As consistent with the Board refreshment plan, the 
Board size temporarily increased from eight to ten directors in 
2014 to ensure a seamless transition. The Board will reduce 
to eight directors after the 2015 AGM as Jonathan Agnew and 
Judy Vezmar will not stand for re-election following the 
completion of their third term of service to the Board.
We have also taken the opportunity to review the 
composition of the Board committees with Peter Williams 
being appointed to the Remuneration Committee in 
November 2014, in advance of his appointment as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee, following Jonathan Agnew’s 
retirement from the Board after the 2015 AGM. 
The Board has accepted the Committee’s 
recommendation to make the following changes to the 
composition of the Board committees immediately effective 
following the 2015 AGM:
•  In addition to his appointment as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, Peter Williams will succeed 
Jonathan Agnew as Senior Independent Director; 
•  Peter Williams will also be appointed to both the Audit and 
Nomination Committees;
•  Rakhi Parekh will be appointed to the Remuneration and 
Audit Committees; and
•  Ashley Martin will be appointed to the Nomination Committee 
and step down from the Remuneration Committee.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions about 
the work of the Nomination Committee.

Membership 
The Committee is comprised entirely of non-executive 
directors, the biographical details which can be found on 
pages 24 to 25. As at 31 December 2014 three out of the four 
members of the Committee were considered by the Board to 
be independent. The quorum for meetings of the Committee 
is two members. 
At the request of the Nomination Committee Chairman,  
the Chief Executive Officer is normally invited to attend the 
meeting to discuss the annual organisation and succession 
plan. During the year Rakhi Parekh and Peter Williams, non-
executive directors, attended two meetings and one meeting 
by invitation, respectively.
The Chairman of the Company may not chair the 
Nomination Committee in connection with any discussion 
about the appointment of his successor to the chairmanship 
of the Company. In these circumstances, the Senior 
Independent Director will take the chair. Appointments are for 
a period of up to three years, extendable by no more than two 
additional three year periods, so long as members continue to 
be independent.
Principal activities of the Committee during 2014
During the year the Committee has:
•  Reviewed the Board composition;
•  Considered the appointment of two new non-executive 
directors;
•  Reviewed the Board Committees composition;
•  Approved the plans for the organisation and succession of 
the executive directors and senior management; 
•  Agreed the process for and considered the outcome of the 
Board’s annual evaluation;
•  Considered the diversity of the Board and agreed the policy 
regarding gender composition on the Board; and
•  Conducted an annual review of its terms of reference. 
Board induction and training
All new non-executive directors joining the Board undertake a 
tailored induction programme to meet their individual needs. 
This covers for example: the operation and activities of the 
Group (including meeting with members of the senior 
management team, spending a day on the road with a sales 
director meeting our customers and attendance at an Agency 
seminar), the role of the Board and the decision making 
matters reserved to it, the responsibilities of the Board 
committees; and the strategic challenges and opportunities 
facing the Group.
There are procedures in place for individual Board 
members to receive training and to seek the advice and 
services of independent professional advisers, at the Group’s 
expense, where specific expertise or training is required in 
furtherance of their duties. 
Board effectiveness and evaluation 
The Board is committed to undertaking annual reviews of its 
own performance and also the performance of its committees 
and individual directors.
For the year under review the Board conducted an internal 
evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees 
and individual directors led by the Chairman and assisted by 
the Company Secretary. The results of the evaluation was 
reviewed and discussed with the Board at its meeting in 
December 2014. 
The Board concluded that the Board evaluation demonstrates 
consistent and valuable contributions from all directors.  
The Board evaluation emphasised a high degree of board 
effectiveness, commitment, good working relationships and a 
strong succession plan as evidence by the approach to 
replacement of retiring non-executive directors. No major areas 
for improvement were highlighted within the 2014 review process. 
The Board intends to continue to create additional opportunities 
for informal discussion between Board members outside of 
the formal Board meetings and has arranged an extended off-
site strategic planning meeting as part of the 2015 
Board calendar .
An externally facilitated review of the performance of the Board 
and its committees will again be conducted during 2015.

Directors
The directors of the Company as at the date of this report are 
named on pages 24 to 25 together with their profiles. 
The Articles of Association of the Company require 
directors to submit themselves for re-appointment where  
they have been a director at each of the preceding two AGMs 
and were not appointed or re-appointed by the Company 
at, or since, either such meeting. Following the changes to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code in September 2010, 
all directors who have served during the year and remain 
a director as at 31 December 2014 will retire and offer 
themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM, with 
the exception of Jonathan Agnew and Judy Vezmar, who 
have notified the Company of their intention not to stand for 
re-election at the next AGM, due to their having completed 
three consecutive terms of three years as non-executive 
directors of the Company.
Rakhi Parekh will offer herself for election, this being her  
first AGM following her appointment to the Board as  
non-executive director on 28 July 2014. 
The Board is satisfied that the directors retiring and 
standing for re-election are qualified for re-appointment by 
virtue of their skills, experience and contribution to the Board. 
The executive directors have service agreements with the 
Company which can be terminated on 12 months’ notice. 
The appointments for the non-executive directors can be 
terminated on three months’ notice.
The interests of the directors in the share capital of the 
Company at 31 December 2014, the directors’ total 
remuneration for the year and details of their service contracts 
and Letters of Appointment are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 41 to 66. At 31 December 2014 
all of the executive directors were deemed to have a non-
beneficial interest in 596,499 ordinary shares of £0.01 each  
held by the trustees of the EBT .
Research and development
The Group undertakes research and development activity in 
order to develop new products and to continually improve the 
existing property website. Further details are disclosed in  
Note 2 to the financial statements on page 79.
Political donations 
During the year the Group did not make any donations to any 
political party or other political organisation and did not incur 
any political expenditure within the meanings of Sections 362 
to 379 of the Companies Act 2006.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of the Company will be held at the offices of UBS 
Limited at 100 Liverpool Street, London, EC2M 2RH on  
7 May 2015 at 10am. The Notice of Annual General Meeting 
will be published in March 2015.
The resolutions being proposed at the 2015 AGM are 
general in nature including the renewal for a further year of  
the limited authority of the directors to allot the unissued  
share capital of the Company and to issue shares for cash 
other than to existing shareholders. A resolution will also  
be proposed to renew the directors’ authority to purchase  
a proportion of the Company’s own shares.  Rightmove plc annual report 2014      39
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
One of the items of special business to be addressed at  
this AGM relates to the requirement in the Companies 
(Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009, which came into 
force on 3 August 2009 that all general meetings must be held 
on not less than 21 clear days’ notice unless shareholders 
approve a shorter notice period. At the 2014 AGM, a 
resolution was passed allowing the Company to call general 
meetings (other than AGMs) on not less than 14 clear days’ 
notice. As this authority will expire at the 2015 AGM, a 
resolution will be proposed to renew this authority.
Auditor
KPMG LLP has confirmed its willingness to continue in office  
as auditor of the Group. In accordance with section 489 of  
the Companies Act 2006, separate resolutions for the 
reappointment of KPMG LLP as auditor of the Group and for 
the Audit Committee to determine their remuneration will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM of the Company. 
Audit information
So far as the directors in office at the date of signing of the 
report are aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the auditor is unaware and each such director has 
taken all reasonable steps to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor 
is aware of that information.
Greenhouse gas emissions 
Our report of greenhouse gas emissions in line with 
UK  mandatory reporting regulation is provided in the 
Corporate Responsibility section of the Strategic Report 
on pages 19 to 23. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Board has concluded that the 2014 Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the necessary 
information for shareholders and other readers of the 
accounts to assess the Group’s performance, business  
model and strategy.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect 
of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
•  The management report required by DTR 4.1.8R (contained 
in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report) includes  
a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the Group taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Governance | Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and 
parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent 
Company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period.  
In preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; 
•  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent Company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
parent Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent 
Company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are  
also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that complies with that law and  
those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included  
on the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements  
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Rightmove plc annual report 2014      41

Governance | Directors’ remuneration report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our Directors’ Remuneration Report  
for Rightmove plc (the Company) together with its subsidiary 
companies (the Group) for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
The report is divided into two distinct sections, the 
remuneration policy and the annual report on remuneration. 
In accordance with the new regulations you were asked to 
vote separately on these two reports at our AGM held on 
7 May 2014. The remuneration policy for the next three years 
received overwhelming support and therefore, as we do not 
propose to make any changes to this policy, we are not 
required to put the policy forward for a vote at this year’s AGM 
to be held on 7 May 2015. For ease of reference, we present 
the policy on pages 43 to 51. 
Our remuneration framework is designed to ensure we 
reward and incentivise our people to deliver our strategy with  
a clear emphasis on performance-related pay to reflect the 
culture of the Group. The overall policy provides below market 
levels of fixed pay but with above market levels of variable  
pay opportunity, subject to the achievement of challenging 
performance measures linked to the Group KPIs. Variable pay 
is biased toward long-term sustainable performance, through 
a high level of annual bonus deferral into shares, long-term 
incentive awards and share ownership guidelines. We believe 
that the remuneration policy which you approved in 2014 
continues to remain appropriate. 
As described in the Strategic Report, our 2014 results 
show strong organic revenue and profit growth. The increase 
in profit achieved this year once again demonstrates the 
strength of the Rightmove business model and brand and the 
effectiveness of our management team.
Performance and reward
In light of the combination of strong Group and executive 
directors’ performance during the year, the Remuneration 
Committee considers the remuneration paid to the executive 
directors to reflect fairly their performance during the year.  
As a result of the financial and operational results of the 
Group, including growth in underlying operating profit of 20%, 
the annual bonus entitlement for executive directors was 70% 
of the maximum for 2014.
With regard to the Group’s longer-term performance, 
reflecting the successful implementation of its growth strategy 
over the last three financial years, the 2012 Performance 
Share Plan awards (measuring performance from 1 January 
2012 to 31 December 2014) will vest in part as a result of 
delivering normalised EPS
(1)
 growth of over 100% and TSR 
growth of 88.7% over the performance period. The EPS 
performance significantly exceeded the maximum growth 
target set of 50%. Whilst the Company achieved a growth in 
TSR of 15% above the FTSE 250 Index, this was below the 
maximum outperformance required of 25% and thus resulted 
in 69% of this part of the award vesting. Overall vesting of 
92.35% of the 2012 award is considered by the Committee  
to be a result that fairly reflects the performance achieved  
over the three year period.

Governance | Directors’ remuneration report continued
Further details in relation to the remuneration policy, which is 
expected to operate for at least another two years are set out 
on pages 43 to 51. We are committed to maintaining an open 
and transparent dialogue with shareholders. We have valued 
the engagement with, and support of shareholders and we 
remain focused on disclosing clearly how much our executive 
directors earn and how this is linked closely to performance.
As explained in the Nomination Committee report, I will be 
stepping down from my position of Remuneration Committee 
Chairman after this year’s AGM and will be succeeded by 
Peter Williams. I have much enjoyed my time on the Board of 
Rightmove, including my role as Chairman of the Committee. 
Jonathan Agnew
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Remuneration policy for 2015
The Committee continues to believe that the current 
remuneration policy of providing below market fixed pay  
(base salary, pension and minimal benefits) and above market 
variable pay opportunity (short and long-term incentives) for 
delivery of challenging performance targets remains 
appropriate for a growth orientated Group. 
In summary, the key elements to the remuneration policy  
are as follows:
•  We remain committed to a pay model of below comparative 
median benchmarks on fixed pay and an above median 
incentive opportunity.
•  Executive directors are to receive inflationary adjustments  
to base salary levels in line with all employees. Up to 6% of 
base salary is contributed to the executive director Group 
pension scheme. 
•  The annual bonus opportunity provides that 60% of any 
bonus earned is deferred into the Company’s shares for a 
period of two years.
•  Annual award levels under the Company’s Performance 
Share Plan are granted at 200% of salary with challenging 
underlying earnings per share growth targets. 
•  Clawback will continue to operate in relation to both 
deferred annual bonus awards and Performance Share Plan 
awards. The mechanism through which the clawback can 
be implemented enables the Committee to (i) reduce the 
cash bonus earned in a subsequent year and/or reduce 
outstanding DSP/PSP share awards (i.e. withholding 
provisions may be used to effect a recovery) or (ii) for the 
Committee to require that a net of tax balancing cash 
payment be made to the Company.
•  The existing share ownership guidelines will be 200% of 
base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% of 
base salary for other executive directors.
Annual statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee continued Rightmove plc annual report 2014      43
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
•  Executive directors should have below market levels of base 
salary, minimal benefits (and only benefits which are made 
available on the same basis to all Rightmove employees), 
but with above market levels of variable pay potential. This 
arrangement is designed to best align the interests of the 
executive directors with the interests of shareholders and  
to reflect the performance-driven culture of the Group. The 
Company will generally review market levels of remuneration 
for executive directors with the assistance of external, 
independent remuneration consultants and with 
shareholder consultation every three years.
•  Having reviewed executive director remuneration against 
the market every three years, further changes to 
remuneration should be made infrequently and those 
changes made each year should, in most instances, be 
directly linked to the policies applied to all employees 
(specifically with regard to cost of living rises in base salary 
and changes in benefits).
•  Executive directors should be principally rewarded for the 
overall success of the business for which they have 
collective responsibility. The Group has key short-term and 
medium/long-term goals and executive directors should be 
incentivised against these goals. 
•  Executive directors should not be able to gain significantly 
from short-term successes which subsequently prove not 
to be consistent with growing the overall value of the 
business. Hence a majority of any bonus payable in relation 
to short-term strategic goals is required to be taken in the 
form of shares in the Company which are deferred for a 
further two years after the bonus target has been achieved.
The table overleaf provides an overview of the Committee’s 
remuneration policy, which has been designed to reflect the 
principles described above: 
Introduction
This report sets out the Company’s policy on directors’ 
remuneration for the forthcoming year, and, so far as 
practicable, for subsequent years, as well as information  
on remuneration paid to directors for the financial year ended 
31 December 2014. This report has been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (together the Act) 
and the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code).
In accordance with the Act this report has been divided 
into two sections: a Policy Report and an Annual Report  
on Remuneration. The Policy Report was put to a binding 
shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and received more than 
98% votes in favour with an ‘Effective Date’ of 7 May 2014 for 
the purposes of complying with the Act. In practice, however, 
the Remuneration Committee (herein referred to as the 
Committee throughout this report) applied the policy detailed 
below from the start of 2014 and expects to apply it 
throughout the three year policy period that commenced from 
the Effective Date. For ease of reference, the Policy Report 
has been represented, albeit with some changes to 
references and with the removal of the performance scenario 
charts. A copy of the original report can be found on the 
Company website at plc.rightmove.co.uk. The Annual Report 
on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the 
2015 AGM. The parts of the report which have been audited 
have been highlighted as required by the Act.
Remuneration Policy Report (the Policy Report) 
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the 
remuneration policy for the Company and has been prepared 
in accordance with the Act. The policy has been developed 
after taking into account Rightmove’s pay philosophy that  
our executives should be rewarded with demonstrably lower 
than market base salaries and benefits and higher than 
market equity rewards contingent upon the achievement of 
challenging performance targets in accordance with the ‘best 
practice’ principles set out in the Code and the views of our 
major shareholders.
The key principles of the Committee’s policy are as follows:
•  Remuneration arrangements should be simple to explain, 
understand and administer. 
•  Remuneration arrangements should be designed to provide 
executive directors with the opportunity to receive a share in 
the future growth and development of the Group which is 
regarded as fair by both other employees and shareholders. 
This approach should allow the Company to attract and 
retain the dynamic, self-motivated individuals who are 
critical to the success of the business.

Salary To provide a base 
salary which will 
attract and retain high 
calibre executives to 
execute the Group’s 
business strategy.
Base salaries are normally 
reviewed annually, with changes 
effective from 1 January.
When considering the executive’s 
eligibility for a salary increase, 
the Committee considers the 
following points:
•  size and responsibilities of  
the role;
•  individual and Group 
performance;
•  increases awarded to the  
wider workforce; and
•  broader economic and 
inflationary conditions.
Executive directors are 
benchmarked against external 
market data periodically (generally 
every three years). Relevant 
market comparators are selected 
for comparison, which include 
other companies of a similar size 
and complexity. The Committee 
considers benchmark data, 
alongside a broad review of the 
individual’ s skills and experience, 
performance and internal relativities. 
The current salaries are set out 
on page 53.
These salary levels will be eligible 
for increases during the period 
that the remuneration policy 
operates from the Effective Date. 
During this time, salaries may 
be increased each year (in 
percentage of salary terms) in line 
with those of the wider workforce 
(after taking into account the 
annual salary budget and 
performance-related increases 
within the overall salary budget). 
Increases beyond those linked 
to the workforce (in percentage of 
salary terms) may be awarded in 
certain circumstances such as 
where there is a change in 
responsibility, experience or a 
significant increase in the scale of 
the role and/or size, value and/or 
complexity of the Group.
The Committee considers both 
individual and Group performance 
in a broad context when 
determining base salary increases. 
Benefits To provide simple, 
cost-effective, 
employee benefits 
which are the same 
as those offered to 
the wider workforce.
The executive directors are 
enrolled in the Group’s private 
medical insurance scheme and 
receive life assurance cover equal 
to four times base salary. 
Additionally, Nick McKittrick 
and Robyn Perriss are members 
of the Group’s medical cash plan.
The value of benefits may vary 
from year to year depending on 
the cost to the Company from 
third party providers.
Not applicable
Pension To provide a
basic, cost-effective,
long-term retirement 
benefit.
The Group operates a stakeholder 
pension plan for employees under 
which the employer contributes 
6% of base salary subject to the 
employee contributing a minimum 
of 3% of base salary. 
The Company does not 
contribute to any personal pension 
arrangements.
Whilst executives are not 
obliged to join, the Company 
operates a pension salary 
exchange arrangement whereby 
executives can exchange part of 
their salary for Company paid 
pension contributions. Where 
executives exchange salary and 
this reduces the Company’s 
National Insurance Contributions 
the Company credits the entire 
saving to the executive’s pension.

Rewards the 
achievement of 
annual financial and 
operational goals.
The annual bonus comprises a 
cash award (40% of any bonus 
earned) and a DSP award (60%  
of any bonus earned). 
Deferred shares will vest after 
two years and be potentially 
forfeitable during that period. 
Payments under the annual 
bonus plan may be subject to 
clawback in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s 
financial results or misconduct.
Maximum (% salary):
125% of base salary. 
The bonus is determined based 
on performance against a range of 
key performance indicators. 
The primary bonus metric will 
be profit-based (e.g. underlying 
operating profit before tax) with 
targets set in relation to a carefully 
considered business plan and 
requiring significant out-
performance of that plan to trigger 
maximum payments. 
A minority of bonus will also be 
earned based on pre-set targets 
drawn from the Group’s other key 
performance indicators relating to 
underlying drivers of long-term 
revenue growth.
Details of the performance 
measures used for the current 
year and the targets set for the

To incentivise and 
reward executives for 
the achievement of 
superior returns to 
shareholders over a 
three year period, 
and to retain key 
individuals and align 
interests with 
shareholders.
Following shareholder approval  
at the 2011 AGM, the PSP was 
established. The PSP permits 
annual awards of nil cost options, 
contingent shares and forfeitable 
shares which vest after three 
years subject to continued service 
and the achievement of 
challenging performance 
conditions. 
A dividend equivalent provision 
operates enabling dividends to be 
paid (in cash or shares) on shares 
at the time of vesting.
PSP awards may be subject to 
clawback in the event of a 
material misstatement of the 
Group’s financial results or 
misconduct.
Maximum (% salary):  
200% of base salary.
Awards vest based on three year 
performance against challenging 
financial targets for EPS and

Financial targets will determine 
vesting in relation to at least half 
of an award.
25% of the awards vest for

grant. On the maturity of the 
savings contracts, participants 
can elect to:
(i)  use the accumulated savings  
to exercise the option; or 
(ii)  request the return of their 
savings.

The fees for non-executive 
directors (including the Company 
Chairman) are reviewed 
periodically (generally every three 
to four years). 
The Remuneration Committee 
will consider the Chairman’s fee, 
whilst the non-executive directors’ 
fee is considered by the wider 
Board excluding the non-
executives. 
Fee levels for each role are 
determined after considering the 
responsibility of the role, the skills 
and knowledge required and the 
expected time commitments. 
Periodic benchmarking against 
relevant market comparators, 
reflecting the size and complexity 
of the role, is used to provide 
context when setting fee levels. 
Fees for the Chairman and non-
executive directors’ are set out  
on page 55.
The Chairman and non-executive 
directors’ fee increases in future 
years are expected to increase (in 
percentage terms) in line with the 
basic level of pay rise received by 
employees within the business.
Fee increases beyond the level 
detailed above may take place if  
fee levels are considered to have 
become out of line with the 
responsibilities and time 
commitments of individual roles.
Flexibility is retained to go above 
the above fee levels in the event that 
it is necessary to recruit a new 
Chairman or non-executive director 
of an appropriate calibre in future 
years.

Selection of performance measures and how  
targets are set
The performance metrics that are used for annual bonus and 
long-term incentive plans are a subset of the Group’s key 
performance indicators.
For the annual bonus, underlying operating profit before 
tax
(1)
 is the primary performance metric used as it is aligned to 
the Group’s strategy of delivering profitable growth and is a 
key financial performance indicator used within the business. 
Consistent with previous years, operating profit is measured 
on an underlying basis, to exclude any volatility in relation to 
the Company’s share price in connection with the IFRS 2 
valuation and National Insurance charge on share-based 
incentives granted. The underlying operating profit
(1)
 before 
tax target is set on a sliding scale based around the business 
plan for the year, with 25% payable for threshold 
performance. 
The annual bonus also considers performance against 
other operational metrics, including a market share target and 
other revenue, for a minority of the bonus, with a sliding scale 
used to determine performance against each measure. 
Market share is a measure of the size and engagement of our 
audience and the value which Rightmove, as a media group, 
brings to our customers. Therefore a challenging target to 
increase this audience is considered appropriate by the 
Committee. The other revenue target will measure growth 
in revenue from businesses other than Agency and New 
Homes. Since some of these will be at an early stage, we 
consider growth in revenue rather than in operating profit to 
be the appropriate measure and note that this element of the 
bonus is only a small proportion of the total bonus 
opportunity.
For the PSP , awards are subject to a combination of EPS 
and relative TSR performance conditions. EPS is considered 
the most appropriate financial metric for this particular 
business at this stage in its development (since it is the 
measure of profitability that is most closely aligned with 
shareholders’ interests and monitored on an ongoing basis 
within the business). The policy also recognises that relative 
TSR should also be a performance measure in order for there 
to be a clear alignment of executive and shareholder interests. 
EPS targets are set based on sliding scales that take account 
of internal financial planning and external analyst forecasts. 
Only 25% of the EPS element will pay out for threshold 
performance levels, with the maximum award requiring 
substantial out-performance. For TSR, the range of targets 
measure how successful the Company is in out-performing 
the FTSE250 Index (the Index within which the Company 
currently resides) with 25% of this part of the award vesting  
at the threshold performance level, through to full vesting for 
25% out-performance of the Index over the three year 
performance period. 
Discretions maintained by the Committee in 
operating its incentive plans
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan, PSP  
and Sharesave Plan according to their respective rules and  
in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where 
relevant. 
The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market 
practice, in a number of regards to the operation and 
administration of these plans. These discretions include,  
but are not limited to, the following:
• The selection of participants in the respective plan;
• The timing of grant of an award (if any) and payments;
•  The size of an award and/or a payment (with limits as 
described in the table above);
•  The extent of vesting based on the achievement of 
performance targets and applicable exercise periods  
where relevant; 
•  How to deal with a change of control (e.g. the timing of 
testing performance targets) or restructuring of the Group;
•  Determination of a good/bad leaver for incentive plan 
purposes based on the rules of each plan and the 
appropriate treatment chosen including the timing of the 
delivery of shares;
•  Adjustments (if any) required in certain circumstances  
(e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events and 
special dividends); and
•  The annual review of performance measures, targets and 
weightings for the annual bonus plan and PSP from year  
to year.
The Committee also retains the ability to adjust the targets 
and/or set different measures for the annual bonus plan and 
PSP if events occur (e.g. a material divestment or acquisition) 
which cause it to determine that the conditions are no longer 
appropriate and the amendment is required so that the 
conditions achieve their original purpose and are not 
materially less difficult to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, 
be detailed in the Annual Report on Remuneration and, if 
appropriate, the subject of prior communication with the 
Company’s major shareholders.
All previous share options, PSP , DSP and Sharesave 
awards that were granted but remain outstanding at 
31 December 2014 (detailed on pages 61 to 64), remain  
eligible to vest based on their original award terms. 48  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Directors’ remuneration report continued
The targets for awards to be granted under the PSP in 2015 
are consistent with the policy set out above and are  
set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance targets do not apply to Sharesave awards 
since these awards are structured to encourage employees to 
become share owners and to maintain tax-favoured status the 
awards must operate on a consistent basis for all employees.
How the views of employees are taken into account
The Company has not to date felt it necessary to consult 
directly with employees on executive remuneration matters. 
However, the Committee is kept aware of pay and 
employment conditions within the wider workforce when 
setting executive directors’ remuneration policy. 
Remuneration policy for executive directors 
compared to other employees
The Committee will consider the proposed salary increase 
budget for the whole Group when it is deciding on salary 
increases for executive directors specifically. 
In line with the Company’s strategy to keep remuneration 
simple and consistent, benefits and pension arrangements 
provided to executive directors are the same as those offered 
to all Group employees. 
The extent to which annual bonuses are offered varies by 
level of employee within the Group, with the quantum and 
performance metrics used determined by the nature of the 
role and responsibilities and market rates at that level.
Long-term incentive awards, other than the all-employee 
Sharesave Plan, are only offered to senior management as 
those awards are more heavily weighted towards 
performance-related pay and have a stronger visibility on the 
value created for shareholders and the reward for participants. 
Shareholders’ views
The Committee considers it vitally important to maintain  
open and transparent communication with the Company’s 
shareholders. The Committee will consult with major 
shareholders before any material change in remuneration 
policy is approved. The views of shareholders received at  
the AGM, during meetings with investors and through other 
contact during the year, are considered by the Committee  
and contribute to the development of the overall  
remuneration policy. 
Recruitment and promotion policy
The Committee proposes an executive director’s remuneration 
package for new appointments in line with the principles 
outlined in the table overleaf: 
(1) Before share-based payments and NI on share-based incentives. Rightmove plc annual report 2014      49
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Element of remuneration Policy
Base salary Base salary levels will be set based on the roles and responsibilities of the individual together with their 
relevant skills and experience, taking into account the market rates for companies of comparable size and 
complexity and internal Company relativities. In some circumstances (e.g. to reflect an individual’s limited 
experience at a PLC board level) it may be considered appropriate to set initial salary levels below the 
perceived market competitive rate. Phased increases, potentially above inflation, may then be offered to 
achieve the desired market positioning over time, subject to individual’s continued performance and 
development in the role. 
Benefits Benefits as provided to current executive directors. Where necessary the Committee may approve the 
payment of relocation expenses to facilitate recruitment, and flexibility is retained for the Company to pay 
legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual in relation to their appointment.
Pension A defined contribution at the level provided to current executive directors.
Annual bonus An annual bonus would operate in the same manner as outlined for the current executives (as described 
above and in the Annual Report on Remuneration), although it would be pro-rated to reflect the 
employment period during the bonus year. 
The bonus maximum potential would not exceed 125% of base salary. 
It would be expected that the bonus for a new appointment would be assessed on the same 
performance metrics as that for the current executives on an ongoing basis. However, depending on the 
timing and nature of appointment it may be necessary to set tailored performance criteria for their first 
bonus plan. 
Long-term incentives A new appointment will be eligible to receive an award under the PSP policy outlined in the policy table. 
Share awards may be granted shortly after an appointment (subject to the Company not being in a close 
period) and would be measured against the same performance criteria as the current executives. 
The ongoing award maximum would not exceed 200% of base salary. 
For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain subject 
to their terms as at the date of grant. 
The new appointment would be eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan under the same terms as all 
other employees. 
Buy-out awards To facilitate an external recruitment, it may be necessary to buy-out remuneration which would be 
forfeited on leaving their previous employer. When determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out 
awards the Committee will, as a minimum, take into account the following factors:
• the form of remuneration (cash or shares); 
• timing of expected payment/vesting; and 
• expected value (i.e. taking into account the likelihood of achieving the existing performance criteria). 
Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing share plans to the extent possible, 
although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the 
Listing Rules.  50  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Directors’ remuneration report continued
Directors’ service contracts and non-executive 
directors’ terms of appointment
The Committee’s policy on service agreements for executive 
directors is that they should provide for 12 months’ notice of 
termination by the Company and by the executive. Any 
proposals for the early termination by the Company of the 
service agreements of directors or senior executives are 
considered by the Committee.
The service agreements for the executive directors allow 
for lawful termination of employment by making a payment  
in lieu of notice or by making phased payments over any 
remaining unexpired period of notice. The phased payments 
may be reduced if, and to the extent that, the executive finds 
an alternative remunerated position. 
In addition, any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or 
compromise claims in connection with the termination would 
be paid as necessary. 
For Nick McKittrick a payment in lieu of notice will be 
related to base salary, benefits and projected annual bonus 
pursuant to the Group’s targets being achieved for the year 
(pro-rated for any unexpired period of notice where 
appropriate). The Committee is aware that the provision of 
annual bonus with a payment in lieu of notice is no longer 
considered in line with best practice. The provision within  
Nick McKittrick’s contract is considered a legacy issue which 
would not be repeated in any future director’s service contract. 
For Peter Brooks-Johnson and Robyn Perriss a payment 
in lieu of notice will be restricted to base salary and benefits.
The treatment for share-based incentives previously 
granted to an executive director will be determined based  
on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment will be for 
outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment. 
For awards granted under the PSP (approved by 
shareholders in 2011) ‘good leaver’ status may be 
determined, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as 
death, ill health, disability, redundancy, transfer or sale of the 
employing company, or other circumstances at the discretion 
of the Committee. If defined as a good leaver, awards will 
remain subject to performance conditions, which will be 
measured over the performance period from grant to the 
original vesting date, unless the Committee determine to 
assess performance from grant to the date of cessation,  
and which will be reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion  
of the performance period actually served. The Committee 
retains the discretion to disapply time pro-rating in  
exceptional circumstances. 
For awards granted under the DSP , ‘good leaver’ status 
may be determined for reasons of death, injury, disability, 
redundancy, transfer or sale of the employing company or 
other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee.  
If defined as a good leaver, awards will be retained and vest 
on the original vesting date. 
Scott Forbes’ appointment may be terminated by either 
party giving to the other not less than three months’ notice  
in writing. The Company may also terminate by making a 
payment in lieu of notice. Scott Forbes is not contractually 
entitled to any other benefits on termination of his contract.
The Letters of Appointment for the non-executive directors 
provide for a term of up to two three year periods and a 
possible further three year term (subject to re-election by 
shareholders and subject to the director remaining 
independent). The appointments may be terminated with a 
notice period of three months on either side and the Letters  
of Appointment set out the time commitments required to 
meet the expectations of their roles. 
Copies are available for inspection on request to the 
Company Secretary.

Appointment are summarised overleaf: Rightmove plc annual report 2014      51

Annual Report on Remuneration
Role and membership
Terms of reference 
The primary role of the Committee is to make 
recommendations to the Board as to the Company’s  
broad policy and framework for the remuneration of the 
executive directors, the Chairman of the Board and the 
Company Secretary. The remuneration and terms of 
appointment of the non-executive directors are determined 
by the Board as a whole.
In accordance with the Code, the Committee also 
recommends the structure and monitors the level of 
remuneration for the first layer of management below Board 
level. The Committee is also aware of, and advises on, the 
employee benefit structures throughout the Group and ensures 
that it is kept aware of any potential business risks arising from 
those remuneration arrangements. 
The Committee has formal terms of reference which are 
reviewed annually and updated as required. These are available 
on the Company’ s website at plc.rightmove.co.uk or on 
request from the Company Secretary.
Membership
The following independent non-executive directors were 
members of the Committee during 2014 and continue to be 
members. During 2014 the Committee met four times and 
attendance at the meetings is shown below:

(1)  Peter Williams was invited to join the Committee in November 2014 and has 
attended all subsequent Committee meetings.
The quorum for meetings of the Committee is two members. 
The Committee will meet at such times as may be necessary 
but will normally meet at least four times a year.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee.
Only members of the Committee have the right to attend 
Committee meetings. The Chairman of the Committee has 
requested that the Chairman of the Board attend the meetings 
except during discussions relating to his own remuneration. 
The Chief Executive Officer may also be invited to meetings 
and the Committee takes into consideration their 
recommendations regarding the remuneration of executive 
colleagues and the first layer of management below Board 
level. No executive director is involved in deciding their own 
remuneration.
During the year Rakhi Parekh, non-executive director, 
attended two meetings by invitation. 
External advisers
New Bridge Street (NBS), a trading name of Aon plc, which is 
a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and has 
signed up to its Code of Conduct, has been retained as the 
Committee’s remuneration advisor since 2011. The terms of 
engagement between the Company and NBS are available 
from the Company Secretary on request. 
The total fees paid to NBS in respect of services to the 
Committee during the year were £18,142. 
During 2014 NBS provided services to the Company in 
connection with the valuation of share-based incentives (as 
required by IFRS 2) and confirmed that, in its view, these 
services did not present a conflict of interest with the other 
services provided to the Committee.
The Committee reviews its relationship with external 
advisors on a regular basis and continues to believe that  
there are no conflicts of interest.
What has the Committee done during the year? 
The Committee met four times during the year to consider 
and, where appropriate, approve key remuneration items 
including the following: Rightmove plc annual report 2014      53
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Pension and other benefits
The Group operates a stakeholder pension plan for 
employees under which the employer contributes 6% of base 
salary, subject to the employee contributing a minimum of 3% 
of base salary. Nick McKittrick has chosen not to participate 
in this arrangement. The Company does not contribute to any 
personal pension arrangements. 
The executive directors are enrolled in the Group’s private 
medical insurance scheme and receive life assurance cover 
equal to four times base salary. Additionally, the executive 
directors are members of the Group’s medical cash plan.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus for the 2015 financial year will be 
consistent with the policy detailed on page 45 of the 
remuneration policy section of this report in terms of 
maximum bonus opportunity, deferral and clawback 
provisions. The mechanism through which the clawback  
can be implemented enables the Committee to (i) reduce  
the cash bonus earned in a subsequent year and/or reduce 
outstanding DSP/PSP share awards (i.e. withholding 
provisions may be used to effect a recovery) or (ii) for the 
Committee to require that a net of tax balancing cash 
payment be made to the Company. The measures have been 
selected to reflect a range of financial and strategic targets 
that support the key objectives of the Group.
The performance measures and weightings will be as follows:
Measure As a % of maximum bonus opportunity
Financial targets
Underlying operating profit before tax
(1)
 70%
Strategic targets
Market share 15% 
Other revenue
(2)

Salaries
The executive directors’ salaries for the 2015 financial year

Nick McKittrick  £408,000 £400,000 2%
Peter Brooks-Johnson £341,700 £335,000 2%
Robyn Perriss £270,300 £265,000 2%
The 2% increase in executive directors’ salaries is in line with 
the average workforce increase for 2015 across the Group. 54  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Directors’ remuneration report continued
In relation to the financial target a challenging sliding scale will 
operate with 25% of the maximum bonus opportunity payable at 
the threshold underlying operating profit target relative to 2015 
business plan through to 100% becoming payable for significant 
outperformance relative to the plan. A greater proportion of the 
award will be paid for exceeding on-target performance.
The weighting of the performance measures to be used 
for the 2015 annual bonus have been adjusted to 15% based 
on market share (2014: 20%) and 15% on other revenue 
(2014: 10% on innovation revenue). This rebalancing is felt to 
reflect the increased emphasis on the delivery of additional 
revenue streams. 
The targets themselves, as they relate to the 2015 financial 
year, are deemed to be commercially sensitive. However, 
retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance 
against them will be provided in next year’s Annual Report  
on Remuneration to the extent that they do not remain 
commercially sensitive at the time.
Long-term incentives
To ensure that the Company’s total remuneration is 
competitive overall, following a wide reaching shareholder 
pre-consultation exercise, subject to achieving demanding 
performance targets, the award levels under the PSP were 
increased to 200% of base salary for all executive directors 
from 2014.
Consistent with current market practice and previous 
years, awards to the executive directors under the PSP in 
2015 will be subject to a mixture of EPS (75% of awards)  
and relative TSR (25% of the awards) performance 
conditions. The 2015 targets are as follows:
EPS condition
The Group’s EPS growth will be measured over the period of 
three financial years (2015 to 2017). The EPS figure used will 
be equivalent to the Group’s basic underlying EPS (before 
share-based payments, National Insurance on share-based 
incentives and no related adjustment for tax). With a view to 
ensuring appropriately stretching but achievable targets are 
set in light of market expectations for the Company, the 
following range of targets will apply to the 2015 awards:
 Underlying basic EPS growth  % of award vesting 
 from 2015 to 2017
(1)
 (maximum 75%)
 Less than 30% 0%
 30% 18.75%
 60% 75%
 Between 30% and 60% Straight-line vesting
 
(1)  The benchmark underlying basic EPS for the financial year 2014 from which 
these targets will be measured is 100.3p. 
As in prior years, the targets that are intended to operate  
for the 2015 PSP awards were set to be appropriately 
demanding in light of the Group’s internal planning, external 
market expectations for future growth and the record high 
base point from which growth would be measured. In the 
current trading environment, particularly in the housing sector, 
the targets are considered to provide a realistic incentive at 
the lower end of the performance range but require 
exceptional performance to achieve full vesting. On this basis, 
the Committee is satisfied that the revised range of targets 
are appropriately demanding, and no less challenging to the 
range of targets set for 2014 awards given the current 
housing market context. 
Relative TSR condition
The vesting schedule for the relative TSR element of executive 
directors’ 2015 PSP awards is set out below. It is consistent 
with the TSR condition used for previous grants under the 
share-based incentive schemes. Performance is measured 
over three financial years.
 TSR performance of the Company  % of award vesting

(1)  If the FTSE250 Index’s TSR was 50% over the three year performance period, 
then the Company’s TSR would have to be at least 75% for all 25% of the 
PSP shares to vest. Rightmove plc annual report 2014      55
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
In line with the Company’s commitment to ongoing dialogue 
with its shareholders, meetings are offered, where 
appropriate, to understand the reasons for any potential or 
actual opposition to the Company’s remuneration policy. 
Changes are made to our policy where it is considered 
appropriate to do so. 
Review of past performance
Share price performance
In 2014, the Company’s share price ended the year at £22.48 
down 18% year on year (the FTSE250 Index was up 1%).  
On a three year basis the share price has increased by 80% 
and has continued to outperform the FTSE250 Index over 
that period as shown in the graphs on page 56.
Total shareholder return (TSR)
The first graph on the next page compares the TSR of 
Rightmove’s shares against the FTSE250 Index for the  
period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014. TSR is 
the product of movements in the share price plus dividends 
reinvested on the ex-dividend date. TSR provides a useful, 
widely used benchmark to illustrate the Company’s 
performance over the last three years. Specifically, it illustrates 
the value of £100 invested in Rightmove’s shares and in the 
FTSE250 Index over that period. 
As required by the Act, the Company’s TSR performance 
is required to be shown against a recognised broad-based 
share index. The FTSE250 Index was chosen as the 
comparator because Rightmove is a current constituent of 
this index. It was used as a comparator in the performance 
condition applying to PSP awards in previous years and it 
will also be used as the criteria applied to 25% of the PSP 
awards to be granted in March 2015.
The graphs on the next page illustrate, for statutory 
purposes, the TSR of Rightmove’s shares against  
the FTSE250 Index for the three and six years to 
31 December 2014.
Chairman and non-executive directors’ fees
In 2009, the Board decided to increase fees for the non-
executive directors in future years annually, directly in line with 
the basic level of pay rise received by employees within the 
business until such time as it is considered appropriate to 
conduct a wider review of non-executive remuneration. 
Accordingly the Board approved an increase of 2% to the 
annual fees payable to the non-executive directors. The 
Committee approved a 2% increase in the annual fees 
payable to the Chairman.
The Chairman’s fee has been set at £117,042 
(2014: £114,747). The basic non-executive fee has been 
set at £46,817 (2014: £45,899) with an additional £5,852 
(2014: £5,737) fee per annum paid for the chairing of the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees and a further £5,852 
(2014: £5,737) fee paid to the Senior Independent Director. 
Jonathan Agnew and Judy Vezmar will continue to receive 
fees until their retirement from the Board in May 2015.
Statement of shareholder voting at AGM
At the AGM on 7 May 2014, 99.83% of shareholders voted in 
favour of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and 98.55% 
voted in favour of the Remuneration Policy. The Committee 
believes this illustrates the strong level of shareholder support 
for the remuneration framework. The table below shows full

as an estimate for potential value prior to vesting. 
Defined contribution pension
The Group operates a stakeholder pension plan for employees under which the employer contributes 6% of base salary, 
subject to the employee contributing a minimum of 3% of base salary. Nick McKittrick chose to not participate in this 
arrangement. Peter Brooks-Johnson and Robyn Perriss are members of the stakeholder pension plan and during 2014 the 
Company contributed £25,383 and £20,309 per annum respectively. The Company does not contribute to any personal 
pension arrangements.  Rightmove plc annual report 2014      59

How was pay linked to performance in 2014?
Annual bonus plan
The incentive for the financial year ended 31 December 2014 was in the form of a cash bonus of up to 50% of salary and a 
DSP bonus of up to 75% of salary (i.e. 125% in total). The bonus (both cash and DSP elements) was determined by a mixture 
of underlying operating profit performance (70%) and key performance indicators (30%) relating to underlying drivers of long-
term revenue growth.
When comparing performance against the 2014 bonus targets set, the Committee determined that 70% of the maximum 
achievable cash and DSP bonus should be paid to the executive directors. Accordingly, a cash bonus of 35% of base salary 
will be paid to the executives and 52.50% of base salary will be granted to the executives under the DSP , which will be 
deferred until March 2017. More details are provided in the table below:

(2)  The innovation revenue targets provided for 25% of this part of the bonus to become payable for achieving the threshold performance level through to 100% at 
the maximum performance level. The targets largely related to revenue from commercial, removals and other third party advertising services. The specific targets 
set for this part of the bonus were considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive given that an understanding of both the nature and scale of our new 
business initiatives could be to the advantage of our competitor companies. As a result these targets have not been disclosed and targets for new business 
activities for 2015 or subsequent years are not expected to be disclosed.
Long-term incentives
The PSP awards granted in March 2012 were subject to EPS (75% of the awards) and relative TSR (25% of the awards) 
performance conditions which related to the three year period ended 31 December 2014. 
The vesting schedule for the relative TSR element of executive directors’ 2012 PSP awards is set out below:
 % of award vesting 
Relative TSR condition  (maximum 25%)
Less than the Index 0%
Equal to the Index 6.25%
25% higher than the Index 25%
Intermediate performance Straight-line vesting
At the end of the performance period, Rightmove’s TSR was 88.7% compared to 73.9% for the FTSE250 Index. As this level 
of outperformance is between the performance targets (i.e. outperformed Index by 14.8%) 17.35% of awards (out of the 
maximum 25%) will vest from 2 March 2015.
Rightmove’s EPS growth is measured over a period of three financial years (2012 to 2014). The EPS figure used is 
equivalent to Rightmove’s reported diluted underlying EPS but with a standard UK tax rate applied (Normalised EPS) and the 
vesting schedule is set out overleaf: 60  rightmove.co.uk

Share awards granted during the year
On 3 March 2014 Nick McKittrick, Peter Brooks-Johnson and Robyn Perriss were awarded shares under the PSP , which vest 
in March 2017, and are subject to a mixture of EPS (75% of the awards) and relative TSR (25% of the awards) performance with 
the greater weighting on EPS to reflect its particular relevance to the performance of the business. 
Executive  Basis of grant Number of shares Face value of award

Nick McKittrick  200% of base salary 30,018 £799,980
Peter Brooks-Johnson  200% of base salary 25,140 £669,981
Robyn Perriss  200% of base salary 19,887 £529,989
 
(1) Based on the average mid market share price for the three consecutive days prior to grant, taken from the Daily Official List, of £26.65.
The vesting schedule for the relative TSR element of 
executive directors’ 2014 PSP awards is set out below.  
It is consistent with the TSR condition used for previous 
grants under the share option scheme. Performance will  
be measured over three financial years.
 % of award vesting 
Relative TSR condition  (maximum 25%)
Less than the Index 0%
Equal to the Index 6.25%
25% higher than the Index 25%
Intermediate performance Straight-line vesting
Rightmove’s EPS growth will be measured over a period of 
three financial years (2014-2016). The EPS figure used will  
be equivalent to the Group’s underlying basic EPS (before 
share-based payments, NI on share-based incentives and  
no related adjustments for tax). 
The following vesting schedule will apply for executive 
directors’ awards granted in 2014:
Underlying basic EPS growth  % of award vesting 
from 2014 to 2016  (maximum 75%)
Less than 40% 0%
Equal to 40% 18.75%
Between 40% and 70% Between 18.75% and 75%  
on a straight-line basis
Equal to or greater than 70% 75%
The benchmark underlying basic EPS for the financial year 
2013 from which these targets will be measured is 81.04p.
Normalised EPS growth  % of award vesting 
from 2012 to 2014  (maximum 75%)
Less than 30% 0%
30% 18.75%
50% 75%
Between 30% and 50% Straight-line vesting
At the end of the performance period, Normalised EPS was 92.6p which from a Normalised EPS base of 47.5p results  
in growth of 95% and exceeded the maximum 50% EPS growth target and will result in full vesting of this part of the award 
(maximum of 75%) from 2 March 2015.  Rightmove plc annual report 2014      61

 Equal to the Index 6.25%
 25% higher than the Index 25%
 Intermediate performance Straight-line vesting
 Rightmove’s EPS growth will be measured over a period of three financial years (2013 to 2015). The EPS figure used will be equivalent to the Normalised EPS. 
 The following vesting schedule will apply for executive directors’ awards granted in 2013:
 Normalised EPS growth from 2013 to 2015 % of award vesting (maximum 75%)
 Less than 22.5% 0%
 22.5% 18.75%

  Assuming no change in the enacted corporation tax rate of 24% before the end of the three year performance period, the benchmark Normalised EPS for the 
financial year 2012 from which these growth targets will be measured is 63.01p.
(9)  On 3 March 2014 Nick McKittrick, Peter Brooks-Johnson and Robyn Perriss were awarded 9,224, 6,918 and 4,353 nil cost deferred shares respectively under the

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1.  Our opinion on the financial statements is 
unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Rightmove plc  
for the year ended 31 December 2014 set out on pages 70  
to 107. In our opinion: 
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended; 
•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU); 
•  the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006; and 
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
We summarise below the risks of material misstatement that 
had the greatest effect on our audit, our key audit procedures 
to address those risks and our findings from those 
procedures in order that the Company’s members as a body 
may better understand the process by which we arrived at 
our audit opinion. Our findings are the result of procedures 
undertaken in the context of and solely for the purpose of our 
statutory audit opinion on the financial statements as a whole 
and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do 
not express discrete opinions on separate elements of the 
financial statements.
Revenue recognition (£167,012,000)
Refer to page 33 (Corporate governance report), page 81 
(accounting policy) and pages 84 to 86 (financial disclosures)
•  The risk: Revenue primarily consists of subscription fees 
and customer spend on additional advertising products 
in respect of properties listed on rightmove.co.uk and is 
recognised over the period of subscription or as additional 
advertising products are used. Individual contracts exist 
with each customer, which include a variety of differing 
terms and conditions. In addition, Rightmove operate a 
number of membership offers during the year, some of 
which include discounted or free periods. Given the variety 
of individual contract terms and that revenue is the most 
material figure in the financial statements, we consider a 
significant risk exists in relation to revenue recognition; 
specifically that the billing of customers is in line with the 
appropriate contract, with resulting revenue recognised 
appropriately, and that membership incentives are 
recognised in the period to which they relate.
•  Our response: Our audit procedures included testing the 
design, implementation and operating effectiveness, of the 
Group’s controls over the billing of customers in line with 
contract terms and product usage. For Agency and New 
Homes, which are the most significant revenue streams,  
we performed detailed procedures using computer assisted 
audit techniques to analyse the amounts billed to customers 
by product in order to identify trends and investigate any 
anomalies and outliers. We considered whether amounts 
billed had been recognised as revenue appropriately by 
comparing the period of subscription or usage of additional 
advertising products to the timing of revenue recognition. 
We inspected significant contracts signed in the year on 
a sample basis, to assess whether revenue has been 
recognised in accordance with the specific contract terms 
and conditions and relevant accounting standards. For new 
membership offers operated during the year, we challenged 
the estimates applied in calculating the impact of discounts 
or free periods by inspecting details of the membership 
contracts and subscription numbers for the year. 
We assessed the appropriateness of deferred revenue at 
the period end with reference to subscription fee billings 
in December and specific product deferrals, where 
amounts are billed in advance but revenue recognition 
deferred until use or expiry. We also considered the 
adequacy of the Group’s accounting policy and disclosures 
(see Notes 1, 2 and 5) in respect of revenue recognition, 
and whether disclosures properly reflect the risks inherent 
in recognising revenue.
•  Our findings: Our testing did not identify weaknesses in the 
design and operation of controls that would have required 
us to expand the extent of our planned detailed testing.  
Our computer assisted audit techniques did not reveal any 
unexplained differences and we found that revenue was 
recognised in line with the period of subscription or usage of 
additional products. We found that revenue was recognised 
in respect of the significant contracts selected for testing in 
line with the underlying contractual terms and we found no 
errors in the Group’s calculation of deferred revenue at the 
year end. We found the group’s disclosures to be 
proportionate in their description of the assumptions  
and estimates made by the group. 68  rightmove.co.uk

Share-based incentives and related deferred tax 
charge and asset (£2,728,000, £1,114,000 and 
£4,224,000 respectively)
Refer to page 33 (Corporate governance report), pages 80  
to 82 (accounting policy) and pages 94 to 95; 100 to 104 
(financial disclosures).
•  The risk: The Group provides share-based incentive plans 
allowing executive directors and other selected senior 
management to acquire shares in the parent Company. 
Significant focus is placed upon the share-based incentive 
charge for the year in the Annual Report, specifically on the 
face of the Income Statement. Each scheme differs based 
on the terms of the scheme and different schemes have 
varying levels of complexity. The choice of valuation 
methodology and certain of the key inputs used to calculate 
the total charge to be recognised for new grants, specifically 
the leaver assumptions and performance conditions, require 
significant estimation and judgement in their selection, and 
impact on the derived fair value, charge and related deferred 
tax balances. As such they are key judgemental areas that 
our audit concentrated on. 
•  Our response: In this area our audit procedures included 
evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the 
Group to value new schemes in the year and to estimate  
the number of shares that will eventually be issued. For key 
inputs we critically assessed the reasonableness of the 
Group’s assumptions by reference to external data and 
historical trends, along with reports from the Group’s 
external consultants. In addition, we used our own tax 
specialists to consider the accuracy of the related deferred 
tax charge and asset for the year. We also assessed 
whether the Group’s disclosures in these areas (see Note  
16 and Note 24) are appropriate.
•  Our findings: We found the assumptions and resulting 
estimates used in the valuation models to be mildly cautious 
in respect of leavers and otherwise balanced and we found 
no errors in the calculation of the related deferred tax  
charge and asset. We found the Group’s disclosures to be 
proportionate in their description of the assumptions and 
estimates made by the Group and the sensitivity of the 
share-based payments charge to changes in those 
assumptions and estimates.
3.  Our application of materiality and an overview of 
the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £5.8m, determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group profit before tax of which it represents 4.75%.
We report to the Audit Committee all uncorrected 
misstatements we identified through our audit with a value in 
excess of £0.29m, in addition to other audit misstatements 
below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We report misstatements corrected by 
management where we believe these will assist the audit 
committee in fulfilling its governance responsibilities.
The Group audit team also audits the single wholly owned 
subsidiary, Rightmove Group Limited with a component 
materiality of £5.0m. The Group procedures covered all of  
the operations of the Group, and accordingly 100% of total 
Group revenue; 100% of Group profit before taxation and 
100% of total Group assets were audited.
4.  Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006;
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements; and
•  the information given in the corporate governance 
statement set out on pages 34 to 35 with respect to internal 
control and risk management systems in relation to financial 
reporting processes and about share capital structures is 
consistent with the financial statements.  Rightmove plc annual report 2014      69
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
5.  We have nothing to report in respect of the 
matters on which we are required to report 
by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identified other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, 
or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
•  we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy; or
•  the Corporate Governance Report does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by 
us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or 
•  the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
•  the directors’ statement, set out on page 35, in relation to 
going concern;  
•  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 
26 to 31 relating to the Company’s compliance with the ten 
provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 40, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of 
the scope of an audit of accounts is provided on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/

1 General information
Rightmove plc (the Company) is a company registered in England (Company no. 6426485) domiciled in the United Kingdom (UK). The 
consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014 comprise the Company and its interest 
in its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). Its principal business is the operation of the rightmove.co.uk website, which has the 
largest audience of any UK property website (as measured by page impressions).
The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014 are available upon request to the 
Company Secretary from the Company’s registered office at Turnberry House, 30 Caldecotte Lake Drive, Caldecotte, Milton Keynes, 
MK7 8LE or are available on the corporate website at plc.rightmove.co.uk.
Statement of compliance
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Board of directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (Adopted IFRSs) and issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB).
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 27 February 2015.
Basis of preparation
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the 
exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form 
a part of these approved financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements are in accordance with Adopted IFRSs and  
are the same as those applied by the Group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2013.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements was adopted in the year to replace IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.  
The adoption of IFRS 10 has had no material impact on the financial statements.
 
Going concern
Throughout 2014, the Group was debt free and has continued to generate significant cash. The Group has net cash balances of 
£11,205,000 at 31 December 2014 (2013: £6,799,000). During the year the business returned £103,400,000 of cash to shareholders.
The Group entered into a 12 month agreement with HSBC for a £10,000,000 committed revolving loan facility on 10 February 2014.  
This agreement has been extended for a further 12 months and will expire on 9 February 2016. To date no amount has been drawn under 
this facility.
After making enquiries, the Board of directors has a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources and 
banking facilities to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Board of directors continues to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and financial statements.
Further information regarding the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 23. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described on pages 13 to 16. In addition Note 4 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit 
risk and liquidity risk.

1 General information continued
Capital structure
The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 14 November 2007 under the Companies Act 1985 as a private 
company limited by shares with the name Rightmove Group Limited, registered no. 6426485. The Company was re-registered as a public 
limited company under the name Rightmove Group plc on 29 November 2007. On 28 January 2008 the Company became the holding 
company of Rightmove Group Limited (formerly Rightmove plc, Company no. 3997679) and its subsidiaries pursuant to a Scheme of 
Arrangement under s425 of the Companies Act 1985. The shares in the Company were admitted to trading on the Official List of the London 
Stock Exchange on 28 January 2008 and the Company immediately changed its name to Rightmove plc. Details of the share capital of the 
Company are disclosed in Note 22.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant 
activities of an entity and has the ability to affect the returns the Group will receive as a result of its involvement with the entity. In assessing 
control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated and Company financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods, if applicable.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated and Company financial statements is included in the following notes:
Note 2 (j)  Revenue recognition and the associated deferral, specifically regarding the period to which services relate, when specific 
products have expired and the recognition of revenue from membership offers including discounted or free periods.
Notes 16 and 24  The choice of valuation methodology and the inputs and assumptions used to calculate the initial fair value for new  
share-based incentives granted and the rate at which the related deferred tax asset is measured. The key estimates used 
in calculating the fair value of the options are the fair value of the Company’s shares at the grant date, expected share 
price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and weighted average expected life of the instrument. In respect 
of share options granted to employees, the number of options that are expected to vest is based upon estimates of the 
number of employees that will forfeit their awards through leaving the Group and the likelihood of any non-market-based 
performance conditions being satisfied. Management regularly performs a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares 
that are expected to vest; this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
2 Significant accounting policies
(a)  Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment in the parent Company financial statements. 
(b)  Intangible assets
 (i)  Goodwill
  All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries 
is included in intangible assets. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the 
difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
  In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount previously 
recorded under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The classification and accounting treatment of business 
combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 were not reconsidered in preparing the Group’s opening IFRS statement of financial 
position at 1 January 2004.
Notes continued Rightmove plc annual report 2014      79
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
  Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. This applies to all 
goodwill arising both before and after 1 January 2004.
 
 (ii)  Research and development
  The Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing property 
website. Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
  Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new product or 
substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and commercially feasible and 
the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
  The expenditure capitalised includes subcontractors and direct labour. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised 
only when it increases the economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed  
when incurred.
 
 (iii)  Computer software and licences
  Computer software and externally acquired software licences are capitalised and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use. Amortisation is provided to write off the cost  
less the estimated residual value of the computer software or licence by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic  
life as follows:
 Computer software 20.0% – 33.3% per annum
 Software licences 20.0% – 33.3% per annum
(c) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is provided to write off 
the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic 
lives as follows:
Office equipment, fixtures & fittings 20.0% per annum
Computer equipment 20.0% – 33.3% per annum
Leasehold improvements remaining life of the lease
(d) Impairment
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the greater of their fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an 
asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value  
of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 80  rightmove.co.uk
Notes continued
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Investments are assessed for possible impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the investments may be below the 
Company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written 
down to its fair value and the amount written off is included in profit or loss. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other  
than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance and  
the Company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the 
investment’s market value.
(e) Financial instruments
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are recognised at fair value less any impairment loss. A provision for impairment of trade 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
receivables’ original terms.
Inter-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from inter-group transactions, are eliminated in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are recognised at fair value. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less. 
(g) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
A provision is maintained in respect of lease dilapidations based on an estimated cost to make good per square foot multiplied by the floor 
area of each premise.
(h) Employee benefits
 (i) Pensions
  The Group provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme (a defined contribution pension plan) into which employees may elect to 
contribute via salary exchange. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit 
expense in profit or loss when they are due.
 (ii) Employee share schemes
  The Group provides share-based incentive plans allowing executive directors and other selected senior management to acquire shares  
in the Company. An expense is recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to acquire equity settled share-based incentives.
  Fair value is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme. 
Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted 
average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), weighted average expected life of the 
instruments (based on historical experience and general option behaviour), expected dividends, and risk-free interest rates (based on 
government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the awards are not taken into account in determining 
the fair value.
  For share-based incentive awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based incentives is measured to 
reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. When either the employee or the 
Company chooses not to meet the non-vesting condition, the failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation and 
the cost that would have been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Rightmove plc annual report 2014      81
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
 (iii) Own shares held by The Rightmove Employees’ Share Trust (EBT)
  The EBT is treated as an agent of Rightmove Group Limited and as such EBT transactions are treated as being those of 
Rightmove Group Limited and are therefore reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. In particular, at a consolidated 
level, the EBT’s purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
 (iv) National Insurance (NI) on share-based incentives
  Employer’s NI is accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when share-based 
incentives are exercised. In the case of share options, it is provided on the difference between the share price at the reporting date and 
the average exercise price of share options. In the case of nil cost performance shares and deferred shares, it is provided based on the 
share price at the reporting date.
(i) Treasury shares and shares purchased for cancellation
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is 
recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are either held in treasury or cancelled.
(j) Revenue
Revenue principally represents the amounts receivable from customers in respect of membership to the rightmove.co.uk website. 
Agency, new homes, overseas and commercial revenue comprises subscriptions for core listing fees and amounts paid for additional 
advertising products. Contracts for these services are per branch or branch equivalent for agency and per development for new homes.  
They vary in length from one month to five years, but are typically for periods of six to 12 months. Revenue is recognised over the period 
of the contract or as additional products are used. Membership offers take place from time to time and may include discounted products 
and free periods. These are recognised on a monthly basis over the contract term.
Agency, overseas and commercial services are typically billed in advance with revenue deferred until the service commencement date.  
New homes developers are billed monthly in arrears. Where invoices are raised on other than a monthly basis, the amounts are recognised 
as deferred or accrued revenue and released to the profit or loss on a monthly basis in line with the provision of services as stipulated in the 
contract terms.
Data services revenue relates to fees generated for data and valuation services under a variety of contractual arrangements. Revenue  
is recognised when the service has been provided. Third party advertising revenue represents amounts paid in respect of non-property 
advertising on the rightmove.co.uk website and is recognised in the month in which the service is provided. Consumer services revenue 
principally relates to payment for leads and is recognised when the lead is generated. Data services, third party advertising and consumer 
services revenue is typically billed in arrears.
(k) Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, 
including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. An operating segment’s operating 
results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s Chief Executive Officer to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and 
assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available.
(l) Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Where cash is received in exchange for 
entering into a lease with rates above market value, this upfront payment is deferred and released on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(m) Financial income and expenses
Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances, deposits and dividend income. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, 
using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised on the date that the Company’s right to receive payment is established.
Financial expenses comprise banking facility fees and bank charges and the unwinding of the discount on provisions.
(n) Taxation
Income tax on the results for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period net of any charge or credit posted directly to equity, using tax 
rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. 82  rightmove.co.uk
Notes continued
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of 
goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and 
the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of 
deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax 
rates enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised.
In accordance with IAS 12, the Group policy in relation to the recognition of deferred tax on share-based incentives is to include the income 
tax effect of the tax deduction in profit or loss to the value of the income tax charge on the cumulative IFRS 2 charge. The remainder of the 
income tax effect of the tax deduction is recognised in equity.
(o) Dividends
Dividends unpaid at the reporting date are only recognised as a liability (and deduction to equity) at that date to the extent that they are 
appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed 
in the notes to the financial statements.
(p) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic, diluted and underlying earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing 
the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the 
year, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all potential dilutive instruments, 
which comprise share-based incentives granted to employees. The calculation of underlying EPS is disclosed in Note 11.
3 IFRSs not yet applied
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective for the year ended 
31 December 2014 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has been issued in the year, although not yet endorsed in the EU, and an exercise is 
underway to assess the impact that this will have on revenue recognition.
4 Risk and capital management
Overview
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• credit risk
• liquidity risk
• market risk
This note presents information about the Group and Company’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for measuring and managing risk and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout 
these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The primary 
method by which risks are monitored and managed by the Group is through the monthly Executive Management Board, where any 
significant new risks or change in status to existing risks will be discussed and actions taken as appropriate.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in 
market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a 
disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s internal controls and reviews the adequacy of the 
risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. Rightmove plc annual report 2014      83
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or banking institution fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group provides credit to 
customers in the normal course of business. The Group provides its services to a wide range of customers in the UK and overseas and 
therefore believes it has no material concentration of credit risk.
More than 90.0% (2013: 90.0%) of the Group’s agency and new homes customers pay via monthly direct debit, minimising the risk of 
non-payment. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and 
other receivables based on individually identified loss exposures. 
The Group’s treasury policy is to monitor cash balances on a daily basis to ensure that no more than £30,000,000 is held with any  
single institution.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled 
by delivering cash. The Group and Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient 
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage 
to the Group’s reputation.
The Group’s revenue model is largely subscription-based, which results in a regular level of cash conversion allowing it to service working 
capital requirements.
The Group and Company ensure that they have sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses excluding the potential 
impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters. Throughout the year, the Group typically  
had sufficient cash on demand to meet operational expenses, before financing activities, for a period of 105 days (2013: 136 days).
The Group entered into a 12 month agreement with HSBC for a £10,000,000 committed revolving loan facility on 10 February 2014.  
This agreement has been extended for a further 12 months and will expire on 9 February 2016. To date no amount has been drawn under  
this facility.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the Group’s income. The objective 
of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
 (i) Currency risk
  All of the Group’s sales and more than 95.0% (2013: 95.0%) of the Group’s purchases are Sterling denominated, accordingly it has no 
significant currency risk.
 (ii) Interest rate risk
 The Group and Company have no interest bearing financial liabilities. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash balances.
Capital management
The Board of directors’ policy is to maintain an efficient statement of financial position so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence 
and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of directors considers that the future working capital and capital expenditure 
requirements of the Group will continue to be low and accordingly return on capital measures are not key performance targets. The Board of 
directors monitors the spread of the Company’s shareholders as well as underlying basic earnings per share. The Board of directors has a 
progressive dividend policy and also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders in relation to profit growth. The Board’s policy is  
to return surplus capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks.
The Company purchases its own shares in the market; the timing of these purchases depends on market conditions. In 2014,  
3,122,418 (2013: 2,780,380) shares were bought back and were cancelled at an average price of £23.66 (2013: £21.77).

4 Risk and capital management continued
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Group’s processes, personnel, 
technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and 
regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour. Operational risks arise from all of the Group’s operations.
The Group’s objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of financial losses and damage to the Group’s reputation 
with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management 
within each business unit. This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational 
risk in the following areas: 
• requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions;
• requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions; 
• compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements;
• documentation of controls and procedures;
•  requirements for the periodic assessment of operational risks faced and the adequacy of controls and procedures to address the  
risks identified;
• requirements for reporting of operational losses and proposed remedial action;
• development and regular testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans; 
• training and professional development; and
• risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective.
5 Operating segments
The Group determines and presents operating segments based on internal information that is provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is 
the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group’s reportable segments are as follows:
• The Agency segment which provides resale and lettings property advertising services on www.rightmove.co.uk; and
•  The New Homes segment which provides property advertising services to new home developers and housing associations on  
www.rightmove.co.uk.
The Other segment which represents activities under the reportable segments threshold, comprises overseas and commercial property 
advertising services and non-property advertising services which include our third party and consumer services as well as data and valuation 
services. Management monitors the business segments at a revenue and trade receivables level separately for the purpose of making 
decisions about resources to be allocated and of assessing performance. All revenues in both years are derived from third parties and there 
are no inter-segment revenues. Rightmove plc annual report 2014      85
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Operating costs, financial income, financial expenses and income taxes in relation to the Agency, New Homes and the Other segment are 
managed on a centralised basis at a Rightmove Group Limited level and as there are no internal measures of individual segment profitability, 
relevant disclosures have been shown under the heading of Central in the table below.

Reconciliation of effective tax rate
The Group’s income tax expense for the year is lower (2013: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 21.5% 
(2013: 23.25%). The differences are explained below:
      Year ended  Year ended 
      31 December 2014  31 December 2013

Adjustment to current tax charge in respect of prior years   (499) (169)
Adjustment to deferred tax charge in respect of prior years   9 3
      25,857 22,680
The Group’s consolidated effective tax rate on the profit of £122,038,000 for the year ended 31 December 2014 is 21.2% (2013: 23.4%). 
The difference between the standard rate and effective rate at 31 December 2014 is primarily attributable to a prior year adjustment in 
respect of research and development 0.4% (2013: 0.2%), offset by disallowable expenditure and a reduction in the rate at which the 
deferred tax asset is recognised of 0.1% (2013: 0.1%).

The 2013 final dividend paid on 6 June 2014 was £16,768,000 being a difference of £140,000 compared to that reported in the 2013

Impairment testing for cash generating units containing goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s operations which represent the lowest level within the Group at 
which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, which is not higher than the Group’s operating segments as reported in Note 5.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each unit are as follows:
      31 December 2014  31 December 2013 
      £000  £000
Agency     732 732
The carrying value of the £732,000 purchased goodwill in Agency, arising pre-transition to IFRS, is reviewed annually for impairment. Due to 
its low level of significance the disclosures as required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets have not been made.

In 2008, the Company became the holding company of Rightmove Group Limited (formerly Rightmove plc, Company no. 3997679) and  
its subsidiaries pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under s425 of the Companies Act 1985 by way of a share-for-share exchange.  
Following the Scheme of Arrangement, the Company underwent a court-approved capital reduction. The consolidated assets and liabilities  
of the Group immediately after the Scheme were substantially the same as the consolidated assets and liabilities of the Group immediately 
prior to the Scheme.
Following the capital reconstruction in 2008 all employees’ share-based incentives were transferred to the new holding company,  
Rightmove plc. In addition certain directors’ contracts of employment were transferred from Rightmove Group Limited to Rightmove plc, 
whilst all other employees remained employed by Rightmove Group Limited. Accordingly the share-based payments charge has been 
split between the Company and Rightmove Group Limited with £1,084,000 (2013: £792,000) being recognised in the Company accounts 
as a capital contribution to its subsidiary.

Provisions    82 84
Deferred tax assets   4,503 5,635
The decrease in the deferred tax asset relating to share-based incentives at 31 December 2014 is due to the reduction in the Company’s year 
end share price from £27.40 to £22.48 and the exercise of share-based incentives, partly offset by the impact of new share awards in the year.

Share buyback
In June 2007, the Company commenced a share buyback programme to purchase its own ordinary shares. The total number of shares 
bought back in 2014 was 3,122,418 (2013: 2,780,380) representing 3.1% (2013: 2.7%) of the ordinary shares in issue (excluding shares 
held in treasury). All of the shares bought back in both years were cancelled. The shares were acquired on the open market at a total 
consideration (excluding costs) of £73,867,000 (2013: £60,537,000). The maximum and minimum prices paid were £27.88 (2013: £26.50) 
and £19.38 (2013: £14.49) per share respectively.
EBT shares reserve
This reserve represents the carrying value of own shares held by the EBT. 185,187 (2013: 2,971,962) share-based incentives were exercised 
by Group employees during the year at an average price of £1.71 (2013: £3.39) per ordinary share. An additional 2,851 shares were issued 
as a result of rolled up dividend payments in relation to performance shares.
In November 2014, the Group established the Rightmove Share Incentive Plan (SIP). Employees were offered 100 shares as a one-off gift, 
subject to a three year service period, with effect from 1 January 2015. The EBT purchased 38,300 shares in December 2014 to fund the 
share requirements of the SIP .
At 31 December 2014 the EBT held 596,499 (2013: 740,324) ordinary shares in the Company of £0.01 each, representing 0.6% 
(2013: 0.7%) of the ordinary shares in issue (excluding shares held in treasury). The market value of the shares held in the EBT at 
31 December 2014 was £13,409,000 (2013: £20,285,000). Rightmove plc annual report 2014      99

Treasury shares
This represents the cost of acquiring 2,505,430 shares held in treasury. These shares were bought back in 2008 at an average price of  
£4.76 and may be used to satisfy certain share-based incentive awards.
Reverse acquisition reserve
This reserve resulted from the acquisition of Rightmove Group Limited by the Company and represents the difference between the value of the 
shares acquired at 28 January 2008 and the nominal value of the shares issued.
Other reserves
Awards relating to share-based incentives made to Rightmove Group Limited employees have been treated as a deemed capital contribution. 
The principal movement in other reserves for the year comprises £1,084,000 (2013: £792,000) in respect of the share-based incentives charge 
for employees of Rightmove Group Limited. In addition other reserves include £294,000 (2013: £263,000) of Capital Redemption Reserve. 
A movement of £31,000 (2013: £28,000) has been recorded in relation to the nominal value of ordinary shares cancelled during the year.
24 Share-based payments
The Group and Company operate share-based incentive schemes for executive directors and other selected senior management employees. 
Since flotation, the Company has awarded share options under the Rightmove Unapproved Executive Share Option Plan (Unapproved Plan) 
and the Rightmove Approved Executive Share Option Plan (Approved Plan). The Group also operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
(Sharesave Plan), a Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSP) and in May 2011 the Rightmove Performance Share Plan (PSP) was introduced. 
All share-based incentives are subject to a service condition. Such conditions are not taken into account in the fair value of the service 
received. The fair value of services received in return for share-based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of share-based 
incentives granted. The estimate of the fair value of the share-based incentives is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes 
pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
During 2013 the Group amended the rules of the Unapproved Plan to enable such awards to be net settled whereby the number of shares 
released by the EBT and sold to satisfy the award is equivalent to the gain due to the option holder. Consequently no proceeds are received by 
the EBT on exercise of unapproved share options.
The total share-based payments charge for the year relating to all share-based incentive plans was £2,728,000 (2013: £2,408,000). 
A 2% reduction or increase in the employee leaver assumption (excluding executive directors) for the DSP and the PSP would have increased/
decreased the share-based payments charge in the year by £23,000 (2013: £40,000). 
The Company charge for the year was £1,644,000 (2013: £1,616,000).
NI is being accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when the awards are exercised, 
based on the share price at the reporting date. NI for the year ended 31 December 2014 relating to all awards was a credit of £194,000 
compared to a charge of £4,538,000 in the prior year, due to a reduction in the share price from £27.40 at 31 December 2013 to £22.48 at 
31 December 2014.
The total Company NI for the year was a credit of £301,000 and a charge of £4,043,000 in the prior year.

Sharesave Plan
The Group operates an HMRC Approved Sharesave Plan under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary shares in the 
Company at up to 20% less than the market price at invitation, in three years’ time, dependent on their entering into a contract to make 
monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period. These funds are used to fund the option exercise. No performance 
criteria are applied to the exercise of Sharesave options. The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the 
Sharesave Plan are as follows:
          Employee turnover 
          before vesting/  
    Share price Exercise Expected  Risk free Dividend non-vesting Fair value

Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date.
The requirement that an employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave Plan is a non-vesting condition. This feature 
has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the Black Scholes pricing model. 
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the 
share price and past employee behaviour.

The Company charge for the year was £3,000 (2013: £2,000).
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The PSP permits awards of nil cost options or contingent shares which will only vest in the event of prior satisfaction of a performance condition.
140,618 PSP awards were made on 3 March 2014 (the Grant Date) subject to EPS and TSR performance. Performance will be measured 
over three financial years (1 January 2014 – 31 December 2016). The vesting in March 2017 (Vesting Date) of 25% of the 2014 PSP award 
will be dependent on a relative TSR performance condition measured over a three year performance period and the vesting of the 75% of the 
2014 PSP award will be dependent on the satisfaction of an EPS growth target measured over a three year performance period. PSP award 
holders are entitled to receive dividends accruing between the Grant Date and the Vesting Date and this value will be delivered in shares. Rightmove plc annual report 2014      103
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The PSP awards have been valued using the Monte Carlo model for the TSR element and the Black Scholes model for the EPS element  
and the resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the period between the Grant Date and the Vesting Date.

(1) For details of TSR and EPS performance conditions refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 41 to 66.
(2) The TSR performance condition for PSPs with a grant date of 2 March 2012 was determined to be 17.35% out of the maximum 25% for the 
TSR element of share awards. The EPS element, being a maximum of 75% of the share awards, was met in full as a result of delivering 
normalised EPS growth of over 100%. 92.35% of the awards are expected to vest. This will result in 9,145 shares lapsing in March 2015.
Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the Grant Date.

Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSP)
In March 2009 a DSP was established which allows executive directors and other selected senior management the opportunity to earn  
a bonus determined as a percentage of base salary settled in nil cost deferred shares. The award of shares under the plan is contingent on 
the satisfaction of pre-set internal targets relating to underlying drivers of long-term revenue growth (the Performance Period). The right to  
the shares is deferred for two years from the date of the award (the Vesting Period) and potentially forfeitable during that period should the 
employee leave employment. The deferred share awards have been valued using the Black Scholes model and the resulting share-based 
payments charge is being spread evenly over the combined Performance Period and Vesting Period of the shares, being three years. 104  rightmove.co.uk

The Group has identified specific balances for which it has provided an impairment allowance on a line by line basis across all ledgers, in 
both years. No general impairment allowance has been provided in either year. 
The allowance accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery 
of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the financial asset directly.

are due within six months of the balance sheet date.

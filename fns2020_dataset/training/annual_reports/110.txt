888 Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
“Our goal is to deliver strong, sustainable, 
long-term earnings growth by maximising 
revenues and expanding margins.”
Richard Kilsby Chairman
2013 was a year of strategic development for 888 as we 
positioned ourselves to take advantage of significant 
opportunities as new markets became regulated and opened 
up to online gaming and high-growth mobile channels 
developed. This was underpinned by excellent momentum 
across our established business streams which delivered 
another record performance driven by our excellent customer 
offering and targeted marketing.
The global online gaming market has dynamic growth 
characteristics, providing 888 with multiple development 
opportunities given our ability to innovate, international reach 
and industry leading technology platform. These enable 
us to enter new markets quickly and effectively and focus 
our marketing initiatives highly efficiently. In particular we 
continued to innovate in mobile with significant increases in 
revenue and new depositors achieved through this rapidly 
growing channel. 
We have entered newly regulated markets in the US and 
continued to develop our successful operations in Spain 
and Italy. During 2013 we completed a number of strategic 
partnerships which position us strongly in the emerging US 
regulated market. Our distinct approach gives us significant 
financial firepower to take advantage of this opportunity and 
we are encouraged by progress to date in Nevada, New Jersey  
and Delaware.
Financial results and dividend
2013 was another record year for 888. We increased revenue 
to a record level of US$401 million, of which 88% was from 
our B2C operations. We continued to make significant 
investments in the future through product development and 
cost effective customer acquisition whilst increasing Adjusted 
EBITDA* by 13% to US$76 million (2012: US$67 million) and 
profit after tax by 41% to US$50 million (2012: US$35 million). 
888 was highly cash generative during the year holding 
US$116 million of cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 
2013 (2012: US$82 million) with US$55 million liabilities to 
customers (2012: US$49 million). At 31 December 2013,  
888 had 15.5 million Casino, Poker and Sport real money 
registered accounts, representing a 19% increase from 2012.
Given the strong financial performance of the Group, the 
Board is recommending a final dividend of 4.0¢ per share 
(which together with the interim dividend equals 7.0¢ per  
share in accordance with our dividend policy) and an 
additional one-off 7.0¢ per share, bringing the total for the  
year to 14.0¢ per share (2012: 9.0¢ per share). 
Winning team
888 has world class talent with a team of more than 1,600 
highly skilled and dedicated staff. They are the driving force 
behind our success including the strong performance in 2013. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all my colleagues 
for their excellent contribution and commitment to fulfilling 
the ambitions we have for the business.
Our values
Our values and a strong culture are key to our success with 
a responsible gaming environment for our customers at the 
centre of all our endeavors. We continuously create innovative 
ways (such as our sophisticated Observer System) to ensure 
that all those who visit our site can do so with confidence and 
safety, and that those for whom our games are not intended 
are not drawn into a gaming environment.
Outlook
888 has world class technology and products, a truly 
international breadth of operations, and a dedicated and 
expert team. These are our key strengths as we continue to 
grow and unlock new market opportunities. I am confident we 
have the right strategy to deliver a truly satisfying experience 
for our customers and strong, sustainable, long-term earnings 
growth for our shareholders.

“A record-breaking year for 888.”
Brian Mattingley Chief Executive Officer
2013 Overview 
2013 was a very busy but also exceptionally rewarding year 
for 888. I am delighted to report that we have delivered 
record-breaking revenue; increased our profitability; remained 
highly cash generative and delivered greater returns to our 
shareholders through a 56% increase to the dividend. 
Our operational achievements in 2013 are equally impressive. 
We continued to deliver product innovation, ensuring that our 
customers are provided with the most enjoyable games in the 
safest possible environment. We made further developments 
to our industry-leading ‘smart marketing’ so that we are able 
to attract more players to the 888 brand and increase their 
life time value. We delivered excellent progress in our core 
markets, continued to develop our offering in Italy and built 
on momentum in Spain where we have quickly developed a 
leading market position. We delivered another very strong 
performance in Casino and made further market share gains 
in Poker, advancing to number two in the PokerScout global 
rankings at the year end. 
All of this was achieved whilst devoting significant energy 
and resources to preparing 888 for launch in the US market. 
I am incredibly proud to say that 888 is the only operator 
currently present in all three regulated states as we execute 
our strategy in what is potentially the largest online gaming 
market globally. This remarkable achievement is testament to 
the strength of our product, technology and marketing but 
also, and most crucially, the hard work, dedication and talent 
of our team. I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
each of them for their fantastic efforts during the year.
I am delighted with 888’s achievements in 2013 and look 
forward to the year ahead with continued confidence. 
Market Overview
The online gaming market is dynamic and fast-growing. 
Growth over the coming years will continue to be driven by 
a combination of customers responding to innovative games 
that deliver a richer entertainment experience, the growing 
use of mobile devices that improve accessibility, increased 
confidence in secure low-cost payment mechanisms and an 
expanding customer demographic, partly driven by regulatory 
trends that are opening up more markets to online gaming.
It is forecast that the value of the global online gaming market 
will be approximately €31.5 billion by 2015, representing a 
CAGR of more than 9% from 2012*. This does not take account 
of the additional opportunities being opened up in the United 
States, which represents a potentially massive opportunity 
for the industry. Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey were 
regulated by the end of 2013 and other States are expected to 
make significant progress towards regulation this coming year. 
As regulation continues, analysts predict that the US could 
become the largest online gaming market in the world.
In more mature markets such as the United Kingdom,  
we anticipate that there will be further consolidation  
given the advantages of scale, brand and technology 
that larger operators can employ in a more competitive 
environment. This trend will be reinforced by the planned 
introduction of a Point of Consumption Tax in the UK, due to 
take effect from December 2014. 
Online mobile gaming (on portable devices such as tablets 
and smart-phones) is growing strongly reflecting consumers’ 
increasing comfort using their mobile phones and tablets for 
a wide range of products and services including banking and 
shopping.  Mobile devices will account for a much greater 
proportion of revenue as customers complement or replace 
their PC-based experience.
Our Strategy
888 is one of the world’s most popular online gaming 
entertainment and solutions providers. We have been at the 
forefront of the industry for more than 15 years by providing 
customers with market leading products that are localised to 
enable players to enjoy the games they want, in the languages 
they speak, in a safe and secure environment. 
The Group is structured into two business lines: B2C, with our 
market leading 888 brands and B2B, conducted as Dragonfish 
business. This structure allows the Group to leverage its 
technological, product, marketing and analytical strengths 
across B2C and B2B. This maximises their benefits and allows 
888 to compete successfully with and surpass our competition 
in both established and newer markets.

Chief Executive’s Review
Stock Code: 888
03
www.888holdingsplc.com Strategic Report 23124.04   25 March 2014 6:24 AM   Proof 11
There are clear opportunities in our global markets. We are 
well placed to deliver growth across all areas of our business, 
generating value for our shareholders as the well-established 
trend towards more international regulation continues and 
new technologies evolve. Our strategy to achieve this is made 
up of five key pillars:  
Growth and Development Of Our Core Products
We are focused on the growth and development of our core 
product groups which are Casino, Poker, Bingo and, to a lesser 
extent, Sport, where we work with a partner. These products 
are delivered via our B2C offering under 888’s own brands 
and to our B2B clients, through Dragonfish. 
‘Best-In-Class’ B2C Offer
Our B2C offering remains our core area and the bedrock of 
the success of the business. We continue to invest in and 
focus on ensuring that we deliver an unsurpassed customer 
experience by developing best-in-class products, maintaining 
excellence in customer service and ensuring we deliver a real 
value-for-money proposition to our customers. This together 
with our advanced modeling and analytics competencies that 
underpin our product development and CRM functions, help 
us achieve our objectives: to increase customer numbers, 
further develop brand loyalty and enhance customer lifetime 
value. 
Partner Of Choice through Dragonfish – Our B2B Offer
Dragonfish is 888’s B2B arm which offers clients best in class 
Total Gaming Services solutions that are tested vigorously to 
meet the regulatory requirements of the different jurisdictions 
where they are delivered. The quality of our offering, driven 
by our continuous investment in developing leading gaming 
platforms, means that we are fast establishing ourselves as 
the partner of choice in both regulated and newly regulating 
markets. This has been evidenced by the key strategic deals 
we have signed in 2013 alongside the deal we signed with 
Caesars Interactive Entertainment in 2012 enabling 888 to 
become the only online gaming operator with a presence in all 
three regulated US states.  
Driving Margin Growth through Operational Efficiencies
We remain focused on improving our margins by maximising 
operational efficiencies and driving volume. 2013 saw 
us continue to deliver progress in this area with further 
operational efficiencies driven across the business resulting in 
our Adjusted EBITDA margin improving to 18.9% (2012: 17.8%).
Expansion in Regulated Markets
We are focused on developing our presence in locally 
regulated markets. A key advantage of having our own 
technology, product development, marketing, analytics and 
CRM teams working closely together, is that it allows us to 
control the key drivers for our success. This ensures that we 
have the agility and skills to successfully and efficiently launch 
in newly regulated markets.
2013 has seen us build further momentum in the European 
markets of the UK, Spain and Italy and we are delighted 
with the progress we have continued to make, building 
strong market positions, especially in Spain. We classify the 
regulation of markets into three categories:
Chief Executive’s Review
04
888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2013 23124.04   25 March 2014 6:24 AM   Proof 11
Developmental – These are Jurisdictions where there is a 
strong indication that at some time in the near future the 
market will open. Here we talk to local industry participants 
with a view to forming partnerships to jointly explore 
opportunities. The US continues to be a primary focus 
for us and we believe our strong position in those states 
already regulated, combined with our focused strategy 
and established partnerships, position us well to take full 
advantage of the opportunities as regulation develops.   
Formational – These are markets where governments have 
announced regulation and are working towards a framework. 
Here we decide on a trading strategy, start dialogue with 
local partners either for B2C or B2B tie ups, and engage with 
regulators and governments to assist in shaping the industry 
framework. 
Implementational – These are markets where regulation has 
been introduced and we have already commenced trading. 
In 2013, we made excellent further progress and built strong 
positions in both Spain and Italy, both of which have recently 
regulated. In the second half of 2013, we commenced 
operations in Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey in the US and 
have made good progress at this early stage.
US Development – Strategy and Current Alliances
The US market is a demanding environment with strict 
regulatory requirements that vary from state to state, however 
the opportunities are potentially vast.
Our successful launch in the regulated US market to date is 
testament to our product, technology and marketing as well 
as the hard work, dedication and talent of our team who have 
been able to meet the complex regulatory requirements in 
each state to pressing deadlines. We have developed close 
working relationships with the various regulatory bodies in 
the US and these relationships, along with the experience 
and skills we have developed to date, mean that we are well 
positioned to exploit the US opportunity as further states 
open up to online gaming. 
In March 2013, 888 completed a major step in its US strategy 
by entering into a joint venture agreement with global 
investment firm Avenue Capital Group through one of its 
affiliates, to form AAPN Holdings LLC. AAPN Holdings was 
formed for the purposes of collaborating and capitalising on 
888’s and Avenue’s respective strengths and competencies 
in order to carry out legalised Internet based gambling 
operations in the United States. Pursuant to the agreement, 
Avenue committed to finance AAPN and its affiliates, while 
888 committed to provide its operational expertise, services 
and software.  In November 2013, one of 888’s subsidiaries 
received an authorization from the regulators in the State 
of New Jersey that enabled it to begin provision of Internet 
based gambling services in New Jersey, branded with the 
888Poker and 888Casino brands, under the authority of the 
regulatory license issued to Caesars Interactive Entertainment.
Our joint venture agreement crucially allows our US 
operations to make a positive contribution to Group 
revenue from the moment we launched, limiting our capital 
requirements and giving 888 the flexibility and financial 
capability to launch in more markets globally as they regulate.

Operations: Delivering on our plans
Success driven by Technology Leadership
Technology leadership remains the foundation of and driver 
for 888’s continued growth and success. Our best-in-breed 
platform combined with industry-leading back office systems 
and unique expertise in online marketing, all underpinned 
by state of the art analytics developed over more than 
15 years, delivers a powerful competitive advantage. Our 
technical edge and strong analytical capabilities together 
drive the success of our products from initial development 
right through to marketing and customer service. As a result 
we are able to focus our resources on individual customers 
to ensure they enjoy the best possible customer experience 
whilst growing their lifetime value to 888. We have continued 
to enhance our comprehensive analytical tools over time 
including the development and addition of new features 
to our CRM armoury, allowing our marketing spend to be 
increasingly effective and resulting in positive customer 
conversion and retention trends.
Our consistency and leadership was recognised at the 2013 
Egaming Review Operator Awards when 888 was the winner 
in the prestigious Poker Operator of the Year, Casino Operator 
of the Year and Best Operator of the Year categories. This was 
the third consecutive year 888 has won the Poker Operator 
of the Year award; a notable achievement that is testament 
to the strength of our platform and our relentless focus on 
continuous improvement and innovation. 
Continuous Innovation
Innovation is central to 888’s business and we have continued 
to invest in and develop our technology to maintain the 
delivery of best-in-class multi-regulation, multi-product and 
multi-platform offerings.
Successful online gaming destinations offer customers safe, 
enjoyable and innovative environments in which to play. 
As online gaming evolves, 888 is focused on innovating 
and developing at the fore of the industry to ensure that 
our players continue to be provided with the compelling 
and dynamic games that we are known for, thus enhancing 
customer satisfaction and ultimately encouraging repeat 
visits. 
As well as delivering continuous improvements across our 
core product verticals, a key area of focus this year has been 
888’s mobile offering. The increasing use of smartphones and 
tablet devices has resulted in mobile becoming one of the 
major engines of growth in online gaming. The rapid rate of 
adoption and growth in players across this channel presents 
unique challenges and opportunities for the industry as 
operators develop their understandings of customer habits 
and profiles on this relatively immature platform. 
888 has been quick to recognise the transformational nature 
of mobile for the online gaming industry. In 2013 we focused 
significant resources and investment on developing our 
products and understanding of this increasingly important 
channel. This has included the launch of new iOS and Android 
Poker and Casino apps during the course of the year along 
with a new and improved mobile Bingo product which has 
shown good customer traction. 
In 2012 we integrated our social gaming business into our 
technological organisation with our team working alongside 
our excellent product developers. We have continued to 
review our product suite in 2013 and look at new ways to 
develop this area of our customer offer. 
Further details of our Research and Development activities 
during the year are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 
25.
B2C
888 is a global gaming destination with core products in 
Casino, Poker and Bingo as well as an emerging offering 
in Sport. 888 has more than a dozen localised offerings 
providing players in more than 100 countries with the games 
they want in the languages they speak. 
Casino
Casino has enjoyed another strong year across a variety of 
markets, with particularly good growth generated across 
Europe, notably in Italy, the United Kingdom and in Spain, 
where we have maintained a market leading position. This 
significant achievement in part reflects the momentum we 
have continued to build during the course of the year around 
Casino 50, our casino offering which was launched in the 
first quarter of 2012. Our teams have continued to evolve and 
refresh our offer, enhancing the customer experience, launching 
new exclusive 888 developed slot games and supporting 
the product with strong marketing campaigns. We have 
remained highly focused on player acquisition and delivered 
very effective results with active Casino players continuing to 
increase against the prior year.
As well as increasing active customers we aim to further 
enhance brand loyalty amongst our players, which ultimately 
results in increased lifetime value. We have continued to make 
progress against this objective this year, in part as a result of 
the continuous development of our leading games portfolio 
and content, aided by the capabilities of our in-house Games 
Studio, ensuring that we remain at the fore  
of the online gaming experience.
Poker
Poker delivered another strong performance with the number 
of active players increasing more than 21% in Q4 against the 
prior year. This impressive growth, achieved in what remains 
a highly competitive market, is a result of the continued and 
relentless execution of our stated poker strategy of focusing 
on recreational players and providing them with a safe and 
enjoyable ecosystem. Our poker product is an accepted 
industry leader and we have continued to take market share

resulting in 888 rising from number four to number two in 
the global poker liquidity rankings according to PokerScout 
during the course of the year. This is an impressive achievement 
that is testament to our ongoing and meticulous network 
management in combination with our ‘smart marketing’ 
strategy. The increasing popularity of mobile has also 
contributed to our strong Poker performance, with mobile 
devices ideally suited to the preferences and playing habits 
of our target recreational players. Overall, we have delivered 
a good performance across territories with our leadership 
position in the Spanish market being particularly pleasing.
Bingo
The Bingo market remains a highly competitive and mature 
market that has proved to be challenging for operators over 
the course of 2013. However, at the start of the year we took 
proactive action and conducted a strategic review of this 
segment along with extensive market research. As a result, 
we have restructured the department into a fully integrated 
product vertical, replicating the approach we have in Casino 
and Poker, and have readdressed the whole look, shape and 
feel of our Bingo customer experience through a number 
of operational and technical improvements. Whilst Bingo 
revenue for 2013 was 16% lower compared to the prior year, 
we are delighted to have seen steady progress during the 
second half of the year, with revenue in Q4 up 7% against Q3, 
and feel confident that this improving trend will continue as 
we enter 2014. The improvement has also in part been driven 
by the re-launch of Bingo on mobile devices during the year 
which has demonstrated tremendous growth both in terms  
of player recruitment and generating deposits. 
Sport
888sport remains a relatively small part of our business. 
However, the sport market is important to our customers, 
especially around major sporting events, and also acts as an 
important acquisition tool enabling us to build our customer 
base and migrate players across products. 
We continue to recognise both the need to invest in our Sport 
offering and the growth opportunity in this market. In May 
we were delighted to announce that the Group had signed an 
agreement with Kambi Sports Solutions, a leading sportsbook 
supplier, to deliver a fully managed sportsbook solution to 888 
under the 888sport brand. We have now integrated our sport 
offering into our core platform, which allows us to leverage all 
of our market-leading capabilities. The agreement with Kambi 
has allowed us to offer a broader range of betting materials 
and products for the UK and other markets through both 
online and mobile channels. The improved 888sport offer was 
launched during the spring supported by an exciting marketing 
campaign and has delivered positive results with both margin 
and revenue improvement. 
B2B
Dragonfish, our B2B offering, is a key component of our 
regulated market strategy. Through our market leading B2C 
offering we have built a reputation for developing the best 
possible platform for operation and therefore an incentive 
for companies to partner with Dragonfish in order to gain a 
foothold in newly regulating territories. 
2013 has seen solid growth in this area of the business with 
revenues up 5% on the prior year as we have developed our 
B2B bingo platform as well as our Globalcom bingo network, 
where we remain one of the leading bingo software providers 
in the UK market supplying many leading brands, as well as 
the relationships with our US partners.
Success in New Markets
Our ability to launch in newly regulated markets with 
impressive results reflects our proven platform and 
technological systems and provides an excellent base for 
continuing growth. During the year we have continued to 
build impressively on our success in the recently regulated 
Spanish and Italian markets, further establishing the 888 
brand in Italy and developing a market-leading position  
in Spain. 
Undoubtedly the key focus for international expansion over 
the course of 2013 has been the US market as we prepared  
for the long-awaited regulation of Delaware, Nevada and  
New Jersey. 
As previously outlined, in the run up to regulation in the US 
market we had ensured that through our focused strategy 
and partnerships we would be ideally positioned to leverage 
own market leading platforms, technological innovation and 
marketing expertise as the market opened. Experiences learnt 
from our successful launches in Spain and Italy in recent years 
further strengthened our position to execute our US strategy 
and, by January 2014, our poker platform had built leading 
positions in each market. 
Our launch in each state has provided different challenges 
but has also provided a number of lessons and equipped 
us with new skills on which to build as we launch in further 
states as and when regulation occurs. We have made further 
investment in the US, supporting our operations with data 
centres for each of the regulated states and we remain 
committed to our objective of becoming the pre-eminent 
online gaming operations and services provider in the key  
US market as both a B2C operator and a B2B provider  
via Dragonfish.

in this field across the business but are in the process of

50 payment methods supported. It is vital that we are able to 
offer fast, efficient and easy to use payment processing, both 
to ensure a positive customer experience but also to maximise 
revenue and convert browsers into players. However we take 
our duty as a responsible operator very seriously and take 
comprehensive steps to minimise fraud. 
2014 Focus
2013 has been an incredibly rewarding year. Not only have we 
delivered strong growth across our core business but we have 
firmly cemented our strategy in the regulating US market. 
As we entered 2014 our US operations, although still in 
their very early stages, were starting to build momentum 
and we are focused on refining and developing our current 
business as well as working with our partners to explore 
new opportunities in regulated states. There is undoubtedly 
appetite for further regulation across the US with a number 
of states in advanced talks and throughout the course of the 
year we will be monitoring these potential markets closely 
for opportunities for 888. We firmly believe that through 
our strategy, growing experience and the investment we are 
making in the US market for the long term, we are best placed 
to take advantage as these opportunities come to bear. 
Across our core business the year ahead promises some 
exciting areas for development. In 2013 a significant amount 
of resource was focused on delivering in the US and in 
2014 we will be able to re-direct a significant portion of 
this resource to further developing our core products and 
markets. The surge in mobile gaming has proved to be an 
important growth engine during 2013. Whilst we have made 
good progress in developing our touch platforms to date, this 
market is still in its infancy and will offer much more to learn 
and leverage as it develops. 
Following our partnership with Kambi Sports Solutions, our 
888sport brand has been revitalised and its performance to 
date in 2014 has been very encouraging. In January 2014 we 
acquired a company holding a license allowing us to launch 
our Sport offer in the Spanish market, and we feel confident 
that the forthcoming year will see us take further significant 
steps forward in this market. 
In summary, 2014 promises to be another very exciting year  
in 888’s continued development.

Overview
888’s success is built on its technological strength and the 
efficient utilisation of this technology, directed by extensive 
data analytics. The goals of our industry leading business 
analytics are simple: to maximise customer recruitment, 
increase customer lifetime value and minimise the cost per 
customer acquisition, thereby optimising return on marketing 
investment. The continued growth in our revenues reflects 
our success in attracting new customers, retaining them and 
increasing their overall spend.
888 delivered another record performance in 2013  
with a revenue increase of 7% to US$401 million (2012:  
US$376 million), which was particularly impressive given the 
strong comparatives in the prior year. Growth was driven 
primarily by our B2C business, with a 7% revenue increase, in 
turn led by strong Casino growth of 15% and Poker up by 7%. 
We also saw growth in B2B, with rising revenue increase of 5% 
to US$48 million (2012: US$46 million). 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to US$76 million (2012:  
US$67 million) and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 18.9% 
(2012: 17.8%) despite Research and Development expenses 
increase of US$3.5 million and payment of additional US$2 
million gaming duties in regulated markets. Profit before tax 
increased 30% to US$53 million (2012: US$41 million) and 
Adjusted Earnings per share increased 19% to 16.6¢ (2012: 
13.9¢). 
888’s record performance in 2013 resulted in operational 
cash generation of US$90 million (2012: US$71 million). The 
Group’s financial position remains strong with cash and cash 
equivalents at the year end of US$116 million (2012: $82 million) 
with no debt.

Product Segmentation
888’s revenue by product segment is set out in the table below.
Revenue by product segment:
888 Casino continued its growth, with record revenues of 
US$190.4 million and a 2% increase in active players compared 
to last year. The main drivers behind this strong performance 
in 2013 were the launch of our mobile platform; the offering 
of slot machines in Italy, optimizing our existing offerings, and 
improving our efficiency of acquisition, supported by strong 
marketing campaigns that have boosted first time depositors 
and shown a solid return on investment.
Our Poker business also continues to grow, with record 
revenues of US$93.6 million and a 21% increase in active players 
compared to last year, reflecting further market share gains and 
our advance to number two in the global poker rankings, as 
reported by PokerScout*. 
Despite the poker market as a whole contracting, 888 was able 
to increase player numbers due to improvements made to our 
Poker product, enhancing the effectiveness of our marketing 
and our strategic focus on obtaining high levels of liquidity.
The Bingo B2C revenues declined by 16% as a result of a highly 
competitive and mature market in the UK. However, following 
a strategic review we have seen encouraging recovery signs 
during the final quarter of 2013 with a 7% revenue increase 
compared to the third quarter of 2013.
Emerging offerings revenues have slightly declined by 2% as a 
result of a lower activity in our brand licensing deal. During the 
year we changed our Sports supplier to Kambi Sports Solutions 
to deliver a high quality sportsbook solution to 888 under our 
888sport brand. The agreement has allowed us to offer a wider 
spectrum of betting markets and products for our players, 
through both online channels and mobile platforms and we 
have already seen a significant positive effect during the final 
quarter of 2013. 
B2B activity (Dragonfish) delivered an increase in revenue of 
5% mainly due to our successful launch in Nevada, Delaware 
and New Jersey where our Poker platforms have achieved 
market-leading positions as well as expanding operations with 
our Bingo partners.

Total Revenue 400.5 7% 100%
Growth was achieved in most geographical segments with UK 
revenue up 1% (11% excluding Bingo) and Europe (excluding 
UK) revenue up 14%, driven by remarkable growth in the 
Spanish and Italian regulated markets. The increase in Italy is 
primarily a result of the launch of video slots and improved 
efficiency of marketing activity. 
Since Spain became part of our regulated offering we have 
increased market share and maintained a leading position. 
Revenue from the Americas increased by 22% as a result of 
our successful launch in the US. Revenue from the Rest of the 
World, which was not a focus region for 888 in 2013, declined 
by 14%.
Expenses
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses

, which include mainly employee related 
costs, chargebacks, payment service providers’ (“PSP”) 
commissions and costs related to operational risk management 
services, totaled US$114 million (2012: US$114 million) 
representing a lower proportion of revenues at 28% (2012: 
30%), as a result of operating efficiencies and strict 
cost control. 
Staff costs included in Operating expenses totalling  
US$51.8 million (2012: US$48.4 million) increased by 7% mainly 
as a result of launched operations into the US.
The Group’s chargebacks ratio continued to decrease from 1.0% 
in 2011 and 0.9% in 2012 to 0.8% in 2013, as a result of enhanced 
fraud and risk management mitigation systems, including the 
optimized use of the 3DSecure verification services offered by 
credit card schemes and continuous improvements to our in-
house monitoring protocols.
The PSP commission ratio decreased to 5.5% (2012: 6.0%) 
reflecting the Group’s stronger commercial terms with greater 
deposit volume. 
Gaming Duties
Gaming duties levied in regulated markets reached  
US$14 million (2012: US$12 million, excluding the payment of 
US$11 million in 2012 back-dated duties imposed in Spain). 
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were US$31 million (2012: 
US$27 million), reflecting the Group’s efforts to simultaneously 
launch operations in three regulated US states and the further 
development of our mobile offering. The introduction of 
“HTML5” technology on mobile devices has significantly 
reduced the effort required to customise the 888 offering to 
new devices as they are introduced to the market.
The research and development expense charge does not 
include capitalised in house development costs which 
totaled US$ 10 million (2012: US$8 million), with the increase 
attributable mainly to the launched operations in  
the US.

In addition, during 2013 the Group established a new research 
and development center in Eastern Europe which will enhance 
888’s ability to cope with market challenges and competition.
Selling and Marketing Expenses
Marketing expenses during the year reached a record 
US$140 million (2012: US$131 million) reflecting our continued 
investments in European markets where the strategy is focused 
on combining diverse customer recruitment channels. We also 
increased our poker marketing initiatives in our core UK market. 
Nevertheless, our marketing ratio to revenue remained stable at 
35% (2012: 35%). 
Administrative Expenses
Administrative expenses* slightly increased to US$27 million 
(2012: US$26 million), mainly attributable to foreign exchange 
movement impact on salaries. 
Share Benefit Charges
Equity settled share benefit charges were US$3.3 million (2012: 
US$0.9 million). A portion of the increased charge in 2013 
relates to performance based awards granted in the past which 
vested during the year. Cash settled share benefit charges were 
US$2.2 million (2012: US$0.8 million), due to the higher fair 
value of the long term incentive plan. Further details are given 
in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 34.
Finance Income and Expenses
Finance income less Finance expenses resulted in an expense 
of US$0.3 million (2012: income of US$1.9 million). Most of 
this income and expense is attributable to the fair value of 
operational hedging instruments. The Group continually 
monitors foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, 
to ensure that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, 
inter alia by using foreign exchange forward contracts designed 
to fix the economic impact of known liabilities. 
Adjusted EBITDA
As a result of revenue increase together with strict cost control 
a record Adjusted EBITDA of US$76 million (2012: US$67 
million) was achieved. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 
18.9% (2012: 17.8%).
Taxation
The tax charge for 2013 was US$3.2 million (2012:  
US$5.4 million). The decrease is a result of prudent  
provisions in respect of previous years’ charges that were 
released this year.
Equity Accounted Joint Ventures
As stated above, in 2013 the Group entered into a joint  
venture agreement with Avenue. As a result, the Group’s share 
of post-tax loss of this equity accounted joint venture was  
US$4.1 million (2012: nil). In addition the Group recognised a 
one time profit on acquiring 47% of the equity accounted joint 
venture of US$1.9 million (2012: nil). 
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share rose 40% to 14.2¢ (2012: 10.2¢). 
Adjusted basic earnings per share rose 19% to 16.6¢ (2012: 
13.9¢). We believe adjusted basic earnings per share excluding 
share benefit charges, retroactive duties and associated 
charges, movement in contingent and deferred consideration 
and impairment charges, better reflects the underlying business 
and assists in providing a clearer view of the performance of 
the Group.
Dividend
Given the strong cash generation during the year the Board of 
Directors declared an interim dividend of 3.0¢ per share that 
was paid on 4 October 2013. Taking into account the strong 
performance the Board is recommending a final dividend of 
4.0¢ per share (which together with the interim dividend equals 
7.0¢ per share in accordance with our pay-out policy) and an 
additional one-off 7.0¢ per share, bringing the total for the year 
to 14.0¢ per share (2012: 9.0¢ per share).
Cash Flow
The Group continues to generate substantial amounts of free 
cash with net cash generated from operating activities reaching 
a record of US$90 million (2012: US$71 million, after payment 
of retroactive duties and associated charges). The net increase 
in cash and cash equivalents in 2013 was US$34 million (2012: 
US$5.6), after dividend payments during the year of US$33 
million (2012: US$8.7 million).
Balance Sheet
The Group’s balance sheet remains strong, with no debt and 
ample liquid resources. The Group’s cash position as at 31 
December 2013 was US$116 million (2012: US$82 million). 
Balances owed to customers were US$55 million (2012:  
US$49 million).

As a business operating in a highly regulated environment 
and deeply committed to conducting its business in a lawful 
and compliant manner, 888 is heavily impacted by regulatory 
changes relevant to its business operations. Whilst in its early 
days internet gaming was characterized by under-regulation 
in most jurisdictions, this situation has seen rapid change in 
numerous large markets in recent years. 
Following several years of emerging regulation in various 
European jurisdictions (Italy, Spain, Denmark, France and 
others), recent years have seen an emergence of licensing 
and regulatory regimes in various US States. This represents 
a drastic change in the regulatory landscape applicable in 
the US, where a 2006 federal law resulted in the majority of 
operators exiting the local market (including the 888 group). 
Commensurate with its deep commitment to regulation, 888 
is proud to be the only international online gaming operator to 
currently operate online gaming in all three US States that have 
launched commercial internet gaming – Nevada, New Jersey 
and Delaware – and we hope to expand into additional states 
once online gaming becomes regulated there. Additionally, the 
group is preparing to face a reform to the regulation of online 
gaming in the United Kingdom, which will require the group to 
obtain a UK gaming license in 2014. 
The group continues to be an active and vocal supporter of the 
regulation of online gaming, and invests significant efforts in 
facing the various challenges posed by the ever growing and 
complex mosaic of divergent regulatory regimes relevant to 
its business worldwide. The following paragraphs summarize 
the main relevant regulatory developments of 2013 and our 
expectations regarding changes that will impact the group  
in 2014. 
European Jurisdictions
After some years of hesitance by the European Commission 
with regard to the regulation of online gaming within 
the European Internal Market, 2013 saw the adoption of 
resolutions on the EU level calling for increased cooperation 
and coordination between member states with regard to 
the regulation of internet gaming, as well as the launching 
of infringement cases against member states whose gaming 
laws contradict EU law. These actions may lead to a greater 
degree of inter-European consistency in the coming years, 
and will hopefully also encourage member states to open their 
markets to licensing of foreign online gaming operators. Such 
developments are anticipated, in the coming years, in several 
European markets including Ireland, Romania, the Czech 
Republic, the Netherlands, and Sweden.
Reports indicate that Spain, where the Group has held a license 
since June 2012, is likely to expand its regulatory regime to 
include online slots in 2014. This would present an opportunity 
for 888, which has already been successful in capturing a large 
share of the Spanish market. 
During 2012, the Group was awarded online gaming and 
betting licenses by the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. 
Legal ambiguities regarding the geographic scope of 
this license and the conditions applicable to it, remained 
unresolved during 2013. The regulation of online gaming itself 
in Germany continued to be characterised by legal ambiguity 
and inconsistencies during 2013. The German Federal Court 
of Justice expressed significant doubts regarding the validity 
of the current German Inter-State Gambling Treaty under EU 
law, and referred the matter for adjudication by the European 
Court of Justice where the matter remains pending. As a result, 
legal proceedings in lower German courts with regard to online 
gaming have generally been suspended or adjourned pending 
guidance from the Federal Court. A tender process intended to 
select a handful of operators who were to be granted national 
sports betting licenses was bogged down by legal challenges 
and remains ongoing. 
2013 saw the UK move towards a reform of the 2005 Gambling 
Act. At the heart of the proposed reform (which is expected to 
enter into law during early 2014) is the requirement for foreign 
operators wishing to offer their services to UK residents, to 
obtain a UK Gambling License and pay UK gaming duty on 
revenues generated from UK residents. Such a reform would 
effectively abolish the right of EU/EEA based operators to 
advertise their services in the UK without a UK gaming license. 
Various challenges to the new law are anticipated, including by 
the Gibraltar Betting and Gambling Association (of which the 
group is a member). Notwithstanding, the Group is presently 
assessing the legal impact of the upcoming reform on its 
interaction with customers in the UK, has supplied comments 
to the UK authorities in the context of consultations conducted 
with regard to the proposed reform, and is preparing to apply 
for licensure in the UK if and when required to do so. Formal 
statements by the UK Gambling Commission indicate that 
holders of Gibraltar online gaming licenses will be subject to 
a “transitional” regime allowing them to seamlessly continue 
operations under a UK license and avail themselves of a 
“continuing license” process. Whilst the Group anticipates 
that the upcoming reform will have a definite impact on the 
manner in which it conducts its UK-facing business, it  
expects such business to continue uninterrupted despite the 
upcoming reform.
In Greece the national regulator commenced a blacklisting 
process, in June 2013, targeting online gaming sites unlicensed 
in the jurisdiction. This move, taken under the country’s 2011 
gaming law, was accompanied by orders issued to the country’s 
Internet Service Providers requiring them to block access to 
sites on the blacklist. Legal challenges against the blacklisting 
process remained pending as 2013 drew to a close. In addition, 
despite the 2011 gaming law allowing for the issuance of online 
gaming licenses in Greece, no such licenses were issued in 2013. 
Various proposals to amend the law were presented to the 
Greek Parliament (but have not yet passed into law). 
Regulation
14
888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2013 23124.04   25 March 2014 6:24 AM   Proof 11
Both Hungary and Romania amended their gambling laws 
during 2011 and introduced limited regulatory regimes 
governing online gaming. The implementation of these 
new regulatory regimes was delayed in anticipation of the 
publication of necessary secondary legislation. It seemed 
apparent as 2013 drew to a close that both jurisdictions 
intended to introduce further changes to their existing online 
gaming laws prior to their implementation.
Bulgaria issued regulations in 2013 to implement its 2012 
gaming law, and began receiving applications for the issuance 
of local gaming licenses. In late 2013 Bulgaria amended the tax 
structure applicable to online gaming. The Group is studying 
the impacts of that reform. 
The government of The Netherlands continued its efforts 
towards liberalisation of the country’s regulatory regime 
applicable to online gaming. The Group continued to conduct 
its operations in the Netherlands in accordance with interim 
guidelines issued by the local authorities, and maintained close 
contact with the authorities providing information and making 
proposals with regard to the anticipated reform. A draft online 
gaming bill is anticipated to be published for comments in 
2014, and the Group will continue to engage with the Dutch 
authorities with the hope that the anticipated reform will 
accommodate a vibrant and commercially viable online gaming 
market in The Netherlands.
Political instability delayed reforms to the online gaming regime 
of the Czech Republic but these are expected to progress, 
under a newly elected government, in 2014. 
In Ireland, the Ministry of Justice published a Heads of Bill 
document encapsulating a proposed reform to the country’s 
betting and online gaming regimes. While the component of 
the reform related to betting is expected to enter into force 
during 2014, work on the gaming-related reform is unlikely to 
reach fruition in the coming year. The Group continues to  
follow these developments and their impact on its operations in 
these markets.
USA
Though no progress was made with regard to federal legislation 
governing online gaming in 2013, major developments 
occurred on the state level. This followed the publication 
of a US Department of Justice memorandum reversing the 
Department’s long-standing position regarding the scope of 
the Wire Act. The Department’s conclusion that the Wire Act 
does not apply to non-sports betting, and hence does not 
prohibit the intra-state sale online of lottery tickets by licensed 
state lotteries, paved the way for various US jurisdictions to 
regulate intra-state online gaming. Indeed, during 2013, internet 
gaming was launched in Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware. 
On 21 March 2013 the Group was licensed as an Interactive 
Gaming Service Provider by the Nevada Gaming Commission, 
after being recommended for licensure by the State Gaming 
Control Board. Through its partnership with Caesars Interactive 
Entertainment, the Group launched its first US-licensed online 
gaming platform, offering online poker to players within the 
State of Nevada under the World Series of Poker brand. The 
group’s Nevada platform was approved for a “field trial” by the 
Nevada authorities, and final approval of the platform by the 
State Gaming Commission is anticipated in 2014. As a pioneer 
of the Nevada online gaming market, the Group has continued 
to work with the Nevada authorities towards approval of inter-
operator poker networks which will allow for shared liquidity 
between local licensed operators. The Group hopes that 
development on this front can be achieved in 2014. In addition 
the Group has also supported efforts by the state to negotiate 
inter-state agreements with other regulated US jurisdictions, 
allowing for regulatory cooperation between states as well as 
the pooling of player liquidity. In late February 2014, the Multi-
State Internet Gaming Agreement between state of Nevada 
and the State of Delaware was entered into. 
Following the passage of legislation in the State of New Jersey 
in 2012, approved by the State Governor in 2013, the Group 
applied for licensing as a Casino Service Industry Enterprise 
in that State. Late in 2013 the Group received a Transactional 
Waiver from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement 
allowing it to commence internet gaming-related operations in 
conjunction with Caesars Interactive Entertainment. 888 was 
amongst the group of first operators approved to launch their 
online gaming platform in the state (including poker and casino 
games) in November 2013. The Group’s platform is available 
to players in New Jersey both under 888’s own brands as 
well as under several brands belonging to the Caesars group. 
The Group continues to work with the Division towards final 
approval of its licensing application. 
Following a 2012 law enacted by the State of Delaware, 
allowing for the online provision of internet lottery games 
(including casino-style gaming and poker) by the State Lottery, 
888 together with Scientific Games were selected to provide 
the technology to power the State Lottery’s online offering. The 
Group worked with the State Lottery providing professional 
input to the State Lottery in connection with the drafting 
of internet lottery regulations and standards. Based on 888 
technology, and under legislation governing the operation 
of internet lottery games, internet gaming services are now 
offered to Delaware players through websites branded and 
promoted by the state’s three racetrack casinos. In connection 
with its selection as the Lottery’s technology provider, the 
Group is presently undergoing licensing by the Delaware 
Division of Gaming Enforcement. The Group continues to 
maintain a close dialogue with the Division and with the State 
Lottery on technological, regulatory and enforcement issues, 
and is supportive of Delaware’s desire to enter into inter-state 
gaming agreements with other regulated US jurisdictions. 
It is the Group’s anticipation and hope that other US 
jurisdictions will follow in the footsteps of Nevada, New Jersey 
and Delaware, in regulating the operation of internet gaming 
within their territories. The State of Michigan is expected to 
launch online lottery games in the coming months. Several 
other states, including California and Pennsylvania, have been 
considering online gaming legislation, while other States 
(including New York) are reportedly studying the market 
and considering their position with regard to the regulation 
of internet gaming. These developments could all present 
potential business opportunities for the Group, which could act 
as a service provider to licensees and lottery corporations in 
the various states. The Group hopes to continue to lead the US 
online gaming market, seeking licensing of its technology and 
products wherever such licenses are available in a commercially 
viable manner.

Corporate Responsibility
Environmental Impact 
As an online business, 888’s activities have a relatively small 
impact on the environment. However, we remain committed to 
ensuring that wherever possible we minimise what little effect 
we have with the following four areas being the key focus 
points.
Energy consumption: We continuously monitor our energy 
consumption to help us ensure we are being as energy efficient 
as possible.
Water: We use only ecological detergents in our offices and use 
water saving devices in most of our locations.
Travel: To minimise the impact of travel on the environment we 
encourage employees to either cycle to work and, in certain 
locations, provide buses for commuters. We also continue to 
invest in the state of the art technology to help meetings occur 
remotely. 
888 has commissioned a study to provide quantitative 
information regarding its environmental impact and to assist it 
in finding ways to further reduce its environmental impact.

Although not legally required to do so, as the Company is 
incorporated in Gibraltar, we have reported on all the emissions 
sources stipulated under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. These sources 
fall within our consolidated financial statement. We do not have 
responsibility for any emissions sources that are not included in 
our consolidated statement.
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition), data gathered from our 
own operations, and emissions factors from UK Government’s 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2013, as well as an 
electricity emission factor for Antigua sourced from UNDP.
The reported emissions come from our offices, data centre and 
servers owned by us, but co-located at third party data centres. 
Our facilities in Gibraltar use chilled water provided by a 
third-party for cooling and no emission factor for the chilled 
water was available. As a result, we estimated the associated 
emissions based on the volume of chilled water and an 
assumed coefficient of performance.
The account of our corporate GHG emissions was prepared by 
the Carbon Trust in the UK.
Employees
888’s success depends on the quality and commitment of its 
people. We take our responsibilities to our staff around the 
world very seriously and aim to provide an enjoyable work 
environment where employees are challenged and motivated 
to excel, where flair is rewarded, compensation is fair and the 
balance between work and family is respected. 
We carry out regular employee satisfaction surveys each year, 
with the latest answers collected in June 2013. The survey 
requests employee feedback regarding the employee, his/her 
team, direct manager, divisional management, and group senior 
management, as well as regarding the organisation as a whole 
and the employee’s overall satisfaction.
This year we were again pleased to report a continued high 
level of employee satisfaction, with a number of actions taken 
to address the small number of issues raised. These include 
improving knowledge sharing in the divisions, professional 
development for key employees and managers, and personal 
work with individual managers.
All employees are formally updated twice a year regarding the 
Group’s business results, and employees are encouraged to 
raise ideas and provide feedback.
In 2013, 888 launched its “Excellence Club”, our employee 
development program which sent a group of employees 
selected by their divisions for excellence in a number of fields, 
to an exciting adventure trip in Lapland. We hope to continue 
this program in years to come with trips to other exotic 
locations planned. 
In addition, 888 runs a number of management skills programs 
for both senior managers and team leaders from all divisions, 
as well as seminars for our B2C employees, which in 2013 
focused on social media and marketing.

Social, Community and Human Rights Issues
Our values
At 888 we are fully committed to maintaining a high standard 
of corporate and social responsibility. This ethos is part of 
our culture and permeates throughout our business into the 
everyday business decisions we make on a day to day basis. 
We also recognise that a responsible approach is not only 
the correct way to do business but one that enhances our 
credibility amongst all our stakeholders and thereby supports 
the development of the Group. 
Responsible gaming
Our values place the community and the customer at the 
centre of all our endeavours. We aim to provide responsible 
adults with the best online gaming entertainment experience. 
However, we acknowledge that gaming poses a potential 
danger to a small minority of people. We are constantly revising 
our innovative procedures to ensure minors are unable to 
access our gaming sites. We also continuously train all our staff 
in how to provide a safe gaming experience to our customers. 
Our training program incorporates methods and techniques 
to help our employees recognise and take appropriate actions 
if they identify compulsive or underage activity. We continue 
to innovate in this area including the development of our 
proprietary sophisticated Observer System to help identify and 
prevent compulsive activity. 
Protecting customers
 } As a responsible, regulated gaming Group we comply with 
both the GamCare and the eCOGRA guidelines. GamCare 
is the leading authority on the provision of counselling, 
advice and practical help in addressing the social impact 
of gambling in the UK. eCOGRA ensures that approved 
online casinos are properly and transparently monitored to 
provide player protection.
 } Our site has links to professional help agencies and we 
have placed many safeguards for those who need help 
with controlling their gaming.
 } E-Break & Support program: Run in collaboration with 
specialist well-known charity Gambling Therapy to offer 
888 customers a free of charge 4 week gambling therapy 
program. 
 } Self-assessment test: For players who are worried about 
their gaming habits and want to know more about the 
signs of compulsive gambling.
 } Controlling deposit limits: should clients feel the need 
to, they can control their play pattern by self limiting the 
amounts they deposit per day, per week or per month.
 } Self exclusion: A player can request to be self excluded 
for a chosen period, due to different concerns. Based 
on internal studies we decided to increase time periods 
available for clients to “cool off”. Customers can choose 
from six different exclusion periods from one day to six 
months. During this period, 888 blocks the account and no 
promotional e-mails are sent to the customer.
Protecting minors
Underage activity on our sites is strictly prohibited and 888 
takes the matter of underage gaming extremely seriously. 
Our offering is not designed to attract minors. We make 
every effort to prevent minors from playing on our sites and 
use sophisticated verification systems as well as a third party 
verification supplier to identify and track minors if they log into 
our software. The verification process today consists of two 
verification systems, both 192.com and URU.
We train our staff to be highly sensitive to the possibility of 
underage activity and make sure we suspend any account 
suspected to be an underage account.
888responsible
Since 2007 a dedicated website, www.888responsible.com, 
has been available, providing information regarding all aspects 
of responsible gaming. The site is available in English, French, 
Spanish and German.
Community
888 is committed to supporting both the various local 
communities in which it operates and also the broader global 
community. Our community investment program includes 
charitable donations and long standing community involvement 
in our key areas across the world. In 2014, 888 supported the 
International Medical Corps in their efforts to assist people 
affected by Typhoon Haiyan which struck the Philippines in 
November 2013.
Human Rights
888 ensures that its policies comply with local law, in addition 
to reflecting the Group’s values. These policies set clear 
standards of behaviour to which all Group personnel are 
expected to adhere, including as regards social, ethical and 
environmental matters. In this respect, 888 is guided by the 
ten principles of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, 
which encourages companies to make human rights, labour 
standards, environmental responsibility and anti-corruption 
part of their business agenda.

Diversity
Diversity is important to us as we believe that only through 
access to the most diverse pool of talent will we recruit and 
retain the most talented individuals to serve our customers. 
We actively seek to recruit and advance women into our 
top management. A summary of the breakdown of men and 
women across the group is as of December 31, 2013, is as

The Board acknowledges that the lack of women on the 
Board is a major challenge for the Company, and that it is the 
Board’s responsibility to address this. In 2013, the Nominations

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Group operates in a dynamic business environment. In 
addition to the day-to-day commercial risks faced by most 
enterprises such as fraud and theft, the online gaming industry 
faces particular challenges in respect of regulatory risk, 
reputational risk, information technology risk and taxation risk, 
each of which is detailed below. The Group considers that the 
nature of its principal risks has not undergone any significant 
change during 2013.
Regulatory risk
The regulatory framework of online gaming is dynamic 
and complex. Change in the regulatory regime in a specific 
jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on business 
volume and financial performance in that jurisdiction. In addition, 
a number of jurisdictions have regulated online gaming, and in 
many of those jurisdictions the Group holds licenses. However, 
in some cases, lack of clarity in the regulations, or conflicting 
legislative and regulatory developments, mean that the Group 
may risk failing to obtain an appropriate license, having existing 
licenses adversely affected, or being subject to other regulatory 
sanctions. Furthermore, legal and other action may be taken by 
incumbent gaming providers in jurisdictions which are seeking 
to regulate online gaming, in an attempt to frustrate the grant 
of online gaming licenses to the Group. A detailed regulatory 
review is set out in the Regulation section above. 
The Group manages its regulatory risk by routinely consulting 
with legal advisors in the jurisdictions where its services are 
offered or are accessible, where necessary obtaining formal 
legal opinions from local counsel. Furthermore, the Group 
obtains frequent and routine updates regarding changes in the 
law that may be applicable to its operations, working with local 
counsel to assess the impact of any changes on its operations. 
The Group constantly adapts and moderates its services to 
comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Finally, the 
Group blocks players from certain ‘blocked jurisdictions’ using 
multiple technological methods as appropriate.
Reputational risk
Under-age and problem gaming are inherent risks associated 
with the online gaming industry. The Group devotes 
considerable resources to putting in place prevention measures 
coupled with strict internal procedures designed to prevent 
under-aged players from accessing its real money sites. In 
addition, the Group promotes a safe and responsible gaming 
environment to its customers supplemented by its corporate 
culture. The Group has a dedicated Director of Responsible 
Gaming tasked with the responsibility of implementing such 
policies. Further details about the Group’s responsible gaming 
initiatives are set out in the Social, Community and Human 
Rights Issue section above. 
Information Technology risks
As a leading online business, the Group’s IT systems are critical 
to its operation. The Group is reliant on the performance of 
these systems.
Cutting-edge technologies and procedures are implemented 
throughout the Group’s technology operations and designed 
to protect its networks from malicious attacks and other 
such risks. These measures include traffic filtering, anti-
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) devices and Anti-Virus 
protection from leading vendors. Physical and logical network 
segmentation is also used to isolate and protect the Group’s 
networks and restrict malicious activities. The IT environment 
is audited by independent auditors, such as PCI DSS security 
audit and eCOGRA audit. These audits form part of the Group’s 
approach to ensuring proper IT procedures and a high level of 
security. In order to ensure systems are protected properly and 
effectively, external security scans and assessments are carried 
out in a timely manner. The Group has a disaster recovery site 
to ensure full recovery in the event of disaster. All critical data 
is replicated to the disaster recovery site and stored off-site on 
a daily basis. In the event of loss of functionality of the Group’s 
critical services, the business can be fully recovered through 
the resources available at the disaster recovery site.
In order to minimise dependence on telecommunication 
service providers, the Group invests in network infrastructure 
redundancies whilst regularly reviewing its service providers. 
The Group has two internet service providers in Gibraltar in 
order to minimise reliance on one provider.
As a part of its monitoring system, the Group deploys set user 
experience tests which measure performance from different 
locations around the world. Network-related performance 
issues are addressed by rerouting traffic using different routes 
or providers. 888 operates a 24/7 Network Operations Centre 
(NOC). The NOC’s role is to conduct real time monitoring of 
production activities using state-of-the-art systems. These 
systems are designed to identify and provide alerts regarding 
problems related to systems, key business indicators and issues 
surrounding customer usability experience.
The IT environment tracks changes, incidents and SLA KPIs in 
order to ensure that client experience is consistent and well 
managed. As part of these procedures, capacity planning 
takes place and infrastructure is built accordingly. System-wide 
availability and business-level availability is measured and 
logged in the IT information systems.
Taxation risk
The Group aims to ensure that each legal entity within the Group 
is a tax resident of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated 
and has no taxable presence in any other jurisdiction. While the 
Group’s customers are located worldwide, certain jurisdictions 
may seek to tax the Group’s activity which could have a material 
adverse effect on the amount of tax payable by the Group or 
impose tax by reference to customers’ activity. Furthermore, 
jurisdictions in which online gaming is regulated may impose 
gaming duties on licenced operators. Commencing in December 
2014, the United Kingdom is expected to impose gaming tax on 
a point of consumption basis, which is expected on the one hand 
to lower margins, but on the other, to continue the trend toward 
consolidation in that market. The Group actively monitors 
taxation risk in the relevant jurisdictions and takes such steps as 
it considers necessary to minimise such risks.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Financial risks
The Group considers its exposure to financial risks, including 
country risk and exposure to trading counterparties, to be low. 
During 2013, the Group hedged its foreign currency risks solely 
with leading banks including Barclays plc and Royal Bank of 
Scotland plc.
Partnership risks
In line with its strategy, the Group has consolidated its position 
in the B2B market to be focused on fewer, larger B2B contracts. 
However, this strategy also gives rise to commercial risks in that 
the Group is more exposed to non-renewal or termination of 
existing contracts.

The Nevada Gaming Commission may also require anyone 
having a material relationship or involvement with the 
Company to be found suitable or licensed. For such time as the 
Company is subject to the aforementioned legal requirements 
and to the control of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board 
and Nevada Gaming Commission, any person who acquires 
more than 5% of any class of our voting securities must 
report, within 10 days, the acquisition to the Nevada Gaming 
Commission. Any person who becomes a beneficial owner of 
more than 10% of any class of our voting securities is required 
to apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the 
Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board mails 
written notice in accordance with NRS 463.643. Under certain 
circumstances, an “Institutional Investor,” as such term is 
defined in the regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission, 
which acquires more than 10% but not more than 25% of 
any class of our voting securities, may apply to the Nevada 
Gaming Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability 
requirements.
The Nevada Gaming Commission may also, in its discretion, 
require any other holders of our equity securities or any holders 
of our debt securities to file applications, be investigated and 
be found suitable to own our equity or debt securities. The 
applicant security holder is required to pay all costs of such 
investigation. 
Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of 
suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered 
to do so by the Nevada Gaming Commission may be found 
unsuitable based solely on such failure or refusal. The same 
restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, when 
requested, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any security 
holder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, 
any beneficial ownership of the common stock beyond such 
period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Gaming 
Commission may be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
Changes in control through merger, consolidation, acquisition 
of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form 
of takeover cannot occur without prior investigation by the 
Nevada State Gaming Control Board and approval by the 
Nevada Gaming Commission.
New Jersey
Vendors offering goods or services to a casino applicant or 
licensee which directly relate to internet gaming activity are 
subject to strict regulation pursuant to the New Jersey Casino 
Control Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
(collectively, referred to as New Jersey Act). The New Jersey 
Act created the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (New 
Jersey Commission) and the New Jersey Division of Gaming 
Enforcement (New Jersey Division). Under the New Jersey 
Act, a casino service industry enterprise (CSIE) license is 
required for a vendor offering goods or services to a casino 
applicant or licensee which directly relate to Internet gaming 
activity. The New Jersey Division has the authority to decide 
CSIE license applications. The New Jersey Division also has 
the responsibility to investigate all license applications and 
to prosecute violations of the New Jersey Act. However, the 
New Jersey Commission has the authority to hear and decide 
appeals regarding denials of CSIE license applications by the 
New Jersey Division. 
 
Two subsidiaries of the Company, 888 Atlantic Limited and 
AAPN New Jersey LLC, have pending CSIE license applications 
before the New Jersey Division in connection with providing 
internet gaming services to New Jersey casino licensees. 
The issuance and maintenance of a CSIE license requires 
that directors, officers, key employees and owners of the 
applicant company be found by the New Jersey Division 
to be of good character, honesty and financially stable by 
a showing of clear and convincing evidence. A CSIE license 
application consists of disclosure forms for the applicant, 
each of its holding companies, and each individual required to 
be found qualified by the New Jersey Division. Generally, all 
five percent (5%) or greater direct or indirect owners, certain 
officers, certain directors, and sales representatives soliciting 
business from Atlantic City casinos and their supervisors must 
be qualified, unless the qualification requirement is waived. 
Outside directors of a holding or intermediary company of a 
CSIE license applicant are only required to be licensed if they 
are members of the Audit or Executive Committee. Officers 
may be waived from the qualification requirement if they are 
not significantly involved in and have no authority over the 
conduct of business with a casino; however, the Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer and 
Chief Legal Officer cannot be waived. The New Jersey Division 
has the discretion to require other persons to be qualified. 
These rules apply to all entities through the chain of ownership, 
regardless of any resulting dilution in interest in the applicant, 
so that any direct or indirect owner of five percent (5%) or 
more of any applicant or holding company must file, as must 
their officers and directors. The 5% or greater ownership is 
generally calculated based on ownership of equity securities. 
The New Jersey Division may also aggregate the holdings 
of different owners of less than 5% and require each to be 
qualified if they have a commonality of interest with each other. 
Situations in which this may occur include common control of 
different entities or familial relationships. 
With respect to security holders, the New Jersey Division may 
waive the qualification requirement for “institutional investors”, 
as defined in the New Jersey Act, of an applicant if: (i) there 
is no reason to believe that the institutional investor may be 
unqualified; (ii) the institutional investor holds less than 25 
percent of the outstanding securities; (iii) the securities were 
acquired for investment purposes only, and (iv) the holder 
has no intention of influencing the affairs of the applicant, 
other than voting its securities. The New Jersey Act defines an 
“institutional investor” as (i) any retirement fund administered 
by a public agency for the exclusive benefit of federal, state or 
local public employees; (ii) an investment company registered 
under the Investment Corporate Law of 1940; (iii) a collective 
investment trust organised by banks under Part Nine of the 
Rules of the Comptroller of the Currency, (iv) a closed end 
investment trust; (v) a chartered or licensed life insurance 
company or property and casualty insurance company; (vi) 
banking or other licensed or chartered lending institutions; (vii) 
an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers 
Act of 1940, and (viii) such other persons as the New Jersey 
Division may determine for reasons consistent with the policies 
of the New Jersey Act.

In connection with a license application, the New Jersey 
Division conducts an investigation of the applicant and its 
individual qualifiers to determine their suitability for licensure. 
In order for a CSIE license to be issued by the New Jersey 
Division, the applicant and its individual qualifiers must 
demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, their good 
character, honesty and integrity, and their financial stability, 
integrity and responsibility. The investigation of a CSIE 
applicant and affiliated individuals and entities will normally 
take at least a year.
An applicant for an internet CSIE license is responsible for the 
entire cost of the investigation charged at the Division’s hourly 
rates, which currently is $113, plus out-of-pocket expenses. All 
unexpected cash disbursements are charged directly to the 
applicant. 
No notifications pursuant to DTR Rule 5 have been received by 
the Company between 31 December 2013 and the date of this

Shareholder Agreements and Consent Requirements 
There are no known arrangements under which financial rights 
are held by a person other than the holder of the shares. 
A Relationship Agreement governing the relationship between 
the above Principal Shareholder Trusts and the Company was 
entered into in connection with the Company’s flotation. The 
Relationship Agreement provides that all transactions between 
the Group and the Principal Shareholder Trusts will be on a 
normal business basis, that the Group will be allowed to carry 
on business independently of them and that the Principal 
Shareholder Trusts will not cause the Company to contravene 
the Code unless required by law or as contemplated in the 
Relationship Agreement. It further provides that each of the 
Principal Shareholder Trusts will not solicit Group employees 
without consent, that only Independent Directors can vote 
on proposals to amend the Relationship Agreement, that 
the Principal Shareholder Trusts will consult the Group prior 
to disposing of a significant number of shares in order to 
maintain an orderly market and shall not disclose confidential 
information unless required to do so by law or relevant 
regulation or having first received the Company’s consent. 
The Relationship Agreement also includes restrictions on the 
Principal Shareholder Trusts power to appoint Directors and 
includes obligations on the trusts to ensure that the majority of 
the Board, excluding the Chairman, is independent. The Principal 
Shareholder Trusts can nominate a Non-executive Director 
for appointment to the Board. In the event that this right is 
exercised and it results in fewer than half the Board (excluding 
The New Jersey Division has broad discretion regarding the 
issuance, suspension or revocation of CSIE licenses. The New 
Jersey Division may impose conditions on the award of a 
license. In addition, the New Jersey Division has the authority 
to impose fines or suspend or revoke a license for violations of 
the New Jersey Act, including the failure to satisfy the licensure 
requirements. A CSIE license is issued for an indefinite term and 
will essentially remain effective thereafter unless the license 
is suspended, expires, or is revoked. The applicant is asked to 
resubmit related information every five years.
Substantial Shareholdings
As at 31 December 2013 the Company had been notified of the 
following interests in 5% or more of its share capital under DTR 
Rule 5 of the UK Listing Authority:
the Chairman of the Board) being Independent Directors, such 
appointment shall only become effective upon the appointment 
to the Board of an additional Independent Director acceptable 
to the Nominations Committee. Such restrictions and obligations 
apply in respect of the E Shaked Shares Trust and O Shaked 
Shares Trust whilst they collectively hold not less than 7.5% of 
the issued share capital of 888, and in respect of the Ben-Yitzhak 
Family Shares Trust whilst it individually holds not less than 7.5% 
of the issued share capital of 888.
Change of Control 
A change of control in the Group may, in the event of failure to 
fulfill any applicable consent requirement, give rise to certain 
revocation or termination rights under the Group’s gaming 
licences or certain contracts to which the Group is a party.
Political Donations
The Company did not make any political donations during  
the year.
Financial Instruments
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the 
Company are set out in the notes to the financial statements 
on page 83. The Company is not materially exposed to foreign 
exchange fluctuations given its policy to hedge its currency 
exposure as described in note 27 to the financial statements. 
The Company is not materially exposed to price risk, credit risk 
or liquidity risk. Given that end-users are required to fund their 
online gaming wallet prior to carrying out any gaming activity, 
operational cash flow is not a material risk for the Company. In 
addition the Group manages its cash in a prudent manner and 
maintains sufficient liquid resources to meet its anticipated 
liabilities as and when they come due.

Directors’ Indemnities
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Company 
to indemnify its Directors in certain circumstances, as well 
as to provide insurance for the benefit of its Directors. The 
Company has undertaken to indemnify its Non-executive 
Directors: (a) in defending any proceedings, whether civil or 
criminal, in which judgment is given in favour of such Non-
executive Director or in which such Non-executive Director 
is acquitted; or (b) in connection with any application under 
Section 378 of the Gibraltar Companies Act (pursuant to which 
the court may provide relief to such Non-executive Director 
in any proceedings for negligence, default, breach of duty or 
breach of trust on grounds that such Non-executive Director 
has acted honestly and reasonably, and that, having regard to 
all circumstances of the case, including those connected with 
his appointment, he ought fairly to be excused from liability 
on such terms as the court thinks fit). The Company also 
undertook in favour of Aviad Kobrine to indemnify him to the 
fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the Company’s 
Articles of Association in connection with the execution of his 
duties and/or exercise of his powers, authorities and discretions 
pursuant to his employment agreement. In addition, certain 
special indemnities were provided to the Executive Directors 
in connection with the compliance and licencing procedures 
relating to the Company’s business in the United States, details 
of which were provided in the Company’s 2011 Annual Report.

Research & Development Activities
2013 was a year of major investment in developing the Group’s 
infrastructure, in order to support our growing business as 
well as to meet regulatory and market needs in support of our 
business strategy. Our research & development focus was on 
regulated markets and mobile, as well as improving scalability 
of our gaming platforms and of our back office, and included: 
Regulated Markets: Delivering the Group’s offering in 
three states over a period of three months required the 
commitment of substantial capital and human resources, 
leading to successful launches in Nevada in September, and in 
both Delaware and New Jersey in November. Major areas of 
investment included:
 } Data center set-up: Three fully operational data centers 
were established in the US; one dedicated to each 
regulated market. 
 } Adaptation to regulation guidelines: The different state 
regulatory requirements meant that our platform and 
games needed to be adapted separately for each state.
 } Certification: Working with accredited testing houses, we 
ensured that our platform passed regulatory certification 
for each state.
 } New payment options: Configuration of the platform to 
interface with US banks and payment methods required 
the implementation of entirely new processes.
 } Major product modifications: Our platform and games 
were adapted to suit US customers’ preferences and 
needs.
We will continue investing to develop our platform for 
regulated markets as part of the Group’s strategic direction.
Mobile: 2013 saw the completion of 888’s strategy of full 
mobile coverage, with all 888 products now offered on both 
iOS and Android platforms (Smartphones and Tablets). 
The Group is constantly adding both content and customer 
communication tools to its mobile offering.
Sport: The Group migrated its sports offering from the 
BlueSquare platform to the Kambi platform. 
Games: In 2013, we made substantial investments in our world-
class in-house games studio which, together with new external 
partners such as Netent, added new games over all platforms 
(PC & Mobile).
Core Business & Operation: During 2013, the Group invested 
in infrastructure and tools supporting our operations and 
core business. Projects included the rebuild of our back-office 
software, the addition of new back-office tools, the addition 
of enhanced marketing capabilities including sophisticated 
communication tools with players and additional payment 
options, all with a focus on optimizing cost and improving 
efficiency.

financial statements as required pursuant to the Listing Rules 
of the UK Listing Authority. BDO Limited have been appointed 
to act as auditors for the purposes of issuing an audit report

Directors’ Statement of Responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies 
(Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated 
Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group 
and Company’s financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of 
the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the 
International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for 
the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In 
virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved 
by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. A fair presentation also 
requires the Directors to: 
 } consistently select and apply appropriate accounting 
policies;
 } present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and 
 } provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to 
enable members to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company, for safeguarding 
the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the 
preparation of a Directors’ report which complies with the 
Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar 
Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar 
Companies Act.
Financial statements are published on the Group’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity 
of the Group’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The 
Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of 
the financial statements contained therein.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the financial statements. The Directors are required to 
prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and have 
also chosen to prepare financial statements for the Company in 
accordance with IFRSs.
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
We confirm, to the best of our knowledge: 
(a)  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and
(b)  the strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 
All of the current directors have taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any  
information  needed  by  the  company’s  auditors  for  the  
purposes  of  their  audit, and  to  establish  that  the auditors 
are aware of that information.  The directors are not aware 
of any relevant audit information of which the auditors are 
unaware.

888 Holdings plc is admitted to the UK Official List and its 
shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange under a 
Premium Listing. As such, despite being incorporated in 
Gibraltar, the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) 
applies to the Company and is available at www.frc.org.uk.  
A new edition of the Code was published in September 2012 
and applies to the 2013 reporting period.
Statement of Compliance
The Board remain committed to the principles of corporate 
governance in the Code which it considers to be central to the 
effective management of the business and to maintaining the 
confidence of investors. This report explains how the Company 
has applied the main principles of the Code. 
During 2013, the Company materially complied with the Code, 
other than as regards the following:
 } The Company did not have a Senior Independent Director 
serving on the Board of Directors during 2013. The 
functions of a Senior Independent Director were fulfilled 
during 2013 by the Chairman and Non-executive Directors.
 } Board evaluations have been conducted internally over 
the past three years by facilitation of the Chairman in 
coordination with the Company’s legal adviser, Herzog 
Fox & Neeman, who may not be considered an external 
facilitator.
Board Composition
The Directors consider it essential that the Company should be 
both led and controlled by an effective Board.
During 2013, the Board consisted of five Directors, as follows: 
two independent Non-executive Directors, a Non-executive 
Chairman, and two Executive Directors, being the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
At present, there is no Senior Independent Director on the 
Board. During 2013, the Board appointed executive search 
firm Odgers Berndtson to undertake a search for new Non-
executive Directors. A process of identification of potential 
candidates and interviewing has taken place. It is noted that 
Odgers Berndtson is independent of the Company and has no 
other connections with the Company. The role of the Senior

Independent Director is to provide a sounding board for the 
Chairman, to evaluate the Chairman’s performance and lead the 
Board’s succession planning, and to serve as an intermediary for 
the other Directors where necessary. During 2013, the Chairman 
and Non-executive Directors fulfilled the functions of a Senior 
Independent Director.
The biographical details of all of the Directors are given on page 
21. The service contracts of the present Non-executive Directors 
were renewed for an additional three year period on  
1 March 2013. In doing so, the Company rigorously reviewed the 
performance of its Non-executive Directors, taking into account 
the need for progressive refreshing of the Board.
Board Strategic approach
The Board focuses upon the Group’s long-term objectives, 
strategic and policy issues and formally and transparently 
considers the management of key risks facing the Group, as well 
as determining the nature and extent of significant risks it will 
take in achieving its strategic objectives, maintaining sound risk 
management and internal control systems and reviewing annually 
the effectiveness of the company’s risk management and internal 
control systems. The Board is responsible for acquisitions and 
divestments, major capital expenditure projects and considering 
Group budgets and dividend policy. The Board also determines 
key appointments. The Board receives regular updates on 
shareholders’ views. The Board has an established calendar of 
business. This covers the financial calendar, strategic planning, 
annual budgets and performance self-assessments, as well as 
the conduct of standing business. The calendar forms the basis 
for effective integration of business activities as between the 
Board and its principal Committees (see pages 28 and 29), which 
individually consider their own operating frameworks against 
the Board’s business programme. The Board plans to meet six 
times a year. During 2013, the Board met six times. Set out below 
are details of the Directors’ attendance record at Board and 
Committee meetings in 2013.

John Anderson did not attend some meetings as noted above, 
due to a period of illness, from which he has now recovered.
The Chairman has responsibility for ensuring that agendas for 
Board meetings are set in advance. Board papers are issued to 
Directors sufficiently in advance of meetings to facilitate both 
informed debate and timely decisions.
Non-executive review and performance appraisal
The Chairman holds meetings at least once per year with 
the Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors 
being present. The Non-executive Directors meet once per 
year without the Chairman present in order to appraise the 
performance of the Chairman and taking into account the 
views of the Executive Directors. It is part of the role of Senior 
Independent Director to lead this process. Presently, the Board 
is in the process of appointing a new Senior Independent 
Director; during 2013, the Chairman and Non-executive 
Directors fulfilled the functions of a Senior Independent 
Director. The Directors have wide-ranging business experience, 
and no individual, or group of individuals, dominates the 
Board’s decision making.
The Board considers that John Anderson and Amos Pickel 
satisfy the independence criteria of the Code in 2013. The 
Board is satisfied that, upon his appointment as Chairman, 
Richard Kilsby met the independence criteria of the Code. The 
other significant commitments of the Chairman during 2013 
are detailed in his biography on page 21. The Board considers 
that Mr Kilsby’s other commitments do not interfere with the 
discharge of his responsibilities to the Group and is satisfied 
that he makes sufficient time available to serve the Company 
effectively.
The Board has established a formal process for the annual 
evaluation of its performance, its committees and individual 
Directors. The evaluation process covers a range of issues 
such as Board processes, Board roles and responsibilities, 
Board agendas and committee processes. The internal Board 
evaluation relating to performance in 2013 was carried out in 
March 2014, and included evaluation of the performance of the 
board as a whole as well as evaluation of individual Directors 
and the Chairman. Pursuant to the evaluation, the Board was 
satisfied that the Non-executive Directors continue to be 
effective and to demonstrate commitment to their role. The 
Chairman in coordination with the Company’s legal adviser 
facilitated the evaluation process. A detailed questionnaire was 
used covering various aspects of the Board’s functions, and 
particular focus was given to the overall quality of decision-
making and performance of the Chairman. Following analysis 
of the questionnaire responses, a detailed discussion was held 
by the Board of the results and the Company’s legal adviser 
provided external feedback. On the whole, the results of the 
evaluation were positive, with the key follow-up action being 
to progress the recruitment of additional experienced Non-
executive Directors. 
Reserved powers and delegation
A schedule of matters reserved to the Board has been adopted 
and its content is reviewed to align it with operational needs 
and the Board’s preference to monitor and, where appropriate, 
approve matters of substance to the Group as a whole. 
Senior executives have given written undertakings to ensure 
compliance within their business operations with the Board’s 
formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision or 
approval.
Division of responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Chairman are clearly and formally 
defined, with the Chairman being responsible for the effective 
operation of the Board as a whole, leadership of the Board 
in achieving a culture of constructive challenge by Non-
executives, regularly agreeing and reviewing each Director’s 
training and development needs, and supporting key external 
relationships.
Conflicts of Interest
Conflicts of interest of the Directors are dealt with in 
accordance with the procedures set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association and are monitored by the Chairman. 
Such procedures operated effectively during the year.
Succession Planning
The Board considers succession planning matters on an 
ongoing basis, with particular focus on succession planning for 
the CEO role as well as for senior management. At Board level, 
the Board has prioritized the recruitment of experienced Non-
executive Directors.
Other issues
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and the Company’s nominated advisers, 
who are responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed. Directors are able to seek independent professional 
advice, if required, at the Company’s expense provided that 
they have first notified their intention to do so. 
The appointment or removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the Board as a whole.
The Board accepts that there should be a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the induction of new Directors, which 
has been formulated with the guidance of the Nominations 
Committee.
The opportunity to hold office as Non-executive Directors of 
other companies enables Directors of 888 to broaden their 
experience and knowledge, which will benefit the Company. 
Executive Directors may be allowed to accept non-executive 
appointments with the Board’s prior permission, so long as 
these are not likely to lead to any conflict of interest. Executive 
Directors may be required to account for fees received from 
such other companies.
The Company has arranged insurance cover in respect of 
legal actions against its Directors. To the extent permitted by 
Gibraltar law, the Company also indemnifies the Directors. 
Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover where a 
Director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Re-election and Appointment of Directors
All Directors are subject to reappointment by shareholders on 
an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of the Code.
The Board may appoint any person to be a Director of the 
company and such Director shall hold office only until the next 
AGM, when he or she shall be eligible for re-appointment by 
the shareholders.

specific activities in 2013, are set out in the Audit Committee 
Report on pages 31 to 33.

Nominations Committee
During the year, the Nominations Committee comprised two 
independent Non-executive Directors: Amos Pickel (Chair) and 
John Anderson.
The Nominations Committee assists the Board in discharging 
its responsibilities relating to the composition of the Board. 
The Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing, 
from time to time, the structure of the Board, determining 
succession plans for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 
and identifying and recommending suitable candidates for 
appointment as Directors. The Nominations Committee’s terms 
of reference are available and are included on the Company’s 
website, www.888holdingsplc.com.
During 2013, the Board appointed executive search firm Odgers 
Berndtson to undertake a search for new Non-executive 
Directors. A process of identification of potential candidates 
and interviewing has taken place. 
The Nominations Committee is also responsible for 
implementing the Board’s policy on diversity within the 
scope of its mandate, including setting measurable objectives 
and monitoring progress on achieving such objectives. In 
considering new Board appointments, diversity (including 
gender diversity) is one of the criteria considered by the 
Nominations Committee. The Company’s statement regarding 
diversity is set out in the Corporate Responsibility section of 
the Business Review on page 18.
Remuneration Committee
During the year the Company’s Remuneration Committee 
comprised two Independent Non-executive Directors: Amos 
Pickel (Chair) and John Anderson.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the 
framework of executive remuneration and its cost. It is 
required to take account of any recommendation made by the 
Remuneration Committee in determining the remuneration, 
benefits and employment packages of the Executive Directors 
and senior management and the fees of the Chairman.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report, which outlines the 
Remuneration Committee’s work and details of Directors’ 
remuneration, is on pages 34 to 48. The Remuneration 
Committee’s terms of reference are available and are included 
on the Company’s website, www.888holdingsplc.com.
Risk Management and Internal Control
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the 
Company’s system of internal control, for setting policy on internal 
control and risk management, and for reviewing the effectiveness 
of internal control and risk management. It is management’s 
role to implement Board policies on risk and control, including 
reporting. The system of internal control is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has delegated responsibility to the Audit Committee 
to review the appropriateness and adequacy of systems 
of internal control and risk management in relation to the 
financial reporting process on an ongoing basis and to make 
recommendations to the Board. During 2013, Deloitte Limited 
(Gibraltar) carried out the Company’s internal audit function, 
reporting to the Audit Committee. Details of the internal audit 
function are included in the Audit Committee Report on  
page 31.
888’s payment risk management team, based in Gibraltar, 
has developed stringent payment risk management and 
fraud control procedures. The team makes use of external 
and internal systems to manage the payment risks. Detailed 
procedures exist throughout the Company’s operations and 
compliance is monitored by operational management and the 
internal audit function.
The Directors annually review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control and risk management. The review 
considers individual risk control responsibilities, reporting lines 
and qualitative assessments of residual risks. Such a review was 
carried out in 2013.
Relations with Shareholders and  
Key Financial Audiences
The Company maintains an active and regular dialogue 
with principal and institutional shareholders and sell-side 
analysts through a planned programme of investor relations 
and financial PR activity. The outcome of these meetings 
is reported to the Board. The programme includes formal 
presentations of full year and interim results, quarterly release 
of Interim Management Statements, analysts’ conference calls 
and periodic road shows. 
Shareholders are free to contact any Non-Executive Director to 
address any issues where contact with the Chairman and Chief 
Financial Officer is inappropriate or where such contact has 
failed to resolve the issue.
All shareholders are welcome to attend the 2014 Annual 
General Meeting (scheduled to be held on 14 May 2014) 
and private investors are encouraged to take advantage 
of the opportunity given to ask questions. The Chairmen 
(or nominated members) of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees will attend the meeting and be 
available to answer questions.

Compliance with Statutory Provisions
As the Company is registered in Gibraltar, it is subject to 
compliance with Gibraltar statutory requirements. The main 
legislation relevant to companies in Gibraltar is the Gibraltar 
Companies Act, which is based on the UK Companies Act 
1929. The Company is in full compliance with the Gibraltar 
Companies Act.
Going Concern 
After careful review of the Group’s budget for 2014, its 
medium-term plans, liquid resources and all relevant matters, 
the Directors are confident that the Company and the Group 
have adequate financial resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. They have therefore 
continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are 
disclosed in the Business Review on pages 19 to 20.
Corporate Social Responsibility Statement
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer is the Director responsible 
for monitoring corporate social responsibility within 888. The 
Board receives periodic reports on the Group’s activities in this 
area from the Chief Executive Officer. Further details are set 
out in the Corporate Responsibility section on pages 16 to 18.
Whistleblowing Policy
The Company’s whistleblowing policy sets out the overall 
responsibility of the Board for implementation of the policy, but 
notes that the Board has delegated day-to-day responsibility 
for overseeing and implementing it to the designated 
whistle-blowing officer. The policy provides that where an 
employee is not comfortable making a disclosure to his/
her respective direct line manager, disclosure can be made 
to the designated whistle-blowing officer whose details are 
provided. If the subject of the disclosure in any way involves 
the designated whistle-blowing officer, the disclosure may be 
made directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee or to 
another member of the Group’s senior management. Whilst 
employees are permitted to make disclosures anonymously, 
disclosing employees are encouraged to reveal their identity 
to the designated whistle-blowing officer in order to allow a 
full and proper investigation to take place; measures can be 
taken to preserve the confidentiality of the disclosure where 
appropriate. The Board commits to investigating all disclosures 
fully, fairly, quickly and, where circumstances permit, 
confidentially. Undertakings are made to employees who raise 
genuinely held concerns in good faith under the procedure 
that they will not be dismissed or subjected to any detriment 
as a result of his/her action. During the year, all employees of 
the Group were sent a reminder regarding the whistleblowing 
policy as part of a general refresher of various Group policies. 
No reports of incidents under the whistleblowing policy were 
received in 2013.
Diversity Policy
Details of the Company’s diversity policy and involvement 
of women in management of the Group are set out in the 
Corporate Responsibility section of the Business Review on 
pages 16 to 18.

30 Letter from the  
Chairman of the Audit Committee
23124.04   25 March 2014 6:24 AM   Proof 11
Dear Shareholder,
The Audit Committee has continued to work over 2013 to improve the Company’s risk management and reporting.
In this report of the Audit Committee as regards the year ending 31 December 2013, we have made every effort to provide detailed 
information as to the activities of the Committee over the course of the year, noting the purpose of such activities and their results, 
as well as to give shareholders some insight into the judgment calls made by the Committee and the basis upon which they were 
made.
The Committee’s primary responsibility is to review the financial information provided to shareholders on behalf of the Board, to 
review the Company’s internal financial controls and to oversee its relationship with the external auditors.
The main agenda items at the four meetings of the Committee in 2013 included reviewing the regular financial reports made to 
shareholders, monitoring and reviewing the internal audit programme, and reviewing the effectiveness of internal control systems. 
Details of the further work carried out by the Committee are given in the report that follows. The Company’s Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer are invited to all the meetings of the Committee, however the Committee also meets when 
appropriate with the external auditor without the presence of the Executive Directors or management.
In addition, during 2013, Deloitte assisted the Audit Committee with its internal audit function. In order to do this, the internal 
auditor prepared a risk report, on the basis of which work commenced on various internal audit projects, regarding which the 
audit committee received periodic updates. During 2013, the internal auditor produced three reports on issues of importance to 
the Group, which were received by the audit committee for comment and two of which have been finally approved. The audit 
committee has further prioritised a list of internal audit issues to be examined by the internal auditor in 2014.
In October 2013, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) issued a report on the reporting of audit committees, providing further 
insight from companies and investors on effective approaches to audit committee reporting in light of the changes to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The Committee has sought in this report to include more detail on the specific matters raised by the 
FRC as well as generally to increase the visibility of shareholders to the activities of the audit committee.

Membership
The Audit Committee is chaired by Non-executive Director 
Amos Pickel. John Anderson also served on the Committee 
throughout the year. The members of the Committee are 
considered independent by the board, having no day-to-
day involvement with the Company. The Board is satisfied 
that Amos Pickel has sufficient recent and relevant financial 
experience to chair the Audit Committee. Normally, by 
invitation, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer and, where appropriate, representatives of 
the Company’s external auditors attend the Audit Committee 
meetings. In addition, the Committee meets with the external 
auditors in the absence of the Company’ Executive Directors 
and management.
Roles and Responsibilities
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website, www.888holdingsplc.com.
Work of the Committee
The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities with regard to financial reporting, external and 
internal audits and controls, including reviewing 888’s annual 
financial statements, considering the scope of the annual 
audit and the extent of non-audit work undertaken by external 
auditors, approving 888’s internal audit programme, advising 
on the appointment of external auditors and reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal control systems. There is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant 
risks faced by the group that was in place for the year under 
review and up to the date of approval of the report, which is 
regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with Turnbull 
guidance. The Board is responsible for the group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, which is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. We disclose below a summary of the processes the board 
and its committee applied in reviewing the effectiveness of the 
system and dealing with material internal control aspects of 
any significant problems disclosed in the report and accounts. 
During the year, the Committee fulfilled this role by carrying 
out the following:
 } Review of the terms of reference of the Committee 
to ensure that they correctly reflect the roles and 
responsibilities of the Committee in light of the recent 
developments;
 } Review of the Company’s interim and annual financial 
statements and the published interim management 
statements, with particular focus on ensuring that – taken 
as a whole – the statements were fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provided the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy. In this respect, the Committee 
considered the adequacy of the systems and controls 
on which management relies in preparing the accounts, 
including procedures to ensure accuracy and completeness 
of information and to ensure consistency with information 
provided to the Board throughout the year;
 } Receipt and discussion of the internal audit program and 
reports from Deloitte, in its capacity as the Company’s 
internal auditor, as well as prioritizing the internal audit 
program for the upcoming year;
 } Review of the legal and regulatory risks faced by the 
Company and the manner in which such risks are 
monitored and addressed on an ongoing basis by the 
Board;
 } Review of the going concern position of the company. 
Considering all relevant factors, the Committee 
determined that the Company remains a going concern.
The Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of the 
external audit process by establishing schedules and agendas 
for regular meetings with the auditors, supervising the audit 
function directly to ensure that the auditors are independent 
and objective in their findings, meeting with the auditors 
to assess their plans for the audit, and working to ensure 
comprehensive audit coverage to meet the risks and demands 
posed by the Company’s business. 
During the year, the Committee fulfilled this role by carrying 
out the following:
 } Meetings with the auditors at the planning stage and at 
completion of their review of the interim accounts, at the 
planning and final stages of the year end audit. Within 
these meetings, areas of significant interest that were 
discussed were as follows: 
 } Review of the impairment tests applied to intangible 
assets in light of the future cash flows expected from 
such assets on the balance sheet and calculation of the 
appropriate discount rate; 
 } Revenue recognition policies of the group and the 
systems and controls around the recording of income 
in the accounts;
 } Taxation position of the group;
 } The appropriateness of the accounting in respect of 
the joint venture arrangements entered into by the 
Group in the USA;
 } Considering the adequacy of the Company’s procedures 
for safeguarding the objectivity and independence of the 
external auditor; and
 } Considering the implications for the Company of the Code 
as to putting the external audit out to tender at least once 
every ten years. It is noted that this audit is provided under 
a joint arrangement within the same international firm 
structure and the relevant firm’s audit partners have been 
rotated every five years with the next individual partner 
rotation due in 2014. The Committee is considering the 
requirement to put the external audit out to tender in the 
near future.

The appointment or reappointment of the external auditor is put 
to the vote of each Annual General Meeting. Prior thereto, the 
Audit Committee considers the auditor’s performance during 
the year, and forms a view as to whether to recommend that the 
present auditor be re-appointed or an alternative be proposed. 
As regards 2013, the Audit Committee formed the view that the 
external auditors performed their role in a professional manner 
and recommended that the auditor be re-appointed for 2014 
at the next AGM in May 2014 and, if so appointed, that they will 
hold office until the conclusion of the next general meeting of 
the Company at which accounts are laid.
BDO LLP and BDO Limited were appointed as the Company’s 
external auditors in 2004. Whilst the Code requires companies 
to comply with the requirement to put the external audit out 
to tender once every ten years, or explain their failure to do 
so, the Financial Reporting Council put forward some possible 
transitional arrangements, including suggesting that companies 
which appointed their auditor post-2000 may defer the tender 
process until after one more audit partner term. In addition, 
the Competition Commission proposals published in October 
2013, which are expected to pass into law in October 2014, 
also provided for transitional arrangements which will require 
companies which have not tendered since the beginning of 
2005 to tender two years after the present partner rotation 
period ends; as well as European regulations approved in 
December 2013 and which are expected to come into law 
within two years in the United Kingdom, but which currently 
contain no such transitional arrangements. Neither BDO LLP 
nor BDO Limited provides any material non-audit services 
to the Company. The Audit Committee seeks to ensure that 
the Company’s auditors are objective and independent by 
monitoring the appointment of the auditors for any non-audit 
work involving fees above US$0.1 million. In 2013, the external 
auditors carried out non-audit work for the Company involving 
fees in the aggregate amount of US$0.1 million.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholders,
The new regime applying to directors’ remuneration reporting has introduced a number of requirements both in terms of 
formulating a written remuneration policy, disclosing it to shareholders and putting it to vote at the Annual General Meeting; and 
in terms of remuneration reporting, including as to the manner in which the remuneration policy was implemented in the relevant 
period as well as other relevant matters regarding directors’ remuneration during the year.
The Company “early adopted” some of the reporting requirements in 2012, on a voluntary basis, which has put it in an 
advantageous position to report in 2013 on its remuneration policy and other relevant matters. It has done so even though it is 
incorporated in Gibraltar and, therefore, is not legally required to comply with the new UK regulations on directors’ remuneration. 
As such, the Board intends to put the remuneration policy set out in this Report, and the remainder of the Report as a whole, to 
shareholders for approval in two separate votes at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. Since the Company is not a UK incorporated 
company, and is not subject to the UK Companies Act 2006 nor the UK regulations on directors’ remuneration, the two votes will 
be “advisory” votes. This means that payments made or promised to directors would not have to be repaid if either of the votes 
were not passed, and while the Board intends to set Directors’ remuneration in accordance with the remuneration policy, subject to 
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, neither the Board nor individual directors are legally bound by the policy.
The Board has determined that its remuneration policy shall come into force immediately after the Annual General Meeting, subject 
to its approval by shareholders. As from the effective date, the Board intends that all payments made by the Company to its 
directors will be made in accordance with the remuneration policy. Existing obligations will continue to be met. It is the Company’s 
intention that the remuneration policy will remain in force until a new remuneration policy that has been approved by shareholders 
takes effect. Furthermore, the Company intends to again seek shareholder approval for its remuneration policy in three years’ time.
The proposed remuneration policy seeks to align the Company’s remuneration policy with Company strategy and its approach 
to risk, and on rewarding success fairly, whilst avoiding paying more than is necessary to properly attract, retain and motivate 
Directors of appropriate calibre to the Company’s business. In adopting the policy, the Company confirms that there is a formal 
and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual 
directors, with no director being involved in deciding his own remuneration.
Annual Statement
2013 was a record year for the group, with revenue increasing by 7% compared to 2012, Adjusted EBITDA increasing by 13% and 
like for like Adjusted EBITDA increasing by more than 20% compared to 2012. During the year, the Board discussed with investor 
representative groups the remuneration of the Executive Directors, amongst other matters. During 2014, the Remuneration 
Committee will exercise its duties in accordance with the Remuneration Policy set out herein, subject to its adoption by the Annual 
General Meeting.
We hope that you will find the Directors’ Remuneration Report informative and would be happy to discuss any feedback you may 
have.
Sincerely,
Amos Pickel
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Introduction
The Company presents its report on the remuneration of its 
Directors for the year ended 31 December 2013. The Company 
is incorporated in Gibraltar and, therefore, is not required to 
comply with the UK Companies Act 2006 or the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report requirements in Schedule 8 to the UK 
Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended), but has chosen 
to prepare this Remuneration Report on the basis of those 
requirements, as appropriate.
The report sets out the remuneration policy proposed to be 
put to the 2014 Annual General Meeting, together with the 
structure and details of the remuneration of the Directors 
for the year ended 31 December 2013. A report regarding 
implementation of the remuneration policy will be included 
in future Annual Reports relating to periods during which the 
remuneration policy is effective. The report also describes 
the Board’s policy and approach to the Principles of Good 
Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration contained in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. 
A resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
is proposed, annually, to shareholders for approval. This 
Remuneration Report and the Remuneration Policy will each 
be put to shareholder votes at the upcoming Annual General 
Meeting. As stated above, the advisory nature of the votes, 
due to the Company’s incorporation in Gibraltar, means that 
obligations to make payments to directors would continue 
to be enforceable in the event that either of the votes is not 
passed and neither the Board nor individual directors are 
legally bound by the Remuneration Policy.
Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors
Remuneration packages must be sufficient to attract, retain 
and motivate Directors of the calibre appropriate to a global 
business in a competitive environment. The Remuneration 
Committee is mindful that many of the Group’s competitors 
are not UK listed companies and acknowledges the unique risk 
profile associated with online businesses of the nature of the 
Group’s, and takes these matters into account in determining 
appropriate remuneration levels. The components of the 
remuneration structure are set out below.
At least half of the total potential remuneration of the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer is represented 
by a variable element, dependent on the performance of the 
Group. The Remuneration Committee considers that these 
represent achievable and motivational levels of personal 
rewards commensurate with stipulated levels of corporate 
performance.
The Remuneration Committee is mandated by the Board 
to satisfy itself that the level of the Directors’ and senior 
management’s remuneration is appropriate, having regard 
to pay and conditions throughout the sectors in which 
the Group operates as well as pay and conditions of 
employees throughout the Group. It further ensures that such 
remuneration aligns with the risks and rewards to shareholders. 
In this context, the Remuneration Committee regularly 
reviews individual and corporate performance targets and 
uses careful and rigorous judgment to match remuneration to 
achievements.
The Remuneration Committee applies a remuneration policy 
which has at its core the following objectives:
 } To align the incentives of executives with the interests of 
shareholders, including being mindful of employee costs 
in light of the Company’s capital needs and return to 
shareholders;
 } To focus on top-line growth and margin improvement;
 } To link a significant proportion of remuneration to financial 
and individual performance, as well as shareholder return, 
both in the short term and long term;
 } To provide strong linkage between remuneration, 
performance and delivery of Company strategy; and
 } To ensure total remuneration is market-competitive in the 
industry and helps attract and retain executives of the 
highest calibre.

The following is the Company’s Remuneration Policy to be put to an advisory vote of the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company scheduled to be held on 14 May 2014: 
Chart 1- Future Policy Table
Remuneration 
Component Purpose How it operates Opportunity Performance Metrics
Base Salary Provide an attractive 
pay package taking 
into account the risks 
and responsibilities 
of the role in order 
to attract, retain and 
motivate directors of 
suitable calibre 
The Executive Directors’ 
base salaries are subject to 
annual review at the time 
of the publication of the 
annual financial statements 
with effect from 1st 
January of the same year. 
The Company considers 
that the Executive 
Directors’ personal 
performance is best 
measured in accordance 
with the performance of 
the Company as a whole, 
taking into account any 
changes in the level of 
responsibilities of the 
Executive Directors. 
Therefore, in determining 
salary levels and raises, the 
Remuneration Committee 
has regard to the pay and 
conditions of comparable 
companies in the same 
sector, including the FTSE 
250 Index.
The Remuneration 
Committee has regard 
to the last reported 
median salary level of 
the upper quartile of 
FTSE 250 companies in 
determining base salary. 
The Executive Directors 
will generally not be 
paid more than 5% 
over such last reported 
upper quartile median, 
except in circumstances 
of significant changes in 
responsibilities.
Payment of base salary is not subject 
to performance conditions. However, 
in reviewing salaries, the Remuneration 
Committee takes into account pay 
and conditions elsewhere across 
the Group, relevant market data and 
benchmarking, and the individual 
Director’s performance and experience. 
Benchmarking is carried out on a total 
remuneration basis, and takes account 
of pay levels for comparable roles at a 
range of organisations of similar size 
and sector. No recovery or withholding 
applies to salary. Current salary levels 
of the Executive Directors are set out 
on page 42.
Benefits Provide an attractive 
benefits package 
taking into account 
the risks and 
responsibilities of the 
role in order to attract, 
retain and motivate 
directors of suitable 
calibre 
Benefits may include cost 
of, or an allowance toward, 
accommodation (where 
the Company has required 
the Executive Director to 
relocate), use of Company 
car, car allowance, health 
insurance (or contribution 
towards health insurance 
scheme), disability and 
life insurance, directors’ 
indemnities and directors’ 
& officers’ insurance to the 
extent permitted by law, 
pension (or payment in lieu 
thereof) at the discretion 
of the Remuneration 
Committee. 
Benefits will be 
market competitive 
taking into account 
the role and the local 
market.  The value 
will be appropriate 
to the individual 
circumstances of the 
individual executive 
director. The current 
package of benefits 
will be maintained 
but the value may 
fluctuate depending 
amongst other things 
on insurance costs 
and an individual’s 
circumstances.
Benefits are not subject to 
performance conditions. No recovery 
or withholding applies to benefits. 
Current benefit levels of the Executive 
Directors are set out on page 42.
Short-term 
incentives
Provide a challenging 
framework to 
incentivize executive 
performance and align 
executive incentives to 
shareholder interests
An annual bonus becomes 
payable following the 
approval of the Group’s 
annual results at the 
annual general meeting, 
in accordance with the 
performance criteria set 
by the Remuneration 
Committee at the 
beginning of the financial 
year. The annual bonus 
may be paid following 
release of the annual 
financial results as the 
Remuneration Committee 
may determine in its 
discretion, provided that 
any such earlier bonus 
payment shall be subject 
to claw-back. The bonus 
can be paid in cash or 
shares, at the discretion 
of the Remuneration 
Committee.
Targets are set in light 
of company growth 
and market conditions. 
The Remuneration 
Committee considers 
the target Adjusted 
EBITDA growth metric 
as being appropriate for 
determining challenging 
performance targets. 
Maximum opportunity 
is 100% of base salary.
Maximum bonus award is 100% of base 
salary for each of the CEO and CFO, 
calculated on a linear scale based on 
like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA growth 
(i.e. with the adjustment for exceptional 
items relating to the changing 
regulatory environment to arrive at 
a like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA, as 
determined by the Remuneration 
Committee). The threshold like-for-
like Adjusted EBITDA growth and the 
like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA growth 
giving rise to maximum bonus award 
are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee in accordance with the 
Executive Directors’ annual targets. No 
bonus is paid where growth is below 
threshold like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA 
growth, and a bonus is only payable 
where Adjusted EBITDA is above 
budget for the year as approved by 
the Board. Whilst not implemented at 
present, the Remuneration Committee 
may decide to apply clawback or 
malus to short-term incentive grants 
to Executive Directors recruited in 
future, at its discretion and pursuant 
to the employment agreement of such 
Executive Director.

value, aligned

of the 
Company’s 
long-term 
strategy
The following is a summary of the 
long-term incentive plans currently 
utilized by the Company. Other plans 
or amendments to the existing plans 
may be utilized at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee and subject to 
any required shareholder approvals.
888 All-Employee Share Plan
The Company currently grants awards 
under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan.
All employees, consultants and Executive 
Directors of the Group who are not within 
six months of their normal retirement age 
are eligible to participate in the 888 All-
Employee Share Plan at the discretion of 
the Remuneration Committee. 
Awards under the 888 All-Employee 
Share Plan can either be granted for 
no consideration (or with a nil exercise 
price for options) or at an exercise 
price that will normally be no less than 
the market value of an ordinary share 
at the time of grant or average share 
price during a period as determined 
by the Remuneration Committee at 
time of grant. In countries where an 
award or option involving real shares 
is not appropriate or feasible for legal, 
regulatory or tax reasons, a phantom 
award may be used which will pay a 
cash sum to an equivalent value in lieu of 
shares.
The maximum number of ordinary shares 
that an eligible employee may acquire 
pursuant to share awards or options 
granted to such person in any calendar 
year under the 888 All-Employee Share 
Plan and the 888 Long-term Incentive 
Plan may not have an aggregate market 
value, as measured at the date of grant, 
exceeding 200% of such person’s annual 
base salary or such higher limit as the 
Remuneration Committee may determine 
is appropriate in any individual case.
Awards vest over a fixed period of up to 
four years from the date determined by 
the Remuneration Committee at the time 
of grant. The Remuneration Committee 
may determine that the vesting and 
release or exercise of share awards and 
options under the 888 All Employee 
Share Plan are subject to performance 
conditions imposed at the time of grant.
The vesting of awards is subject to any 
applicable performance conditions 
and continued employment during the 
vesting period, with exceptions where 
the Executive Director leaves for certain 
“good reasons”, including ill-health, injury, 
disability, timely retirement, disposal of 
employing company or business by the 
group, or other reasons determined by 
the Remuneration Committee.  Awards 
will vest early in the event of a change 
of control of the Company, and in such 
event may be exercised within one month 
of the date on which the relevant event 
occurs or otherwise lapse automatically; 
provided that the Board may determine 
instead that outstanding awards shall 
instead be exchanged for new awards 
which in the opinion of the Board are 
equivalent thereto but relate to shares in 
a different company. 
The Executive 
Directors are 
granted nil 
cost options or 
shares for no 
consideration 
on an annual 
basis following 
the publication 
of the Group’s 
annual results. 
The total grant 
allocation to 
each Executive 
Director under 
the All Employee 
Plan is equal 
to 100% of 
such Executive 
Director’s salary 
converted into 
shares of the 
Company by 
reference to the 
prevailing market 
value of a share 
at the time of 
grant. 
Share awards or nil cost options issued 
with performance criteria are subject to 
3 year cliff vesting, with equally weighted 
dependence on EPS-based and TSR-based 
metrics.
The performance conditions of nil cost 
options or free shares are measured over 
a period of 3 years commencing from the 
beginning of the financial year in which the 
award is granted, with 50% of such share 
awards or options dependent upon the 
achievement of a performance condition 
based on cumulative growth in Earnings 
Per Share (EPS) over such three-year 
period adjusted on a like-for like basis, and 
the other 50% of such share awards or 
options dependent upon the achievement 
of a performance condition based on 
relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
compared to a defined peer group median 
over such three-year period. 
The threshold compound EPS growth 
rate as well as the compound EPS growth 
rate and annual relative TSR giving rise to 
maximum vesting are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee in accordance 
with Executive Directors’ annual targets. 
With regard to the share awards or options 
subject to the EPS performance condition, 
where the compound annual EPS growth 
rate, is between the threshold compound 
EPS growth rate and the compound 
EPS growth rate giving rise to maximum 
vesting, such share awards or options vest 
on a linear scale between 25% and 100% 
of the shares under the EPS element, 
with an EPS growth rate of below the 
threshold compound EPS growth rate 
not allowing any vesting. With regard to

the TSR performance condition, where 
the Company’s TSR over the vesting 
period is between the median of a peer 
group determined by the Remuneration 
Committee and the TSR over the vesting 
period above such median giving rise to 
maximum vesting, such share awards or 
options vest on a linear scale between 
25% and 100% of the shares under the TSR 
element, with TSR below such median not 
allowing any vesting.  The peer group for 
the TSR performance condition determined

made to date, however the Remuneration 
Committee will reconsider the composition 
of such peer group on an annual basis

recruited in future, at its discretion and 
pursuant to the employment agreement of 
such Executive Director.

Phantom Share Award
Generally in circumstances where the grant 
of equity may give rise to dilution in excess 
of limits set down in institutional investor 
guidelines, a phantom share award may be 
granted. 
Brian Mattingley was granted a phantom 
share award by the Company pursuant 
to his employment agreement dated 27 
March 2012. 
The phantom share award provides 
that Mr Mattingley will be entitled to a 
one-time cash sum, on the vesting date 
of 27 March 2015 provided that he is in 
employment with the Company at that 
time. The amount payable is calculated on 
an incremental basis, based on the average 
share price of the Company over a period 
of 20 dealing days prior to the scheduled 
vesting date for the award. The minimum 
amount payable is £250,000 and the 
maximum payable is £5,500,000.
Specifically, where the Company’s average 
share price is less than 50p in the 20 
dealing days prior to the scheduled 
vesting date, a minimum award amount 
of £250,000 is payable. Where the share 
price is between 50p and 60p, the award 
payable is calculated on a straight-line 
basis between £250,000 and £450,000. 
For each additional 10p above a share 
price of 60p up to £1, an incremental 
amount of £200,000 is payable; for each 
additional 10p above a share price of £1 
and up to £1.20, an incremental amount of 
£300,000 is payable; for each additional 
10p above a share price of £1.20 and up to 
£1.60, an incremental amount of £400,000 
is payable; and for each additional 10p 
above a share price of £1.60 up to £2.00, 
an incremental amount of £500,000 is 
payable up to a maximum payment of 
£5,500,000. 
The phantom award will also vest if Mr 
Mattingley leaves employment before the 
normal vesting date for any reason unless 
he resigns or the Company dismisses him 
summarily in accordance with the terms 
of his contract for example for gross 
misconduct. The average share price will 
normally be calculated by reference to 
the 20 day period up to the date of the 
termination of employment. However, if the 
Company has terminated Mr Mattingley’s 
employment under notice, he may request 
the average share price to be calculated 
either by reference to the period up to the 
service of the notice or the normal vesting 
date of 27 March 2015 as he chooses. If 
there is a change of control, the average 
share price will be calculated by reference 
to the period up to the change of control. 
The fair value of Mr Mattingley’s award 
at 31 December 2013 has been externally 
evaluated at £1.9 million, with the Company 
recording a charge in the amount of £1.4 
million in its 2013 (£0.5 million in 2012) 
accounts in respect of the amount earned 
in the year.
The maximum 
amount 
payable is 
£5,500,000 
for the 
achievement 
of an average 
share price of 
at least £2.00 
over the 20 
dealing days 
prior to  
27 March 2015. 
Phantom awards are subject to 3 year 
cliff vesting, and grant a one-time cash 
sum on the vesting date provided that the 
Executive Director is in employment with 
the Company at that time. 
Whilst not implemented at present, the 
Remuneration Committee may decide 
to apply clawback or malus to phantom 
grants to Executive Directors recruited in 
future, at its discretion and pursuant to the 
employment agreement of such Executive 
Director.

Determination of Performance Measures
The performance measures adopted by the Company in 
determining the remuneration of its Executive Directors 
acknowledge that the performance of the Executive Directors 
is best measured in accordance with the performance of 
the Company as a whole. For this reason, the Remuneration 
Policy has regard to various financial measures, including 
both internal measures such as like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA 
growth and cumulative growth in Earnings Per Share (adjusted 
to compare like for like), as well as relative T otal Shareholder 
Return compared to a peer group median, which the Company 
believes best reflects the interests of shareholders. In general, 
the Company seeks to remunerate its Executive Directors in line 
with comparable roles at other companies in the same market, 
taking into account the scope of roles and responsibilities of the 
Executive Directors; similarly, the Company seeks to remunerate 
its employees generally in line with comparable roles of 
personnel located in comparable locations.
Recruitment of New Directors
The Company is aware of its need to attract and retain new 
Directors of suitable calibre to its business, and determines 
the remuneration packages it offers by taking into account the 
global nature and competitive environment of its business. 
The principles to be applied by the Company in agreeing the 
components of a remuneration package for the appointment of 
a new Executive Director will include the following:
 } In general, the total compensation package offered to a 
new Executive Director will not exceed the upper quartile 
total compensation package of the FTSE 250;
 } Insofar as practicable, the remuneration proposed for 
a new Executive Director would be consistent with the 
”Future Policy” table set out above;
 } In order to secure an appropriate candidate, it may be 
necessary to offer a higher base salary than that offered to 
the current Executive Directors;
 } There may be a need to compensate a newly recruited 
Executive Director for forfeiting remuneration from 
existing employment. The Company may award a newly 
recruited Executive Director a signing bonus or retention 
bonus, which may be paid in the form of cash, options 
and/or shares, and may rely on Listing Rule 9.4.2 to put 
an appropriate arrangement in place upon recruitment. 
If the remuneration being forfeited was subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions the compensation 
awards will be subject to Company performance 
conditions and where practicable will mirror the vesting 
schedule of the remuneration being forfeited;
 } The Company will not pay more than is necessary to 
attract a suitable individual for the role; 
 } Relocation benefits may be applicable where the newly 
recruited Executive Director is required by the Company 
to relocate;
 } Other benefits may also be payable, including business 
expense reimbursement, car or car allowance, health 
insurance (or contribution towards health insurance scheme), 
pension (or payment in lieu of pension), life insurance, 
holiday pay, sick pay and other statutory benefits;
 } Where an existing employee is promoted to the board, 
existing contractual entitlements including any outstanding 
share and cash awards and pension entitlements will be 
honoured;
 } The Remuneration Committee may negotiate inclusion 
in a newly recruited Executive Director’s employment 
agreement a clawback or malus mechanism as regards 
short-term or long-term incentives, and/or a mitigation 
mechanism regarding short-term and long-term incentive 
payments made during the Executive Directors’ unexpired 
notice period where such Executive Director is engaged in 
other employment during such period. 
 } The Company will make timely disclosure of the 
remuneration structure of any new Executive Director or 
Chairman in a RIS.
Directors’ Service Agreements and Termination Benefits
Details of the Directors’ Service Agreements are set out in 
Charts 6(a) and 6(b) on page 44. 
It is the Company’s policy that each Executive Director’s 
service agreement is terminable on no more than 12 months’ 
written notice by either party; the notice period applying 
to both Brian Mattingley’s and Aviad Kobrine’s employment 
is 12 months. Each Executive Director’s employment can 
be terminated by making a payment equal to the salary 
and pension contributions (if any) and the value of other 
contractual benefits due to the Executive Director in lieu of any 
unexpired notice period. The Executive Directors shall continue 
to be entitled to be paid a bonus and in Brian Mattingley’s case, 
to payment of his phantom share award as described on page 
39, in respect of any unexpired part of the notice period even 
if the employment is terminated by making payment in lieu 
of notice. No other benefits upon termination of employment 
are payable. Each Executive Director’s employment can be 
terminated without compensation in circumstances where the 
employer is entitled to terminate for cause, as defined for the 
purposes of the service agreement. An Executive Director’s 
entitlement to share awards and share options under the 888 
All-Employee Plan on termination of employment are governed 
by the terms of that plan, pursuant to which, if the termination 
occurs for various “good reasons” set out in the Plan (details 
set out on page 37), any vested but unexercised awards may 
be exercised or released within six months after such cessation, 
whilst any unvested portion automatically lapses, unless 
determined otherwise by the Remuneration Committee. In 
exercising its discretion, the Remuneration Committee will have 
regard to the circumstances of the termination and any special 
circumstances of the Executive Director in determining whether 
to extend the exercise period by an additional short period. 
The directors’ service contracts are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office at any time during normal 
business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public 
holidays excepted).
Remuneration Scenarios
The first financial year in which the Remuneration Policy applies 
is 2014. The following graphs set out the minimum, target and 
maximum remuneration presently expected to be payable to 
each of the Executive Directors in that year:

The following assumptions were used in the above graphs:
Fixed Salary: Brian Mattingley’s and Aviad Kobrine’s fixed 
salaries for 2014 are set out on page 43.
Benefits: The graph assumes that Brian Mattingley’s and Aviad 
Kobrine’s benefits are as set out on page 42 below.
Short-Term Incentive: The maximum bonus payable to each 
of Brian Mattingley and Aviad Kobrine is equal to one year’s 
salary. The graph assumes that the Executive Directors’ 2014 
target performance (which the Board considers stretching) will 
give rise to entitlement of 75% of the maximum award amount.
Long-Term Incentive: The  graph assumes no further phantom 
grants to Brian Mattingley in 2014, and therefore there is 
no Long-Term Incentive component of Brian Mattingley’s 
compensation in 2014. Aviad Kobrine’s nil cost options are 
granted subject to the performance conditions set out in the 
Remuneration Policy. The graph assumes that the Executive 
Directors’ 2014 target performance (which the Board considers 
stretching) will give rise to vesting of 75% of the maximum 
award amount. The graph assumes that the share price 
remains at the same share price as at 31 December 2013. 
Finally, it should be noted that the graph shows the potential 
remuneration opportunity granted in the relevant year rather 
than what actually vests and is received in such year.
Policy on Exit Payments and Loss of Office
The Remuneration Committee will consider a director’s 
past performance, the circumstances of and the reasons for 
his departure, prevailing best practice, and any transition/
handover required in exercising any discretions relating to 
his arrangements for loss of office, including his contractual 
arrangements, his participation in an annual bonus scheme and 
awards under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan.
Consideration of Shareholder Views on Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee intends to establish a program of 
consultation with significant investors. The Board engages with 
significant investors regarding remuneration issues and intends 
to continue doing so.
Consideration of Employee Views on Remuneration
Whilst the Company does not formally consult employees 
on remuneration, in determining the remuneration policy for 
Executive Directors, the Committee takes account of the policy 
for employees across the workforce. In particular, when setting 
base salaries for executives, the Committee compares the 
salary increases with those for the workforce as a whole. 
The overall remuneration policy for Executive Directors is 
broadly consistent with the remainder of the workforce. 
Executive remuneration and remuneration of senior employees 
is weighted towards performance-related pay; the Company 
has introduced equity based schemes for senior employees 
(albeit at lower quantum) which are similar to those of the 
Directors.

Fees Duly compensate 
Non-executive 
directors, taking 
into account the 
risks of the role, in 
order to attract and 
retain Non-executive 
Directors of suitable 
caliber.
The Chairman and the Executive Directors determine the fees paid  
to the Non-executive Directors. The Chairman’s fees are determined 
by the Remuneration Committee with reference to prevailing fee rates 
amongst the upper quartile of FTSE 250 companies. Fees paid to 
the Non-executive Directors are set by reference to an assessment 
of the time commitment and responsibility associated with each 
role, and the Remuneration Committee has reference in this respect 
to prevailing fee rates amongst the upper quartile of FTSE 250 
companies. Levels take account of additional demands placed upon 
individual Non-executive Directors by virtue of their holding particular 
offices, such as Committee Chairman and/or Deputy Chairman, 
and travel time to Board meetings at the Group’s headquarters in 
Gibraltar. The fees paid to each Non-executive Director during 2013 
are disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration summary on page 43. 
Other Benefits The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are not eligible to 
participate in any bonus plan, pension plan, share plan, or long-term 
incentive plan of the Company. The Chairman and Non-executive 
Directors are covered by the Company’s directors’ & officers’ 
insurance policy and are entitled to indemnification in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association. In addition, the Chairman 
receives a cash amount covering life insurance and health insurance 
expenses. The amount paid to the chairman during 2013 is disclosed 
in the Directors’ remuneration summary on page 43.
Non-executive Directors’ appointments, which are for a term of 
three years, may be terminated by the Company without notice 
in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association 
and the Gibraltar Companies Act, except for the Chairman 
who is required to be given six months’ prior written notice of 
termination. No compensation is payable on the termination of 
the appointment.

Salary: In 2013, Brian Mattingley’s annual salary was £377,000, 
and Aviad Kobrine’s annual salary was £359,000

. In 2014, Brian 
Mattingley’s annual salary will be £396,000 and Aviad Kobrine’s 
annual salary will be £377,000

. These amounts are converted 
into USD in the Single Total Figure table in accordance with the 
GBP:USD exchange rate as at 31 December 2013.
Benefits: Benefits provided to Brian Mattingley in 2013 include 
the provision of accommodation and the use of a company car 
at the Company’s expense. Benefits provided to Aviad Kobrine 
include a car allowance and health, disability and life insurance.
Short-term incentives: The sole short-term incentives 
applicable to Brian Mattingley and Aviad Kobrine in 2012 
and 2013 were their annual bonuses. In both cases, the 
performance conditions set out in the Remuneration Policy 
applied. Specifically, threshold performance for 2013 was 5% 
year on year Adjusted EBITDA Growth and target performance 
for 2013, which was considered a stretching target, was 15% 
year-on-year Adjusted EBITDA growth, which would have given 
rise to payment of 75% of the Executive Directors’ bonuses. In 
fact, year-on-year Adjusted EBITDA growth for 2013 (adjusted 
to arrive at a like for like basis) exceeded 20%, thus giving rise 
to payment of 100% of the Executive Directors’ bonuses. The 
2013 Adjusted EBITDA performance also exceeded budgeted 
EBITDA for 2013.
Long-term incentives: The long-term incentives applicable to 
Aviad Kobrine in 2012 and 2013 were governed by the 888 All-
Employee Share Plan; however, no performance-based grants 
under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan were due to vest in 
2012 and 2013 and therefore no vesting occurred. As regards 
Brian Mattingley, the phantom award is due to vest in 2015 and 
therefore no long-term incentive figure appears in the table for 
2012 and 2013. 
Pensions: In 2013, Brian Mattingley had no pension entitlement 
from the Company. Aviad Kobrine is entitled to a cash payment 
in lieu of an annual contribution to his personal pension scheme 
of 15% of his base salary.
Other items in the nature of remuneration: Aviad Kobrine 
benefited in 2012 and 2013 from vesting of awards under the 
888 All-Employee Share Plan granted to him in previous years. 
The value of the vested awards is determined in accordance 
with the share price as of the vesting dates being 44.8p on 15 
January 2012, 70.5p on 24 May 2012 and 160.2p on  
24 May, 2013.

Implementation of the Remuneration Policy
The performance targets applying to Directors’ remuneration in 
2014 are considered commercially sensitive. The Remuneration 
Committee intends to disclose these performance targets 
retrospectively in the 2014 Remuneration Report.
The salary to be paid to the Executive Directors in 2014 is set 
out on page 43. Brian Mattingley is entitled in 2014 to use of 
company car. Benefits payable to Aviad Kobrine in 2014 will be 
paid on the same basis as 2013, as set out on page 43. Payment 
of short-term incentives and vesting of long-term incentives 
will occur in accordance with the remuneration policy, and the 
performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee, as 
stated above.
Remuneration Committee Advice
The Remuneration Committee consisted solely of independent 
Non-executive Directors, currently Amos Pickel (Chair) 
and John Anderson. As a member of the FTSE 250 Index 
throughout 2013 (and on the reserve list in 2012), the Company 
is required to have three independent Non-executive Directors 
on its Remuneration Committee. As such, the Company 
continues to seek suitably experienced Non-executive Directors 
to expand its Board and committee membership. Details of 
attendances at Committee meetings are contained in the 
statement on Corporate Governance on pages 27.
The Remuneration Committee’s remit includes such matters as:
Determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration 
policy with regard to the Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other members of the 
executive management; 
Regularly reviewing the on-going appropriateness and 
relevance of the Company’s remuneration policy;
Setting and monitoring performance criteria for bonus 
arrangements operated by the Group ensuring that they 
represent achievable and motivating rewards for appropriate 
levels of performance and, where appropriate, are justifiable 
taking into account the Company’s and its Group’s overall 
performance and the corresponding return on shareholders’ 
investment in the same period;
Recommending to the Board the policy for and scope of 
pension arrangements for the Executive Directors; and 
In relation to the Company’s share option and share award 
schemes, setting or recommending vesting criteria which are 
appropriate in terms of the Company’s performance and return 
on shareholders’ investment over the same period.
The formal terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee 
are available on the Company’s website, www.888holdingsplc.
com.
The Board intends that executive remuneration policies be 
both formal and transparent. It further acknowledges the 
importance of taking into consideration independent advice 
in setting remuneration policies and benefit levels. In 2013, 
the Remuneration Committee took into consideration advice 
received in the past from New Bridge Street, however no 
additional advice was received during 2013. New Bridge Street 
does not provide any other services to the Company, and was 
appointed in the past by the Remuneration Committee as an 
objective and independent remuneration adviser. No fees were 
paid by the Company to New Bridge Street in 2013.

Voting at General Meeting
At the Company’s last Annual General Meeting, held on 8 May 
2013, 86.62% of the votes (243,336,972 votes) were cast for 
the resolution to approve the Remuneration Report, 13.38% 
(37 ,590,064 votes) of the votes were cast against the resolution 
to approve the Remuneration Report, and 28,576 votes were 
withheld.
Actions taken by the Directors in 2013 in response to concerns 
of institutional investor groups included:
 } The Remuneration Committee has sought to provide more 
detail in the Remuneration Report and to make it a more 
straightforward document to read.
 } The performance conditions under the 888 All-Employee 
Share Plan are considered by the Remuneration Committee 
to be challenging, due to the 3-year cliff vesting mechanism 
and the reference to relative TSR compared to a peer group 
median. The performance targets set by the Remuneration 
Committee for the Executive Directors are also considered 
to be stretching.
 } The Remuneration Committee may negotiate inclusion 
in newly recruited Executive Directors’ employment 
agreements a clawback or malus mechanism as regards 
short-term or long-term incentives, and/or a mitigation 
mechanism regarding short-term and long-term incentive 
payments made during the Executive Directors’ unexpired 
notice period where such Executive Director is engaged in 
other employment during such period.
 } The Remuneration Committee has sought to introduce 
guidelines that will reference overall compensation levels, 
to compensation packages in FTSE 250 companies, 
in order to avoid concerns that compensation may be 
considered or appear excessive.

Independent auditors’ report to the 
Members of 888 Holdings plc
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion: 
 } The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 } The Group and Company’s financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union; and
 } The financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated Accounts) 
Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as amended). 
We have audited the financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of 888 Holdings plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity, the Consolidated and Company 
Statements of cash flows and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a number of subjective judgements and significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are, by their nature, inherently uncertain (see 
note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). We primarily focused our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the Group financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the 
greatest effect on our Group audit in the current year are noted below. This is not a complete list of all risks or areas of audit 
focus identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. Their report on those matters that 
they considered to be significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on pages 31 to 33. We focused on the 
following areas:
 } Revenue recognition, which is a presumed fraud risk under International Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland). The main risks 
are the completeness, existence and presentation in the statement of comprehensive income of net gaming revenue and 
other revenue. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of the various income streams earned by the Group are 
given in note 2 to the financial statements. The Group also makes certain judgements around the estimates and treatment of 
various customer incentives and bonuses that are either deducted from revenue or treated as a cost, the timing of revenue 
recognition and the accounting treatment of revenue streams derived from contractual arrangements entered into with third 
parties. 
We documented and tested the key IT and manual general and application controls over the completeness and accuracy 
of the Group’s main gaming systems. This included testing the reconciliation between the main gaming systems and the 
nominal ledger. We also undertook analytical and other substantive testing, including IT interrogation work over net gaming 
revenue, other revenue and the treatment of customer bonuses. 
We reviewed the assumptions, estimates and judgements applied by management related to certain customer bonuses and 
challenged these based on available information. 
We reviewed key contracts related to revenue share agreements and other relevant documentation to assess whether 
the revenue recognised had been correctly treated as gross or net in line with the Group’s stated accounting policies and 
whether any other terms within the contract had any material accounting or disclosure impacts. We also assessed whether 
the revenue recognition policies adopted by the group complies with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and industry standards.
Where revenue was recorded through journal entries we performed testing to establish whether a service had been provided 
in the financial year to support this recognition.
 } The assessment of the additions to, and carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, to determine whether there 
was a risk of material misstatement in the carrying value of these assets and whether an impairment should be recognised. 
Intangible assets primarily comprise those intangible assets recognised on acquisitions, licenses acquired, and internally 
generated computer software enhancements, including those designed to meet US licensing criteria. The Group holds 
material amounts related to the above assets with carrying values supported through compiling discounted cash flow 
models with assumptions, estimates and judgements adopted or applied by management. Key assumptions include discount 
rates, perpetuity rates, expected operating margins and growth rates, the future period over which projections should apply, 
and sensitivity analysis.
Stock Code: 888
www.888holdingsplc.com Financials
49 23124.04   25 March 2014 6:24 AM   Proof 11
We documented and tested the key controls in respect of the capitalisation of intangible assets, tested a sample of projects 
undertaken in the year against invoices from external suppliers and internal payroll costs and assumptions, and evaluated 
the assessment by management as to whether the project spend met all the recognition criteria set out in IAS38. We also 
considered whether there were any indications of impairment of intangible assets. We utilised our internal valuations team 
as part of the audit team and together we challenged management’s assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models 
prepared to assess the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles as described in note 11 of the group’s annual report. 
This included reviewing all the key assumptions against external evidence where available and by reviewing the cash flow 
projections against board approved budgets and assessing the reasonableness of cash flow projections beyond that period 
against available evidence to support these including external information and studies. We also assessed the past ability of 
management to forecast with material accuracy. We also performed other sensitivity analyses on these models particularly 
where changes in key assumptions could have an impact on the headroom against a break-even position. We also reviewed 
the disclosures in the financial statements to conclude that these reasonably highlighted all key assumptions and judgements 
made.
 } Legal and regulatory compliance and provisions. Given the developing nature of the gaming sector in many countries across 
the world, there is a risk that potential material legal or regulatory matters are not appropriately disclosed or provided for. 
We discussed with the Group’s Legal advisors as to whether there were any known instances of material breaches in 
regulatory and licence compliance that needed to be disclosed or required provisions to be made in the financial statements. 
The Group have compliance obligations that range from administration of their licences to assessing the impact of country-
specific and pan-regional rules and regulations on its business. We reviewed how the Group monitors legal and regulatory 
developments and their assessment of the potential impact on the business and the appropriate internal and external 
advice taken in respect of these developments. The Group assesses the appropriateness and quantum of any provisions and 
disclosures required under IFRSs as adopted by the EU for certain outstanding legal and regulatory disputes which are an 
estimate of what the Directors believe to be the fair value based on the Directors best estimate where there is a probable 
outflow of economic benefits. Where the Group do not consider the likelihood of a provision being probable the Group will 
disclose the existence of a contingent liability unless it is remote. We corroborate this by reviewing any correspondence 
from regulators related to the Group’s licence compliance requirements. We met with, and reviewed the litigation report 
provided by the Group’s legal counsel and discussed each of the material cases noted in the report to determine the Group’s 
assessment of the likelihood and magnitude of any liability that may arise. We also reviewed, where required, any available 
external legal or regulatory advice sought by the group in their assessment. We challenged the assessments made, where 
needed, and reviewed the calculation of any provisions made in the light of the external advice provided to the Group. We 
also reviewed all disclosures prepared by the Group for these provisions and contingent liabilities.
 } Tax including deferred tax given that due to the international nature of the Group there was a risk that material tax 
exposures may not be reasonably disclosed or provided for in the financial statements. 
We discussed with the Group how they manage, control and operate Group companies in the countries in which they are 
registered. We also reviewed how the Group considers taxation as part of the overall business planning and how they 
regularly monitor the rules and practices governing the taxation of ecommerce activity that is evolving in many countries. 
The Group seeks external advice on these matters in formulating the estimated amount of tax to be provided in certain 
jurisdictions. We reviewed the taxation provisions in respect of each jurisdiction in which the Group is registered or has a 
significant presence. We assessed the latest external advice received by management with regard to exposure to taxation 
in the major territories in which the Group operates, and any correspondence from tax authorities in those territories that 
may require additional disclosures or provisions. We also considered any transfer pricing studies carried out on behalf of 
the Group in the period, and assessed, in respect of earlier studies, whether there had been any change in the basis of 
operations in the relevant territories. We challenged the assessments made by management, where needed, and reviewed 
the disclosures prepared by the Group for the tax provisions and contingent liabilities.
 } The re-opening of the US market in certain states. Certain US states have legalised various forms of online gaming, and 
the Group has re-entered the market during the year. As a consequence, the Group has entered into a number of new 
agreements and joint venture arrangements during the year and management has assessed the accounting treatments that 
should be applied to these. 
We critically assessed the agreements entered into during the year in respect of the group’s US operations, both with 
third parties and joint venture partners and assessed whether the company and consolidation accounting applied was in 
accordance with applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU. We also assessed with the Group’s Compliance and Legal advisors 
as to whether the Group was operating in accordance with its US licenses.
Independent auditors’ report to the 
Members of 888 Holdings plc
888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2013

Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on 
our audit and on the financial statements. For planning, we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, 
including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial 
statements. In order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use 
a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below 
these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, 
and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole. 
We determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole to be US$4.0 million. In determining this, we based our 
assessment on a level of 1% of revenue for the year. On the basis of our risk assessment, together with our assessment of the 
Group’s control environment, our judgment is that performance materiality for the financial statements should be 75% of planning 
materiality. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences individually in excess 
of US$0.1 million. We also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. 
An overview of the scope of our group audit
The majority of the Groups individual entities do not require individual statutory audits and as an online gaming Group the 
accounting for the Group is centrally managed. For the purposes of the Group audit we consider that there are two reporting 
components, comprising one company based in Israel, and the other being the rest of the worldwide group. The audit of the 
Israeli company is carried out by a component audit firm using a materiality of US$0.9 million as instructed by BDO, and the 
BDO Group audit team audit the rest of the worldwide group, which includes all the Group’s consolidated revenue, and the 
majority of the Groups costs, using materiality of US$4.0 million. As part of our work on the group and in accordance with 
ISA600 “Special considerations - Audit of Group financial statements ( including the work of component auditors) we requested 
that the Israeli component auditor performed their audit under group instructions and reporting, and we met with and reviewed 
their work as part of the overall audit. Based on the above scope we were able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence had been obtained as a basis of our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by legal and regulatory requirements 
In our opinion:
 } The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2013 for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 } The part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
Section 421 of the UK Companies Act 2006. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is: 
 } Materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 } apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the company acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 } is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed.
Under Gibraltar legal and regulatory requirements we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 } The Company has not kept proper accounting records;
 } if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 } if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 } The Directors’ statement, on page 30, in relation to going concern; and
 } the part of the corporate governance statement on pages 27 to 30 relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 26, the Directors’ are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
888 Holdings plc has complied with the requirements of rules 9.8.6 and 9.8.8 of the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Conduct 
Authority and in accordance with Section 421 of the UK Companies Act 2006 in preparing its Annual Report, as if it was 
incorporated in the United Kingdom. As auditors, we have agreed that our responsibilities in relation to the Annual Report will 
be those as set out below.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial 
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999, 
the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as amended), and the part of the 
Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with Section 421 of the UK Companies Act 2006. 
We also report to you whether in our opinion, the information disclosed in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial 
statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information specified by the Listing Rules and Gibraltar legislation regarding Directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements performed in accordance with ISAs (UK and Ireland)
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies within the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our 
report.
The purpose of this report and restrictions on its use by persons other than the members of the Company, as a body
Our report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with our engagement letters. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters that we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.

The financial statements are presented in US Dollars (US$ million) because that is the currency the Group primarily 
operates in. 
The consolidated financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies 
(Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act. 
The following standards and interpretations, issued by the IASB or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) have been adopted by the Group during the year with no significant impact on its consolidated results 
or financial position:
 } Amendments to IAS 1 — Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income (effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2012).
 } IFRS 13 — Fair Value Measurement. 
 } Amendments to IAS 19 — Employee Benefits: Accounting for defined benefit pension schemes.
 } Amendments to IFRS 7 — Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). 
 } Improvements to IFRSs (2009–2011 cycle) – This annual improvement project clarifies the requirements of IFRSs 
and eliminates inconsistencies within and between standards. The relevant changes included amendments to IAS 1 
‘Presentation of financial statements’, IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’, IAS 32 Financial instruments and IAS 12 
‘Income taxes’.

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
The following standards and interpretations issued by the IASB or IFRIC have not been adopted by the Group as they were 
not effective for the year 2013. The Group is currently assessing the impact these standards and interpretations will have 
on the presentation of, and recognition in, its consolidated results in future periods:
 } IFRS 10 — Consolidated Financial Statements (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014). 
 } IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014).
 } IFRS 12 — Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014). 
 } IAS 27 — Separate Financial Statements (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014). 
 } IAS 28 — Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2014). 
 } Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 – Consolidated Financial Statements, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure 
of Interests in Other Entities (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014). 
 } Amendments to IAS 32 — Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014).
 } Amendments to IAS 36 — Recoverable amounts disclosures for non-financial assets (effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014).
 } Amendments to IAS 39 — Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting (effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014).
 } IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments (the effective date is to be determined). This amendment has not yet been endorsed 
for use in the EU.
 } IFRIC 21 Levies — Interpretation of IAS 37: Accounting for levies imposed by governments (effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014). This amendment has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU.
 } Amendments to IAS 19 — Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2014). This amendment has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU.
 } Improvements to IFRSs (2010-2012 cycle and 2011-2013 cycle) — This annual improvement project clarifies the 
requirements of IFRSs and eliminates inconsistencies within and between standards. The relevant changes included 
amendments to IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’, IFRS 2 ‘Share-based 
Payment’, IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’, IAS 16 
‘Property, Plant and Equipment’, IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ and IAS 40 ‘Investment 
Property’ (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014). This amendment has not yet been 
endorsed for use in the EU.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgments that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based 
on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and 
assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year. These policies together with references to the related notes to the financial statements can

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are 
companies controlled by 888 Holdings Public Limited Company. Control exists where the Company has the power 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are 
consolidated from the date the parent gained control until such time as control ceases. 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements using the purchase 
method of accounting. On the date of the acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair 
values and any excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill. 
Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company and using 
consistent accounting policies. 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised provided that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occurred after deduction of 
certain bonuses granted to customers and after adding the management fees and charges applied to customer accounts, 
and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. 
Revenue consists of income from online activities and that generated from processing customers’ cross currency deposits 
and withdrawals, which is allocated to each reporting segment. Revenue from online activities comprises:
Casino and Bingo
Casino and Bingo online gaming revenue is represented by the difference between the amounts of bets placed by 
customers less amounts won.
Where the Group is using a third-party platform and is not deemed to be the principal, the recognised income is the net 
revenue share earned from that activity. 
Poker 
Poker online gaming revenue represents the commission charged from each poker hand in ring games and entry fees 
for participation in Poker tournaments. In Poker tournaments entry fee revenue is recognised when the tournament has 
concluded. 
Emerging Offerings 
Revenue from Emerging Offerings is mainly comprised of Sportbook, Social games and brand licensing on third party 
platforms.
 } Sportsbook online gaming revenue comprises net house win adjusted for the fair value of open betting positions.
 } Social games revenue comprises the Group’s share from the sale of virtual goods to customers playing the Group’s 
games. 
 } Revenue derived from brand licensing on third party platforms represents the Group’s net revenue share from that 
activity.
B2B 
 } Where the Group is considered to be the principal, income is recognised as the gross revenue generated from use of 
the Group’s platform in online gaming activities with the partners’ share of the revenue charged to operating expenses. 
 } In other cases income is recognised as the Group share of the net revenue generated from use of the Group’s platform.
 } B2B also includes fees from the provision of certain gaming related services to partners.
 } Customer advances received are treated as deferred income within current liabilities and released as they are earned.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses consists primarily of staff costs, payment service providers’ commissions, chargebacks, commission 
and royalties payable to third parties, all of which are recognised on an accruals basis, and depreciation and amortisation.

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses consist primarily of staff costs, corporate professional expenses, all of which are recognised on an 
accruals basis, and impairment charges.
Foreign currency 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-US Dollar currencies are translated into US Dollar equivalents using 
year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at 
the dates of the transactions. Exchange rate differences on foreign currency transactions are included in financial income 
or financial expenses as appropriate. 
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US Dollars are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows: 
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance 
sheet; and
(b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate (unless this average is 
not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case 
income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions).
Taxation 
The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet 
differs from its tax base. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Recognition of deferred tax assets is 
restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit. The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/
assets are settled/recovered.
Segment information 
Segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the management team comprising mainly the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. These segments are: 
 } B2C (Business to Customer) Casino and games, Poker, Bingo and Emerging Offering; and
 } B2B (Business to Business) which offers Total Gaming Services under the Dragonfish trading brand. Dragonfish offers 
to its business partners use of technology, software, operations, E-payments and advanced marketing services, through 
the provision of offline/online marketing, management of affiliates, SEO, CRM and business analytics. 
Intangible assets 
Acquisitions 
Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised 
at their fair value at the acquisition date. The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the 
assets. This has ranged between three months to four years for acquisitions to date. The exception is acquisitions of trade 
names, which have an indefinite useful economic life and therefore an annual impairment test is conducted. 
Internally generated intangible assets 
Expenditure incurred on development activities is capitalised only when the expenditure will lead to new or substantially 
improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has 
sufficient resources to complete development. All other development expenditure is expensed. Subsequent expenditure on 
intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which 
it relates. The Group estimates the useful life of these assets as between three and five years, except for certain licence 
costs which are amortised over either the life of the licence, or up to 20 years, whichever is the shorter period.

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the Company’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Cost comprises the fair value of any assets transferred, 
liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated 
income statement. Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of 
consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated income statement on the acquisition. Changes in the 
fair value of the contingent consideration are charged or credited to the income statement. In addition the direct costs of 
acquisition are charged immediately as an expense.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. Assets are assessed at each 
balance sheet date for indications of impairment. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets less 
their estimated residual values over their expected useful lives. The annual depreciation rates are as follows: 
IT equipment 33%
Office furniture and equipment 7–15%
Motor vehicles 15%
Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives
Impairment of non-financial assets 
Impairment tests on goodwill are undertaken annually on 31 December, and where applicable an impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value 
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is 
written down accordingly. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on 
the asset’s cash generating unit (i.e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows). 
Investment in equity accounted joint ventures
Jointly controlled entities (JCE) are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by 
contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. 
JCEs are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are recognised initially at cost. The 
Group’s share of post-acquisition profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that losses 
in excess of the Group’s investment in the JCEs are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good those losses. 
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its JCEs are recognised only to the extent of unrelated 
investors’ interests in the JCE. The investor’s share in the JCEs profits and losses resulting from these transactions is 
eliminated against the carrying value of the JCEs. Any premium paid for a JCE above the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount 
of the JCE. Where there is objective evidence that the investment in a JCE has been impaired the carrying amount of the 
investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets, and any charge or reversal of previous 
impairments is taken to the consolidated income statement.
Where amounts paid for a JCE are exceeded by the Group’s share of the fair value of net assets acquired, the excess is 
recognised as negative goodwill and released to the consolidated income statement immediately.
The Group’s share of additional equity contributions from other joint venture partners is taken to Other Comprehensive 
Income.
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost and principally comprise amounts due from 
credit card companies and from e-payment companies. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full 
amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when there is objective evidence that the full amount may not be 
collected.

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into contracts for derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge 
operational risks associated with foreign exchange rates. Such derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value 
under IAS 39 and comprise level 2 fair value measurement instruments and are carried in the balance sheets as assets 
when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in 
the fair values of derivatives are recorded immediately in the consolidated income statement.
A fair value measurement hierarchy is based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value to increase 
consistency and comparability. The inputs are categorised into three levels, with the highest priority given to unadjusted 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs. Level 
2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the 
asset or liability. 
Short term investments
Short term investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on 
an active market. They are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition. 
They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provisions for 
impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash. They include short-term deposits originally purchased with maturities of 
three months or less. 
Equity 
Equity issued by the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost. 
Liabilities to customers 
Liabilities to customers comprise the amounts that are credited to customers’ bankroll (the Group’s electronic ‘wallet’), 
including provision for bonuses granted by the Group, less management fees and charges applied to customer accounts, 
along with full progressive provision for jackpots. These amounts are repayable in accordance with the applicable terms 
and conditions.
Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets comprise non-derivative financial assets not included in any of the above financial asset 
categories and comprise principally the Group’s investments in entities not qualifying as joint ventures or subsidiaries. 
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in a separate component of equity. Where there 
is a significant decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset the full amount of the impairment, including 
any amount previously charged to equity, is recognised in the income statement. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset 
any balance within equity is transferred to the income statement. 
Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to income on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which it 
is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated. 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends this is when paid. In the case 
of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Share-based payments
 } Equity settled
Where the Company grants its employees or contractors shares, or options, the fair value at the date of grant is charged to 
the income statement over the vesting period. Non-market performance conditions are taken into account by adjusting the 
number of instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised 
over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest. Market performance conditions are 
taken into account in determining the fair value at the date of grant.
 } Cash-settled
For transactions treated as cash settled share based payment transactions, the Company recognises the services received, 
and a liability to pay for those services, as the employees render the service. 
Until the liability is settled, the Company remeasures the fair value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of 
settlement, with any changes in fair value charged or credited to the income statement for the period. 
Severance pay schemes
Severance scheme surpluses and deficits are measured at:
 } The fair value of plan assets at the reporting date; less
 } Plan liabilities calculated using the projected unit credit method discounted to its present value using yields available 
for the appropriate government bonds that have maturity dates appropriate to the terms of the liabilities; plus
 } Unrecognised past service costs.
Any difference between the expected return on assets and that actually achieved, and any changes in liabilities over the 
year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the scheme, are recognised in other comprehensive income in 
the period in which they arise.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Group enters into financial guarantee contracts the Group considers these to be insurance contracts and 
accounts for them as such. The Group treats the guarantee as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable

Severance pay liability – Israel 
The Group’s employees in Israel are eligible to receive certain benefits from the Group in specific circumstances. As 
such the Group operates a defined benefit severance pay plan which requires contributions to be made to separately 
administrated funds. 
The method used to determine the current service cost and the present value of the defined benefit obligation, according 
to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ is the Projected Unit Credit actuarial cost method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
by the Group using the equity method.

operation: 
Gibraltar — Gibraltar companies are subject to a corporate tax rate of 10%. 
Israel — The domestic corporate tax rate in Israel from 2013 is 25% (2012: 25%). The Company’s Israeli subsidiary had 
entered into certain transfer pricing agreements with the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner, which were effective until 
the end of 2010. The subsidiary has recently concluded an assessment agreement with respect to all tax years up to and 
including 2012. 
UK — 888’s subsidiary in the UK pays corporate tax in the UK at the applicable rate of 23.25% 
(For period April 1, 2012 — March 31, 2013: 24%; for period April 1, 2013 – March 31, 2014: 23%)
8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share 
In accordance with IAS 33, ‘Earnings per share’, the weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share 
takes into account all potentially dilutive equity instruments granted, which are not included in the number of shares 
for basic earnings per share. Certain equity instruments have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as 
their conditions of being issued were not deemed to satisfy the performance conditions at the end of the performance 
period or it will not be advantageous for holders to exercise it into shares, in the case of options. The number of equity 
instruments excluded from the diluted EPS calculation is 2,259,924 (2012: 6,363,756).

The Directors believe that EPS excluding share benefit charges, retroactive taxes and associated charges, movement in

profit on acquisition of equity accounted joint venture (“Adjusted EPS”) better reflects the underlying performance of the 
business and assists in providing a clearer view of the performance of the Group.

10 Acquisitions
Acquisitions completed in prior years
Internet domain name and brands
During the prior year the Group acquired one of its former B2B customers domain name and brands for cash consideration 
of US$0.6 million, and contingent consideration based on a percentage of revenue receivable originally estimated at US$0.9 
million. All amounts, except for goodwill arising of $0.3m, were attributed to intangible assets acquired, comprising customer 
information and brands. During the year 2012 the contingent consideration payable was increased by US$0.4 million and 
during the year 2013 by US$0.5 million. The acquisition is deemed immaterial in respect of IFRS 3 disclosure requirements.
Wink online Bingo business
On 31 December 2009 the Group acquired the trade and assets comprising the Wink online Bingo business of  
Daub Limited (‘Wink Bingo Business’) for an all cash consideration.
During the prior year, the Group paid an amount of US$35.5 million and completed the settlement of the deferred 
consideration payable in respect of the Wink acquisition. Following negotiations with the vendors the final amount payable 
was reduced and as a result US$2.4 million was released to the consolidated Income Statement in 2012.

Impairment
In accordance with IAS 36 and the Group’s stated accounting policy an impairment calculation is carried out annually 
on the carrying amounts of goodwill and any other intangible assets that shows indication of impairment. A review was 
carried out at 31 December 2013 to assess whether there was any indication that its other intangible assets and property 
plant and equipment had been impaired. Where an impairment calculation was carried out, the carrying value in use of the 
assets was determined by discounting the future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit to their present value.
Goodwill
Bingo Online Business 
Goodwill and intangible assets associated with the online Bingo business unit relates to the acquisition of the online Bingo 
business of Globalcom Limited during 2007 and the acquisition of the Wink Bingo business in 2009. The income streams 
generated from the bingo business, comprising the B2C Bingo cash generating unit and the B2B cash generating unit, 
have been treated together as the risks and rewards associated with those income streams are deemed to be sufficiently 
similar. Cash flow projections have been prepared covering the following five year period prior to assuming a long term 
growth rate. Underlying growth rates as shown in the table below have been applied to revenue and are based on past 
experience, the reorganisations that have taken place within the B2C Bingo cash generating unit during the year, the 
positive results of which have been seen in recent months, and projections of future changes in the online gaming market.

11 Intangible assets (continued)
Having applied conservative estimates, certain B2B contracts due to end in the next two years have not been projected 
to be renewed and have been assumed to gradually decline over the period to contract end. The discount rate that is 
considered by the Directors to be appropriate is the Group’s specific weighted average cost of capital which also applies 
to the online Bingo cash generating units.

  The discount rate is recalculated every year by taking into account prevailing risk free rates, equity risk premium and company beta and 
having regard to external data commenting upon the Weighted Average Cost Of Capital applied to the Group. 
2
  Operating expenses exclude marketing costs which were included in the projections throughout the period on a slowly declining 
percentage of revenues.
Under the key assumptions above, the Bingo unit recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by US$49 million. A 1% 
increase in the discount rate, or a 1% reduction in the underlying growth rate over the forecast period would reduce this 
excess by US$17 million and US$13 million respectively.
Internally generated Intangible assets
Other intangible assets 
No impairment tests were considered to be required at 31 December 2013 and the carrying value of other intangible assets 
is considered to be appropriate. 
Licenses- prior year impairment
During the year 2012, the Group requested the French licence to be revoked given the impact of high gaming duty rates 
imposed in France which ultimately rendered the offering of the Group’s online gaming services in that jurisdiction not 
economically viable. As a consequence no future income arises from these assets and the Group made a full impairment 
charge of US$0.8 million in respect of the French licence costs and other intangible assets of US$0.1 million.

Technology Solutions (Gibraltar) Limited (“TSG”)
In 2010 the Group obtained a licence to operate online poker games in France.
High gaming duty rates imposed in France rendered the offering of the Group’s online gaming services in that jurisdiction 
not economically viable. Accordingly, in 2012, the Group requested its local licence to be revoked following agreement to 
terminate the joint venture. Consequently, in 2012, the Group impaired the full amount of its investment in the joint venture 
in the amount of US$1.3 million.
USA Jointly Controlled Entities
On 11 March 2013 the Group entered into a joint venture agreement (“JVA”) with Avenue OLG Entertainment LLC 
(“Avenue”) and other minority shareholders to form AAPN Holdings LLC (“AAPN”). Under that agreement the Group has a 
47% interest in AAPN. AAPN is funded by Avenue as defined in the JVA.
AAPN New Jersey LLC (“AAPN NJ”) is the entity which contracted with an Atlantic City casino licensee in connection with 
the operation of a B2C gaming offering in New Jersey (an offering which launched in November 2013). AGN LLC is the 
entity which contracted with a Las Vegas casino licensee in connection with the operation of a B2C gaming offering in 
Nevada (this offering has not yet launched).
As at December 31 2013, AGN LLC and AAPN NJ (together, the “Operating Entities”) were 100% owned by 888 US Inc. 
However, both are regarded as jointly controlled entities, as the Group has agreed that so long as the Operating Entities 
remain wholly owned by the Group, they will be operated in a manner consistent with the contractual arrangements in 
place within the AAPN JVA. The Group also has an irrevocable commitment to contribute 100% of the interests in AAPN 
NJ and AGN LLC, to AAPN for no consideration, upon fulfillment of certain conditions.
On this basis the three entities, ( the “US Joint venture”) have been equity accounted for reflecting the Groups effective 
47% interest in their aggregated results and assets.
On 8 July 2013, AGN LLC obtained the required licences by the Nevada Gaming Commission enabling it to provide online 
gaming services in the State of Nevada in accordance with the stipulations of the licences.
On 8 November 2013, AAPN NJ obtained the transactional waiver by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement 
enabling it to provide online gaming services in the State of New Jersey for a period of six months from the date of the 
waiver and subject to final approval by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.

During 2013 the US JV launched regulated license gaming offering in the states of Nevada and New Jersey. As a result 
substantial marketing costs were incurred in order to facilitate the penetration into these newly opened markets.
On acquisition of the interest in AAPN the difference of US$1.9 million between the consideration paid of nil and the share 
of net assets of the entity of US$1.9 million was accounted for as a profit on acquisition in line with IAS 31.
The Group’s share of subsequent increases in the net assets of AAPN arising from equity injections by its JV partners, 
amounting to US $6.1 million has been accounted for through Other Comprehensive Income.

this scheme will vest in installments over a fixed period of up to four years subject to the relevant individuals remaining in 
service. Certain of these awards are subject to performance conditions imposed by the Remuneration Committee at the 
dates of grant, further details of which are given in the directors Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 39.

Ordinary shares granted for future vesting without TSR performance conditions are valued at the share price at grant date 
which the Company considers approximates to the fair value. The restrictions on the shares during the vesting period, 
primarily relating to non-receipt of dividends, are considered to have an immaterial effect on the share option charge.
In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards a charge to the income statement in respect of any shares 
or options granted under the above schemes is recognised and spread over the vesting period of the shares or options 
based on the fair value of the shares or options at the grant date, adjusted for changes in vesting conditions at each 
balance sheet date. These charges have no cash impact. 
Cash-settled share-based payment
On 27 March 2012, the Company awarded its Chief Executive Officer a cash settled share-based award (“Phantom award”). 
The phantom award will be fully vested in three years from the grant date, provided he remains in employment with the 
Company on the third anniversary of the grant date. Under specific terms, the phantom award will also vest if he leaves 
employment before the normal vesting date as detailed in the Directors remuneration report.
The amount payable is calculated on an incremental basis, based on the average share price of the Company over a period 
of 20 dealing days prior to the scheduled vesting date for the award. The minimum amount payable is £0.25 million and 
the maximum amount payable is £5.5 million if the share price is above £2.00.

27 Financial risk management 
The Group is exposed through its operations to risks that arise from use of its financial instruments. Policies and 
procedures for managing these risks are set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer. The 
Board reviews the effectiveness of these procedures and, if required, approves specific policies and procedures in order to 
mitigate these risks.
The main financial instruments used by the Group, on which financial risk arises, are as follows: 
 } Cash and cash equivalents;
 } Restricted cash;
 } Short term investments;
 } Trade and other receivables;
 } Trade and other payables;
 } Liabilities to customers;
 } Available for sale financial investments

(2012: except for available-for-sale assets and US$3.3 million relating to forward currency contracts to hedge risks 
associated with foreign exchange rates). Such derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value under IAS 39 and

In accordance with IAS 39, all financial liabilities are held at amortised cost, except for US$0.4 million of contingent 
consideration arising on acquisitions and US$4.2 million relating to the forward currency contracts to hedge risks 
associated with foreign exchange transactions which are recognised at fair value. Such derivative financial instruments are 
measured at fair value under IAS 39 and comprise level 2 fair value measurement instruments (2012: except for US$0.5 
million of contingent consideration arising on acquisitions which are recognised at fair value). 
At 31 December 2013 and 2012, the fair value and the book value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities were 
materially the same. 
Capital
The capital employed by the Group is composed of equity attributable to shareholders. The primary objective of the Group 
is maximising shareholders’ value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital structure 
most suited to the Group’s size, strategy, and underlying business risk. Other than disclosed elsewhere in note 28, there are 
no demands or restrictions on the Group’s capital. 
The main financial risk areas are as follows: 
Credit risk
Trade receivables
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables due primarily from the Group’s payment service 
providers (‘PSP’). These are third party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawals of funds to and from customers’ 
virtual wallet with the Group. These are mainly intermediaries that transact on behalf of the main credit card companies. 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

84 23124.04   25 March 2014 6:24 AM   Proof 11
27 Financial risk management (continued)
The risk is that a PSP would fail to discharge its obligation with regard to the balance owed to the Group. The Group 
reduces this credit risk by: 
 } Monitoring those balances on a regular basis.
 } Arranging for the shortest possible cash settlement intervals.
 } Replacing rolling reserve requirements, where they exist, with a Letter of Credit by a reputable financial institution.
 } Ensuring a new PSP is only contracted following various due diligence and ‘Know Your Customer’ procedures.
 } Ensuring policies are in place to reduce dependency on any specific PSP and as a result gain high degree of 
diversification.
The Group believes that based on the above and on extensive past experience, the PSP receivables are of good credit 
quality and there is no requirement to provide for any potential bad debts arising from a PSP failing to discharge its 
obligation. None of the balances owed by the various PSP are overdue or impaired (2012: nil).
An additional credit risk the Group faces relates to customers disputing charges made to their credit cards (‘chargebacks’) 
or any other funding method they have used in respect of the services provided by the Group. Customers may fail to fulfil 
their obligation to pay which will result in funds not being collected. These chargebacks and uncollected deposits, when 
occurring, will be deducted at source by the PSPs from any amount due to the Group. As such the Group provides for 
these eventualities by way of a provision based on analysis of past transactions. This provision is netted off from the trade 
receivables balance and at 31 December 2013 was US$1.2 million (2012: US$1.1 million). 
The Group’s in-house Fraud and Risk Management department carefully monitors deposits and withdrawals by following 
prevention and verification procedures using internally developed bespoke systems integrated with commercially available 
third party measures. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
The Group controls its cash position out of its Gibraltar headquarters. Subsidiaries in its other main locations maintain 
minimum cash balances which are deemed required for their operations. 
Cash settlement proceeds from PSPs, as described above, are paid into bank accounts controlled by the Treasury function. 
The Group maintains its funds with highly reputable financial institutions and will not hold funds with financial institutions 
with low credit rating. 
The Group maintains its cash reserves in highly liquid deposits and regularly monitors rates in order to maximize yield.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash represents customers’ funds held for payment service provider transactions in respect of regulated markets.
Short term investments

Market risk 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the interest bearing deposits in which the Group invests  
surplus funds. 
The Group’s policy is to invest surplus funds in low risk money market funds and in interest bearing bank accounts. The 
Group arranges for excess funds to be placed in these interest bearing accounts with its principal bankers in order to 
maximise availability of funds for investments. 
Downside interest rate risk is minimal as the Group has no floating rates borrowings. Given current low interest rates a 
0.5% downward movement in bank interest rates would not have a significant impact on finance income for the year. 
However, a 0.5% increase in interest rates would, based on the year end deposits, increase annual profits by US$0.4 million. 
Currency risk 
The Group’s financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations is mainly attributed to: 
 } Mismatch between balance sheet liabilities to customers which is predominantly denominated in US$ and the net 
receipts from customers which are settled in the currency of the customer’s choice, of which sterling (GBP) and Euros 
(EUR) are significant.
 } Mismatch between reported revenue which is mainly generated in USD (the Group’s functional and reporting currency) 
and a significant portion of deposits which are settled in local currencies. 
 } Expenses, the majority of which are denominated in foreign currencies including sterling (GBP), euro (EUR) and New 
Israeli Shekel (ILS).
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure 
is kept to an acceptable level, inter alia by using foreign exchange forward contracts designed to fix the economic impact 
of known liabilities. At 31 December 2013 the Group had entered into US Dollar/GB Pound and US Dollar/Euro forward 
contracts totaling US$146 million regarding 2014 expected currency excess in GB Pound and Euro. The total fair value 
of the forward contracts was US$4.2 million liability to be settled on a monthly basis throughout 2014. (During 2012 the 
Group had entered into Israeli Shekel/US Dollar outstanding forward contracts totaling US$81 million regarding 2013 
operational business costs incurred in Israeli Shekels. In addition the Group had entered into US Dollar/ GB Pound as well 
as US Dollar/Euro forward contracts totaling US$140 million regarding 2013 currency excess in GB Pound and Euro. The 
total fair value of the forward contracts as at 31 December 2012 was US$ 3.3 million asset which had been settled during 
the year 2013.)

28 Fair value measurements
Materially, the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value are in respect of derivative foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying value of derivative foreign exchange contracts was a liability of US$4.2m at 31 December 2013. (2012: an asset 
of US$3.3m). These comprise level 2 fair value measurement instruments, valued using forward exchange rates that are 
quoted in an active market.
Other financial instruments carried at fair value are not considered material. There were no changes in valuation techniques 
or transfers between categories in the period.
The fair value of the following financial assets and liabilities approximate to their carrying amount:
 } Trade and other receivables
 } Other current financial assets
 } Cash and cash equivalents
 } Trade and other payables
 } Customer deposits

29 Contingent liabilities and regulatory issues
(a) As part of the Board’s ongoing regulatory compliance and operational risk assessment process, the Board continues 
to monitor legal and regulatory developments, and their potential impact on the business, and continues to take 
appropriate advice in respect of these developments. 
(b) Given the nature of the legal and regulatory landscape of the industry, from time to time the Group has received 
notices, communications and legal actions from a small number of regulatory authorities and other parties in respect 
of its activities. The Group has taken legal advice as to the manner in which it should respond and the likelihood of 
success of such actions. Based on this advice and the nature of the actions, the Board is unable to quantify reliably any 
material outflow of funds that may result, if any. Accordingly, no provisions have been made. 
(c) The Group operates in numerous jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Group is filing tax returns, providing for and paying 
all taxes and duties it believes are due based on local tax laws, transfer pricing agreements and tax advice obtained. 
The Group is periodically subject to audits and assessments by local taxing authorities. The Board is unable to 
quantify reliably any exposure for additional taxes, if any, that may arise from the final settlement of such assessments. 
Accordingly, no additional provisions have been made.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
1 General information and accounting policies 
A description of the Company, its activities and definitions are included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The Company has applied accounting policies identical to the Group’s accounting policies listed in note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements other than in relation to investments in its subsidiaries which are held at cost less any 
impairment provision required. 
The following standard issued by the IASB has not been adopted by the Company as this was not effective for the year 
2013. The Company is currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the presentation of its results in future 
periods. 
IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014). 
Under Section 10(2) of the Gibraltar (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to 
present its own income statement. 
2 Investments in subsidiaries
The Company’s principal subsidiaries are listed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements and are held at cost 
less provision for any impairment. The Group applies IFRS 2 ‘Share based payments’. Consequently, the Parent Company 
recognises as a cost of investment the value of its own shares that it makes available for the purpose of granting share 
options to employees or contractors of its subsidiaries. The movement on investment in subsidiaries in both years was in 
respect of IFRS 2. This amount was US$2.7 million in 2013 (2012: US$0.6 million).

The disclosures in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements are identical for the Company.

10 Related party transactions 
During the year the Company was credited with dividends from its subsidiaries totaling US$86.1 million and paid to its 
shareholders dividends totaling US$33.2 million (2012: US$8.7 million). 
Share benefit charges in respect of options and shares of the Company awarded to employees of subsidiaries totalled 
US$2.7 million (2012: US$0.6 million). 
During the year subsidiaries of the Company participated in funding its costs which totalled US$12.5 million  
(2012: US$11.2 million) At 31 December 2013, net amount owed by subsidiaries to the Company amounted to  
US$56.6 million (2012: net amount owed by subsidiaries to the Company US$2.9 million). 
The aggregate benefits paid to the Directors of the Company by its subsidiaries set out below:
Year ended 31 December
2013
US$ million
2012
US$ million
Short term benefits 0.2 0.2
11 Significant non cash transactions
During the year the company was a party to arrangements made by the group to rationalise the intercompany balances 
within the group. Under these arrangements certain intercompany balances were novated to and from the company and 
its subsidiaries, and certain intercompany balances were forgiven by subsidiary companies. As a result movements on 
intercompany debtor and creditor balances of US$238 million and US$238 million respectively in the period did not arise 
as a result of cash transfers and have therefore been excluded from the company cash flow.

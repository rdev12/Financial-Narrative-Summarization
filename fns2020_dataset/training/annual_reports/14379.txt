Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 4 Chairman’s statement
“Smith & Nephew made 
good progress last year , 
delivering strong earnings 
growth and enhanced  
value to shareholders. ”
Dear Shareholder ,
I joined Smith & Nephew in December 
2013, and succeeded Sir John Buchanan as 
Chairman	in	April	2014.	In	my	first	letter	to	you	
I am pleased to report that Smith & Nephew 
made good progress last year, delivering 
strong earnings growth and enhanced value 
for shareholders. We did this whilst making 
major investments to reshape the Group for 
future success such as the acquisition of 
ArthroCare Corporation for $1.5 billion net. 
Revenue was $4,617 million, up 2% on an 
underlying basis or 6% on a reported basis. 
Trading	profit	was	$1,055	million,	up	3% on an 
underlying basis or 7% on a reported basis. 
The	trading	profit	margin	of	22. 9% was 20bps 
up on the previous year. The Board is pleased 
to propose a Final Dividend for the year just 
gone	of	18.6¢	per	share,	giving	a	total	dividend	
for 2014 of 29.6¢,	up	8% year-on-year.
Board changes
Sir John Buchanan retired as Chairman in 
April at the 2014 Annual General Meeting, 
after nine years of outstanding service. On 
behalf of the Board and the whole of Smith  
& Nephew I thank him for his leadership. 
Richard (‘Dick’) de Shutter also retired at the 
Annual General Meeting. In his role as Senior 
Independent Director, Dick provided wise 
counsel	through	a	period	of	significant	growth	
and change. Ajay Piramal retired in March, 
having provided valuable insight into the 
emerging markets as we built our presence 
there. Pamela Kirby retired from the Board 
in July. She also made a major contribution 
– particularly as Chairman of the Ethics & 
Compliance Committee. I thank Dick, Ajay  
and Pamela for their service.
It is a credit to the growing strength and 
reputation of the Company that we have 
attracted top global talent to succeed these 
individuals. Vinita Bali joined the Board in 
December following an impressive career at 
blue-chip global corporations such as The 
Coca-Cola Company in multiple geographies 
including India, Africa, South America, the US 
and UK. Her strong appreciation of customer 
service and marketing will bring deep insight 
to Smith & Nephew as we continue to develop 
innovative ways to serve our markets. Erik 
Engstrom, the CEO of Reed Elsevier , joined the 
Board in January 2015. His understanding of 
how technology can be used to transform a 
business will be invaluable.
First impressions
My	first	impression	of	Smith	&	Nephew	was	
of a Company with strong leadership, a clear 
strategy	and	sound	financial	platform.	The	
open communication between the Board and 
the executive team is a real strength of the 
business. I was particularly impressed with 
the execution of the ArthroCare acquisition, 
especially the thoroughness of our due 
diligence and how well the team is managing 
the integration.
I have also been able to spend time visiting 
our sites and meeting employees, including 
attending a Sports Medicine procedure to 
witness how our highly-skilled reps assist 
surgeons in improving outcomes. I have 
consistently found a business with a strong 
culture, particularly in areas of ethics and 
compliance, and people who are proud of their 
work supporting healthcare professionals. 
Looking ahead I see many exciting 
opportunities – in the Established Markets 
where we are challenging the status quo 
through new commercial models, in the 
Emerging & International Markets where 
we have a leadership platform – and from 
recent acquisitions. In 2015, I believe we 
will	begin	to	see	more	clearly	the	benefits	
of the transformational work that has been 
undertaken at Smith & Nephew, and I look 
forward to sharing more news of these 
achievements next year . 
Yours sincerely,
 
Roberto Quarta
Chairman

Chief Executive Officer’s review
A	good	financial	performance	while	
strengthening the business
Dear Shareholder
Smith & Nephew proudly supports healthcare 
professionals in their daily efforts to improve 
the lives of their patients. We do this by taking 
a pioneering approach to the design of our 
products and services, by striving to ensure 
wider access to our advanced technologies, 
and by enabling better outcomes for patients 
and healthcare systems. In doing so, we drive 
growth and create value for our stakeholders.
In 2014, we made great progress. We drove 
a much improved performance in US Hip 
and Knee Implants and maintained our 
momentum in Sports Medicine Joint Repair 
and Trauma & Extremities. Advanced Wound 
Bioactives, acquired at the end of 2012, again 
produced double-digit growth. Our continued 
investment in Emerging & International 
Markets drove revenues up 17%. 
Performance in Europe was weaker and 
Advanced Wound Management was held 
back by a distribution hold on RENASYS
◊
 
in	the	US,	and	I	am	confident	that	we	have	
taken actions that will deliver a better 
2015 across these areas. Additionally, 
the Phase 3 trial results for HP802 were a 
disappointment, but we remain committed 
to developing pioneering Advanced Wound 
Bioactives treatments.
The Group generated a good increase in 
revenues	and	trading	profit,	and	an	8% uplift 
in EPSA. I am pleased by the changing mix of 
the business, as we successfully rebalance 
by strengthening our higher growth platforms. 
These now represent more than half of our 
revenue, up from just 35% three years ago. 
Pioneering design
Smith & Nephew has a long history of 
pioneering design, dating back to our 
foundations	in	the	19th	century.	In	2014,	we	
launched many exciting products, including 
a cruciate retaining version of our JOURNEY
◊
II 
natural-motion	knee,	a	first-of-its-kind	
DYONICS
◊
 PLAN surgical planning tool for hip 
arthroscopy, and the HAT-TRICK Lesser Toe 
Repair System. We continued to invest more 
in R&D, over 5% of revenue, and have a strong 
pipeline for 2015 and beyond. 
“The journey to reshape  
Smith & Nephew continues  
and I am excited by our  
prospects for accelerating  
growth in 2015 and beyond. ”
6 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 For us, innovation is not just about products. 
It is also about how we do business. We seek 
new ways to serve our customers. In 2014, 
we pioneered a new commercial solution for 
Orthopaedic	Reconstruction	that	fulfils	the	
unmet needs of customers searching for a 
different value proposition. Called Syncera
◊
, 
this offers clinically proven primary hip and 
knee implants combined with cutting-edge 
technology to streamline the extensive 
support process. Syncera has the potential to 
generate	significant	savings	for	the	customer.	
We are encouraged by the contracts signed 
and prospective customers. 
Widening access
In the Emerging & International Markets 
we have built an entrepreneurial business 
resourced	to	maximise	the	significant	
opportunities we see. In 2014, it generated 
more	than	$600	million	revenue,	with	China,	
our largest market, growing revenue at over 
30%. 15% of Group revenue came from these 
markets	in 2014,	up	from	8%	in	2010.	
In 2014, we established a new commercial 
structure to market and expand our mid-
tier value product ranges. This will provide 
wider access to our advanced technologies, 
helping us support an ever greater number of 
customers in delivering affordable healthcare. 
Enabling better outcomes
We provide high quality products and 
medical education to help drive better clinical 
outcomes. During 2014, we saw strong and 
rising demand for unique products such as 
our hard-wearing VERILAST
◊
 Hips and Knees, 
VISIONAIRE
◊
 patient-matched instrumentation 
and the PICO
◊
 portable disposable 
Negative Pressure Wound Therapy system. 
These, and many other advanced Smith & 
Nephew products, also enable healthcare 
professionals to treat more patients faster, 
improving the economic outcome for the 
healthcare system payers. 
Strengthening our platform
In recent years, we have successfully 
supplemented our organic growth through 
acquisitions. Healthpoint Biotherapeutics  
gave us a leading position in Advanced 
Wound Bioactives, the fastest growing 
segment of Advanced Wound Management. 
We have also completed a number of 
acquisitions in the Emerging & International 
Markets, strengthening our platform by adding 
products, manufacturing, distribution  
and sales teams. 
ArthroCare, completed in May 2014, has 
strengthened our Sports Medicine business. 
Its	technology	and	products	significantly	
enhance our portfolio, and we will use our 
global presence to drive substantial new 
growth. The integration is progressing well.
Enhanced	efficiency	
By simplifying and improving our operating 
model we are increasing our agility and 
efficiency.	In	2011,	we	announced	a	
programme to generate annual savings of 
$150 million. By 31 December 2014, we had 
achieved annualised savings of $146 million, 
enabling investment in the Emerging & 
International Markets, R&D and other 
growth opportunities.
In 2014, we announced a further programme 
to realise at least another $120 million of 
annual savings. This work is progressing well. 
For instance, we are rationalising our global 
property portfolio and found major savings 
through better procurement processes.  
These	savings	will	more	directly	benefit	the	
bottom line. 
Great Place to Work
Achieving recognition as a Great Place to 
Work is important to me. It means having 
a workplace where employees are proud 
and excited to come each day because they 
are doing work that makes a difference for 
customers and patients. During 2014,  
I was proud to congratulate our colleagues 
in	Spain	for	being	the	first	country	to	achieve	
this distinction from the Great Place to Work 
Institute – and it will not be the last. Also, our 
sustainability performance was recognised 
again as we retained our rankings in both the 
FTSE4Good and Dow Jones Sustainability 
indices. Acting sustainably and responsibly 
to	deliver	long-term	benefits	to	society	is	
important. It is our employees who earn these 
awards, and I thank them for their efforts.
I am pleased with our momentum in 2014 as 
we	delivered	a	good	financial	performance	
while strengthening the business, and you will 
find	more	details	on	our	successful	actions	on	
pages 42 to 53. Whilst the journey to reshape 
Smith & Nephew continues, we enter 2015 
stronger	and	more	efficient	and	I	am	excited	
by our prospects for accelerating growth in 
2015 and beyond.
Sincerely,
Olivier Bohuon

performance was slightly below estimated 
global segment growth, despite a 15% 
growth in Advanced Wound Bioactives. 
While Trauma & Extremities, Hip Implants 
and Knee Implants growth were also 
slightly below the market, these franchises 
performed better than last year and 
demonstrated an improving trend in 
the second half of the year as a result of 
our investments in marketing, medical 
education and new products. In the higher 
growth Sports Medicine Joint Repair 
segment we delivered growth at around 
market rate and saw the first benefits  
of the ArthroCare acquisition. 
Global Outlook
While there are some signs of 
improvement in economic conditions, 
overall the Established Markets continue 
to experience a challenging environment. 
We have responded by realigning our 
business models and made focused 
investments to enhance our performance 
and efficiency in these markets.
Performance
For Smith & Nephew ‘Innovate for value’ 
means having a pioneering approach 
to creating both products and new 
commercial models to bring products and 
services to our customers.
Consistent with 2013, R&D investment 
represented over 5% of revenue, bringing 
a wide range of products to market across 
all our franchises. More detail on individual 
products is set out on pages 21 to 22 and 
on pages 27 and 31.
In addition we have made investments in 
two venture funds as part of our search for 
future disruptive technologies.
We have also been investing in an innovative 
commercial solution for Orthopaedic 
Reconstruction that fulfils the unmet needs 
of customers searching for a different value 
proposition. Called Syncera, it offers 
customers clinically proven primary hip and 
knee implants combined with cutting-edge 
technology that streamlines the supply 
chain and logistics and enables technical 
support in the operating room. This new 
model has the potential to generate 
significant savings for the customer.
A pioneering approach to products and 
services provides competitive advantages. 
Smarter, easier to use, cost-efficient 
products and services can offset pricing 
pressures, disrupt markets and challenge 
the status quo, which will be required to 
meet the new and expanding demands  
for healthcare customers globally.
Emerging &  
International Markets
Established Markets Innovate for value
Performance
Emerging & International Markets 
represent those outside of the Established 
Markets including the fast growing BRIC 
group of Brazil, China, India and Russia. 
Our Emerging & International Markets grew 
at 17%, building further on the double-
digit growth of 2013. These geographies 
now represent 15% of the Group’s overall 
revenue, up from 11% in 2011.
During 2014:
–  Our success in China continued with 
growth of over 30%, for a second year in 
a row, as our investment in training and 
infrastructure continue to show results.
–  Our Latin American markets, which 
include Brazil and Mexico, are set for 
improvement going forward as we 
spent the year integrating acquisitions 
and making organisational and 
strategic changes.
–  The execution of our mid-tier 
market strategy continues with the 
establishment of an independent 
commercial structure and increased 
investment in building a suitable 
product portfolio.
Global Outlook
The healthcare environment in our regions 
continues to rapidly expand and with the 
right investments combined with strategic 
execution will provide sustained growth 
opportunities for the Group.

Simplify and improve 
our operating model
Performance
Trading profit grew by 3% and trading profit 
margin increased by 20bps while investing 
in our commercial operations and meeting 
market and pricing pressures.
Key initiatives included:
–  Continuing to deliver our $150 million  
per annum efficiency savings 
programme, of which we have achieved 
annualised savings of $146 million  
as at 31 December 2014.
–  Commencing a further $120 million 
annualised Group Optimisation plan 
through a one-off investment of $150 
million, which is progressing well.
–  Moving to a single Managing Director 
model in markets outside of the  
US, combining the commercial 
organisations to leverage scale  
and better serve customers.
By simplifying and improving our  
operating model we have been able  
to liberate resources to invest in growth 
opportunities, meet the persistent  
price pressure and improve our financial 
returns. A simpler and more efficient 
organisation allows us to make faster and 
better decisions.
Supplement organic 
growth with acquisitions
Performance
In 2014, we completed five acquisitions and 
investments, including our largest deal to 
date, the $1.7 billion acquisition of 
ArthroCare Corporation. This brings the 
total over the last 4 years to 15 transactions 
for a combined consideration of $2.8 
billion, including the $782 million 
acquisition of Healthpoint Therapeutics  
in late 2012.
ArthroCare was a compelling opportunity  
to add unique technology and highly 
complementary products to further 
strengthen our sports medicine business. 
We will be able to generate significant 
additional revenue from the more 
comprehensive portfolio. We will use our 
global presence to drive substantial new 
growth. The transaction accelerates our 
strategy to rebalance Smith & Nephew 
towards higher growth opportunities. 
We regularly review acquisitions to ensure 
they are meeting our expectations, and use 
IRRs and ROCE to confirm performance is 
on track to deliver the required return. 
During 2014 we continued to integrate  
our recent emerging markets acquisitions, 
whilst Healthpoint performed strongly  
in its second full year in Smith & Nephew. 
Acquisitions and partnerships are 
important elements which supplement 
organic investment and provide increased 
opportunity for high growth and  
value creation.

We made significant 
progress in 2014…
Reinvestment & Group optimisation
During 2014, we launched a programme to 
target further efficiencies. We have identified 
four main areas of activity:
1  Globalising functions such as Finance, 
HR, IT and Legal to ensure that we are 
operating most effectively to support 
business growth.
2  Driving procurement savings to get the 
most value from the money we spend.
3  Rationalising our footprint to simplify the 
way we work.
4  Further simplifying our operating model, 
including establishing a single operating 
structure under a single managing 
director in all markets outside the US so 
that we can make decisions more quickly 
and effectively. 
All areas of the programme are progressing 
well. Overall, we are on target to deliver 
benefits of over $120 million over a four-year 
period, with the majority of this expected to 
benefit margin over time. 
Acquisitions
We acquired ArthroCare Corporation in 2014 
for a net $1.5 billion. This has strengthened 
our Sports Medicine business. Its technology 
and products will significantly enhance 
our portfolio, and we will use our global 
presence to drive substantial new growth. 
The integration is progressing well.
The financial rationale for this transaction  
was strong, and we expect to realise cost and 
revenue synergies of around $85 million of 
additional annual trading profit in 2017. 
Our other recent acquisitions continue to 
perform well. The Advanced Wound Bioactives 
business acquired at the end of 2012 delivered 
strong 15% growth in 2014. Our emerging 
markets acquisitions in Brazil, Turkey and India 
are now bedded in and delivering increasing 
benefits. And Bioventus, our orthobiologic 
therapies development vehicle, completed 
a successful external refinancing and repaid 
a $160 million loan -note, plus $28 million of 
accrued interest, to us in October.
Dear Shareholder,
Smith & Nephew made significant progress  
in 2014 and continued to deliver good revenue 
and earnings growth. Our growth trajectory 
is being enhanced by the integration of our 
acquisitions, greater Group efficiency, and tax 
improvement – combining with strong cash 
generation and disciplined capital allocation  
to accelerate value creation for shareholders. 
Strong earnings growth
In the full year 2014, we generated revenue 
of $4,617 million (2013: $4,351 million), an 
increase of 2% on an underlying basis and 6% 
on a reported basis. Acquisitions added 5%  
to the reported growth rate, while currency 
was a -1% headwind.
Trading profit was $1,055 million (2013: 
$987 million), up 3% underlying and 7% on 
a reported basis. The trading profit margin 
was 22.9% (2013: 22.7%), a 20bps increase 
despite the headwind from the US RENASYS 
distribution hold announced in June.
Operating profit for 2014 was $749 million 
(2013: $810 million), reflecting acquisition 
costs largely relating to ArthroCare, as well 
as restructuring and rationalisation costs, 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles and 
legal and other items incurred. The net  
interest charge and other financing costs  
for 2014 were $33 million (2013: $7 million). 
Profit before tax was therefore $714 million 
(2013: $802 million).
The tax charge of $213 million reflects an 
effective tax rate of 27.7% for the full year 
(2013: 29.2%) on Trading results.
EPSA was 83.2¢ (166.4¢ per ADS) (2013: 76.9¢). 
Reported basic earnings per share was 56.1¢ 
(112.2¢ per ADS) (2013: 61.7¢).
Trading cash flow was $781 million (2013: 
$877 million), reflecting a trading profit to cash 
conversion ratio of 74% (2013: 89%).
Net debt at the year-end was $ 1,613 million 
reflecting our acquisitions of ArthroCare and 
in the emerging markets. This represents a 
reported net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.2x.

“We expect the Group to

than in 2014. We also 
expect to deliver a further 
improvement in trading

Segment reporting
As we simplify our operating model and move 
to one commercial organisation in all countries 
barring the US, we are updating our segmental 
reporting to reflect this, providing disclosure 
consistent with the financial information used 
by senior management to run the business. 
This means that from 1 January 2015 we will 
continue to disclose revenue performance 
by franchise, but other financial data, such 
as trading margin and assets, will no longer 
be split between two divisions – Advanced 
Surgical Devices (‘ASD’) and Advanced 
Wound Management (‘AWM’), since they  
are now part of one operating unit. 
Outlook
We have made material progress in  
reshaping Smith & Nephew for higher growth 
since 2011. Whilst the journey to transform 
Smith & Nephew continues, increasingly 
we expect to benefit from the actions and 
investments we have made.
We expect the Group to deliver higher 
underlying revenue growth in 2015 than in 
2014. We also expect to deliver a further 
improvement in trading profit margin.
Additionally, we expect the effective corporate 
tax rate on trading results to reduce to slightly 
above 27% in 2015, absent any changes to tax 
legislation. This is incremental to the 220bps 
reduction achieved in the last two years. 
We believe the Group is at the start of a new 
and exciting phase in its 158-year history.
Sincerely,
Julie Brown

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
Our marketplace
Market trends
The combination of ageing populations 
and increasing prevalence of obesity and 
associated chronic illness is expanding the 
gap between the demand for healthcare 
and ability of governments to supply it. The 
changing balance in ageing populations also 
means that there is a potential decrease 
in funds available for healthcare raised 
through taxes on the working population. 
Consequentially, governments and healthcare 
providers are looking for various ways to 
constrain their healthcare expenditure. 
Cost and Outcomes
Healthcare providers, in an effort to reduce 
spending, are increasingly focusing on the 
cost of the whole treatment, rather than 
the individual components. This is leading 
governments and hospitals to seek greater 
transparency of product pricing.
As a result, health economic data is being 
used to obtain reimbursement or justify 
product pricing. Health economic data 
currently forms an integral part in shaping 
the recommendations from the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
in the UK and in the US, the Affordable Care 
Act has committed budget spend to carry 
out comparative effectiveness research 
on treatments. 
As well as the focus on suppliers of 
healthcare products, some providers are also 
implementing incentives for better health 
outcomes to reduce the costs associated 
with repeated patient treatments or reduced 
hospital stay.
Governments are beginning to impose 
penalties on healthcare facilities for acute 
patient re-admissions or for infections 
acquired within the health system which 
present an additional economic burden on 
health care systems.
In the US, healthcare-acquired infections cost 
almost $10 billion annually, with surgical site 
infections being the largest contribution to 
overall cost.
Product innovation has been the primary 
response by some suppliers in meeting 
patient and healthcare provider demands to 
improve outcomes, simplify procedures and 
reduce cost. 
New commercial models, together with 
product innovation, are being adopted by 
health systems as a solution to improving 
resource allocation. There is a recent trend 
by health systems to shift towards ‘payment 
for performance’ schemes in an effort to 
promote high quality care and increase the 
effectiveness of treatments. Additionally, 
suppliers of healthcare products and devices 
are providing lower cost or reduced service 
offerings to those segments of the market 
more sensitive to price.
The healthcare industry is also seeing 
protectionism/localisation playing a part 
in the product selection process as some 
jurisdictions are implementing laws to show 
bias towards locally manufactured products. 
This already exists in Brazil for major tender 
offers and China is considering incentives 
to encourage hospitals to use locally made 
medical devices. 
The increased demand for healthcare 
products and the limitation of available 
resources is widening the funding gap. 
Providing technologies that deliver value by 
improving clinical outcomes while reducing 
the consumption of overall healthcare 
resources is vital for the success and 
sustainability of medical device businesses.
Self-Care and Prevention
Self-care and prevention is regarded as 
an important element of healthcare in that 
it will help protect society from potential 
health threats by minimising the risk factors 
that cause them. Governments have been 
investing in programmes and providing tools 
to encourage and support healthier behaviour 
to reduce the strain on healthcare systems 
from ‘lifestyle’ diseases. Additionally, pressure 
is gradually being applied on the food industry 
to reduce saturated fats, sugar and salt in 
products and increase nutritional labelling 
in an effort to tackle rising rates of obesity 
and diabetes.
Regulatory standards  
and compliance in the 
healthcare industry
The international medical device industry is 
highly regulated. Regulatory requirements are 
important in determining whether substances 
and materials can be developed into safe 
and effective products and done so in an 
environmentally sustainable way.
National regulatory authorities administer 
and enforce a complex series of laws 
and regulations that govern the design, 
development, approval, manufacture, 
labelling, marketing and sale of healthcare 
products. They also review data supporting 
the safety and efficacy of such products. Of 
particular importance is the requirement in 
many countries that products be authorised 
or registered prior to the placement on market 
and that such authorisation or registration 
be subsequently maintained. The major 
regulatory agencies for Smith & Nephew’s 
products include the Food and Drug 
Administration (‘FDA’) in the US, the Medicines 
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency 
in the UK, the Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare in Japan, the China Food and Drug 
Administration and the Australian Therapeutic 
Goods Administration.
Changing demands
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 18 In general, with the aforementioned industry 
trends, safety standards and regulations in 
the medical device industry are becoming 
more stringent. Regulatory agencies are 
intensifying audits of manufacturing facilities 
and the approval time for new products has 
lengthened. Legislation covering corruption 
and bribery such as the UK Bribery Act and 
the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act business 
also apply to all our global operations. 
We are committed to assuring a high level of 
regulatory compliance and to doing business 
with integrity and welcome the trend to higher 
standards in the healthcare industry. We and 
other companies in the industry are subject to 
regular inspections and audits by regulatory 
agencies and notified bodies, and in some 
cases, remediation activities have and will 
continue to require significant financial and 
resource investment. See ‘Legal proceedings’ 
on page 146.
Dependence on government 
and other funding
In most markets throughout the world, 
expenditure on medical devices is ultimately 
controlled to a large extent by governments. 
Funds may be made available or withdrawn 
from healthcare budgets as a result of 
government policy. We are therefore 
largely dependent on future governments 
providing increased funds commensurate 
with the increased demand arising from 
demographic trends.
Pricing of our products is largely influenced 
in most developed markets by governmental 
reimbursement authorities. Initiatives 
sponsored by government agencies, 
legislative bodies and the private sector to 
limit the growth of healthcare costs, including 
price regulation, excise taxes and competitive 
pricing, are ongoing in markets where we 
operate. This control may be exercised by 
determining prices for an individual product 
or for an entire procedure. We are exposed to 
changes in reimbursement policy, tax policy 
and pricing which may have an adverse 
impact on revenue and operating profit. There 
may be an increased risk of adverse changes 
to government funding policies arising 
from the deterioration in macro-economic 
conditions in some of our markets.
Competitors
Competition exists among healthcare 
providers to gain patients on the basis of 
quality, service and price. Providers are under 
pressure to reduce the total cost of healthcare 
delivery. In order to achieve this there has 
been some consolidation in our customer 
base, as well as amongst our competitors, 
and these trends are expected to continue 
in the long term. We compete against both 
local and multinational corporations, including 
some with greater financial, marketing and 
other resources.

Smith & Nephew estimates that the global 
orthopaedic reconstruction segment is worth 
approximately $14 billion and increased by 
approximately 3% in 2014. Competitors in the 
orthopaedic reconstruction segment include 
Biomet, DePuy Synthes (a division of Johnson

approximately 6% in 2014. Competitors in the 
orthopaedic trauma segment include Biomet, 
DePuy Synthes, Stryker and Zimmer.
Smith & Nephew estimates that the global 
sports medicine segment (representing 
access, resection and repair products) is 
worth approximately $5 billion and grew by 
approximately 8% in 2014. Competitors in the 
sports medicine segment include Arthrex, 
Conmed, DePuy Mitek (a division of Johnson

Smith & Nephew estimates that the global 
wound management segment is worth 
approximately $7 billion and grew by 4% 
in 2014. Global competitors vary across 
our product areas and geographies and 
include Acelity, Coloplast, ConvaTec, 3M 
and Molnlycke.
Customers
In certain parts of the world, including the 
UK, much of Continental Europe, Canada 
and Japan, the healthcare providers are 
largely government organisations funded 
by tax revenues. In the US, our major 
customers are public and private hospitals, 
which receive revenue from private health 
insurance and government reimbursement 
programmes. Medicare is the major source 
of reimbursement in the US for knee and hip 
reconstruction procedures and for wound 
treatment regimes. In the emerging markets, 
demand is driven by self-pay patients.
Seasonality
Orthopaedic and sports medicine procedures 
tend to be higher in the winter months when 
accidents and sports related injuries are 
highest. Conversely, elective procedures tend 
to slow down in the summer months due 
to holidays.
Due to the nature of our product range, there 
is little seasonal impact on the Advanced 
Wound Management business.

Our business
Delivering advanced 
medical technologies
Smith & Nephew’s business model, set out 
on page 12, supports our mission to deliver 
advanced medical technologies to help 
healthcare professionals, our customers, 
improve the quality of life for their patients.
Through it we create value. This value  
creation process is actioned through five 
streams of activity. 
– Research & Development 
– Ethics & Compliance 
– Manufacturing
– Medical Education 
– Sales & Marketing 
Our business model is underpinned by our 
Capital Allocation Framework. This enables 
us to invest for the future, both in organic 
growth and through acquisitions, whilst also 
generating value for shareholders today 
through a progressive dividend policy and 
commitment to return any excess capital.
Research and Development
We have a deep knowledge of the needs 
of surgeons, physicians and nurses, we 
understand the economic pressures 
healthcare payers work under, and we 
recognise that patients are demanding better 
treatment options to restore quality of life.
These factors inform our Research and 
Development (‘R&D’) strategy, which is at the 
heart of our business model.
In 2014, we launched many exciting products, 
including a cruciate retaining version of our 
JOURNEY II natural-motion knee, a first-of-
its-kind DYONICS PLAN surgical planning 
tool for hip arthroscopy, and the HAT-TRICK 
Lesser Toe Repair System. We have a strong 
new product pipeline for 2015, with many 
innovations scheduled. 
These new products, and many more 
currently in development, are a result of our 
focus on R&D. We invested $235 million in 
this area in 2014, in-line with our commitment, 
stated in 2011, to increase our investment  
level to around 5% of revenue. 
We are highly disciplined in project selection. 
Our R&D experts in the UK, US, Europe, China 
and India have extensive customer and sector 
knowledge, which is augmented by ongoing 
interaction with our marketing teams. 
Strict criteria are applied to ensure new 
products fulfil an unmet clinical need, 
have a strong commercial case, and are 
technologically feasible. Our R&D teams also 
work closely with manufacturing and supply 
chain management to ensure we can produce 
new products to clinical, cost and time 
specification. Our products undergo clinical 
and health economic assessment both  
during their development and post launch.
Open innovation
As part of our R&D strategy, Smith & Nephew 
supports and works with numerous small 
companies looking for help with developing 
and commercialising new technologies. 
We scout globally for new technologies and 
services to meet the needs of our customers.
We are a primary sponsor of the 
Massachusetts Medical Device Development 
Center (‘M2D2’) New Venture Competition, 
supporting entrepreneurial product 
development by early-stage medical device 
companies. We also work with MassChallenge, 
a global start-up competition and accelerator 
programme, to support emerging companies 
that fit with our strategic areas of interest.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
Our business continued
We continued in 2014 as the commercial 
partner in SWAN-iCare, an EU-funded 
initiative to bring multidisciplinary European 
research teams together to deliver a next 
generation integrated autonomous solution 
for monitoring and adapting personalised 
therapy of foot and leg ulcers.
Smith & Nephew also welcomes new  
product concepts from surgeons. Through  
our InVentures programme we collaborate 
to bring ideas to reality. InVentures evaluates 
surgeon concepts for technical and market 
viability and our development team works 
hand-in-hand with surgeons to deliver 
new products that advance healing. 
Commercialised products benefit from  
the global selling power of Smith & Nephew.
In addition, Smith & Nephew invests in 
early stage technologies relevant to our 
business. Recent examples include UK-based 
Michelson Diagnostics that is developing a 
point-of-care tissue-imaging system that for 
the first time allows users to see below the 
surface of the skin; and an incubator fund 
investing in orthopaedic technologies close 
to commercial launch.
We continue to scout for further opportunities 
where we can access new disruptive 
technologies in our areas of specialism.  
These investments are typically in technologies 
that are not yet ready for acquisition but that 
we believe hold great promise. As well as 
funding, we may bring R&D, management and 
manufacturing expertise, and gain privileged 
access to or rights to the technology. We aim 
to accelerate the journey to market and may 
ultimately acquire the business.
Intellectual property
We protect the results of our research and 
development through patents and other  
forms of intellectual property. The Group’s 
patent portfolio currently includes in excess  
of 5,000 patents and patent applications. 
Patent protection for our products is sought 
routinely in our principal markets.
We also have a policy of protecting our 
products by registering trademarks under  
the local laws of markets in which such 
products are sold. We vigorously protect  
our trademarks against infringement.
In addition to protecting our market position  
by filing and enforcing patents and trademarks, 
we may oppose third party patents and 
trademark filings where appropriate in 
those areas that might conflict with our 
business interests.
In the ordinary course of business, we enter 
into a number of licensing arrangements 
with respect to our products. None of these 
arrangements individually is considered 
material to our current operations and 
financial results.
Ethics and compliance
Code of conduct and 
business principles
Smith & Nephew earns trust with patients, 
customers, healthcare professionals, authorities 
and the public by acting in an honest and fair 
manner in all aspects of its operations. 
We expect the same from those with whom 
we do business, including distributors and 
independent agents that sell our products. 
Our Code of Conduct and Business Principles 
(‘Code’) governs the way we operate to 
achieve these objectives.
Smith & Nephew takes into account ethical, 
social, environmental, legal and financial 
considerations as part of its operating 
methods. We have a robust whistle-blowing 
system in all jurisdictions in which Smith 
& Nephew operates. We are committed to 
upholding our promise in our Code that we 
will not retaliate against anyone who makes  
a report in good faith. 
New employees receive training on our Code, 
and we assign annual compliance training to 
employees. In 2014, we updated our Code 
training. The new module is more interactive, 
role-based and allows individuals to apply the 
Code in different scenarios. Individuals can 
earn ‘trust points’ and ‘achievement badges’  
if they make the right choices in the scenarios. 
Individuals who show an understanding of 
the Code by selecting the right behaviour 
in a scenario can move through the module 
more quickly than individuals who choose 
the incorrect behaviour and are then subject 
to remediation. 
Global compliance programme
Smith & Nephew has implemented what we 
believe is a world-class Global Compliance 
Programme that helps our businesses comply 
with laws and regulations. Our comprehensive 
compliance programme includes global 
policies and procedures; on-boarding and 
annual training for employees and managers; 
monitoring and auditing processes; and 
reporting channels. 
Through a global intranet website, we provide 
resources and tools to guide employees to 
make decisions that comply with the law and 
our Code and earn trust. We conduct advance 
review and approval for significant interactions 
with healthcare professionals or government 
officials. We regularly assess existing and 
emerging risks in the countries in which 
we operate. 
Managing Directors complete an annual 
certification to the CEO to confirm 
implementation of required programmes. 
Managers and employees make an annual 
compliance certification, and executive 
management, managers and employees 
have a compliance performance objective 
customised to their level in the organisation. 
In 2014, we developed and piloted a face-to-face 
course for new managers, which supplements 
the on-line manager certification training.  
In 2015, all new managers will be required  
to complete both the on-line and the face-to-
face course.
New distributors and other higher risk third 
parties are subject to screening and are 
contractually obligated to comply with applicable 
laws and our Code. Their management is 
required to take compliance training and 
certify that they will ensure their employees 
and agents comply with the law and our 
Code. They also receive a CD-ROM with tools 
to assist them with their own compliance 
programmes. We have expanded our oversight 
of independent agents and distributors with  
on-site assessments to check compliance 
controls and monitoring visits to review a sample 
of transactions from their books and records. 
In 2014, Smith & Nephew filed its first report in 
compliance with the US Physician Payments 
Sunshine Act, which comprised over 
22,000 transactions with nearly $18 million 
in payments and expenses to reportable 
individuals and entities.
In early 2015, Smith & Nephew submitted 
the final report to the US Department of 
Justice (‘DoJ’) and the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) required under 
the Company’s Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act settlement agreement. We also filed our 
first report under the deferred prosecution 
agreement we inherited with the ArthroCare 
acquisition (see Note 17 .3 of the Notes to the 
Group accounts).
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 22 Manufacturing
We operate manufacturing facilities in a 
number of countries across the globe, and 
a number of central distribution facilities in 
key geographical areas in which we operate. 
Products are shipped to individual country 
locations which hold small amounts of 
inventory locally for immediate supply to  
meet customer requirements. We have a 
defined manufacturing and facility footprint 
plan in-line with our commercial strategy 
which we review on a regular basis. 
We continue to implement improved 
processes such as ‘Lean Manufacturing’ 
throughout our factories, the global supply 
chain and the supporting operations to 
improve and sustain the levels of safety, 
quality, delivery, productivity and efficiency. 
We have numerous Core Competences 
including: materials technology; precision 
machining, high volume and automated 
manufacturing for both our Advanced 
Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound 
Management products.
We procure raw materials, components, 
finished products and packaging materials 
from key suppliers. These purchases include 
metal forgings and stampings for orthopaedic 
products, optical and electronic sub-
components for sports medicine products, 
active ingredients and semi-finished 
goods for Advanced Wound Management 
as well as packaging materials across all 
product ranges.
Suppliers are selected, and standardised 
contracts negotiated, by a centralised 
procurement team wherever possible, with  
a view to ensure value for money based  
on the total spend across the Group. 
We outsource certain parts of our manufacturing 
processes where necessary to obtain 
specialised expertise or gain lower cost 
without undue risk to our intellectual property. 
Suppliers of outsourced products and services 
are selected based on their ability to deliver 
products and services to our specification, and 
adhere to and maintain an appropriate quality 
system. Our specialist teams work with and 
monitor suppliers through on-site assessments 
and performance audits to ensure the required 
levels of quality, service and delivery.
Our largest manufacturing operation for 
Advanced Surgical Devices is based in 
Memphis (Tennessee, US), with additional 
production and assembly plants based in 
Mansfield (Massachusetts, US), Oklahoma 
City (Oklahoma, US), Austin (Texas, US),  
Aarau (Switzerland), Tuttlingen (Germany), 
Beijing (China), Calgary (Canada),  
Warwick (UK), Heredia (Costa Rica) and 
Sangameshwar (India).
The Memphis facilities produce key products 
and instrumentation in our Knee Implants, 
Hip Implant and Trauma franchises. These 
include the JOURNEY II and LEGION

knee and hip range and the BIRMINGHAM
◊
 
Hip Resurfacing System. The facility in 
Oklahoma City deals mainly with the 
assembly of surgical digital equipment, such 
as HD560
◊
 Camera. 
We operate three main holding warehouses, 
one in each of Memphis (Tennessee, US), 
Baar (Switzerland) and Singapore. These 
facilities consolidate and ship to local country 
and distributor facilities.
The Advanced Wound Management 
manufacturing is primarily managed from 
our factory and offices in Hull (UK). Wound 
Management products are also made at our 
facilities in Suzhou (China), Curaçao (Dutch 
Caribbean), Alberta (Canada) and Oklahoma 
City (Oklahoma, US). 
The products made at the Hull site cover 
the therapies of Exudate management 
(Foam products – principally ALLEVYN
◊

23 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION A key base material used in the production of a 
large number of dressings is the intermediate 
bulk rolls of film which are manufactured in the 
Gilberdyke (UK) facility. The facility in Alberta 
(Canada) provides specific expertise in the 
addition of silver coatings onto the ACTICOAT 
burns range prior to shipping to Hull for the final 
conversion process into finished dressings. 
The facility in Gilberdyke (UK) was sold in 2014, 
and will continue to supply sub components to 
other facilities until 2016. The processes at the 
Alberta facility are being transferred to the  
Hull site during 2015.
The Suzhou facility opened in 2009 initially 
to manufacture some Foam products within 
Exudate management. It has since expanded 
to take on production of some Film Wound 
Closure products.
The majority of the NPWT components are 
bought in from third parties and assembled 
in the Advanced Surgical Devices Oklahoma 
City facility, with the exception of the  
dressings used for the PICO product  
which are manufactured in Hull.
Manufacturing for Advanced Wound Bioactives 
takes place in Curaçao, and at various third party 
facilities in the US. The products are distributed 
from a third party logistics facility in San Antonio 
(T exas, US). Advanced Wound Bioactives has 
facilities for the development and possible 
production of cell based therapies in Fort Worth 
(Texas, US).
Advanced Wound Management distribution 
hubs are located in Neunkirchen (Germany) 
and Derby (UK) for international distribution, 
Bedford (UK) for UK domestic distribution  
and Lawrenceville (Georgia, US) for 
US distribution.
Medical education
Smith & Nephew is dedicated to helping 
healthcare professionals improve the quality 
of care for patients. We are proud to support 
the professional development of surgeons 
and nurses by providing them with medical 
education and training on our Advanced 
Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound 
Management products.
Every year thousands of customers attend  
our state-of-the-art training centres in the  
US, UK and China and Smith & Nephew 
courses at multiple hospitals and facilities 
around the world.
In 2014, we provided training to more than 
25,000 surgeons. Working under expert 
guidance, attendees refine techniques 
and learn new skills, whilst experiencing 
the safe and effective use of our products. 
We also support healthcare professionals 
through our on-line resources such as 
the Global Wound Academy, The Wound 
Institute and, for surgeons, our Education and 
Evidence website.
Sales and marketing
Our customers are the providers of medical 
and surgical treatments and services in over 
100 countries worldwide.
The largest single customer worldwide is 
a purchasing group based in the UK that 
represented less than 5% of our worldwide 
revenue in 2014.
In our Established Markets, our Advanced 
Surgical Devices are principally shipped and 
invoiced directly to healthcare providers, hospitals 
and other healthcare facilities. Certain Advanced 
Wound Management products are shipped and 
invoiced to wholesale distributors and others are 
consigned to distributors that lease the devices 
to healthcare providers, hospitals and other 
healthcare facilities and end-users.
Our US sales forces consist of a mixture of 
independent contract workers and employees. 
Sales agents are contractually prohibited 
from selling products that compete with our 
products. In most other Established Markets 
country-specific commercial organisations 
manage employee sales forces directly.
In our Emerging & International Markets we 
operate through direct selling and marketing 
operations, and through distributors. In these 
markets, our Advanced Surgical Devices 
franchises frequently share sales resources. 
The Advanced Wound Management sales 
force may be separate where it calls on 
different customers.

Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 24 Our people
Smith & Nephew is committed to attracting, 
engaging, developing and retaining employees. 
In 2014, we had more than 14,000 employees

commitment to be an employer of choice as 
well as a responsible corporate citizen.
Investing in our people and communities 
helps ensure the long-term sustainability 
of our business. Smith & Nephew strives 
to create a more engaged and productive

understanding of the Group’s mission and 
direction, sense of employee involvement, 
focus and adaptability to customers and 
market place. We continue to listen to our 
employees, via regular surveys and focus 
groups, and we value their opinions. In 2014, 
we conducted a Global Employee survey to 
measure progress against our actions and 
were named Great Place to Work in Spain.
Attracting the best talent and developing 
and engaging our employees are critical 
to achieving and sustaining our business 
objectives and overall performance. Employee 
advancement is merit-based, based on 
performance as well as demonstration of core 
competencies which include our core values 
with an emphasis on ethics and integrity. We 
prioritise the development and promotion of 
our existing employees whenever possible.

to develop their skills and career through new 
assignments and on the job experiences. 
Current programmes include our Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) Forum – where small 
groups of high potential and emerging talent 
are given the opportunity to learn more 
about the business from the Company’s 
most senior leaders and to benefit from peer 
mentorship – and the annual Managing 
Director’s Meeting where country and 
regional commercial leaders begin the year in 
alignment with the Group’s strategy and goals. 
In addition, the Board reviews succession 
plans for key executive roles and succession 
plans are in place for critical positions across 
our business.
Our performance management process 
ensures all employees set objectives which 
align to our overall business goals and have 
clear line-of-sight to how their individual 
contributions benefit the Company. Our 
performance management system assesses 
and rewards both performance and behaviour , 
in line with our Code of Conduct. All employees 
have a specific annual objective to adhere to 
the Code of Conduct and to complete training 
and certify their adherence to this Code.
Smith & Nephew strives to create a highly 
engaged and productive workforce. We foster 
this goal with targeted initiatives to ensure 
understanding of the Company’s mission and 
direction, encourage employee involvement, 
and ensure focus and adaptability to our 
customers and market place. We seek 
employee feedback via regular surveys and 
focus groups, and we act on this feedback in 
the spirit of continuous improvement.

26 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 Orthopaedic Reconstruction
Smith & Nephew offers a range of specialist 
products for orthopaedic reconstruction in its 
Knee	Implants	and	Hip	Implants	franchises.
Implant bearing surfaces such as the 
proprietary OXINIUM
◊
 Oxidized Zirconium 
continue to be a point of differentiation for 
Smith & Nephew. OXINIUM Technology 
combines the enhanced wear resistance of a 
ceramic bearing with the superior toughness  
of	a	metallic	bearing.	When	combined	with	
highly	cross-linked	polyethylene	(‘XLPE’)	it	
results	in	our	proprietary	VERILAST	Technology.	
In Hip Implants, the combination of a 
ceramicised metal head and a highly cross-
linked	polyethylene	lined	cup	have	been	shown	
in various national joint replacement registries 
to have displayed best in class survivorship 
rates when compared to implants made 
from	any	other	materials.	In	Knee	Implants,	
the	LEGION	Primary	Knee	with	VERILAST	
Technology	is	the	only	knee	implant	that	
has been laboratory-tested to 30-years of 
simulated	wear.	While	lab	testing	is	not	the	
same as clinical performance, the tests showed 
significant	reduction	in	wear	compared	to	
conventional technologies.
Knee Implants
Smith & Nephew offers a range of products for 
specialised	knee	procedures.	In	2014,	Smith	
&	Nephew	launched	the	JOURNEY	II	Cruciate	
Retaining	(‘CR’)	knee	implant	extending	the	
JOURNEY	II	Active	Knee	System	to	procedures	
that preserve the posterior cruciate ligament 
(‘PCL’)	which	account	for	approximately	half	of	
all	knee	replacement	procedures.
The	LEGION/GENESIS
◊
	II	Total	Knee	System	
is a comprehensive system designed to allow 
surgeons	to	address	a	wide	range	of	knee	
procedures from primary to revision.
These	systems	also	feature	VERILAST	
Technology, our advanced bearing 
surface and also utilise VISIONAIRE 
Patient-Matched Instrumentation.
With	VISIONAIRE	Instrumentation,	a	patient’s	
MRI and X-rays are used to create customised 
cutting	blocks	that	allow	the	surgeon	to	achieve	
optimal mechanical axis alignment of the 
new implant. In addition, VISIONAIRE also 
helps save time by reducing the number of 
procedural steps and instruments used in the 
operating room.
In 2014, Smith & Nephew entered into 
a commercial agreement with Blue Belt 
Technologies	(‘BBT’),	makers	of	the	Navio
®
 
Orthopaedic Surgical System, the next 
generation of orthopaedic robotic surgical 
navigation. Under this agreement, surgeons 
using the Navio system will be able to implant 
Smith	&	Nephew’s	JOURNEY	UNI	partial	knee.	
We	also	announced	an	agreement	with	
OrthoSensor, the leader in intelligent 
orthopaedics, that will enable surgeons to 
benefit	from	OrthoSensor’s	VERASENSE
TM
 
Sensor Assisted Surgery Technology for 
soft tissue balancing when implanting our 
JOURNEY	II	and	LEGION	Total	Knee	Systems.	
VERASENSE utilises advanced sensor 
technologies to enable evidence-based 
surgical decisions regarding component 
position, limb alignment and soft tissue 
balance to optimise outcomes in total 
knee	replacement.
Hip Implants
For Hip Implants, core systems include the 
ANTHOLOGY	Hip	System,	SYNERGY
◊
 Hip 
System, the SMF
◊
 Short Modular Femoral 
Hip System, the R3
◊
 Acetabular System, the 
POLARCUP
◊
 Dual Mobility Hip System and the 
SL-PLUS
◊
 Hip Family System.
In	2014,	we	introduced	the	POLARSTEM
◊
 
HA Cementless Stem System in the US 
for state-of-the-art minimally invasive 
surgical techniques that preserve bone 
and soft tissue, with good functionality 
and reproducible	results.
Overview
In Advanced Surgical Devices 
(‘ASD’)	we	develop,	manufacture	
and sell products in the areas 
of Orthopaedic Reconstruction, 
Trauma & Extremities, Sports 
Medicine	Joint	Repair ,	Arthroscopic	
Enabling Technologies, and  
others such as Gynaecology  
and Ear , Nose and Throat.
ENDOBUTTON CL ULTRA 10mm 
With	our	shortest,	continuous	loop	of	suture,	the	
10mm	fixation	device	is	designed	specifically	for	
shorter femoral tunnels used in the popular 
anatomic	method	for	ACL	reconstruction.
27 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION For	US	patients,	our	successful	VERILAST	
knee	consumer	campaign	was	expanded	
to	include	hips	in	2014.	Thanks	to	the	
combination of a well-established brand, a 
compelling call-to-action and our position as 
the	first	company	to	advertise	differentiating	
technology to this audience, we were able 
to	mirror	the	successes	of	our	earlier	knee	
campaigns by driving potential patients to our 
consumer-facing	RediscoverYourGo	website	
and its surgeon locator.
Trauma & Extremities
Our Trauma & Extremities franchises offer 
both	internal	and	external	fixation	and	tissue	
repair devices, as well as other products used 
in the stabilisation of severe fractures and 
deformity correction procedures.
For extremities and limb restoration, the 
franchise	offers	the	TAYLOR	SPATIAL	FRAME
◊
 
Circular Fixation System as well as a range of 
plates, screws, arthroscopes, instrumentation, 
resection, and suture anchor products for 
orthopaedic surgeons including foot and 
ankle,	hand	and	wrist,	and	trauma	surgeons.	
For	Trauma,	the	principal	internal	fixation	
products are the TRIGEN
◊
 family of IM nails 
(TRIGEN	META-NAIL	System,	TRIGEN	Humeral	
Nail System, TRIGEN SURESHOT
◊
, and TRIGEN 
INTERTAN
◊
)	and	the	PERI-LOC
◊
 Plating System. 
2014 saw the introduction of the D-RAD
◊
 
SMART	PACK	System	for	treating	distal	radius	
fractures. The new system – which includes 
complete,	sterile,	single-use	instrument	kits	
with	implants,	and	a	tray	of	sterile	packaged	
fasteners and templates – allows hospital 
operating room staff to reduce the typical 
time and expense involved with reprocessing 
traditional plate and screw systems.
In wrist repair, we introduced a new solution 
for	triangular	fibrocartilage	(‘TFCC’),	a	complex	
repair that leverages our FAST-FIX
◊
	360	
technology and provides an all arthroscopic 
repair	which	eliminates	knot	stack.
Smith & Nephew also announced its entry into 
the	forefoot	market	in	2014,	with	the	launch	
of	the	HAT-TRICK	Lesser	Toe	Repair	System.	
Comprised of three separate repair options, 
the	HAT-TRICK	System	includes	products	for	
metatarsophalangeal	(‘MTP’)	ligament	repair	
and reconstruction, a metatarsal osteotomy 
guide,	and	a	revisable,	all-PEEK	implant	for	
Proximal	Inter-Phalanges	(‘PIP’)	fusion,	also	
known	as	hammer-toe	correction.	
In hip repair, we introduced INTERTAN
◊
 
Gold instrumentation that is designed to 
streamline the surgical steps and improve 
clinical	outcomes	by	offering	a	more	efficiently	
designed set. In addition, the INTERTAN 10S 
was launched to meet the unique needs of 
smaller-stature patients by offering a more 
appropriate size for this population.
We	launched	the	EVOS
◊
 MINI Plating System 
for use in complex fractures of the long bones 
of	the	arms	and	legs.	Designed	specifically	for	
traumatologists,	this	long-bone-specific	system	
includes	the	variety	of	mini,	flat	plates	and	
screw sizes necessary to address both fracture 
reduction	and	short-term	fixation	while	the	
final,	load-bearing	repair	is being	completed.
Sports	Medicine	Joint	Repair
The	Sports	Medicine	Joint	Repair	franchise	
offers surgeons a broad array of instruments, 
technologies and implants necessary to 
perform minimally invasive surgery of the 
joints,	including	knee,	hip	and	shoulder	repair.
Our global position within the Sports Medicine 
Joint	Repair	market	was	strengthened	
significantly	in	2014,	with	the	May	acquisition	
of ArthroCare Corporation. The transaction 
adds technology and highly complementary 
products to our existing portfolio, including 
new shoulder anchor innovation.
In 2014, Smith & Nephew launched its 
SUTUREFIX
◊
 Ultra soft suture anchor for hip 
and shoulder labral repair to surgeons in the 
US.	The	new	anchor’s	small,	soft	construct,	
and superior pull-out strength, allow surgeons 
to	more	precisely	place	fixation	points	around	
the joint to more accurately re-approximate the 
patient’s	native	anatomy.	
2014 also saw the launch of the N8TIVE
◊
 
ACL (anterior	cruciate	ligament)	System	which	
helps	surgeons	create	highly	anatomic	ACL	
Reconstructions. N8TIVE allows surgeons to 
restore the size, shape, and location of the 
native	femoral	and	tibial	ACL	insertion	points.
Arthroscopic Enabling 
Technologies	(‘AET’)
Our Arthroscopic Enabling technologies 
franchise now includes the latest generation 
COBLATION
◊
	radio	frequency	(‘RF’)	technology	
acquired from ArthroCare, as well as 
electromechanical and mechanical blades 
and hand instruments for the removal of 
damaged tissue. Additionally, the franchise 
offers	fluid	management	equipment	for	
surgical	access	and	high	definition	cameras,	
digital image capture, scopes, light sources 
and monitors to assist with visualisation inside 
the joint.
Key	AET	products	include	DYONICS	shaver	
blades, ACUFEX
◊
 handheld instruments, and 
a wide range of RF probes. The ArthroCare 
acquisition brought us the latest generation of 
RF technology – the internationally patented 
COBLATION	technology	–	which	offers	
ablation, resection, and coagulation of soft 
tissue and hemostasis of blood vessels. The 
DYONICS	Platinum	Series	Shaver	Blades	
are single-use blades that provide superior 
resection due to their sharpness and virtually 
eliminate clogging through their improved 
debris	evacuation	capabilities.	The	DYONICS	
PLAN	Hip	Impingement	Planning	System	was	
launched in 2014. This interactive, 3D software 
system uses data from low-dose
1
 CT scans 
to help surgeons visualise, assess and plan 
each	patient’s	unique	Femoroacetabular	
Impingement	(‘FAI’)	surgery	before	they	enter	
the operating room. 
Other ASD
The Other ASD franchise includes smaller 
businesses such as Gynaecology and  
our newly acquired Ear, Nose and Throat 
(‘ENT’)	business.
The main Gynaecology product is the 
TRUCLEAR
◊
	System,	a	first-of-its-kind	
hysteroscopic tissue removal system, 
providing	safe	and	efficient	removal	of	
endometrial	polyps	and	submucosal	fibroids.	
The	business	also	sells	a	hysteroscopic	fluid	
management system, which provides uterine 
distension and clear visualisation during 
hysteroscopic procedures.
Our ENT business develops, manufactures, 
and	markets	products	for	the	ENT	market	
space.	We	offer	a	wide	variety	of	products	
in	this	area	including	our	COBLATION	
technology and our RAPIDRHINO
◊
 
carboxymethylcellulose	(‘CMC’)	technology	
which is featured in dissolvable nasal and 
sinus dressings, removable nasal and sinus 
dressings, and epistaxis treatment products.

30 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 Overview
In	Advanced	Wound	Management	
(‘AWM’)	we	offer	products	from	
initial wound bed preparation 
through to full wound closure. 
These products are targeted at 
chronic wounds associated with 
the elderly population, such as 
pressure sores and venous leg 
ulcers. There are also products 
for the treatment of acute wounds 
such as burns and invasive surgery 
that impact the wider population.
The	main	products	within	the	AWM	business	
are for management of wound exudate, 
treatment and prevention of wound infections, 
negative	pressure	wound	therapy	(‘NPWT’)	
and bioactive therapies. The portfolio 
is grouped into disposable wound care 
products	(Advanced	Wound	Care),	electrical	
equipment	for	wound	therapy	(Advanced	
Wound	Devices)	and	bioactives	(Advanced	
Wound	Bioactives).	
Advanced	Wound	Care
Exudate management
Exudate management products focus on 
effectively	and	efficiently	managing	wound	
fluid	and	creating	an	optimal	healing	
environment to promote improved healing 
outcomes.	Our	key	brands	in	this	space	are	
ALLEVYN	foam	dressings	and	DURAFIBER
◊
 
gelling	fibre	dressings.
In 2014, we continued to invest in the 
development and commercialisation of our 
flagship	ALLEVYN	brand,	with	significant	sales	
and	marketing	efforts	in	key	countries.	The	
ALLEVYN	brand	is	evolving	towards	ALLEVYN	
Life,	our	latest	innovation	in	foam	dressings,	
which was designed to provide a better 
patient experience, and greater wear time. 
This leads to improved patient outcomes and 
economic savings for payers, which has now 
been demonstrated in several studies.
We	have	also	experienced	a	significant	
increase	in	the	utilisation	of	ALLEVYN	Life	
as a prophylactic measure to help prevent 
pressure	ulcers,	driven	by	the	dressing’s	
unique multi-layer design which gives it 
superior pressure redistribution properties.
Throughout 2014, we have continued to invest 
in customer insights and the generation of 
meaningful clinical and health economic 
evidence	to	ensure	that	our	ALLEVYN	portfolio	
is in a sustainable, category leading position 
and	delivers	to	our	customers’	expectations.	
Infection management
AWM	has	two	significant	technologies	in	
its infection management portfolio, silver 
(ACTICOAT,	DURAFIBER	Ag	and	ALLEVYN	
Ag)	and	iodine	(IODOSORB
◊
).	The	iodine-
based IODOSORB product has continued 
to gain interest due to the unique properties 
of the cadexomer iodine molecule and their 
impact	on	biofilms,	which	have	become	a	
well-recognised barrier to healing in wound 
care.	IODOSORB	benefits	from	one	of	the	
most comprehensive evidence bases in 
wound care.
We	are	also	experiencing	strong	interest	
in ACTICOAT, particularly in post-surgical 
wounds to prevent the complications 
associated with surgical site infection and 
in delayed	healing	chronic	wounds.
Other
AWM	offers	a	wide	range	of	other	wound	care	
products, resulting in Smith & Nephew having 
one of the most comprehensive ranges of 
wound care solutions in the industry. These 
products	include	our	film	and	post-operative	
dressings,	skincare	products	and	gels.
IV3000
◊
:	AWM’s	specialist	breathable	premium	
IV	dressing,	utilising	REALTIC
◊
	film	technology	
and unique patterned adhesive, continues to 
perform well, particularly driven by emerging 
markets.	In	2014,	the	IV3000	range	benefited	
from several product upgrades reinforcing its 
differentiation as a premium offering. Success 
in	the	emerging	markets	has	created	an	
opportunity for a mid-tier offering, which  
will	be	introduced	in	2015.
ALLEVYN Life 
An innovative multi-layered dressing designed for 
people living their everyday lives.

Segment performance: Advanced	Wound	Management	continued
OPSITE Post-Op Visible: This is our innovative 
dressing that combines the qualities of a 
premium dressing with the ability to see and 
monitor the incision. This unique product 
continues to deliver strong growth in both 
our	Established	Markets	and	Emerging	
&	International	Markets,	supported	by	
investment in clinical evidence.
Advanced	Wound	Devices
Advanced	Wound	Devices	consists	of	two	
categories	of	products:	NPWT	and	VERSAJET
◊
.
NPWT
Our	NPWT	solutions	include	traditional	NPWT	
products	(RENASYS	products)	and	the	single-
use	portfolio	(PICO	and	KALYPTO
◊
	products).
We	are	also	progressing	with	launch	plans	for	
our	next-generation	traditional	NPWT	product.
During 2014, we were required to initiate 
a	distribution	hold	in	the	US	on	RENASYS	
products as the FDA indicated new regulatory 
clearances were required in respect of certain 
design	enhancements.	We	are	working	to	
obtain	these	and	RENASYS	remains	available	
outside of the US.
The PICO system, our single-use, canister-
free	solution,	is	revolutionising	NPWT.	As	
familiar and easy to use as an advanced 
wound dressing, PICO provides an active 
intervention to help promote optimal healing 
for early discharge and enhanced outcomes 
in	complex	cases.	PICO	simplifies	the	delivery	
of	negative	pressure,	which	benefits	patients	
and	caregivers	alike.
VERSAJET
The	VERSAJET	II	Hydrosurgery	system	is	a	
mechanical debridement device used by 
surgeons to excise and evacuate non-viable 
tissue, bacteria and contaminants from 
wounds, burns and soft tissue injuries.
Advanced	Wound	Bioactives
Smith	&	Nephew	is	the	global	market	
share leader in the bioactives segment, 
which is the fastest growing category 
of	wound	therapeutics.	Our	diversified	
biotherapeutic portfolio offers differentiated, 
cost-effective solutions for tissue repair and 
healing, addressing the full spectrum of 
hard-to-heal wounds.
Currently, our leading bioactive brand is 
Collagenase	SANTYL
◊
 Ointment, the only FDA-
approved biologic enzymatic debriding agent for 
chronic dermal ulcers and severe burns. In 2014, 
Smith	&	Nephew	launched	a new	90g	package	
size to bring convenience and economy to 
providers and patients treating large dermal 
ulcers	and	burns	with	SANTYL.	In	addition,	
consistent	with	Smith	&	Nephew’s	scientific	
leadership strategy , new clinical data highlighting 
the	benefits	of	using	SANTYL	adjunctively	with	
sharp debridement was released early in the 
year and was closely followed by initiation of 
a larger , follow-on study of similar design to 
corroborate	the	initial	findings.	
REGRANEX
◊
	Gel	is	the	first	and	only	FDA	
approved recombinant platelet-derived 
growth factor indicated for use as an adjunct 
to good ulcer care in the treatment of lower 
extremity diabetic neuropathic ulcers. 
Physicians increased their prescribing of 
REGRANEX throughout the year, in part due 
to	REGRANEX	360,	a	novel	programme	
launched by Smith & Nephew to help patients 
maximise	the	benefits	of	the	brand	by	
informing about insurance coverage, shipping 
the	medication	directly	to	the	patient’s	home	
or	office	and	providing	expert	consultation	on	
how to use the brand appropriately. 
Collagenase SANTYL Ointment 
The only enzymatic debrider approved by the FDA 
for use in the US. It selectively removes necrotic 
tissue without harming surrounding healthy tissue.

◊
, a family of naturally-derived, 
extracellular matrix replacement products 
indicated for the management of both chronic 
and traumatic wounds completes Smith & 
Nephew’s	bioactive	portfolio.
In October 2014, we announced the top-line 
results	of	the	Phase	3	study	of	HP802-247 ,	
a living cell spray-on therapy designed 
to stimulate healing of venous leg ulcers. 
HP802-247	did	not	meet	the	primary	
endpoint	in	this	trial	and	we	have	taken	the	
decision to stop the Phase 3 programme. 
We	remain	committed	to	investing	in	
developing	pioneering	Advanced	Wound	
Bioactive treatments.
Regulatory approvals
In 2014, regulatory clearance was obtained 
for	both	ALLEVYN	Life	and	DURAFIBER	
in	Japan	making	the	latest	absorbent	
dressing technologies available to this 
important	market.	
PICO,	our	single	use	NPWT	system	was	
approved	for	the	first	time	in	Japan.	In	
addition,	a	significant	enhancement	to	the	
PICO product, in the form of the new Soft Port 
dressing and tubing set, was approved in the 
EU and Australia.
Other registration activities during the year 
include expanding the geographic footprint 
of established products within the emerging 
markets	and	the	ongoing	expansion	of	 
Smith	&	Nephew	Medical	(Suzhou)	as	a	new	
supply site for multiple wound care products.

Revenue
ASD revenue increased by $283 million (9% on a reported basis) 
from $3,015 million in 2013 to $3,298 million in 2014. The underlying 
increase of 3% is after adjusting for a 7% impact from the acquisition 
of ArthroCare Corp in May 2014 and a 1% unfavourable foreign 
currency translation.
In the US, revenue increased by $167 million to $1,558 million in 2014 
from $1,391 million in 2013 (12% on a reported basis). The underlying 
increase of 2% is after adjusting 10% for the impact of the ArthroCare 
Corp acquisition in May 2014. In Other Established Markets, 
revenue was $1,229 million in 2014, an increase of $25 million from 
$1,204 million in 2013 (2% on a reported basis). The underlying 
increase was flat after adjusting for 2% from favourable foreign 
currency translation and the impact of 4% from acquisitions. Our 
Emerging & International Markets revenue increased by $91 million 
to $511 million in 2014 from $420 million in 2013 (22% increase on a 
reported basis). The underlying increase was 17% after adjusting for 
3% for unfavourable foreign currency translation and the impact of 8% 
from acquisitions. 
In the global Knee Implant franchise, revenue increased by $8 million 
from $865 million in 2013 to $873 million in 2014 (1% on a reported 
basis), representing a 2% underlying revenue increase after 1% of 
unfavourable currency translation. Growth has been impacted by 
exposure to a weakening European market with conditions continuing 
to deteriorate in Germany, our largest European market, and our 
position in the product life cycle versus our peers. Growth improved 
driven by sales of the JOURNEY II BCS Knee System.
Global revenue from the Hip Implant franchise increased by $1 million 
from $653 million in 2013 to $654 million in 2014 (flat on a reported 
basis), which represented an underlying revenue increase of 1% after 
1% unfavourable foreign currency translation. Sales in our VERILAST  
Hip and direct anterior approach portfolio contributed to the increase.
Trauma & Extremities revenue increased by $20 million from 
$486 million in 2013 to $506 million in 2014 (4% on a reported basis), 
representing underlying revenue growth of 4% after adjusting for 
a 1% impact from the acquisition of a Brazilian distributor and 1% of 
unfavourable foreign currency translation.
Sports Medicine Joint Repair revenue increased by $80 million from 
$496 million in 2013 to $576 million in 2014 (16% on reported basis), 
representing underlying revenue growth of 8% after adjusting for 
a 8% impact from the acquisition of ArthroCare Corp, 1% from the 
acquisition of a Brazilian distributor and 1% of unfavourable foreign 
currency translation.
Global revenue from Arthroscopic Enabling technologies increased 
by $101 million from $441 million in 2013 to $542 million in 2014 (23% 
on a reported basis). This increase represents an underlying revenue 
increase of 1% after adjusting for the 22% impact from the acquisition  
of ArthroCare Corp, 1% from the acquisition of a Brazilian distributor  
and 1% of unfavourable foreign currency translation.
The revenue in the Other ASD (including Gynaecology and ENT)
franchise increased by $73 million from $74 million in 2013 to 
$147 million in 2014 following the acquisition of ArthroCare Corp in 
2014. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, underlying revenue in  
the Other ASD franchise, which includes gynaecology, grew by 10%.

Operating profit, the most directly comparable financial measure under 
IFRS, reconciles to trading profit as follows:
2014
$ million
2013
$ million
Operating profit 626 620
Acquisition-related costs 107 7
Restructuring and rationalisation costs 33 44
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles

Legal and other (34) –
Trading profit 810 712
Trading profit margin increased from 23.6% to 24.6%. Trading profit 
increased by $98 million to $810 million from $712 million in 2013. This 
increase reflects the benefits from our structural efficiency programme.
Operating profit increased by $6 million from $620 million in 2013 to 
$626 million in 2014. This comprises the increase in trading profit of 
$98 million discussed above offset by increases in acquisition-related 
costs of $100 million and amortisation of acquisition intangibles of 
$37 million and partially offset by a decrease in restructuring and 
rationalisation costs of $11 million and credit relating to the US pension 
settlement and closure.
Advanced Wound Management
Revenue
AWM revenue decreased by $17 million (-1% on a reported basis), from 
$1,336 million in 2013 to $1,319 million in 2014. The underlying decrease 
of 1% is after adjusting for an increase of 1% for acquisitions completed 
in the year and a 1% unfavourable foreign currency translation.
In the US, revenue decreased by $17 million to $454 million in 2014 
from $471 million in 2013 (-4% on a reported basis). The underlying 
decrease was also 4%. In Other Established Markets, revenue was 
$699 million in 2014, a decrease of $23 million from $722 million in 
2013 (-3% on a reported basis). The underlying revenue decrease 
was 2% with 1% of unfavourable foreign currency translation. Our 
Emerging & International Markets revenue increased by $23 million in 
2014 (16% on a reported basis). The underlying increase was 14% after 
adjusting 2% for unfavourable foreign currency translation.
Advanced Wound Care revenue decreased by $38 million (-5% on 
a reported basis) to $805 million in 2014 from $849 million in 2013. 
The underlying decline of 4% is after adjusting for foreign currency 
translation. Conditions across many European markets remain 
challenging but the introduction of the ALLEVYN Life range continues 
to make good progress across Europe following product introductions 
and investment in marketing.
Advance Wound Devices revenue decreased from $213 million in 2013 
to $192 million in 2014, a reported decrease of $21 million and 10%. 
The underlying decrease of 9% is after adjusting for unfavourable 
foreign currency translations of 1%. This decline was due to the hold of 
RENASYS in the US due to regulatory issues and competitive pressures 
in traditional canister-based NPWT in Europe.
Advanced Wound Bioactives revenue increase to $322 million in 
2014 from $280 million in 2013 (15% reported growth). The underlying 
increase was also 15%.

Trading profit 245 275
Trading profit margin decreased from 20.6% to 18.6%. Trading profit 
decreased by $30 million to $245 million from $275 million in 2013.  
The decrease in the year is primarily attributable to the RENASYS hold.
Operating profit decreased by $67 million from $190 million in 2013 
to $123 million in 2014. This comprises of the decrease in trading 
profit of $30 million discussed above, costs relating to the hold on 
RENASYS and cessation of the HP802 trials amounting $52 million, 
offset by a decrease in acquisition-related costs of $13 million, due 
to the integration of the Healthpoint acquisition which completed 
in December 2012, an increase in restructuring and rationalisation 
costs of $14 million and an increase of $4 million in amortisation of 
acquisition intangibles.
Principal risks and risk management
As an integral part of planning and review Group, business area and 
functional management seek to identify the significant risks involved 
in the business, and to review the risk management action plans for 
those risks. The Group Risk Committee, which is comprised of the 
Chief Executive Officer and senior executives, meets twice a year to 
review the risks identified by the businesses and corporate functions 
and any risk management actions being taken. As appropriate, the 
Risk Committee may re-categorise risks or require further information 
on the risk management action plans. The Risk Committee reports to 
the Board on an annual basis detailing all principal risks. In addition, 
the Board considers risk as part of the development of strategy. Internal 
audit reviews and the Audit Committee reports on the effectiveness of 
the operation of the risk management process.
There are known and unknown risks and uncertainties relating to  
Smith & Nephew’s business. The following pages provide an overview 
of what the Board considers the most significant risks that could cause 
the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations to 
differ materially and adversely from expected and historical levels, and 
how these risks relate to the Group’s strategic priorities. Additional 
detail is set forth under Risk Factors in the Group information section 
of this report. In addition, other factors not listed here that Smith & 
Nephew cannot presently identify or does not believe to be equally 
significant, could also materially adversely affect Smith & Nephew’s 
business, financial position or results of operations.

Government Action, Pricing and Reimbursement Pressure 
In most markets throughout the world, expenditure on medical devices is controlled to a large extent by governments, many 
of which are facing increasingly intense budgetary constraints. The Group is therefore largely dependent on governments 
providing increased funds commensurate with the increased demand arising from demographic trends. Reimbursement rates 
may be set in response to perceived economic value of the devices, based on clinical and other data relating to cost, patient 
outcomes and comparative effectiveness. Political upheaval in the countries where the Group operates or surrounding regions 
could adversely affect Group operations or turnover.
Group operations are affected by transactional exchange rate movements. The Group’s manufacturing cost base is situated in 
the US, UK, Costa Rica, China and Switzerland and finished products are exported worldwide.
Specific risks we face Risk management actions Possible impacts
– Reduced reimbursement levels and increasing 
pricing pressures
–  Reduced demand for elective surgery
–  Lack of compelling health economics  
data to support reimbursement requests
–  Government policies favouring lower priced and 
locally sourced products
–  Political upheavals prevent selling of products, 
receiving remittances of profit from a member of 
the Group or future investments in that country
–  The Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange 
rates. If the manufacturing country currencies 
strengthen against the selling currencies, the 
trading margin may be affected
–  Economic downturn impacts demand and

Business Operations and Business Continuity
Unexpected events could disrupt the business by affecting either a key facility or system or a large number of employees. The 
business is also reliant on certain key suppliers of raw materials, components, finished products and packaging materials.
The Group manages a large product portfolio and a large product inventory. Sales and operation planning and supply chain 
management must ensure the products needed are available at the right place and time.
In a fast changing, complex, global business, high performing talent in key positions is a business critical requirement.
Specific risks we face Risk management actions Possible impacts
–  Catastrophe could render one of the Group’s 
production facilities out of action
–  A significant event could impact key leadership or 
a large number of employees
–  Issues with a single source supplier of a key 
component and failure to secure critical supply
–  A severe IT fault or cyber crime could disable 
critical systems and cause loss of sensitive data

Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 38 Product Safety, Regulation, and Litigation
National regulatory authorities enforce a complex series of laws and regulations that govern the design, development, approval, 
manufacture, labelling, marketing and sale of healthcare products. They also review data supporting the safety and efficacy of 
such products and may also inspect for compliance with appropriate standards, including those relating to Quality Management 
Systems (‘QMS’) or Good Manufacturing Practice (‘GMP’) regulations. Design or manufacturing defects in products could result 
in product recalls and liability claims and impact revenues, profits and reputation.
Specific risks we face Risk management actions Possible impacts
–  Defective products supplied to Smith & Nephew 
or failure in design or manufacturing process
–  New technology, product or processes changed 
by Smith & Nephew or supplier result in product

Compliance with Laws and Ethical Behaviour
Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to increasing scrutiny by government authorities. The trend in many 
countries is towards increased enforcement activity for bribery and corruption. The Group is also subject to increased scrutiny 
under US healthcare laws (e.g. False Claims Act) and in the EU for data protection. Acquisitions and expansion into emerging 
markets may require additional compliance controls.
Specific risks we face Risk management actions Possible impacts
–   Violation of anti-corruption, healthcare, or  
data privacy laws could result in fines, loss of 
reimbursement and harm reputation
–  Cultures in certain geographies and in acquired 
businesses may not fully support the Group

Sustainability
Protecting the future
We care about our customers and helping improve 
people’s lives. We also care about the people who 
work for us, the environment in which we operate and 
the societies in which we do business. Addressing 
unmet social need with more affordable products 
gathered pace in 2014 with the introduction of our 
Syncera range and further growth and consolidation  
of our mid-tier products. As part of our commitment  
to build trust we increased our engagement with 
suppliers to increase assurance around compliance 
and ethics.
This is a summary of our sustainability activities and progress  
in 2014. Our Sustainability Report will be published in April 2015.
In 2014, there were no employee or contractor fatalities and our Lost  
Time Injury Frequency Rate (‘LTIFR’) fell again for the fourth successive 
year, this time by 20%. Compared to the previous year, total waste  
increased by 13%, however waste disposed to landfill fell by 19%  
as we found new ways to recycle.
Energy consumption has increased by 9% since 2011. However, after 
adjusting for the transient effect of transferring some production to 
China and the impact of newly acquired businesses, there was a net 
fall in energy consumption of 2% .
After three consecutive years of increases, water consumption reduced 
by 7% in 2014 compared to the previous year.
As part of the Great Place to Work strategy, substantially more of  
our employees enjoyed the benefits of wellness programmes. 
We donated approximately $9 million in philanthropic activities, 
of which $2 million was in product donations and charitable gifts. 
Volunteering programmes were active in most of the territories  
where we work and the benefits to society and the level of 
employee involvement continued to increase.

The continuous improvement in safety performance is underpinned by 
committed leadership and a sharp focus on managing risks. Making 
health and safety a priority for all of our employees and contractors was 
an imperative in 2014. This was supported by the progressive rollout 
of our integrated management system and the wide introduction of 
behavioural based safety programmes.
Behavioural safety campaign
The ‘Don’t drop the ball’ campaign is all about raising 
awareness of safety in the workplace. This initiative started 
in our Memphis facility and will be ‘rolled’ out across other 
divisions in the coming year. Employees sign the ball, thereby 
pledging to put safety at the forefront of all of their actions.  
No team wants to be the one who drops the ball!
How this delivers value:
–  Awareness of safety in the workplace is increased  
in a fun and engaging way
–   Employees share a collective responsibility for the safety  
of the entire team

breakthrough in water consumption at our Memphis manufacturing 
facility where 66% of Smith & Nephew’s water is consumed.

The annual increase of 13% in total waste was offset by moving landfill 
waste to recycling or energy recovery. A transient increase created 
by commissioning new capacity in China and the one-off event of 
disposing of waste arising from the Hull flood increased the total  
waste by 8%. In 2014, we carried out a thorough waste audit in order  
to implement more initiatives to manage and reduce our waste.

The energy increase of 15.2 GWh (9%) since 2011 has been dominated 
by the transient impact of commissioning new manufacturing capacity 
in China accounting for 10 GWh whilst continuing production in the UK. 
The effect of recently acquired businesses accounted for 8.7GWh of 
the increase.
The underlying reduction of 3.5 GWh (2%) reflects the implementation 
of efficiency improvements in our manufacturing facilities.
Transferring manufacturing to China from the UK and acquiring 
capacity in India has resulted in higher emissions factors and increased 
CO2 emissions.
Greenhouse gases
Methodology, materiality and scope
The data reported relates to areas of largest environmental impact 
including manufacturing sites, warehouses, research and offices. Smaller 
locations representing less than 2% of our overall emissions are not 
included. Acquisitions completed before 2014 are included in the data.
All emissions fall within the scope of our consolidated financial 
statement and we have used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) as 
guidance for this process. Primary data from energy suppliers has 
been used wherever possible. The Biotherapeutics and the Sushrut 
Adler acquisitions are included in the data for 2014 for the first time. 
Data from the ArthroCare acquisition is excluded and is in line with  
our established policy for integration of acquired assets.
Our emissions have been calculated by using specific emissions 
factors for each country outside the US and regional factors within 
the US. We have used the US EPA ‘Emissions & Generation Resource 
Integrated Database’ (eGRID) for US regions and the UK Government 
DEFRA Conversion Factors for Greenhouse Gas Reporting for 
elsewhere. The emissions from all years have been recalculated using 
the most up-to-date factors available in 2014. Fugitive emissions are 
included from the manufacturing and research locations and arise  
from the losses of refrigerant gases.

43 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 At the top of 
their game
Sports Medicine is the treatment of injuries 
to the soft tissues through keyhole surgery – 
typically ligaments, tendons and cartilage in 
the joints. These injuries can affect anyone, 
not just athletes. Sports Medicine helps 
patients recover function as well as minimise 
disability and recovery time.
Smith & Nephew is a global leader in  
Sports Medicine. In 2014, nearly a quarter  
of our revenue came from this area, and  
our Joint Repair business delivered revenue  
growth of 8%.
It is a $4.6 billion global market, and a  
strong area of focus and opportunity for  
Smith & Nephew. 
We expect to see long-term global  
growth driven by delivering both clinical 
benefits and strong health economics. 
Repairing injuries today prevents them 
becoming more debilitating as patients get 
older, which reduces future demands on 
healthcare systems. In the emerging markets 
we are helping to widen access to these 
advanced treatments through delivering 
medical education.
Sports Medicine is a great place to innovate. 
We are investing more in R&D to improve 
existing treatments, and to develop new 
instrumentation to enable surgeons to  
better treat their patients.
In 2014, we made a major investment in 
Sports Medicine, acquiring ArthroCare 
Corporation, an innovative medical device 
company with a highly complementary 
sports medicine portfolio. This 
strengthened our business, and brings 
exciting growth prospects. 
In resection, the combination of 
ArthroCare’s COBLATION radio frequency 
(RF) technology and Smith & Nephew’s 
mechanical blade portfolio gives customers 
greater choice. In joint repair, ArthroCare’s 
shoulder anchor innovation complements 
our strength in knee repair, forming an 
extensive, integrated portfolio.
We expect to benefit from additional revenue 
opportunities from our combined global 
footprint and channel presence as well as 
an enhanced new product pipeline.

45 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 Better by
design
We have a deep knowledge of the needs  
of surgeons and nurses, we understand the 
economic pressures healthcare payers work 
under, and we recognise that patients are 
demanding better treatment options to  
restore quality of life. These factors drive our 
new product development programmes. 
In 2014, we launched a number of exciting  
new products, expanding our portfolios in  
our Established Markets and Emerging & 
International Markets. 
We also invested $235 million in R&D in 
2014, over 5% of revenue, and have a strong 
pipeline of innovation to come. Our experts in 
Europe, US, China and India keep us close to 
our customers and ensure our programmes  
target unmet clinical needs, have strong 
financials and are technologically feasible. 
They also work closely with manufacturing 
to ensure we can produce new products to 
clinical, cost and time specifications.
JOURNEY II
The JOURNEY II Cruciate Retaining (CR) knee 
replacement extends the JOURNEY II Total Knee 
System to procedures that preserve the 
posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), which 
accounts for approximately half of all knee 
replacement procedures. The JOURNEY II CR 
knee, like the JOURNEY II Bi-cruciate Stabilized 
(BCS) knee that was launched last year, sets a 
new standard in knee implant performance by 
restoring more normal motion for patients. 
PICO
PICO, Smith & Nephew’s disposable, canister-
free Negative Pressure Wound Therapy system 
has been named Most Innovative Product  
2014 at The Irish Medical and Surgical Trade 
Association Awards. The award was judged  
by a panel of top clinicians, health service 
executives and medical companies.
HAT-TRICK
The HAT-TRICK Lesser Toe Repair System is our 
entry into the high-growth forefoot market, 
where we believe there are significant 
opportunities for us to enhance the surgeon 
experience, simplify the procedures and, 
most importantly, improve patient outcomes.

How a rep supports our customers – Japan
Smith & Nephew’s sales representatives 
are highly trained and skilled individuals 
who work tirelessly to support healthcare 
professionals, our customers, in their daily 
efforts to better treat patients. 
In Japan, becoming a sales representative 
can take many months or even years of 
intense training, including passing a strict 
certification programme, before being 
allowed to engage in discussions with, 
and ultimately , sell product to customers. 
Depending on their area of specialism, 
representatives must be able to demonstrate 
a detailed knowledge of all the surgical 
instruments used to implant a device, or 
have specific understanding of the various 
surgical techniques a customer might use. 
In Advanced Wound Care, representatives 
are expected to have deep knowledge of 
best-practice for treating both chronic and 
acute wounds. 
Once a sales representative is certified in 
Japan, they typically spend the majority 
of their time working directly with, and 
supporting customers. They help develop 
preoperative plans and provide in-hospital 
support to aid in the safe and effective use 
of our implants, instruments and medical 
products and techniques. 
The use of surgical devices regularly 
necessitates technical training and  
hands-on experience. Our sales 
representatives will often arrange such 
training, either for clinical experts to visit 
customers at work, or for surgeons to 
attend Smith & Nephew medical education 
courses. In Japan, surgeons often travel 
to our training centres in the US to learn 
the latest surgical techniques from 
acknowledged global leaders. In Japan, 
and everywhere we work, our sales 
representatives embody the trust that  
our customers place in Smith & Nephew. 49 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 Extending 
our reach
Serving the mid-tier
Smith & Nephew has a strong sustainable 
business in the emerging markets. We also 
have a clear strategy to drive this further. 
We focus on those countries which offer the 
greatest opportunity; we ensure we have a 
more direct relationship with our customers 
– surgeons, nurses and other healthcare 
professionals – and we offer these customers 
the right products.
Over the last five years we have created a 
business with revenues well over $600 million, 
growing rapidly. The proportion of our Group 
revenues from Emerging & International 
Markets has doubled to 15% today, and we 
aspire to 25%. 
Virtually all of this growth has come  
from bringing premium products to  
high-tier customers. 
However , we believe that it is the mid-tier ,  
made up of the economic middle class, which 
will grow faster and ultimately become much 
larger than the high-tier .
By addressing this mid-tier market we can 
substantially widen access to our products. 
Our approach is based upon pioneering 
a different commercial model and often 
different products from those for the high-tier. 
Customers are demanding good quality 
products at significantly lower prices. We are 
meeting this need through service, product 
and manufacturing innovation. 
We launched our first mid-tier products  
in 2014 – including ELECT
◊
 Foam – and  
have a strong pipeline for the future.
ELECT FOAM dressing offers access to the 
advantages of foam-based wound care at 
an affordable price.
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 50 Closing the skills gap
Resources at South African State Hospitals 
are limited. This means that newly qualified 
orthopaedic surgeons have limited access 
to arthroplasty training and Smith & Nephew 
South Africa is meeting this skills gap  
through its Arthroplasty Academy.
There is keen competition to participate in  
the 12-month programme where candidates 
are mentored by leading arthroplasty 
consultants, participate in workshops and 
ultimately treat patients. 
Learning how to present more effectively  
is another valuable component of the 
Academy programme. A series of public 
speaking coaching sessions culminate in  
the candidates presenting a paper to  
faculty at a formal academic meeting.

51 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 Realising  
potential
The ability to attract and retain talented 
employees is essential to achieving our 
business goals. This is why one of our  
strategic imperatives is to be recognised  
as, a great place to work.
For Smith & Nephew, being a great place 
to work means having a workplace where 
employees are proud and excited to come 
each day because they are doing work 
that makes a difference for customers 
and patients. 
It is a place where employees are valued  
for their performance and achievements, 
and a place that values trust above all else.
To qualify as a Great Place to Work, a  
company must complete the Great Place to 
Work T rust Index survey and its management  
must participate in a Culture Audit. Both 
evaluate the company’s performance on 
key dimensions of engagement: Credibility, 
Respect, Fairness, Pride and Camaraderie.

Diverse
Smith & Nephew believes that diversity fuels innovation. We are committed to 
employment practices based on equality of opportunity, regardless of colour, creed, 
race, national origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation or mental or physical

Steering team sponsored by the CEO with local councils established across the 
business. 30% of our Board of Directors and 23% of senior managers are female.
Healthy
We strongly believe we perform better when our employees are healthy, motivated  
and focused. The support we provide our employees when they experience a health 
concern is a critical factor in how well and how quickly they are able to get back to  
peak. During 2014, Smith & Nephew signed up to the UK’s Time to Change programme, 
showing our employees being open about mental health concerns will lead to support, 
not discrimination, and embarked on a global wellness initiative to support all employees.
Safe
We are committed to providing healthy and safe working conditions for all employees. 
We achieve this by ensuring that health and safety and the working environment are 
managed as an integral part of the business, and we recognise employee involvement 
as a key part of that process. During 2014, we reduced the lost time injury frequency by 
20%, reflecting a sharp focus of leadership on identifying and managing workplace risk.
We aim to provide an open, challenging, productive,  
diverse, healthy, safe and participative environment  
based on constructive relationships.

attract, develop and retain this  
very talented workforce.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Mergers and acquisitions
Following the successful acquisition of our Biotherapeutics business in 
2012, we continued to make further acquisitions throughout 2013 of the 
Adler business in India, two distributorships in Brazil and one in Turkey . In 
January 2014, we announced the acquisition of ArthroCare Corporation 
and this deal completed in May. You will read elsewhere in this Annual 
Report about the successful integration of ArthroCare into our Company. 
We also undertook post acquisition reviews of the transaction and 
earlier acquisitions to monitor actual performance against expected 
performance at the time of acquisition and we continued to review 
and evaluate other potential acquisitions for the future to support our 
Strategic Priorities.
Succession planning below Board level
We believe that succession planning below Board level is crucially 
important for the long-term future of the Company. In October , the Board 
therefore reviewed management succession plans both for the Executive 
Board members and also for their direct reports. We recognised that 
whilst there were some gaps, there were also plans in place to address 
these gaps and develop the next tier of management to become Board-
ready in the medium-term. The Board also takes the opportunity to meet 
with local management teams when undertaking site visits and senior 
executives below Board level frequently present to the Board and its 
Committees. This helps us to get to know executives who could well  
become Board members in the future.
Understanding the business more deeply
Corporate governance does not exist in isolation and cannot be 
reduced to compliance with checklists and codes. In order for the 
Board to be able to review strategy, to determine our approach to risk 
and to respond to events, we need to have a thorough understanding 
of the business in which we operate. 
During the year , the Board received a number of presentations from the 
businesses covering corporate development activity, the ArthroCare 
integration progress and our investment in Bioventus LLP . In October ,  
we visited our Biotherapeutics facility in Fort Worth, Texas, where  
we met with management and toured the R&D facility. 
In September , we held our annual Strategy Review in Singapore and met 
with members of our ASEAN management team and discussed their 
opportunities and challenges. 
Dear Shareholder ,
I am delighted to present my first Corporate Governance Statement 
as your Chairman following my appointment at the Annual General 
Meeting in April 2014. I feel very strongly that good corporate 
governance lies at the heart of a well-run company. Openness and 
transparency, accountability and responsibility should run through 
everything that we do, both as a Board and throughout the business  
as a whole. The Board and I aim to set the tone at the top which  
should pervade throughout the rest of the organisation.
Later in this statement, as well as all the standard corporate governance 
disclosures we are required to make, you will find reports from Ian 
Barlow, Michael Friedman, myself and Joseph Papa, the Chairmen of 
our Board Committees on the activities of those committees throughout 
the year. These reports will explain to you where we have focused  
our work in 2014. Firstly, however I should like to explain the key  
issues that we, as a Board, have been handling:
Board succession planning
As mentioned in my letter on page 5, Sir John Buchanan, Richard De 
Schutter, Ajay Piramal and Pamela Kirby all retired from the Board 
during 2014. One of my first tasks in assuming the role of Chairman 
therefore was to refresh the Board to take the Company into our next 
stage of development. The report from the Nomination & Governance 
Committee on page 70 discusses the process we followed to identify 
the gaps in Board skills and experiences left by the departing directors 
and to commence the search for our new Non-executive Directors, 
Vinita Bali, who joined the Board on 1 December 2014, and Erik 
Engstrom, who joined us on 1 January 2015. I believe that we have 
a well-balanced Board with the skills we need for the future and I 
welcome our new Board members. This, however, is an ongoing 
process and we shall keep the Board composition under constant 
review in the years ahead, making changes where necessary to adapt 
to the changing needs of the Company.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Chairman’s letter
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and we 
comply with all of the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 (‘the 
Code’). The Company’s American Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE) and we are therefore subject to the rules of the NYSE as well as to 
the US securities laws and the rules of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) 
applicable to foreign private issuers. We comply with the requirements of the NYSE 
and SEC except that the Nomination & Governance Committee is not comprised 
wholly of Independent Directors as required by the NYSE, but consists of a majority 
of Independent Directors in accordance with the Code. We shall explain in this 
Corporate Governance Statement and in the reports on the Audit Committee, the 
Nomination & Governance Committee, the Ethics & Compliance Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee, how we have applied the provisions and principles of the 
Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) Listing Rules, Disclosure & Transparency Rules 
(DTRs) and the Code throughout the year. 
The Directors report comprises pages 54 to 80, 103, 111, 113, 115 and pages 170 to 193 
of the Annual Report. 
Good Governance lies at the heart  
of a well-run Company

Working together as a Board
Given the number of changes at Board level in 2014, we decided that 
our review into the Board’s effectiveness would focus on how we 
worked together as a Board and how we worked with the Executive 
Team. This review was led by Brian Larcombe, our Senior Independent 
Director. He asked the Directors and key members of the Executive 
team a series of open-ended questions about their views on the role 
of the Board and its Committees and how we worked together. The 
results of his review have proved to be very interesting and we are 
now working on ways to work together even more effectively. This is 
explained in greater detail on page 68.
Yours sincerely ,
Roberto Quarta
Chairman

Supporting the Business
Various committees and groups relating to the running of the business 
report to the Chief Executive Officer. These groups have a dual role both 
advising the Chief Executive Officer and also implementing the strategy 
throughout the business. A number of these committees also report 
regularly to the Board or one of its Committees. 
Investment in the Strategic Priorities
Investment in our Strategic Priorities, important for our future success, is 
governed through a number of committees and groups. These groups 
report either to the Chief Executive Officer or to one of the Executive 
Officers and are focused on allocating resources to and overseeing 
investment in the strategic priorities. Regular reports from these groups 
are submitted to the Board or one of its Committees.
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 64 Independence of Directors
We require our Non-executive Directors to remain independent from 
management so that they are able to exercise independent oversight 
and effectively challenge management. We therefore continually 
assess the independence of each of our Non-executive Directors. 
The Executive Directors have determined that all our Non-executive 
Directors are independent in accordance with both UK and US 
requirements. None of our Non-executive Directors or their immediate 
families has ever had a material relationship with the Group. None of 
them receives additional remuneration apart from Directors’ fees, nor 
do they participate in the Group’s share plans or pension schemes. 
None of them serve as directors of any companies or affiliates in which 
any other Director is a director.
More importantly, each of our Non-executive Directors is prepared to 
question and challenge management, to request more information and 
to ask the difficult question. They insist on robust responses both within 
the Boardroom and sometimes, between meetings. The Chief Executive 
Officer is open to challenge from the Non-executive Directors and uses 
this positively to provide more detail and to reflect further on issues.
We acknowledge that Brian Larcombe has served as an independent 
Non-executive Director for a period of 13 years, which is a period of time 
that some might regard as likely to impact his independence. We do not 
believe this to be the case as Brian Larcombe continues to maintain an 
independent view within Board discussions. Furthermore, his experience 
on the Board, wise counsel and corporate memory has been most 
useful to Roberto Quarta in his first year as Chairman of the Company, 
particularly in a year when a number of other long-serving directors have 
left the Board and new Non-executive Directors have been appointed.
Management of Conflicts of Interest
None of our Directors or their connected persons, has any family 
relationship with any other Director or Officer, nor has a material 
interest in any contract to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries 
are, or were, a party during the year or up to 23 February 2015.
Each of us as a Director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 
to avoid a situation in which we have or may have a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts or might conflict with the interests of the Company. 
This duty is in addition to the existing duty owed to the Company to 
disclose to the Board any interest in a transaction or arrangement 
under consideration by the Company. 
If any Director becomes aware of any situation which might give rise 
to a conflict of interest, they inform the rest of the Board immediately 
and the Board is then permitted under the Company’s Articles of 
Association to authorise such conflict. This information is then recorded 
in the Company’s Register of Conflicts, together with the date on which 
authorisation was given. In addition, each Director certifies on an 
annual basis that the information contained in the Register is correct.
When the Board decides whether or not to authorise a conflict, only the 
Directors who have no interest in the matter are permitted to participate 
in the discussion and a conflict is only authorised if the Board believes 
that it would not have an impact on the Board’s ability to promote the 
success of the Company in the long term. Additionally, the Board may 
determine that certain limits or conditions must be imposed when 
giving authorisation. No actual conflicts have been identified, which 
have required approval by the Board. However, six situations have 
been identified which could potentially give rise to a conflict of interest 
and these have been duly authorised by the Board and are reviewed 
on an annual basis.
Outside Directorships
We encourage our Executive Directors to serve as a Non-executive 
Director of a maximum of one external company. Olivier Bohuon is a 
Non-executive Director of Virbac group and Julie Brown does not hold 
such a position. 
Re-appointment of Directors
In accordance with the Code, all Directors offer themselves to 
shareholders for re-election annually, except those who are retiring 
immediately after the Annual General Meeting. Vinita Bali and Erik 
Engstrom, who were appointed to the Board on 1 December 2014 and 
1 January 2015 respectively, will offer themselves for election at the 
Annual General Meeting. Each Director may be removed at any time by 
the Board or the shareholders.
Director Indemnity Arrangements
Each Director is covered by appropriate directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance and there are also Deeds of Indemnity in place between the 
Company and each Director. These Deeds of Indemnity mean that the 
Company indemnifies Directors in respect of any proceedings brought 
by third parties against them personally in their capacity as Directors 
of the Company. The Company would also fund ongoing costs in 
defending a legal action as they are incurred rather than after judgment 
has been given. In the event of an unsuccessful defence in an action 
against them, individual directors would be liable to repay the Company 
for any damages and to repay defence costs to the extent funded by 
the Company.
Liaison with shareholders
The Board meets with retail investors at the Annual General Meeting 
and responds to many letters and emails from shareholders 
throughout the year. 
The Executive Directors also meet regularly with institutional investors 
to discuss the Company’s business and financial performance both 
at the time of the announcement of results and at industry investor 
events. During 2014, the Executive Directors held meetings with 
institutional investors, including investors representing approximately 
46% of the share capital as at December 2014.
Since joining the Company, Roberto Quarta, the new Chairman has 
taken the opportunity to meet with investors to hear from them their 
views of the Company and also to talk about his first impressions of 
the Company and management. He held 12 meetings with investors 
holding approximately 22% of the share capital. These meetings have 
been a useful part of his induction process in understanding the 
Company from the investor perspective.
Joseph Papa, the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee also 
offered to meet with key institutional investors towards the end of 2014. 
Most investors were overwhelmingly supportive of our remuneration 
arrangements and we have made no changes to these arrangements 
over the year. He therefore met with four investors holding around 2% 
of the share capital. These were useful discussions giving insight into 
current investor thinking.
Ian Barlow, the Chairman of the Audit Committee also offered to meet 
with institutional investors to discuss audit related matters and in 
particular, the tender process we had followed to select new auditors. 
The meetings held with five investors holding around 5.45% of the 
issued share capital were interesting and useful and we welcomed 
some insightful comments on possible improvements to the Audit 
Committee Report.
Members of the Board are always happy to engage with investors, if 
they have matters they wish to raise with the Non-executive team.
A short report on our major shareholders and any significant changes 
in their holdings since the previous meeting is reviewed at each Board 
meeting. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors report back to the 
Board following their meetings with investors. Olivier Bohuon and Julie 
Brown routinely report on any concerns or issues that shareholders 
have raised with them in their meetings. Copies of analyst reports on 
the Company and its peers are also circulated to Directors.

Each meeting was preceded by a meeting between the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors without Executive Directors and 
management in attendance. Unless otherwise stated, meetings are held in London. 
At each meeting, we approved the minutes of the previous meetings, reviewed matters arising and received reports and updates from  
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Business Development Officer, the Chief Legal Officer and the Company 
Secretary. We also received reports from the chairmen of the Board Committees on the activities of these Committees since the 
previous meeting.

Board and Committee Attendance
The review into the Board’s effectiveness in 2015 will be facilitated externally as although we undertake an annual review, the last externally 
facilitated review was in 2012. The areas for attention identified in the 2013 review have been addressed as follows:
Progress made in 2014 against the Areas for Attention identified in the 2013 review
Succession Planning at Non-executive Director 
level would be a key priority following the 
retirement of a number of long serving Non-
executive Directors during the year.
Nomination & Governance Committee undertook a comprehensive search for new Non-
executive Directors leading to the appointment of Vinita Bali on 1 December 2014 and of 
Erik Engstrom on 1 January 2015. This process is ongoing. Details of the full search process 
are given in the Nomination & Governance Committee Report on page 70.
Timing and length of the Board and Committee 
meetings could be reviewed to consider 
whether the current pattern of meetings was 
most effective.
The timing and frequency of Board meetings has been reviewed by the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive Officer, who have concluded that the current pattern of meetings is 
appropriate for the Company and fits in well with the programme of executive activities 
throughout the year. The reporting schedule inhibits changing the Board timetable.
Action identified
Make more effective use of the annual Board Planner to ensure that all key strategic issues were timetabled appropriately throughout the year
Encourage the executive team to access the diverse competencies of the Non-executive Directors more between Board meetings
Continue the practice of inviting members of the executive team to present regularly to the Board

Corporate Governance Statement continued
Effectiveness
Dear Shareholder ,
The Chairman asked me as Senior Independent Director to conduct 
the review into the effectiveness of the Board in 2014. I interviewed all 
the members of the Board, the Company Secretary and the Head of 
Human Resources towards the end of 2014, basing our discussions 
around a short questionnaire prepared by the Company Secretary.
The Board scores highly on all the key assessments of our 
responsibilities for approving strategy, monitoring performance, 
determining risk, diligence of members’ attendance and quality of 
discussion. Roberto Quarta, Chairman of the Board is universally 
respected for his professionalism, chairmanship skills and for 
developing an excellent working relationship with Olivier. He has 
invested the time to understand the business, getting to know 
the senior executives and the major shareholders and has made 
excellent progress in strengthening the Board with appointment of 
new Non-executive Directors. The Committees of the Board were 
also found to be operating effectively. 
There has been some healthy discussion around the role played by 
the Board, with the Non-executives eager to play a more active role 
in agenda planning, setting the strategy, organisational change and 
management succession and the appointment of advisers. 
The Board discussed the results of my findings at our Board meeting 
in February 2015 and agreed the following actions for 2015:
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 68 Board Development Programme
Our Board Development Programme is directed to the specific needs 
and interests of our Directors. We focus the development sessions on 
facilitating a greater awareness and understanding of our business 
rather than formal training in what it is to be a Director. We value our 
visits to the different Smith & Nephew sites around the world, where 
we meet with the local managers of our businesses and see the 
daily operations in action. Meeting our local managers helps us to 
understand the challenges they face and their plans to meet those 
challenges. We also take these opportunities to look at our products 
and in particular the new products being developed by our R&D teams.  
This direct contact with the business in the locations in which we 
operate around the world helps us to make investment and strategic 
decisions. Meeting our local managers also helps us when making 
succession planning decisions below Board level.
During the course of the year, we receive updates at the Board and 
Committee meetings on external corporate governance changes  
likely to impact the Company in the future. 
Succession Planning 
The Board is responsible for ensuring that there are effective 
succession plans in place to ensure the orderly appointment of 
directors to the Board, as and when vacancies arise. The report  
from the Nomination & Governance Committee on pages 70 to 71 
explains the process the Board and the Nomination & Governance 
Committee followed in 2014 to build a balanced board for the future  
in undertaking the search for new Non-executive Directors.
Building a successful executive team is the responsibility of the Chief 
Executive Officer, although this process is also overseen by the Board. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer 
present a report to the Board on Succession Planning on an annual 
basis, at which the performance and potential of members of the 
executive team are discussed and considered. The Board is also given 
a number of opportunities during the course of the year to meet key 
members of the executive team at the Strategy Review held annually in 
September and at the site visits held in October each year. Executive 
Officers and their direct reports also make regular presentations 
on different aspects of the business. The Board recognises the 
importance of getting to know the executive team below Board level 
both for the purpose of understanding the business better but also  
in order to plan for executive succession.
By order of the Board, on 25 February 2015
Roberto Quarta
Chairman
In 2014, we particularly focused on the changes to Narrative Reporting 
and reporting on Remuneration as well as the changes incorporated in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 and the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Audit Quality Thematic Review into fraud risks and laws 
and regulations. New Directors receive tailored induction programmes 
when they join the Board. In 2014, Vinita Bali commenced her induction 
programme with a series of meetings with key senior executives and a 
briefing on UK Company Law and Corporate Governance delivered jointly 
by our corporate lawyers, Freshfields and our Company Secretary, Susan 
Swabey. Since the year end, Vinita Bali and Erik Engstrom have continued 
meeting with key senior executives and a series of visits to our major 
facilities is planned for them both over the next few months. All Non-
executive Directors are encouraged to visit our overseas businesses, if 
they happen to be travelling for other purposes. Our local management 
teams enjoy welcoming Non-executive Directors to their business 
and it emphasises the interest the Board takes in all our operations. 
The Chairman regularly reviews the development needs of individual 
Directors and the Board as a whole. 
Development activities
The following development sessions covering both the Smith & Nephew business and wider market issues were held during the year:
Month Activity

– Further reviewed the longlist and shortlist of Non-executive 
Director candidates and discussed the outcome of meetings held

Since the year end, we have also considered the outcomes of the Board 
Effectiveness review and discussed the future structure of the Board.
Non-executive Directors
During 2014, there were a number of changes to the composition of 
the Board. Sir John Buchanan retired as Chairman of the Board at the 
Annual General Meeting after nine years’ service to the Company. 
Richard De Schutter also retired at the Annual General Meeting 
following 13 years’ service and Pamela Kirby retired after 12 years’ 
service in July. Earlier in the year, Ajay Piramal also retired from the 
Board in March due to the pressure of other commitments. These 
departures left a number of positions on the Board to be filled. We 
therefore undertook a search programme to identify suitable new 
Board members, which resulted in the appointment of Vinita Bali as 
Non-executive Director with effect from 1 December 2014 and of Erik 
Engstrom with effect from 1 January 2015. The process we followed was 
as follows:
– I worked with Olivier Bohuon, Chief Executive Officer, the Company 
Secretary and the Head of Human Resources to analyse the skills 
and experiences we felt that we needed on the Board to implement 
our Strategy over the next five years. We also analysed the skills 
and experiences of those Directors who would be remaining on 
the Board 
– From this review, we identified that we would wish to search for up to 
three new Non-executive Directors, each with a combination of one 
or more of the following skills, experiences or backgrounds:
–  Experience of one or more of the Emerging Markets in which 
we operate;
–  Digital experience – we later modified this to leading a company 
through a period of considerable technological change;
– Experience as a Chief Executive Officer in another listed company;
– At least one new female Non-executive Director;
– The Board reviewed this analysis and endorsed the skills and 
experiences against which we would be searching
– The Nomination & Governance Committee selected Russell 
Reynolds to undertake the search for new Non-executive directors, 
having reviewed three firms suggested by the Head of Human 
Resources and the Company Secretary
– Russell Reynolds prepared a long list of candidates satisfying one or 
more of the above criteria and Brian Larcombe and I met with them to 
discuss the longlist and select a shortlist of suitable candidates
– Members of the Nomination & Governance Committee then met 
individually with a number of candidates. Additional Board members 
were also asked to meet certain candidates where there were 
particular interests or experiences
– The Nomination & Governance Committee agreed to recommend 
that the Board appoint Vinita Bali and Erik Engstrom as Non-
executive Directors.
The Nomination & Governance Committee selected Vinita Bali to be 
a Non-executive Director because of her experience as a very senior 
commercial executive in a wide range of Emerging Markets across India, 
Africa and South America.
We selected Erik Engstrom because of his experience in his role as Chief 
Executive Officer leading his company Reed Elsevier through significant 
technological change and his ability to add value to our Audit Committee.
Russell Reynolds also undertook succession planning assessments on 
behalf of management. The Committee is satisfied that their advice is 
objective and independent. 
Diversity
We aim to have a Board which represents a wide range of 
backgrounds, skills and experiences. We also value a diversity of 
outlook, approach and style in our Board members. We believe that a 
balanced Board is better equipped to consider matters from a broader 
perspective and therefore come to decisions that have considered a 
wider range of issues and perspectives than would be the case in a 
more homogenous Board. Diversity is not simply a matter of gender, 
ethnicity or other easily measurable characteristic. Diversity of outlook 
and approach is harder to measure than gender or ethnicity but is 
equally important. A Board needs a range of skills from technical 
adherence to governance or regulatory matters for an understanding of 
the business in which we operate. It needs some members with a long 
corporate memory and others who bring new insights from other fields. 
There needs to be both support and challenge on the Board as well as 
a balance of gender, commercial and international experience. When 
selecting new members for the Board, we take these considerations 
into account, as well as professional background. A new Board 
member needs to fit in with their fellow Board members, but also needs 
to provide a new way of looking at things.
In 2012, we stated that our expectation would be that by 2015, 25% of 
our Board would be female and we have met this expectation. 30% 
of our Board is female. We do not regard this as a fixed percentage as 
the number of Board members will fluctuate from time to time and we 
would not necessarily expect to replace any retiring Director with a new 
Director of the same gender. We will still continue to appoint Directors 
on merit, valuing the unique contribution that they will bring to the 
Board, regardless of gender.
Governance
During the year, the Nomination & Governance Committee also 
addressed a number of governance matters. We also received updates 
from the Company Secretary on new developments in corporate 
governance and reporting in both the UK and Europe. We reviewed 
the independence of our Non-executive Directors, considered 
potential conflicts of interest and the diversity of the Board and made 
recommendations concerning these matters to the Board.
Yours sincerely ,
Roberto Quarta

In 2014, we held four physical meetings. Each meeting was attended by

initiatives to address them.
At each meeting we noted and considered the activities of enforcement 
agencies and investigation of possible improprieties. We also reviewed 
a report on the activities of the Group Ethics & Compliance Committee 
and reviewed the progress of the Global Compliance Programme. 
Since the year end, we have also reviewed the work of the Group Ethics 
& Compliance Committee meeting held in November 2014, considered 
the compliance implications of recent acquisitions and continued our 
oversight of the Quality Assurance and Regulatory Assurance function.
Employee Compliance Programme
New employees are trained on our Code of Conduct, which sets 
out the basic legal and ethical principles for conducting business. 
A copy of the Code of Conduct can be found on our website at 
www.smith-nephew.com
Further support is provided through a comprehensive set of tools and 
resources located on our global intranet platform. These tools and 
resources are regularly updated. 
The Code of Conduct includes our whistle-blower policy, which 
enables employees and members of the public to contact us 
anonymously through an independent provider (where allowed by local 
law). Individuals can also report any concern to their direct manager 
or a manager in Compliance, Legal or Human Resources. All calls and 
contacts are investigated and the appropriate action taken, including 
reports for senior management or the Board, where warranted. As 
stated in the Code of Conduct, we also enforce our non-retaliation 
policy with respect to anyone who makes a report in good faith. The 
Ethics & Compliance Committee is advised of any potentially significant 
improprieties from time to time, and the Company’s response. 
In 2014, we continued to work to enhance the employee compliance 
training programme. New employees receive training on our Code 
of Conduct (‘Code’), and we assign annual compliance training to 
employees. In 2014, we updated our Code training. The new module is 
more interactive, role-based and allows individuals to apply the Code 
in different scenarios. 
We also developed and piloted a face-to-face course for new 
managers, supplementing the on-line manager certification training. In 
2015, all new managers will be required to complete both the on-line 
and the face-to-face course. 
73 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Compliance Programme for Third Parties
We continually review our compliance programme with third  
party sellers (such as distributors and sales agents), particularly  
in higher risk markets. This programme includes due diligence, 
contracts with compliance terms and compliance training. To increase 
oversight, we have augmented monitoring and auditing programmes 
in 2014.
We expanded our oversight of third party sellers with site assessments 
to check compliance controls and monitoring visits to review books 
and records. 
We have continued to strengthen controls over other third parties 
engaged by us to provide services other than selling our products, 
such as customs, registration and travel agents. In 2014, we focused on 
potentially higher risk third parties. We have established a policy and 
process requiring that managers prioritise our oversight of third parties 
and take appropriate steps, including performing a risk assessment, 
conducting due diligence and assigning training, based on third party 
type and risk profile. 
Compliance implications around acquisitions 
In both 2013 and 2014, there has been increased strategic acquisition 
activity across the Group. In all cases, we undertake comprehensive 
due diligence evaluation prior to acquisition and implement compliance 
integration plans from the point of executing the acquisition. This is to 
ensure that new businesses are integrated into the Smith & Nephew 
compliance culture as soon and consistently as possible and that all 
new employees are immediately made aware of how we do things at 
Smith & Nephew.

Oversight of Quality Assurance and Regulatory 
Assurance Function
During the course of 2014, it was agreed that primary oversight of the 
Quality Assurance and Regulatory Assurance Function (QARA) would 
move from the Audit Committee to the Ethics & Compliance Committee. 
Product safety is at the heart of our business and regulatory authorities 
enforce a complex series of laws and regulations that govern the 
design, development, approval, manufacture, labelling, marketing 
and sale of healthcare products, including review of the safety and 
efficacy of such products. Jerry Porreca, SVP Quality Assurance 
and Regulatory Assurance presented to the Ethics & Compliance 
Committee in October 2014, explaining the new structure of the QARA 
function and the current focuses and initiatives being addressed by the 
function. The QARA function is built on four pillars – quality assurance, 
regulatory affairs, customer complaints and quality systems and 
regulatory compliance. 
Going forward, the Ethics & Compliance Committee will monitor the 
work of the QARA function on a quarterly basis, approve the QARA 
annual programme of work, as outlined in their 3-Year QARA Plan, 
consider any quality or regulatory issues that arise during the year,  
and approve any appropriate remedial action. 
Yours sincerely,

During the year, we also approved our Policy on the use of Conflict Minerals by written resolution.
Since the year end, we have also reviewed the Annual Report and Accounts for 2014 and have concluded that taken as a whole, they are fair 
balanced and understandable and have advised the full Board accordingly. In coming to this conclusion, we have considered the description 
of the Group’s strategy and key risks, the key elements of the business model, which is set out on page 12, and the key performance 
indicators and their link to the strategy.
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 76 Significant matters related to the financial statements
We considered the following key areas of judgement in relation to the 2014 accounts and at each reporting quarter end, which we discussed in all 
cases with management and the external auditor:
Area of judgement Our action
Valuation of inventories
A feature of the orthopaedic business model (whose finished goods inventory 
makes up 81% of the Group total finished goods inventory) is the high level of 
product inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and is 
available for customers’ immediate use. Complete sets of product, including large 
and small sizes have to be made available in this way. These sizes are used less 
frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are 
inevitably in excess of requirements. Adjustments to carrying value are therefore 
required to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation.
At each quarter end, we received reports from and 
discussed with management the level of provisioning 
and material areas at risk. The provisioning level was 21.5% 
at 31 December 2014 (26.0% as at 31 December 2013). We 
concluded that the proposed levels were appropriate.
Liability provisioning
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree 
of estimation. Provision is made for loss contingencies when it is considered 
probable that an adverse outcome will occur and the amount of the loss can be 
reasonably estimated. In making its estimates, management takes into account 
the advice of internal and external legal counsel. Provisions are reviewed regularly 
and amounts updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes. 
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the 
outcome of court proceedings or settlement negotiations or if new facts come  
to light. The level of provisioning for contingent and other liabilities is an issue 
where management and legal judgements are important.
As members of the Board, we receive regular updates from 
the Chief Legal Officer. These updates form the basis for the 
level of provisioning. These judgements have not moved 
materially during the year, with some cases having been 
resolved, and we have determined that the proposed levels 
at year end of $74 million in 2014 ($86 million in 2013) were 
appropriate in the circumstances.
Impairment
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill, intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment, a number of significant assumptions have to be made 
when preparing cash flow projections. These include the future rate of market 
growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future 
profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and 
success in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results should differ or  
changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which  
would adversely impact operating results.
We reviewed management’s reports on the key 
assumptions with respect to goodwill, acquisition intangible 
assets and investments in associates - particularly the 
forecast future cash flows and discount rates used to make 
these calculations. We have also considered the disclosure 
surrounding these reviews, and concluded that the review 
and disclosure were appropriate.
Taxation
Provisioning for potential current tax liabilities and the level of deferred tax asset 
recognition in relation to accumulated tax losses are underpinned by a range 
of judgments about the future statutory profitability of constituent entities of 
the Group.
We annually review our processes and approve the 
principles for management of tax risks. We review quarterly 
reports from management evaluating existing risks and 
tax provisions, concluding that the levels of provisions 
was appropriate.
Business combinations
The Group has identified ‘growth through acquisitions’ as one of its Strategic 
Priorities. During 2014, we acquired ArthroCare Corporation; the determination 
of the balance sheet fair value acquired is dependent upon understanding the 
circumstances at acquisition and estimates of the future results of the acquired 
business and management judgement is a factor in making these determinations. 
For completed acquisitions, we received a report from 
management setting out the significant assets and liabilities 
acquired, details of the provisional fair value adjustments 
applied, an analysis of the intangible assets acquired, 
the assumptions behind the valuation of these acquired 
intangible assets and the proposed useful economic life 
of each intangible asset class. For material acquisitions, 
management engage third party specialists to perform 
a detailed analysis, summaries of which are included 
in management reports. We reviewed, discussed and 
approved these reports.
We note that within the External Audit report there is a principal risk associated with the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of related 
reserves as required by auditing standards. We have considered this and have concluded that we have appropriate procedures and controls in 
place not to include this as a significant area of judgement.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

External Auditor
Independence of External Auditors
The independence of our external auditors is critical for the integrity  
of the audit. Our Auditor Independence Policy, which ensures that this 
independence is maintained, is available on the Company’s website.  
We believe that the implementation of this policy helps ensure that 
auditor objectivity and independence is safeguarded. The policy governs 
our approach when we require our external auditor to carry our non-
audit services, and all such services are strictly governed by this policy. 
During 2014, fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP , our external auditor , for non-
audit work totalled $1.8 million, representing 35% of total audit fees. Full 
details are shown in Note 3.2 of the Notes to the Group accounts. During 
2014, fees paid to KPMG LLP , who will be appointed as our external 
auditors at the Annual General Meeting, amounted to $3.9 million. The 
provision of non-audit services by KPMG will be subject to our Auditor 
Independence Policy and the level of these services will be monitored 
closely. It is not expected that the level of non-audit services provided by 
KPMG will be as high in 2015.
The Auditor Independence Policy also governs the policy regarding 
audit partner rotation. In 2014, Les Clifford who had been our audit 
partner for five years was replaced by Michael Rudberg.
Effectiveness of External Auditors
Although EY will cease to be the Company’s external auditors at the 
Annual General Meeting, we felt that it would still be useful to carry 
out a review of the effectiveness of the external audit process and 
the quality of the audit, as the findings could be of use to KPMG, the 
incoming external auditor. We therefore conducted a review into 
the effectiveness of the external audit as part of the 2014 year-end 
process, in line with previous years. We sought the views of key 
members of the finance management team, considered the feedback 
from this process and shared it with management, EY and KPMG.
During the year, we also considered the inspection reports from the 
Audit Oversight Boards in the UK and US and determined that we were 
satisfied with the audit quality provided by EY.
The Audit Quality Review Team of the Financial Reporting Council in the 
UK reviewed the 2013 audit EY performed of the Company. We have 
discussed the results of this inspection with EY and are satisfied that 
the points raised by the review have been appropriately addressed in 
the 2014 audit.
Overall therefore, we concluded that EY had carried out their audit for 
2014 effectively. 
Appointment of External Auditors at Annual General Meeting
Ernst & Young LLP will be retiring as the Company’s external auditor 
at the Annual General Meeting. The reports of Ernst & Young LLP on 
the Company’s financial statements for the past two fiscal years did 
not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were 
not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting 
principles. In connection with the audits of the Company’s financial 
statements for each of the two fiscal years ended 2013 and 2014, and 
in the subsequent interim period to 23 February 2015, there were no 
disagreements with Ernst & Young LLP on any matters of accounting 
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope 
and procedures which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young 
LLP would have caused Ernst & Young LLP to make reference to the 
matter in their report.
Resolutions will be put to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
9 April 2015 proposing the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company’s 
Auditors and authorising the Board to determine their remuneration,  
on the recommendation of the Audit Committee.
Disclosure of Information to the Auditors
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Directors serving at the time of approving the Directors’ Report confirm 
that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Auditor, Ernst & Young LLP , are unaware and 
the Directors also confirm that they have taken reasonable steps to be 
aware of any relevant audit information and, accordingly, to establish 
that the Auditor is aware of such information.
Audit and Professional Fees paid to the Auditor
Fees for professional services provided by Ernst & Young LLP , the 
Group’s independent auditor in each of the last two fiscal years, in 
each of the following categories were:

Internal Audit
Our Internal Audit function reports directly to the Audit Committee 
and is headed by Jenny Morgan, Senior Vice President Internal Audit, 
whom we appointed in May 2014. She has subsequently restructured 
her team to meet the requirements of the evolving nature of our 
business, particularly in Emerging Markets and new acquisitions.
The internal Audit function carries out work in the following three areas:
– Financial systems and processes;
– Systems that ensure compliance with our Code of Conduct, 
regulation and laws; and
– Quality management systems in our manufacturing activities.
In all three areas, they act as a third line of defence behind operational 
management’s front line and the Company’s internal assurance 
activities within Group Finance Compliance and Quality Assurance. 
During the year, they completed 26 reviews across the business.  
The Audit Committee receives a quarterly report of the activities of 
the Internal Audit function and reviews the results of the Internal Audit 
reports, looking in detail at any reports with unsatisfactory ratings. 
We also receive a quarterly report detailing any unremediated and 
overdue control recommendations and oversee the effective and timely 
remediation of any recommendations.
Specific activities of the Internal Audit function in 2014 were the 
review of the design of the post-deal acquisition review process 
and the calculation of the benefits and costs associated with the 
Group Optimisation programme. In addition site specific audits were 
conducted of the China commercial business and the new acquisitions 
in Turkey and India to ensure that integration efforts were in line with 
approved plans.
In 2015, we will continue to monitor Internal Audit’s scope of work and 
operational methods to ensure that it continues to play a full role in 
providing assurance over the Group’s identification and management 
of risk and its associated controls.
During 2014, KPMG carried out an external review into the 
effectiveness of the Internal Audit function. The review made a number 
of recommendations regarding the role and remit of internal audit, the 
resourcing of the function and the development of integrated working 
with other functions to provide a more holisitc approach to risk and 
assurance across the Group. These recommendations were accepted 
and are being implemented. 
Since this review, the Internal Audit function has been strengthened 
by the appointment of Jenny Morgan, the new Senior Vice 
President Internal Audit who has in turn restructured the function as 
detailed above. 
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 78 Tender of External Audit Services
EY and their predecessor firms have been the Company’s auditors 
since the Company listed in 1937. We have been very satisfied with 
the effectiveness of the external audit process and the quality of the 
audit and have undertaken a number of measures to ensure that 
the external auditor has continued to maintain its independence. 
However, in common with a number of other companies, as we 
explained in our Audit Committee Report last year, we recognised  
in 2014, that it was the right time to put the external audit out to tender . 
During the early summer of 2014, I led a process to select a new 
external auditor for the year ending 31 December 2015. I worked 
with the Group’s procurement function and established a Steering 
Committee comprising myself, Brian Larcombe, member of the 
Audit Committee and Senior Independent Director, Julie Brown, the 
Chief Financial Officer, Susan Swabey, the Company Secretary and 
Dan Baker, Senior Vice President Group Finance. Given the size, 
complexity and geographical scope of the business, we invited 
Deloitte, KPMG and PwC to take part in the tender for carrying out 
our external audit. In addition, in light of the emerging rules from 
Europe, we reached mutual agreement with EY that they would not 
take part in the tender process.
Prior to the commencement of the tender process, each firm was 
invited to make a presentation to the early April Audit Committee 
meeting on a project on which they had recently been working 
with the Company. This was to ensure that each firm had sufficient 
exposure to the Audit Committee prior to the financial tender. 
We were conscious that the audit tender process is time and 
resource consuming, both for the firms involved and for the 
Company, and were therefore determined to have a concise yet 
thorough process, ensuring equivalent access to management for 
each firm. We undertook the following process over just six weeks:
1. Late May – Issued the request for tender.
2. Late May – Participating firms attended a joint workshop over a 
period of two days. This included a group meeting with all firms 
with a series of presentations from key members of management, 
explaining their key expectations from the external audit process, 
as well as a series of individual meetings with management.
3. Late May – Each firm was granted access to key senior members 
of management in a structured programme following the 
workshop, and then given access to senior managers and  
finance staff throughout the Group to help them understand 
the business further.
4. End June – Each firm submitted their written tender document 
covering predetermined areas of focus, including risk 
identification, audit approach to risks and audit scope. These 
written tenders also included the proposed audit fee, as we 
believed that as well as ensuring the quality of the audit, we  
also needed to have regard to the sensible containment of costs.
5. Early July – In the week leading up to the presentation, each 
audit firm was asked to prepare a response to an audit query, 
the same query for each firm, to simulate real life working and 
allow the Steering Committee to assess how well they responded 
to a request at short notice and how they interacted with the 
Committee on a technical issue.
6. Early July – Each firm was asked to make a presentation to the 
Steering Committee explaining why we should select them  
as our external auditors. 
7 . Early July – Following the presentations and further discussions, 
the Audit Committee met and considered the recommendation  
of the Steering Committee and agreed to appoint KPMG LLP  
as our external auditors for the 2015 financial year. A resolution  
to this effect will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the  
Annual General Meeting. 
Throughout the process, we were mindful of the need to preserve the 
independence of the external audit. As part of the tender, each firm 
was required to disclose all existing relationships with the Company 
and explain their proposals for ensuring that these relationships 
would not cause any conflict of interest after 1 January 2015. Given that 
up until 2008, I was Senior Partner in London with KPMG, we were 
aware that there might be some concerns about my independence. 
In order to address this, our Chairman Roberto Quarta joined the 
Steering Committee for the final stage of presentations to ensure 
impartiality was maintained. We also noted that other senior members 
of the finance team had recently joined the Company from other 
tendering firms.
We chose KPMG to be our external auditors as we felt that they had 
demonstrated that they understood our business and risks well and 
could work both constructively and in a challenging manner with our 
management and provide the Audit Committee with the assurances 
we would need to fulfil our role.
The audit of the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts will therefore 
be the last external audit to be conducted by EY. I should therefore 
like to record my thanks to EY and their partners and staff for their 
many years of excellent service to the shareholders of Smith & 
Nephew. As Chairman of the Audit Committee for the past five years, 
I have enjoyed working with them and have valued the insights and 
professionalism they have brought to the Audit Committee meetings.
Risk Management and Internal Control
On behalf of the Board, we reviewed the system of internal financial 
control and satisfied ourselves that we are meeting required standards 
both for the year ended 31 December 2014 and up to the date of approval 
of this Annual Report. No concerns were raised with us in 2014 about 
possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting.
In coming to this conclusion:
– We received regular reports from the Internal Audit and Group 
Finance functions on their findings from the reviews undertaken 
throughout the year, both from an internal audit perspective and also 
with regard to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
– We requested and reviewed a report mapping Group level risks  
and related control assurance.
– We requested various reports from management relating  
to specific risks identified through the risk management process.  
Our Risk Management Framework is underpinned by Business 
and Functional Risk Registers that highlight the risks identified and 
the probability and impact of risk to the Group, as well as mitigation 
plans. The most significant of these risks are considered by the 
Group Risk Committee for inclusion on a Group Risk Register. The 
effectiveness of the framework is reviewed annually by Internal 
Audit and by the Audit Committee. In 2014, the Audit Committee 
concluded that the framework was effective.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Accountability continued
Evaluation of Internal Controls
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a–15 (f) and 
15d–15(f) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
There is an established system of internal control throughout the 
Group and our Divisions. The main elements of the internal control 
framework are:
The management of each Division is responsible for the establishment 
and review of effective financial controls within their Division.
The Group Finance manual sets out, amongst other things, 
financial and accounting policies and minimum internal financial 
control standards.
The Internal Audit function agrees an annual work plan and scope of 
work with the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee reviewed reports from Internal Audit on their 
findings on internal financial controls.
The Audit Committee reviews the Group whistle-blower procedures.
The Audit Committee reviews regular reports from the Senior Vice 
President, Group Finance and the heads of the Financial Controls and 
Compliance, Taxation and Treasury functions.
This system of internal control has been designed to manage rather 
than eliminate material risks to the achievement of our strategic 
and business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. Because of 
inherent limitation, our internal controls over financial reporting may not 
prevent or detect all misstatements. In addition, our projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness in future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate. The system of internal control is not applied to the 
entities in which the Group does not hold a controlling interest. This 
process complies with the Financial Reporting Council’s ‘Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’ and 
additionally contributes to our compliance with the obligations under 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and other internal assurance activities. 
Other than the integration of ArthroCare there has been no change 
in the Group’s internal control over financial reporting during the 
period covered by this Annual Report that has materially affected, or is 
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Group’s internal control over 
financial reporting.
The Board is responsible overall for reviewing and approving the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework and 
the system of internal controls over financial, operational including 
quality management and ethical compliance processes operated by 
the Group. The Board has delegated responsibility for this review to 
the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee, through the Internal Audit 
function, reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control 
procedures and identifies any weaknesses and ensures these are 
remediated within agreed timelines. The latest review covered the 
financial year to 31 December 2014 and included the period up to the 
approval of this Annual Report. 
The main elements of this annual review are as follows:
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have 
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the 
Group’s disclosure controls and procedures as at 31 December 2014. 
Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer concluded on 23 February 2015 that the disclosure 
controls were effective as at 31 December 2014.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management 
assessed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control over 
financial reporting as at 31 December 2014 in accordance with 
the requirements in the US under s404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act. In making that assessment, they used the criteria set forth 
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway 
Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on 
their assessment, management concluded and reported that, as 
at 31 December 2014, the Group’s internal control over financial 
reporting is effective based on those criteria.
Having received the report from management, the Audit Committee 
reports to the Board on the effectiveness of controls.
Ernst & Young LLP . An independent registered public accounting firm 
issued an audit report on the Group’s internal control over financial 
reporting as at 31 December 2014. This report appears on page 105.
Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers
We have adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, which 
applies to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Senior Vice President Group Finance and the Group’s senior financial 
officers. There have been no waivers to any of the Code’s provisions 
nor have there been any amendments to the Code during 2013 or up 
until 23 February 2015. A copy of the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial 
Officers can be found on our website at www.smith-nephew.com. 
In addition every individual in the finance function certifies to the 
Chief Financial Officer that they have complied with the Finance Code 
of Conduct. 
Evaluation of Effectiveness of the Audit Committee
The effectiveness of the Audit Committee was evaluated as part of 
the review into the effectiveness of the Board conducted at the end of 
2014. The results of this review are described on pages 66 to 67 of this 
Annual Report.

Remuneration report
Remuneration
Our remuneration arrangements have essentially remained unchanged 
from last year and we will therefore not be asking shareholders to vote 
on a new remuneration policy. We have however chosen to replicate 
the policy you approved last year following the annual report on 
remuneration for ease of reference. 
During the year, Richard De Schutter and Pamela Kirby ceased to be 
members of the Remuneration Committee on their retirement from 
the Board. We value the contribution they each made to the work of 
the Committee during the years they served and thank them both for 
their work.
We welcome the opportunity we have had during the year to meet with 
our investors to discuss our remuneration arrangements and we thank 
the shareholders who met with us for their valuable contributions and 
insights into the way we think about remuneration. We were delighted 
to have received the ICSA Excellence in Governance Award for “Best 
Remuneration Report” in FTSE 100 in 2014.
Yours sincerely,
Joseph Papa 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder ,
The Board focuses on the long-term future of the Company. We 
are delivering on our strategy to rebalance Smith & Nephew by 
strengthening our higher growth platforms, which now represent more 
than half the business, up from just 35% in 2011. In 2014, we undertook 
a number of important actions to accelerate this transformation:
– We drove a much improved performance in US Hip and Knee 
Implants, and maintained our momentum in Sports Medicine Joint 
Repair and Trauma & Extremities.
– We strengthened our higher growth platforms, acquiring ArthroCare 
to give us a broader sports medicine portfolio. 
– We created new growth platforms, the mid-tier portfolio for  
Emerging markets, and Syncera, as well as delivering double-digit 
growth from our recent acquisition Advanced Wound Bioactives. 
The role of the Remuneration Committee is to design a remuneration 
strategy that drives performance aligned to the strategic priorities.
Our performance in 2014 reflected the choices we made to continue 
investing to transform Smith & Nephew and, as a result, the Group 
enters 2015 stronger, more efficient, and set for higher growth. 
However, these choices did impact profit and cash performance in 
2014 and consequently performance against the financial measures in 
the Annual Incentive Plan and the resulting payouts under this plan are 
accordingly lower than in previous years. The Remuneration Committee 
recognises that the Executive Directors made the right decisions for the 
long-term future of the Company and for the benefit of shareholders, 
and performed well against their business objectives.
In devising our remuneration arrangements, we aim to have a clear 
line of sight between the performance of the Company and how our 
Directors and senior executives are paid. We do this by setting the 
fixed elements of pay, notably base salary and benefits, in line with 
what our Executive Directors would be paid at another company of a 
comparable size, complexity and geographical spread. For the variable 
elements of pay, we select performance measures that are linked to 
one or more of our Strategic Priorities as detailed on page 13 of the 
Annual Report. These performance measures are summarised on the 
following page.

Compliance statement
We have prepared this Directors’ remuneration report (the ‘Report’) in accordance with The Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2012-2013 (clauses 81-84) and The Large and 
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the ‘Regulations’). The Report also meets the relevant requirements of the 
Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) Listing Rules.
The first part of the Report (pages 83 to 93) is the annual report on remuneration (the ‘Implementation Report’). The Implementation Report will be put to shareholders for approval 
as an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting on 9 April 2015. The Implementation Report explains how the remuneration policy was implemented during 2014 and also how 
it is currently being implemented in 2015. Pages 85, and 88 to 90 have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP .
The second part of the Report (pages 94 to 102) is the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report (the ‘Policy Report’) which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting held in 2014. The Policy Report describes our remuneration policy as it relates to the Directors of the Company. All payments we make to any Director of the Company 
will be in accordance with this remuneration policy. We intend that this remuneration policy will remain in place unchanged for at least the next two years and will next be put to 
shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2017 . We will bring the policy report back to shareholders earlier in the event that we make any material change to the 
remuneration policy or shareholders do not approve the annual report on remuneration. The level of base salary and benefits paid and performance measures shown in the Policy 
Report are as at 2014, when the Policy Report was approved by shareholders. Full details of any changes to these details since then, in accordance with the Policy Report are given 
in the Implementation Report.

International Markets, innovation, organic growth and acquisitions in order to continue to grow in 
the future. Cash flow is therefore important and this in turn is derived from increased revenues and 
healthy trading profits.
Business objectives in Annual Incentive Plans
Business process We need to release resources from the businesses through improved structures, efficiencies 
and business processes in order to re-invest in our higher growth areas, including Emerging & 
International Markets, innovation, organic growth and acquisitions. 
People We need to attract and retain the right people to achieve our strategy through improving our 
operating model. 
Customer Our mission is to deliver advanced medical technologies that help healthcare professionals, our 
customers, improve the quality of life of their patients. 
Performance measures in our Performance Share Plan
Free Cash flow Cash flow from our Established Markets is necessary in order to fund growth in Emerging &

Four written resolutions were approved during the year relating to the approval of two leaver and two recruitment arrangements for 
Executive Officers.
Since the year end, we have also reviewed the financial results for 2014 against the targets under the short-term and long-term incentive 
arrangements jointly with the Audit Committee, and have agreed the targets for the short-term and long-term incentive plans for 2015. We 
have also approved increases to the salaries of Executive Directors and Executive Officers and determined cash payments under the Annual 
Incentive Plan, awards under the Equity Incentive Programme and the Performance Share Programme, and the vesting of awards under the 
Performance Share Programme granted in 2012. Finally, we approved the wording of this Directors’ remuneration report.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received information and advice from Towers Watson, an independent executive 
remuneration consultancy firm appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 2011 following a full tender process. They provided advice on 
market trends and remuneration issues in general, attended Remuneration Committee meetings, assisted in the review of the Directors’ 
remuneration report and in determining the third performance measure for the Performance Share Programme. The fees paid to Towers 
Watson for Remuneration Committee advice during 2014, charged on a time and expense basis was £39,745 in total. Towers Watson also 
provided other human resources and compensation advice to the Company for the level below the Board. Towers Watson comply with the 
Code of Conduct in relation to Executive Remuneration Consulting in the United Kingdom and the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that 
their advice is objective and independent.
Activities of the Remuneration Committee in 2014 and since the year end
In 2014, we held four physical meetings and determined four matters by written resolution. Each meeting was attended by all members of the 
Committee. The Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer and the Senior Vice President, Global Reward, key members of the 
finance function and the Company Secretary also attended all or part of some of the meetings, except when their own remuneration was being 
discussed. We also met with the independent Remuneration Consultants, Towers Watson without management present. Our programme of work 
in 2014 was as follows:
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 84 Base salary
With effect from 1 April in each year, Executive Directors were paid the 
following base salaries:
2013 2014
Olivier Bohuon €1,081,500 €1,111,782
Julie Brown £500,000 £514,000
In February 2015, we reviewed the base salaries of the Executive 
Directors, having considered general economic conditions and average 
salary increases across the rest of the Group, which have averaged 
at 3%. The Remuneration Committee has therefore agreed that the 
Executive Directors’ base salaries will increase by 3% with effect from 
1 April 2015 to the following:
Olivier Bohuon €1,145,135
Julie Brown £529,420
Payment in lieu of pension
In 2014, both Olivier Bohuon and Julie Brown received a salary 
supplement of 30% of their basic salary to apply towards their 
retirement savings, in lieu of membership of one of the Company’s 
pension schemes. The same arrangement will apply in 2015.
Benefits
In 2014, both Olivier Bohuon and Julie Brown received death in service 
cover of seven times basic salary, of which four times salary is payable 
as a lump sum with the balance used to provide for any spouse and 
dependent persons. They also received health cover for themselves 
and their families, a car allowance and financial consultancy advice. 
Oliver Bohuon also received assistance with travel costs between 
London and Paris. The same arrangements will apply in 2015. The 
following table summarises the value of benefits on an element-by-
element basis in respect of 2013 and 2014.

Previous years are restated to reflect amounts not known at the date of signing of the previous 
Annual Report.
(ii)  The level of financial consultancy advice fees for Olivier Bohuon in 2014 reflects that he is  
a French national working in a global role of a company headquartered in the UK. 
These figures have been calculated as follows:
Base salary: the actual salary receivable for the year.
Payment in lieu of pension: the value of the salary supplement paid by the Company in lieu of a pension.
Benefits: the gross value of all taxable benefits (or benefits that would be taxable in the UK) received in the year. Prior years are restated to reflect 
amounts not known at the date of signing the previous annual report.
Annual Incentive Plan – cash: the value of the cash incentive payable for performance in respect of the relevant financial year.
Annual Incentive Plan – equity: the value of the equity element awarded in respect of performance in the relevant financial year, but subject to 
an ongoing performance test as described on pages 87 and 88 of this report.
Performance Share Plan: the value of shares vesting that were subject to performance over the three-year period ending on 31 December in the 
relevant financial year, based on an estimated share price of 1,053 pence per share, which was the average price of a share over the last quarter 
of 2014. 
Share Option Plan: the embedded gain of options vesting that were subject to performance over the three-year period ending on 31 December 
in the relevant financial year.
All-Employee Share Plans: the gain on the date of grant for SAYE awards (these are only subject to an employment condition and therefore the 
total value is captured in the year of grant), reflecting the 20% discount at which options are granted in the relevant financial year.
One-off awards: the total face value of shares awarded to Julie Brown on appointment in 2013 as described on page 89 of this report (these 
awards are only subject to an employment condition and therefore the total value is captured in the year of award).
Total: the sum of the above elements.
The amounts for 2014 have been converted into US$ for ease of comparability using the exchange rates of £ to US$1.6464 and € to US$1.3263, and 
for the prior years using exchange rates disclosed in previous years’ accounts.

During 2014, the Annual Incentive Plan for Executive Directors was 
based on the achievement of specific financial and business objectives 
as follows:

Revenue 30%

Trading cash 10%
Business objectives 30%

The Board have considered whether it would be in the best interests 
of the Company and its shareholders to disclose the precise targets 
agreed for each of the performance measures in 2014. The targets for 
each year are set within the context of the Group’s five-year plan, which 
is updated at least annually. If we were to disclose the precise targets 
for one year of the plan, this would give information to our competitors 
about our long-term plans, which they could use to compete against 
us, for example by re-timing the launch of new products or extension 
into new growth areas. This could be detrimental to our commercial 
performance both in 2015 and going forward. The Board has concluded 
that even though the actual results for 2014 are known and published, 
it would be commercially sensitive to disclose what the precise targets 
determined at the beginning of 2014 were.  At present, the Board would 
not be in a position to declare these targets at a later date, but will keep 
this under review. 
In early 2015, the Remuneration Committee conducted an assessment 
of the Executive Directors against their 2014 financial and business 
objectives. In doing so the Remuneration Committee focused on the 
need to balance short-term growth whilst building the platform to 
deliver sustainable strong performance and greater shareholder value 
over the medium-term.
In summary, the performance of the Executive Directors against the 
targets set for 2014 was as follows:
Below  
threshold
Between  
target and  
threshold

Multiplier (+/- 10%) 
Julie Brown
Financial Objectives
Over the period, revenue was $4,617 million, trading profit was 
$1,055 million and trading cash flow $781 million. When set against the 
financial objectives for 2014, revenue performance was between target 
and threshold, while trading profit and trading cash performance was 
below threshold. 
The Committee believes, whilst some of the underperformance on 
trading profit and cash is attributable to the RENASYS hold in the US, 
the financial outturn partly reflects the impact of important strategic 
decisions to invest more in the business during 2014 to deliver 
longer-term, sustainable value. Decisions to invest in R&D, Emerging & 
International Markets, the sales force, particularly in wound, and new, 
disruptive business models in 2014 all impacted profitability for the 
year, but strengthened the platform for future growth. Trading cash flow 
was impacted as we made significant investment in instrument sets 
to support growth rebuilt our wound safety stock following flooding in 
our Hull, UK factory and increased the holdings of Advanced Wound 
Bioactives products to meet anticipated demand.
Business Objectives
Under Olivier’s strong leadership, and consistent with the strategic plan 
he initiated in 2011, the Group made significant progress in 2014. 
Olivier is delivering on his strategy to rebalance Smith & Nephew by 
strengthening our higher growth platforms, which currently represent 
more than half the business, up from just 35% three years ago. 
Advanced Wound Bioactives delivered strong double-digit growth, 
Sports Medicine Joint Repair performed well, Trauma & Extremities 
made good progress, and the Emerging & International Markets 
business increased underlying revenue by 17%. He also oversaw 
a successful turnaround in US Orthopeadic Reconstruction and 
addressed issues in Europe and AWM where we faced headwinds.
In addition to maintaining an increased level of investment in R&D and 
supporting new products, he introduced new, disruptive commercial 
models in orthopaedic reconstruction and the Emerging & International 
Markets to position Smith & Nephew to fulfil the unmet needs 
of customers. 
Finally, he continues to deliver on our strategic priority to supplement 
organic growth through acquisition. He led the acquisition of 
ArthroCare Corporation for $1.7 billion, Smith & Nephew’s largest deal 
to date. This has strengthened our Sports Medicine business and 
we will use our global presence to drive substantial new growth. He 
also oversaw the integration of our recent Emerging & International 
Markets acquisitions.
The Remuneration Committee has therefore determined that Olivier 
performed between target and maximum in 2014 with regard to his 
business objectives.
Under Julie’s stewardship we continued our disciplined approach 
to finance, applying our cash allocation framework, managing 
trading cash effectively to support investments and initiating a major 
Group optimisation programme. Led by Julie, this will realise at least 
$120 million of annual savings. This is progressing as planned, with 
early results including rationalising our global property portfolio and 
making major savings through better procurement processes. She led 
a successful private placement and has overseen an improvement in 
our corporate tax rate with further progress expected.
She is leading a finance transformation project, establishing new 
transactional systems across Europe and new Business Information 
tools, which is improving visibility and consistency of financial 
information in the business. 
The Remuneration Committee has therefore determined that Julie 
performed between target and maximum in 2014 with regard to her 
business objectives.
It is not appropriate to disclose the precise personal targets set as a 
number of the measurements continue to apply into 2015 and would 
be commercially sensitive if known by our competitors. At present, 
the Board would not be in a position to declare these targets at a later 
date, but will keep this under review. The Remuneration Committee did 
highlight a number of their achievements as follows:
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 86 Commentary on 2014 performance

the Group.

development of group-wide 
Minimum Acceptable Practices. 
Refinanced the Company through 
US Private Placement, term loans 
and revolving credit facility. 
The Remuneration Committee also considered whether to apply the 
multiplier to the annual incentive assessment of Olivier Bohuon and Julie 
Brown and agreed that no multiplier was appropriate in respect of 2014. 
In summary, as a result of the performance described above, the 
Remuneration Committee determined that the following awards be 
made under the Annual Incentive Plan in respect of performance in 2014:
Executive Director Cash Component Equity Component
% of salary Amount % of salary Amount
Olivier Bohuon 65 €718,026 55 €611,480
Julie Brown 56 £285,698 55 £282,700
As a result of the 2014 performance assessment for both Olivier 
Bohuon and Julie Brown, the first tranche of the Equity Incentive Award 
made in 2014, the second tranche of the Equity Incentive Award made 
in 2013 and the third tranche of the Equity Incentive Award made in 
2012 (to Olivier Bohuon only) will vest.
Annual Incentive Plan 2015
The Remuneration Committee has also reviewed the Annual Incentive 
Plan arrangements for 2015 and has determined that the following 
performance measures and weightings will apply to the financial and 
business objectives in 2015:
Financial objectives 70%
Revenue 30%
Trading profit 30%
Trading cash 10%
Business objectives 30%

Customer
The Board has determined that the disclosure of performance targets 
at this time is commercially sensitive. As explained on page 96, these 
targets are determined within the context of a five-year plan and the 
disclosure of these targets could give information to our competitors 
about details of our strategy which would enable them to compete 
more effectively with us to the detriment of our performance. At 
present, the Board would not be in a position to declare these targets at 
a later date, but will keep this under review. 
For the financial performance measures, ‘Target’ is set at target 
performance as approved by the Board in the Budget for 2015. 
‘Threshold’ and ‘Maximum’ are set at +/–3% from the target for revenue 
and trading profit measures and at +/– 10% for the cash flow measure.

The precise awards granted in 2015 in respect of service in 2014 will 
be announced when the awards are made and will be disclosed in the 
2015 Annual Report.
Performance Share Programme – grants
Performance share awards in 2014 were made to Executive Directors 
under the Global Share Plan 2010 to a maximum value of 190% of 
salary (95% for target performance). Performance will be measured 
over the three financial years beginning in 2014 and will vest subject 
to performance and continued employment in 2017 . 50% of the award 
will vest subject to free cash flow performance, 25% to revenue in 
Emerging & International Markets and 25% to TSR.
Free cash flow is defined as net cash inflow from operating activities, 
less capital expenditure. Free cash flow is the most appropriate 
measure of cash flow performance because it relates to cash 
generated to finance additional investments in business opportunities, 
debt repayments and distribution to shareholders. This measure 
includes significant elements of operational financial performance and 
helps to align Executive Director awards with shareholder value creation.
The 50% of the award that will be subject to free cash flow performance 
will vest as follows:
Cumulative free cash flow Award vesting as % of salary
Below $1.64bn Nil
$1.64bn 23.75%
$1.88bn 47.5%
$2.12bn or more 95%
Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between these points.
Revenue in Emerging & International Markets is defined as cumulative 
revenue over a three-year period opening 1 January 2014 from our 
Emerging & International Markets. The 25% of the award that will be 
subject to revenue in Emerging & International Market performance will 
vest as follows:
Revenue in Emerging &  
International Markets Award vesting as % of salary
Below Threshold Nil
Threshold 11.875%
Target 23.75%
Maximum or above 47.5%
It is not possible to disclose precise targets for revenue growth in 
Emerging & International Markets as this will give commercially 
sensitive information to our competitors concerning our growth plans 
in Emerging & International Markets, which they could use against 
us to launch new products and enter new markets. This would be 
detrimental to our business in Emerging & International Markets, 
which are key to our success overall. ‘Target’ is set at target cumulative 
revenues from Emerging & International Markets in the corporate plan 
approved by the Board for the three years commencing 1 January 2014. 
‘Threshold’ and ‘Maximum’ are set at +/– 15% from target. At present, 
the Board would not be in a position to declare these targets at a later 
date, but will keep this under review. 
25% of the award will vest based on the Company’s Total shareholder 
Return (TSR) performance relative to a bespoke peer group of 
companies in the medical devices sector over a three-year period 
commencing 1 January 2014 as follows:
Relative TSR ranking Award vesting as % of salary
Below median Nil
Median 11.875%
Upper quartile 47.5%
Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between these points. If the 
Company’s TSR performance is below median, none of this part of the 
award will vest.
The bespoke peer group for the 2014 awards comprises of the 
following companies: Baxter, Becton Dickinson, Boston Scientific, CR 
Bard, Coloplast, Conmed, Covidien, Edwards life Sciences, Medtronic, 
Nobel Biocare, Nuvasive, Orthofix, Stryker, St Jude Medical, Wright 
Medical and Zimmer.
The Group’s TSR performance and its performance relative to the 
comparator group is independently monitored and reported to the 
remuneration Committee by Towers Watson. TSR is calculated in 
common currency using a three-month averaging period at the start 
and end of the performance period. The Company has established 
protocols for dealing with companies that cease to be listed or merger 
and acquisition activity within the peer group.
Performance Share Programme 2015
Performance share awards will be made in 2015 to Executive Directors 
under the Global Share Plan 2010 to a maximum value of 190% of salary 
(95% for target performance). Performance will be measured over the 
three financial years commencing 1 January 2015 and will vest subject to 
performance and continued employment in 2018. Vesting will be subject 
to the same three performance measures as applies to the awards 
made in 2014 using the same definitions and same comparator group. 
50% of the award will vest subject to free cash flow performance, 25% 
to revenue in Emerging & International Markets and 25% to TSR.
The 50% of the award that will be subject to free cash flow performance 
will vest as follows:
Cumulative free cash flow Award vesting as % of salary
Below $1.58bn Nil
$1.58bn 23.75%
$1.81bn 47.5%
$2.05bn or more 95%
The free cash flow performance measure target for 2015 is lower than 
the same target in 2014, primarily due to exchange rate movement, 
as well as the continued impact of the RENASYS hold in the US and 
restructuring charges associated with the Group Optimisation Plan, 
both of which were not factored in when setting the prior year target.
Vesting of Awards made in 2012
Since the end of the year, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed 
the vesting of conditional awards made to Executive Directors under 
the Global Share Plan 2010 in 2012. Vesting of the conditional awards 
made in 2012 was subject to performance conditions based on TSR 
and cumulative free cash flow measured over a three-year period 
commencing 1 January 2012.
50% of the award was based on the Company’s TSR performance 
relative to a bespoke peer group of companies in the medical devices 
sector. Over the three-year period ending 31 December 2014, the 
Company was ranked 7th out of 17 companies in the comparator group. 
This part of the award therefore vested at 58.5%.
50% of the award was based on free cash-flow performance. Over the 
same three-year period, the adjusted cumulative cash free cash-flow 
was $1.642 billion. These adjustments include items such as Board 
approved M&A including the acquisition of Healthpoint and ArthroCare 
but do not include items such as the proceeds of the sale of the 
Gilberdyke business or the repayment of the Bioventus loan which are 
excluded from free cash. This part of the award therefore vested at 55.5%.
Overall therefore, the conditional awards made in 2012 will vest at 57% 
on 8 March 2015 as follows:

Implementation of remuneration policy in 2015
The Remuneration Committee proposes to make no changes to the way that the remuneration policy is implemented in 2015 from how it was 
implemented in 2014, other than increasing base salaries in line with salary increases across the Group, as explained on page 85 and setting new 
targets for the Annual Incentive Plan and the Performance Share Programme, as explained on page 88.

Joseph Papa, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee has met with a number of shareholders in previous years to discuss remuneration 
matters and met and held calls with the holders of around 28% of the shares in 2013. In 2014, he offered again to meet with shareholders to 
discuss remuneration matters. Very few shareholders accepted his invitation to meet, acknowledging that shareholders were broadly happy with 
our remuneration arrangements and had no concerns that they wished to discuss. He did however meet with shareholders holding around 2% 
of the share capital, who also indicated their broad support for our remuneration arrangements. Joseph Papa is always happy to meet and talk to 
shareholders who wish to discuss remuneration matters with him.

Dilution headroom
The Remuneration Committee ensures that at all times the number of new shares which may be issued under any share-based plans, including 
all-employee plans, does not exceed 10% of the Company’s issued share capital over any rolling ten-year period (of which up to 5% may be 
issued to satisfy awards under the Company’s discretionary plans). The Company monitors headroom closely when granting awards over shares 
taking into account the number of options or shares that might be expected to lapse or be forfeited before vesting or exercise. In the event that 
insufficient new shares are available, there are processes in place to purchase shares in the market to satisfy vesting awards and to net-settle 
option exercises.
Over the previous 10 years (2005 to 2014), the number of new shares issued under our share plans has been as follows:
All-employee share plans 7,991,875 (0.89% of issued share capital as at 23 February 2015)
Discretionary share plans 37 ,853,815 (4.23% of issued share capital as at 23 February 2015)

The following table and accompanying notes explain the different elements of remuneration we pay to our Executive Directors:
All figures in this policy table are as at 2014 when the Policy Report was approved by shareholders
How the component supports the short-  
and long-term strategy of the Company How the component operates
Base salary and benefits
Base salary
We are a FTSE 50 listed company, operating in over 100 countries around  
the world. Our strategy to generate cash from Established Markets in order to 
invest for growth in Emerging Markets means that we are competing for 
international talent and our base salaries therefore need to reflect what our 
Executive Directors would receive if they were to work in another international 
company of a similar size, complexity and geographical scope.
Salaries are normally reviewed annually, with any increase applying 
from 1 April.
Salary levels and increases take account of:
 – market movements within a peer group of similarly sized UK 
listed companies;
 – scope and responsibility of the position;
 – skill/experience and performance of the individual Director;
 – general economic conditions in the relevant geographic market; and
 – average increases awarded across the Company, with particular regard 
to increases in the market in which the Executive is based.
Payment in lieu of pension
In order to attract and retain Executive Directors with the capability of driving 
our corporate strategy, we need to provide market-competitive retirement 
benefits similar to the benefits they would receive if they were to work for one 
of our competitors. 
At the same time, we seek to avoid exposing the Company to defined  
benefit pension risks, and where possible will make payments in lieu of  
providing a pension.
Current Executive Directors receive an allowance in lieu of membership 
of a Company-run pension scheme.
Base salary is the only component of remuneration that is pensionable.
Benefits
In order to attract and retain Executive Directors with the capability of driving 
our corporate strategy, we need to provide a range of market-competitive 
benefits similar to the benefits they would receive if they were to work for one 
of our competitors.
It is important that our Executive Directors are free to focus on the Company’s 
business without being diverted by concerns about medical provision, risk 
benefit cover or, if required, relocation issues.
A wide range of benefits may be provided depending on the benefits 
provided for comparable roles in the location in which the Executive 
Director is based. These benefits will include, as a minimum, healthcare 
cover, life assurance, long-term disability, annual medical examinations, 
company car or car allowance. The Committee retains the discretion to 
provide additional benefits where necessary or relevant in the context of 
the Executive’s location.
Where applicable, relocation costs may be provided in line with Company’s 
relocation policy for employees, which may include removal costs, 
assistance with accommodation, living expenses for self and family and 
financial consultancy advice. In some cases such payments may be 
grossed up. 
 
 
All-employee arrangements
All-employee share plans
To enable Executive Directors to participate in all-employee share plans on 
the same basis as other employees.
ShareSave Plans are operated in the UK and 27 other countries internationally. 
In the US, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan is operated. These plans enable 
employees to save on a regular basis and then buy shares in the Company. 
Executive Directors are able to participate in such plans on a similar basis to 
other employees, depending on where they are located.
The Policy Report
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 94  
Maximum levels of payment Framework in which performance is assessed
The base salary of the Executive Directors with effect from 1 April 2014  
will be as follows:
Olivier Bohuon €1,111,782
Julie Brown £514,000
The factors noted in the previous column will be taken into consideration 
when making increases to base salary and when appointing a 
new Director.
In normal circumstances, base salary increases for Executive Directors  
will relate to the geographic market and peer group. In addition, the 
average increases for employees across the Group will be taken into 
account. The Remuneration Committee retains the right to approve higher 
increases when there is a substantial change in the scope of the Executive 
Director’s role. A full explanation will be provided in the Implementation 
Report should higher increases be approved in exceptional cases.
Performance in the prior year is one of the factors taken into account and poor 
performance is likely to lead to a zero salary increase.
Up to 30% of base salary. The level of payment in lieu of a pension paid to Executive Directors is not 
dependent on performance.
The policy is framed by the nature of the benefits that the Remuneration 
Committee is willing to provide to Executive Directors. The maximum 
amount payable will depend on the cost of providing such benefits to 
an employee in the location at which the Executive Director is based. 
shareholders should note that the cost of providing comparable benefits 
in different jurisdictions may vary widely.
As an indication, the cost of such benefits provided in 2013 was as follows:
Olivier Bohuon €80,705
Julie Brown £14,400
The maximum amount payable in benefits to an Executive Director, in 
normal circumstances, will not be significantly more than amounts paid 
in 2013 (or equivalent in local currency). The Remuneration Committee 
retains the right to pay more than this should the cost of providing the 
same underlying benefits increase or in the event of a relocation. A full 
explanation will be provided in the Implementation Report should the 
cost of benefits provided be significantly higher.
The level and cost of benefits provided to Executive Directors is not dependent 
on performance but on the package of benefits provided to comparable 
roles within the relevant location.
Executive Directors may currently invest up to £250 per month in the UK 
ShareSave Plan. The Remuneration Committee may exercise its  
discretion to increase this amount up to the maximum permitted by the 
HM Revenue & Customs. Similar limits will apply in different locations. 
The potential gains from all-employee plans are not based on performance 
but are linked to growth in the share price.

Annual incentives
Annual Incentive Plan –  Cash Incentive
To motivate and reward the achievement of specific annual financial and 
business objectives related to the Company’s strategy and sustained 
through a clawback mechanism explained more fully in the notes.
The objectives which determine the payment of the annual cash incentive and 
the level of the annual equity award are linked closely to the Group strategy.
The financial measures of revenue, trading profit and cash flow underlie  
our strategy for growth and the need to generate cash to fund future growth.
The business objectives are also linked to the Group strategy. These change 
from year to year to reflect the evolving strategy, but will typically be linked to 
the Strategic Priorities set out in this Annual Report. The Implementation 
Report each year will explain how each objective is linked to a specific 
strategic priority.
For example, a Reinvestment objective links to the priority of improving the 
efficiency of the business model and investment in higher growth segments 
and geographies and Processes and People objectives link to developing 
the right organisation.
The Annual Incentive Plan comprises a cash and an equity component, 
both based on the achievement of financial and business objectives set 
at the start of the year.
The cash component is paid in full after the end of the performance year.
At the end of the year, the Remuneration Committee determines the extent 
to which performance against these has been achieved and sets the 
award level.

Long-term incentives (awards actively being made)
Performance Share Programme
To motivate and reward longer term performance linked to the long-term 
strategy and share price of the Company.
The performance measures which determine the level of vesting of the 
Performance Share Awards are linked to our corporate strategy.
Our strategy requires the generation of cash in order to invest for growth. 
Cash flow is therefore a key performance measure in our performance 
share plan.
Growth in our Emerging & International Markets is a key part of our strategy. 
Revenue in our Emerging & International Markets is therefore included as 
one of our performance share plan measures.
If our strategy succeeds, the total return to our shareholders will also increase 
and therefore we include a relative TSR measure in our long-term share plan.
 
 
The Performance Share Programme comprises conditional share awards 
which vest after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching 
performance targets linked to the Company’s strategy.
Awards may be subject to clawback in the event of material financial 
misstatement or misconduct.
Participants will receive an additional number of shares equivalent to 
the amount of dividend payable per vested share during the relevant 
performance period.
One-off share awards
In order to implement our Group strategy, we recognise that it is not always 
possible to promote from within the Company. In the event that we recruit an 
Executive Director who is currently employed by another company, we 
recognise that we might be required to compensate that Executive Director 
for cash or share awards, they may forfeit on leaving their former employer. 
Our policy regarding such awards is detailed in the notes.
One-off share awards may be made under the provisions of Listing 
Rule 9.4.2 to facilitate the appointment of a new Executive Director. 
Such awards will be made on a case-by-case basis depending on 
the circumstances at the time to take account of amounts forfeited 
elsewhere on accepting appointment. 
 
Maximum levels of payment Framework in which performance is assessed
The total maximum payable under the Annual Incentive Plan is 215% 
of base salary (150% Cash Incentive and 65% Equity Incentive).
50% salary awarded for threshold performance.
100% salary awarded for target performance.
150% salary awarded for maximum performance.
Performance assessed against individual objectives and Group 
financial targets.
The cash and share awards are subject to malus and clawback as detailed in 
the notes following this table. 
70% of the cash component is based on financial performance measures, 
which currently include revenue, trading profit and trading cash. The 
Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adopt any financial 
performance measure that is relevant to the Company.
30% of the cash component is based on other business goals linked to the 
Company’s strategy, which could include financial and non-financial measures.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to apply a multiplier, adjusting 
the outcome up or down by 10% to reward or penalise conduct in respect of 
leadership, corporate reputation, ethics, organisational behaviours and 
representing the Company both internally and externally.
The maximum opportunity shown to the left cannot be exceeded through the 
application of the multiplier.

The Remuneration Committee will use their judgement of the individual’s 
performance in determining the level of equity award that may be awarded 
within the range of 50% to 65% of salary.
The equity component will vest in three equal tranches over a three-year 
period, provided that the annual performance conditions set at the beginning 
of each year continue to be met.
 
 
Annual awards:
47.5% of salary for threshold performance.
95% of salary for target performance.
190% of salary for maximum performance.
Currently:
 – 50% of the award vests on achievement of a three-year cumulative free 
cash-flow target
 – 25% of the award vests subject to three-year Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) 
at median performance relative to industry peers
 – 25% of the award vests subject to the achievement of revenue targets in 
Emerging & International Markets
 – These measures are described in more detail in the notes and the targets 
and performance against them will be disclosed in the Implementation 
Report if appropriate
 – The Performance Share Award will vest on the third anniversary of the date of 
grant, depending on the extent to which the performance conditions are met 
over the three-year period commencing in the year the award was made
 – The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to change the measures 
and their respective weightings to ensure continuing alignment with the 
Company’s strategy
 – The cash and share awards are subject to malus and clawback as detailed in 
the notes following this table.
Awards made prior to 2014 were subject to TSR and cash flow targets. 
Each award will be determined on a case-by-case basis. In normal 
circumstances such awards will be no more beneficial than the value 
of amounts forfeited by the Executive Director on leaving a previous 
company to join the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to apply performance 
conditions to one-off awards if appropriate. However, if it is impossible to 
replicate the vesting conditions applicable to awards granted by other 
companies, awards may be made without performance conditions.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Notes to Future policy table – Executive Directors
Changes to remuneration policy
The remuneration policy described in the future policy table – Executive 
Directors is the same remuneration policy in respect of Executive 
Directors that has been in force since the beginning of 2012. It is 
anticipated that this policy will apply at least until the Annual General 
Meeting in 2017. The only change made has been to introduce a third 
performance measure to our Performance Share Programme. 
Performance measures – Annual Incentive Plan
The performance measures which apply to the Annual Incentive Plan 
for Executive Directors comprise 70% financial measures and 30% 
business goals linked to the Company’s strategy, which could include 
financial and non-financial measures.
The financial measures may differ from year to year to provide 
continued alignment with the Company strategy. Measures to be 
used in 2014 are detailed in the Implementation Report. Each year the 
measures are chosen in order to relate to our Strategic Priorities and in 
turn to our key performance indicators, which are set out in this Annual 
report. The performance targets are set by taking into account the 
strategy of the Company and are designed to be realistic yet stretching.
The business measures will differ from year to year as the evolving 
corporate strategy means that we will wish to set Executive Directors 
different business objectives in order to meet the current corporate 
needs. The business objectives are personal to each Executive 
Director, and are tailored to reflect their role and responsibilities during 
the year. These are set at the start of the year and reflect the most 
important areas of strategic focus for the Company. The Remuneration 
Committee sets annual measurement criteria (performance targets) 
that are appropriate to motivate and measure an Executive Director’s 
performance in any one year. The factors taken into consideration 
include the three-year strategic plan, prior years’ delivered 
performance and budgeted performance. In the past, measures 
have included R&D investment, succession planning, employee 
engagement, compliance, development of product portfolio, M&A 
activity and shared services implementation.
Performance measures –  
Performance Share Programme
The performance measures which apply to the Performance Share 
Programme awards made in 2014 relate to cumulative free cash flow, 
revenue in Emerging & International Markets and Total Shareholder 
Return. We have chosen three measures which are relevant for the 
long-term success of the Company. 
The free cash flow measure is important for us in a period of 
growth, when we need to generate cash to fund both organic and 
inorganic investment.
Revenue in Emerging & International Markets is important for us when 
we are seeking to generate profitable revenue in new markets and from 
new products. 
The Total Shareholder Return measure, which compares our long-
term performance against that of our peers, seeks to align the payout 
of the Performance Share Programme with the experience of our 
shareholders. This helps Executive Directors relate to the shareholder 
experience and ensure that vesting is aligned to the out-performance 
of our sector.
The Remuneration Committee will keep these performance measures 
under review and retains the discretion to alter the measures or 
their respective weightings to ensure continuing alignment to the 
corporate strategy.
Malus and clawback
The Remuneration Committee may determine that an unvested 
award or part of an award may not vest (regardless of whether or not 
the performance conditions have been met) or may determine that any 
cash bonus, vested shares, or their equivalent value in cash be 
returned to the Company in the event that any of the following matters 
is discovered:
– A material misstatement of the Company’s financial results; or
– A material error in determining the extent to which any performance 
condition has been satisfied; or
– A significant adverse change in the financial performance of the 
Company, or a significant loss at a general level or at the division 
or function in which a participant worked; or
– Inappropriate conduct (for example reputational issues), capability 
or performance by a participant, or within a team business area or 
profit centre.
These provisions apply to share awards under the Global Share Plan 
2010 and cash amounts under the Annual Cash Incentive Plan.

Policy on recruitment arrangements
Our policy on the recruitment of Executive Directors is to pay a 
fair remuneration package for the role being undertaken and the 
experience of the Executive Director appointed. In terms of base 
salary, we will seek to pay a salary comparable, in the opinion of the 
Committee, to that which would be paid for an equivalent position 
elsewhere. The Remuneration Committee will determine a base salary 
in line with the policy and having regard to the parameters set out on in 
the future policy table. Incoming Executive Directors will be entitled to 
pension, benefit and incentive arrangements which are the same as 
provided to existing Executive Directors. On that basis, awards would 
not exceed 405% of base salary.
We recognise that in the event that we require a new Executive Director 
to relocate to take up a position with the Company, we will also pay 
relocation and related costs as described in the future policy table, 
which is in line with the relocation arrangements we operate across 
the Group.
We also recognise that in many cases, an external appointee may 
forfeit sizeable cash bonuses and share awards if they choose to 
leave their former employer and join us. The Remuneration Committee 
therefore believes that we need the ability to compensate new hires for 
incentive awards they give up on joining us. The Committee will use its 
discretion in setting any such compensation, which will be decided on 
a case-by-case basis. We will only provide compensation which is no 
more beneficial than that given up by the new appointee and we will 
seek evidence from the previous employer to confirm the full details of 
bonus or share awards being forfeited. As far as possible, we will seek 
to replicate forfeited share awards using Smith & Nephew incentive 
plans or through reliance on 9.4.2 in the Listing Rules, whilst at the 
same time aiming for simplicity. 
If we appoint an existing employee as an Executive Director of the 
Company, pre-exisiting obligations with respect to remuneration, 
such as pension, benefits and legacy share awards, will be honoured. 
Should these differ materially from current arrangements, these will be 
disclosed in the next Implementation Report. 
We will supply details via an announcement to the London Stock 
Exchange of an incoming Executive Director’s remuneration 
arrangements at the time of their appointment.
Service contracts
We employ Executive Directors on rolling service contracts with notice 
periods of up to 12 months from the Company and six months from 
the Executive Director. On termination of the contract, we may require 
the Executive Director not to work their notice period and pay them an 
amount equivalent to the base salary and payment in lieu of pension 
and benefits they would have received if they had been required to 
work their notice period. 
Under the terms of the Executive Director’s service contract, Executive 
Directors are restricted for a period of 12 months after leaving the 
employment of the Company from working for a competitor, soliciting 
orders from customers and offering employment to employees 
of Smith & Nephew. The Company retains the right to waive 
these provisions in certain circumstances. In the event that these 
provisions are waived and the former Executive Director commences 
employment earlier than at the end of the notice period, no further 
payments shall be made in respect of the portion of notice period not 
worked. Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office: 15 Adam Street, London WC2N 6LA.
99 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Policy on payment for loss of office
Our policy regarding termination payments to departing Executive 
Directors is to limit severance payments to pre-established contractual 
arrangements. In the event that the employment of an Executive 
Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined 
in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the 
Company and the Executive Director, as well as the rules of any 
incentive plans.
Under normal circumstances (excluding termination for gross 
misconduct) all leavers are entitled to receive termination payments 
in lieu of notice equal to base salary, payment in lieu of pension, and 
benefits. In some circumstances additional benefits may become 
payable to cover reimbursement of untaken holiday leave, repatriation 
and outplacement fees, legal and financial advice. 
In addition, we may also in exceptional circumstances exercise our 
discretion to pay the Executive Director a proportion of the annual cash 
incentive they would have received had they been required to work 
their notice period. Any entitlement or discretionary payment may be 
reduced in line with the Executive Director’s duty to mitigate losses, 
subject to applying our non-compete clause.
We will supply details via an announcement to the London Stock 
Exchange of a departing Executive Director’s termination arrangements 
at the time of departure.
In the case of a change of control which results in the termination of 
an Executive Director or a material alteration to their responsibilities 
or duties, within 12 months of the event, the Executive Director would 
be entitled to receive 12 months’ base salary plus payment in lieu of 
pension and benefits. In addition, the Remuneration Committee has 
discretion to pay an Executive Director in these circumstances an 
annual cash incentive. For Directors appointed prior to 1 November 
2012, an automatic annual cash incentive is payable at target.
In the event that an Executive Director leaves for reasons of ill-health, 
death, redundancy or retirement in agreement with the Company, 
then the vesting of any outstanding annual cash incentive and 
equity incentive awards will generally depend on the Remuneration 
Committee’s assessment of performance to date. Performance share 
awards will be pro-rated for the time worked during the relevant 
performance period, and will remain subject to performance over the 
full performance period.
For all other leavers, the annual cash incentive will generally be forfeited 
and outstanding equity incentive awards and performance share 
awards will lapse.
One-off awards granted on appointment will normally lapse on leaving 
except in cases of death, retirement, redundancy, or ill-health. The 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to permit such awards to vest 
in other circumstances and will be subject to satisfactorily meeting 
performance conditions if applicable.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to alter these 
provisions on a case-by-case basis following a review of 
circumstances and to ensure fairness for both shareholders and 
Executive Directors.
We will supply details via an announcement to the London Stock 
Exchange of an out-going Executive Director’s remuneration 
arrangements around the time of leaving.
Policy on shareholding requirements
The Remuneration Committee believes that one of the best ways our 
Executive Directors can have a greater alignment with shareholders 
is for them to hold a significant number of shares in the Company. 
Executive Directors are therefore expected to build up a holding of 
Smith & Nephew shares worth two-times their base salary. In order to 
reinforce this expectation, we require them to retain 50% of all shares 
vesting under the Company share plans (after tax) until this holding 
has been met recognising that differing international tax regimes affect 
the pace at which an Executive Director may fulfil the shareholding 
requirement. When calculating whether or not this requirement 
has been met, we will include ordinary shares or ADRs held by the 
Executive Director and their immediate family and the intrinsic value of 
any vested but unexercised options.
Statement of consideration of employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Company and 
differences to the Executive Director Policy
All employees across the Group including the Executive Directors 
are incentivised in a similar manner. Although the salary levels and 
maximum opportunities under bonus and share plans differ, generally 
speaking the same targets and performance conditions relating to the 
Company’s strategy apply throughout the organisation.
Executive Director base salaries will generally increase at a rate in 
line with the average salary increases awarded across the Company. 
Given the diverse geographic markets within which the Company 
operates, the Committee will generally be informed by the average 
salary increase in both the market local to the Executive and the UK, 
recognising the Company’s place of listing, and will also consider 
market data periodically.
A range of different pension arrangements operate across the Group 
depending on location and/or length of service. Executive Directors 
and Executive Officers either participate in the legacy pension 
arrangements relevant to their local market or receive a cash payment 
of 30% of salary in lieu of a pension. Senior Executives who do not 
participate in a local Company pension plan receive a cash payment 
of 20% of salary in lieu of pension. Differing amounts apply for lower 
levels within the Company.
The Company has established a benefits framework under which the 
nature of benefits varies by geography. Executive Directors participate 
in benefit arrangements similar to those applied for employees within 
the applicable location.
All employees are set objectives at the beginning of each year, which 
link through to the objectives set for the Executive Directors. Annual 
cash incentives payable to employees across the Company depend on 
the satisfactory completion of these objectives as well as performance 
against relevant Group and divisional financial targets relating to 
revenue, trading profit and trading cash, similar to the financial targets 
set for the Executive Directors.
Executive Officers and Senior Executives (72 as at 2014) participate 
in the annual Equity Incentive Programme and the Performance 
Share Programme. The maximum amounts payable are lower, but 
the performance conditions are the same as those that apply to the 
Executive Directors.
No specific consultation with employees has been undertaken relating 
to Director remuneration. However, regular employee surveys are 
conducted across the Group, which cover a wide range of issues 
relating to local employment conditions and an understanding of 
Group-wide strategic matters. As at 2014, over 4,500 employees in 32 
countries participate in one or more of our global share plans.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Notes to Future policy table – Non-executive Directors
Changes to remuneration policy
The Board has altered the policy regarding the payment of Non-
executive Directors and to the Chairman in one respect in 2013, 
by introducing the payment of a proportion of the fees in the form 
of shares. The fees paid to the Non-executive Directors and to the 
Chairman were reviewed in July 2013 and it was agreed that the basic 
fee should be increased by 5% (there having been no increase to these 
fees since August 2011) and that the increase be paid in the form of 
shares. The amount of the increase less applicable taxes was used 
to purchase shares in the market on 15 August 2013. Going forward 
any increase in the level of fees paid to a Non-executive Director will 
be paid in the form of shares until 25% of the Non-executive Director’s 
fee is paid in the form of shares. We have made this change in order 
to align the fees paid to Non-executive Directors with the experience 
of our shareholders. With the appointment of Roberto Quarta as 
Chairman of the Company with effect from the Annual General 
Meeting, we have taken the opportunity to pay 25% of his fees in the 
form of shares immediately.
Policy on recruitment arrangements
Any new Non-executive Director shall be paid in accordance with the 
current fee levels on appointment, in line with the policy set out above. 
With respect to the appointment of a new Chairman, fee levels will take 
into account market rates, the individual’s profile and experience, the 
time required to undertake the role and general business conditions. 
In addition, the Remuneration Committee retains the right to authorise 
the payment of relocation assistance or an accommodation allowance 
in the event of the appointment of a Chairman not based within the UK.
Letters of appointment
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors have letters of 
appointment which set out the terms under which they provide their 
services to the Company and are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office: 15 Adam Street, London WC2N 6LA. 
The appointment of Non-executive Directors is not subject to a notice 
period, nor is there any compensation payable on loss of office, for 
example, should they not be re-elected at an Annual General Meeting. 
The appointment of the Chairman is subject to a notice period of 
six months.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are required to acquire 
a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to one times their 
basic fee within two years of their appointment to the Board.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
This policy report sets out the remuneration policy in relation to 
Executive Directors, which has been in place since 2012. As this policy 
evolved at the end of 2011 and during 2012, we engaged actively 
with shareholders to explain our remuneration arrangements and to 
discuss their views on our proposals. At the time, Joseph Papa, the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and members of the Senior 
Executive Team met with the holders of around 30% of our shares, 
including collectively with a number of smaller engaged investors, as 
well as shareholder advisory bodies. We discussed the structure of 
our remuneration package, our policies on termination, recruitment, 
shareholding requirements and the operation of Annual Incentive 
Plan. The Directors’ remuneration report was approved by 96% of 
shareholders who voted at the Annual General Meeting in 2013 and we 
received feedback from shareholders around the time of this meeting 
that they understood and approved of our remuneration arrangements. 
Although the remuneration policy has remained essentially unchanged 
as in previous years, given the changes in remuneration reporting, 
we also conducted an engagement programme with our larger 
shareholders in 2013. Joseph Papa met with the holders of around 
20% of our shares, and with a number of shareholder advisory bodies. 
He has also been available to discuss any aspect of our remuneration 
programme with shareholders throughout the year. The shareholders 
who have engaged with us have all been supportive of our approach to 
remuneration, recognising the link between the corporate strategy and 
executive reward.

Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 102 Directors’ responsibilities for the accounts
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Group and Company 
accounts in accordance with applicable UK law and regulations. As  
a consequence of the Company’s ordinary shares being traded on the 
New York Stock Exchange (in the form of American Depositary Shares) 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation and filing of an annual 
report on Form 20-F with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The Directors are required to prepare Group accounts for each financial 
year, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union which present fairly the 
financial position of the Group and the financial performance and cash 
flows of the Group for that period. In preparing those Group accounts, 
the Directors are required to: 
 – select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
and then apply them consistently; 
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on  
the Group’s financial position and financial performance; and 
 – state that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the accounts. 
Under UK law the Directors have elected to prepare the Company 
accounts in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (UK Accounting Standards and applicable law), which are 
required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of  
the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.  
In preparing the Company accounts, the Directors are required to: 
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 – state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the accounts; and 
 – prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business. 
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the accounts. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Group and the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, in the 
case of the Group accounts, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention  
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Group’s website.  
It should be noted that information published on the internet is 
accessible in many countries with different legal requirements. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination 
of accounts may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Fair , Balanced and Understandable
As required by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors 
confirm that they consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole,  
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy. When arriving at this conclusion the 
Board was assisted by a number of processes including:
 – The Annual Report is drafted and comprehensively reviewed by 
appropriate senior management with overall co-ordination by the 
Head of Financial Reporting;
 – An extensive verification process is undertaken to ensure factual 
accuracy, with third party review by legal advisers; and
 – The final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to 
consideration by the Board.
Directors’ responsibility statement pursuant to 
disclosure and transparency Rule 4
The Directors confirm that, to the best of each person’s knowledge: 
 – the Group accounts in this report, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group taken as a whole; 
 – the Company accounts in this report, which have been prepared in 
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and 
the Companies Act 2006, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company; and 
 – the ‘Financial review and principal risks’ section and commentary 
on pages 34 to 39 contained in the accounts includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the 
financial position of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the ‘Financial review and principal risks’ section on pages 34 to 39. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described under ‘Commentary on the 
Group cash flow statement’ section set out on page 115.
In addition, the Notes to the Group accounts include the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources and its customers  
and suppliers are diversified across different geographic areas. As  
a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risk successfully despite the on-going uncertain 
economic outlook.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis for accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Management also believes that the Group has sufficient working 
capital for its present requirements.
Directors’ Report
The Directors’ Report has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Critical accounting policies 
The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted 
by the EU, the application of which often requires judgements to be 
made by management when formulating the Group’s financial position 
and results. Under IFRS, the Directors are required to adopt those 
accounting policies most appropriate to the Group’s circumstances for 
the purpose of presenting fairly the Group’s financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows.
In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often 
required in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, 
accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially 
affect the reported results or net asset position of the Group; it 
may later be determined that a different choice would have been 
more appropriate.
The Group’s significant accounting policies are set out in Notes 1 to 23 
of the Notes to the Group accounts. Of those, the policies which require 
the most use of management’s judgement are as follows:
Valuation of inventories
A feature of the Orthopaedic Reconstruction and Trauma & Extremities 
franchises (whose finished goods inventory makes up approximately 
79% of the Group total finished goods inventory) is the high level of 
product inventory required, some of which is located at customer 
premises and is available for customers’ immediate use. Complete sets 
of products, including large and small sizes, have to be made available 
in this way. These sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes 
and towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess 
of requirements. Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required 
to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation. These 
adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on 
levels of inventory compared with historical usage. This formula is 
applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a 
product group has been on the market for two years. This method of 
calculation is considered appropriate based on experience, but it does 
involve management judgements on customer demand, effectiveness 
of inventory deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old 
products and efficiency of manufacturing planning systems.
Impairment
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill, intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, a number of significant assumptions 
have to be made when preparing cash flow projections. These include 
the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for 
the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or 
products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory 
approvals. If actual results should differ or changes in expectations 
arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely 
impact operating results.
Liability provisioning
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant 
degree of estimation. Provision is made for loss contingencies when 
it is considered probable that an adverse outcome will occur and 
the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In making its 
estimates, management takes into account the advice of internal and 
external legal counsel. Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts 
updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes. 
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending 
on the outcome of court proceedings and settlement negotiations or if 
investigations bring to light new facts.
Taxation
The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. 
Although it is Group policy to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax 
authorities as promptly as possible, at any given time the Group has 
unagreed years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits. 
Significant issues may take several years to resolve. In estimating the 
probability and amount of any tax charge, management takes into 
account the views of internal and external advisers and updates the 
amount of provision whenever necessary. The ultimate tax liability may 
differ from the amount provided depending on interpretations of tax 
law, settlement negotiations or changes in legislation.
Business combinations
The group has identified “growth through acquisitions” as one of its 
Strategic Priorities. During 2014, we acquired ArthroCare Corporation; 
the determination of the balance sheet fair value acquired is 
dependent upon the understanding of the circumstances at acquisition 
and estimates of the future results of the acquired business and 
management judgement is a factor in making these determinations.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent auditor’s US reports 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting 
Firm to the Board of Directors and shareholders of 
Smith & Nephew plc
We have audited the accompanying group balance sheets of Smith & 
Nephew plc as of 31 December 2014 and 2013, and the related group 
income statements, group statements of comprehensive income, 
group cash flow statements and group statements of changes in 
shareholder’s equity for each of the three years in the period ended 
31 December 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility 
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
Auditor’s responsibility
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those 
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that 
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, 
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Smith & 
Nephew plc at 31 December 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated 
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended 31 December 2014, in conformity with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), 
Smith & Nephew plc’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
31 December 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting 
Firm to the Board of Directors and shareholders of 
Smith & Nephew plc 
We have audited Smith & Nephew plc’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of 31 December 2014, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 
framework), (the COSO criteria). Smith & Nephew plc’s management 
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial 
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control 
over financial reporting included in the accompanying ‘Evaluation of 
Internal Controls’ . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included 
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures 
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our 
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to 
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Smith & Nephew plc maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 
2014, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the group 
balance sheets of Smith & Nephew plc as of 31 December 2014 and 
2013, and the related group income statements, group statements 
of comprehensive income, group cash flow statements and group 
statements of changes in equity for each of the three years in the 
period ended 31 December 2014 of Smith & Nephew plc and our report 
dated 25 February 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Overview
Materiality Overall Group materiality of $45 million which 
represents 5% of adjusted profit before tax
Audit scope We performed an audit of the complete financial 
information of two components and audit 
procedures on specific balances for a further ten 
components.
The 12 reporting components where we performed 
audit procedures accounted for 81% of the group’s 
total assets, 64% group revenue and 85% of the 
group’s profit before tax and 86% of the group’s 
adjusted profit before tax.
Areas of focus Recognition and measurement of provisions for 
litigation reserves and contingent liabilities 
Recognition and measurement of provisions  
for taxation 
Existence and valuation of inventory 
Timing of revenue recognition and measurement of 
related reserves 
Judgements determining purchase price allocation 
on acquisitions
Our application of materiality 
We determined materiality for the group to be $45 million (2013: 
$45 million), which is calculated as 5% of adjusted profit before tax. 
We believe that profit before tax, adjusted for the items, as described 
below, provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining 
materiality and is the most relevant performance measure to the 
stakeholders of the entity. Adjustments are made to profit before tax for 
acquisition related costs of $118m and restructuring and rationalisation 
expenses of $61m as highlighted in note 2.2 of the financial 
statements, as well as acquisition-related finance costs of $7m. This 
provided a basis for identifying and assessing the risk of material 
misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further 
audit procedures. 
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment 
of the group’s overall control environment and other qualitative 
considerations, our judgement was that overall performance materiality 
(i.e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance) 
for the group should be 75% (2013: 75%) of planning materiality, namely 
$33.75 million (2013: $33.75 million). Our objective in adopting this 
approach was to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability 
that the aggregate of total undetected and uncorrected misstatements 
for the accounts as a whole did not exceed our planning materiality.
Audit work at individual components is undertaken based on a 
percentage of our total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is based on the relative size of the 
component and our view of the risk of misstatement at that component. 
In the current year the range of performance materiality allocated to 
components was $3.32m to $21.58m. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of $2.25 million (2013: 
$2.25 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our 
view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in the light  
of other relevant qualitative considerations.

Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 106
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Scope of our audit 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report. 
Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to 
the group financial statements, we selected 12 components which 
represent the principal business units within the group’s two reportable 
segments. Two of these components were subject to a full audit and 
ten were subject to a partial scope audit where the extent of audit work 
was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
outlined below and the materiality of the location’s business operations 
relative to the group. The scope of these components may not have 
included testing of all significant accounts of the location but will have 
contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the 
group. Partial scope component testing of significant risks is primarily 
focused on the inventory and revenue recognition risks as tax, litigation 
and purchase price allocation risks are audited centrally. For the 
remaining components, we performed other procedures to test or 
assess that there were no significant risks of material misstatement in 
these components in relation to the group financial statements. The 
components subject to full audit or partial scope audit procedures 
make up 81% of the group’s total assets, 64% of the group’s revenue, 
85% of the group’s profit before tax and 86% of the group’s adjusted 
profit before tax, although for countries where a partial scope audit was 
performed, not all balances that comprise these coverage percentages 
have been audited.
The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory 
Auditor or his designate visits each of the locations where the Group 
audit scope was focused at least once every two years and the most 
significant of them at least once a year. For all full scope entities, in 
addition to the location visit, the group audit team participated in 
the component team’s planning, including the component team’s 
discussion of fraud and error. The group audit team have also reviewed 
key working papers and challenged conclusions on significant risk 
areas, as identified at the scoping stage, primarily inventory and 
revenue recognition. The group audit team visited nine locations in total 
over the course of the current year audit.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
We consider that the following areas present the greatest risk of 
material misstatement in the financial statements and consequently 
have had the greatest impact on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources and the efforts of the engagement team, including the more 
senior members of the team:
Principal risk area and rationale Audit response
Recognition and measurement of provisions for litigation reserves and contingent liabilities
The development, manufacture and sale of medical devices entails 
risk of product liability claims and patent infringement issues due 
to the surgical nature of the products and the competitive nature of 
the industry. 
Determining the impact and likely outcome of any litigation matters 
requires significant judgement due to the uncertainty of the litigation 
process and the level of royalty that may be payable for infringed 
products and raises the risk that those legal provisions may 
be incorrect. 
 
The litigation reserve at 31 December 2014, included in legal and other 
provisions of $118m in note 17.1 to the financial statements, covers a 
number of open legal matters as described in detail in note 17.3 to the 
financial statements. We held discussions with in-house legal counsel 
to understand the status of litigation cases. We read legal invoices and 
corresponded directly with external legal advisors to understand the 
fact patterns of the cases. We reviewed management’s calculations of 
provisions, including their assessment of potential royalties payable 
for past sales and challenged and corroborated key assumptions.
Recognition and measurement of provisions for taxation
The tax charge of profits is determined according to complex tax laws 
and regulations. Where the effect of these tax laws and regulations is 
unclear, judgements are used in determining the liability for the tax to 
be paid.
As a multinational Company, tax audits can be ongoing in a number of 
jurisdictions at any point in time and tax returns are subject to possible 
challenge in most locations in which the Company operates. 
There can be significant judgement involved in determining the 
provision for tax liabilities. 
The details of the tax charge are included in note 5.1 to the 
financial statements. 
We involved tax specialists in the US and the UK to assist us in 
assessing and challenging the assumptions and judgements made 
by the company in their recognition and measurement of provisions 
for taxation. We tested tax calculations and challenged the company’s 
transfer pricing arrangements, tax planning activities and status and 
findings from ongoing tax audits to assess the reasonableness of the 
provisions recorded. This included an assessment of the likelihood 
that known uncertain tax positions would result in a tax liability to 
the company.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Independent auditor’s UK report continued
Principal risk area and rationale Audit response
Existence and valuation of inventory
The Company has high levels of finished goods inventory, as detailed 
in note 12 to the financial statements, some of which are located at 
customer premises to be available for immediate use.
Complete sets of products, including outsizes, have to be made 
available in this way, with these sizes used less frequently. Towards 
the end of a product’s life cycle, these inventory levels are more than is 
required and therefore excess to requirements. 
In estimating the appropriate value for inventory, management has to 
apply judgement on how much of the inventory on hand will ultimately 
be used, considering the length of product lives predicted, product 
usage and how quickly products will be phased out. 
We carried out tests of controls over routine inventory processes, 
including cycle counts and period end counts.
We independently counted or confirmed inventory levels at key 
component locations and also reviewed the results of management’s 
testing results for a sample of counts that we did not attend.
We challenged management’s judgements and assumptions used 
in determining the inventory excess and obsolescence provision 
in order to assess that their calculation represents excess and 
obsolete inventory. We understood their plans for launching new 
product lines or discontinuing product lines to assess the adequacy 
of the provision, as well as reflecting on the adequacy of prior 
year provisions.
We tested management’s calculation to eliminate intercompany 
profit held in inventory as goods are sold between group 
companies, including the recalculation and vouching of margins on a 
sample basis.
Timing of revenue recognition and measurement of related reserves
Revenue recognition is one of the key areas of audit focus, particularly 
in respect of the risk of management override and the risk of cut-off 
of revenue for sales to distributors with the need for the risks and 
rewards of ownership to have passed before revenue is recognised.
We carried out tests of controls over revenue recognition, including 
the timing of revenue recognition, as well as substantive testing, 
analytical procedures and assessing whether the revenue recognition 
policies adopted complied with IFRS as detailed in note 2.1 to the 
financial statements.
Procedures included independent confirmation with distributors, 
reviewing shipping terms for items despatched to test that the risk and 
reward of ownership had passed, cut off testing of items despatched 
close to the year end date and a review of returns and credit notes 
issued subsequent to the year end. 
We also performed detailed trend analysis by period and by major 
customer to identify unusual fluctuations.
Judgements determining purchase price allocation on acquisitions
On 27 May 2014, the Group acquired ArthroCare Corporation for 
$1.7bn.
The acquisition accounting includes the need to determine the fair 
value of the acquired assets and liabilities at the acquisition date. 
This included complex valuation considerations and required the use 
of specialists.
The most significant judgements relate to the valuation of intangible 
assets acquired, the uplift to the value of inventory and property, plant 
and equipment and the value of any provisions recorded.
We focused on this area given the significant judgements involves 
in assessing the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as this 
directly impacts the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition. 
The fair values are based on valuation techniques built, in part, on 
assumptions around the future performance of the business. We 
challenged the assumptions underpinning the valuations, assessed 
the fair value of the identified assets and liabilities, audited the 
accounting differences upon IFRS conversion and evaluated the 
adequacy of the disclosures.
We also discussed the specialist valuations with the specialists and 
read their reports, with involvement of our own specialists to conclude 
on the appropriateness of the valuation.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commentary on the Group income statement and Group statement of comprehensive income
Revenue
Group revenue increased by $266m (6% on a reported basis), from 
$4,351m in 2013 to $4,617m in 2014.
The underlying increase is 2%, after adjusting for the 5% impact 
of the acquisitions of ArthroCare and a Brazilian distributor and 1% 
attributable to the unfavourable impact of currency movements. 
Despite flat growth in the Established Markets, growth of 17% in the 
Emerging & International Markets contributed to this underlying 
increase of 2%.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold increased by $62m (6% on a reported basis) 
from $1,100m in 2013 to $1,162m in 2014. The underlying movement 
is 5% after adjusting for the net impact of 4% from the ArthroCare 
acquisition and 3% attributable to the unfavourable impact of currency 
movements. The movement in underlying costs of goods sold of 5% is 
largely attributable to the increase in underlying trading. 
During 2014, $12m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses 
(2013 – $12m) and $23m of acquisition related costs (2013 – $5m) were 
charged to cost of goods sold.
Selling, general and administrative expenses 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $261m (12% 
on a reported basis) from $2,210m in 2013 to $2,471m in 2014. The 
underlying movement is 5% after adjusting for the net impact of 7% 
from the ArthroCare acquisition. Currency movements had no impact.
The underlying increase of 5% is due to the promotion of new product 
and costs associated with the RENASYS distribution hold and HP802 
termination and the underlying increase in trading.
In 2014, administrative expenses included $62m of amortisation of 
other intangible assets (2013 – $64m), $49m of restructuring and 
rationalisation expenses (2013 – $46m), an amount of $129m relating 
to amortisation of acquisition intangibles (2013 – $88m) and $95m of 
acquisition related costs (2013 – $26m).
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenditure as a percentage of revenue 
remained broadly consistent at 5.1% in 2014 (2013 – 5.3%). Actual 
expenditure was $235m in 2014 compared to $231m in 2013. The 
Group continues to invest in innovative technologies and products to 
differentiate it from competitors.
Operating profit
Operating profit decreased by $61m to $749m from $810m in 2013. 
This comprised an increase of $6m in Advanced Surgical Devices 
and a decrease of $67m in Advanced Wound Management. 
The movement in Advanced Surgical Devices is attributable to the 
continuing pressure on margins and its investment in the Emerging 
& International Markets. Advanced Wound Management has been 
adversely impacted by the costs assocaited with the RENASYS 
distribution hold and the impairment and costs associated with the 
termination of the HP802 programme.
Net interest receivable/(payable)
Net interest payable increased by $26m, from a net $4m receivable in 
2013 to a net payable of $22m in 2014. This movement is primarily due 
to an increase in interest payable as a result of financing the ArthroCare 
acquisition. Interest receivable also decreased following the repayment 
by Bioventus LLC of their loan note in October 2014.
Other finance costs
Other finance costs in 2014 remained at $11m and principally relate to 
costs associated with the Group’s retirement benefit schemes.
Taxation
The taxation charge decreased, by $33m, to $213m from $246m in 
2013. The rate of tax was 29.9%, compared with 30.5% in 2013.
After adjusting for specific transactions that management considers 
affect the Group’s short-term profitability, restructuring and 
rationalisation expenses, amortisation of acquisition intangibles, 
acquisition related costs and legal and other items) the tax rate was 
27.7% (2013 – 29.2%).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Non-current assets
Non-current assets increased by $1,303m to $4,866m in 2014 from 
$3,563m in 2013. This is principally attributable to the following:
 – Property, plant and equipment increased by $75m from $816m in 
2013 to $891m in 2014. Depreciation of $222m was charged during 
2014, assets with a net book value of $15m were disposed of and 
$14m was impaired relating to HP802. These movements were offset 
by $298m of additions relating primarily to instruments and other 
plant & machinery and $62m of additions arising on the acquisitions 
of ArthroCare. The balance relates to unfavourable currency 
movements totalling $34m.
 – Goodwill increased by $771m from $1,256m in 2013 to $2,027m 
in 2014. Of this movement, $829m arose on the acquisition of 
ArthroCare and $15m on the acquisition in Brazil. The remaining 
balance relates to unfavourable currency movements totalling $73m.
 – Intangible assets increased by $693m from $1,054m in 2013 to 
$1,747m in 2014. Intangible assets totalling $817m and $16m arose on 
the acquisition of ArthroCare and Brazil respectively. Amortisation 
of $191m was charged during the year and assets with a net book 
value of $1m were disposed of. A total of $77m relates to the cost of 
intellectual property, distribution rights and software acquired. The 
balance relates to unfavourable currency movements totalling $25m.
 – Investment in associates of $112m in 2014 has increased from $107m 
in 2013. The loan to the associate was fully repaid in the year.
 – Deferred tax assets decreased by $68m in the year from $145m in 
2013 to $77m in 2014.
Current assets
Current assets increased by $184m to $2,440m from $2,256m in 2013. 
The movement relates to the following:
 – Inventories rose by $175m to $1,181m in 2014 from $1,006m in 2013. 
This movement is principally attributable to the acquisitions of 
ArthroCare and distributor in Brazil which increased inventory by 
$70m and $36m relating to the purchase of an advanced quantity of 
an ingredient to ensure continued supply of REGRANEX.
 – The level of trade and other receivables increased by $53m to 
$1,166m in 2014 from $1,113m in 2013. The movement primarily 
relates to the increase in underlying revenues and $54m from 
the ArthroCare acquisition offset by $75m of unfavourable 
currency movements.
 – Cash at bank has fallen by $44m to $93m from $137m in 2013.
Non-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities increased by $1,405m from $699m in 2013 to 
$2,104m in 2014. This movement relates to the following items:
 – Long-term borrowings have increased from $347m in 2013 to 
$1,666m in 2014 as a result of the $1.1bn private placements and 
$400m additional long-term facility use to fund the acquisition 
of ArthroCare.
 – The Retirement benefit obligation increased by $3m to $233m in 
2014 from $230m in 2013. 
 – Deferred tax liabilities increased by $48m in the year from $50m in 
2013 to $98m in 2014.
Current liabilities
Current liabilities increased by $89m from $1,073m in 2013 to $1,162m in 
2014. This movement is attributable to:
 – Bank overdrafts and current borrowings have decreased by $5m 
from $44m in 2013 to $39m in 2014.
 – Trade and other payables have increased by $53m to $838m in 2014 
from $785m in 2013. This increase includes $75m of trade and other 
payables arising on the acquisition of ArthroCare and distributor in 
Brazil offset by $34m of favourable currency movements.
 – Current tax payable is $218m at the end of 2014 compared to $184m 
in 2013.

Group cash flow statement 
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 114
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The main elements of the Group’s cash flow and movements in net 
debt can be summarised as follows:
Net cash inflow from operating activities
Cash generated from operations in 2014 of $961m (2013 – $1,138m, 
2012 – $1,184m) is after paying out $112m (2013 – $25m, 2012 – $3m) 
of acquisition-related costs, $60m (2013 – $54m, 2012 – $55m) of 
restructuring and rationalisation expenses and $23m (2013 – $nil, 2012 
– $22m) relating to legal and other exceptional costs.
Capital expenditure
The Group’s ongoing capital expenditure and working capital 
requirements were financed through cash flow generated by business 
operations and, where necessary, through short-term committed 
and uncommitted bank facilities. In 2014, capital expenditure on 
tangible and intangible fixed assets represented approximately 8% of 
continuing Group revenue (2013 – 8%, 2012 – 6%).
In 2014, capital expenditure amounted to $375m (2013 – $340m, 
2012 – $265m). The principal areas of investment were the placement 
of orthopaedic instruments with customers, patents and licences, plant 
and equipment and information technology.
At 31 December 2014, $34m (2013 – $41m, 2012 – $4m) of capital 
expenditure had been contracted but not provided for which will be 
funded from cash inflows.
Acquisitions and disposals
In the three-year period ended 31 December 2014, $2,428m was 
spent on acquisitions, funded from net debt and cash inflows. This 
comprised, $782m for Healthpoint acquired in December 2012, $74m 
relating to acquisitions in Turkey, Brazil and India completed in quarter 
four of 2013, $1,546m for ArthroCare acquired in May 2014 and $26m 
for the acquisition in Brazil completed in quarter one 2014.
During 2012, the Group completed the transfer of its Biologics and 
Clinical Therapies business (‘CT’) to Bioventus for total consideration  
of $367m. As part of this transaction the Group received a 49%  
interest in Bioventus with a value of $104m and subsequently invested 
a further $10m.
During 2014, the Group received repayment of the $160m loan note  
to Bioventus and $28m of accrued interest.
Proceeds of $20m have been received on the disposal of the Group’s 
manufacturing plant in Gilberdyke, UK.
Liquidity and capital resources
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it has sufficient funding and 
facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.
At 31 December 2014, the Group held $65m (2013 – $126m, 2012 
$167m) in cash net of bank overdrafts. The group had committed 
facilities available of $2,525m at 31 December 2014 of which $1,655m 
was drawn. Smith & Nephew intends to repay the amounts due within 
one year by using available cash and drawing down on the longer term 
facilities. In addition, Smith & Nephew has finance lease commitments 
of $12m.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group refinanced its 
principal banking facilities. The Group has signed a new five-year 
committed $1 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility with a 
maturity date of March 2019. In addition, the Group signed a $1.4 billion 
committed term loan facility with a maturity date of February 2016. The 
Group drew down its $1.4 billion committed term loan facility to fund the 
acquisition of ArthroCare. $1 billion of this loan was repaid during the 
year partly from private placement proceeds. 
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group received the 
entire proceeds of the $325 million private placement debt agreement 
signed in December 2013. The funds have a weighted average fixed 
rate of 3.7% and mature between 2021 and 2026. The Group also 
received $800 million of proceeds from a second private placement 
agreement signed in November 2014. The funds have a weighted 
average fixed rate of 3.1% and mature between 2019 and 2024. 
The principal variations in the Group’s borrowing requirements result 
from the timing of dividend payments, acquisitions and disposals 
of businesses, timing of capital expenditure and working capital 
fluctuations. Smith & Nephew believes that its capital expenditure 
needs and its working capital funding for 2015, as well as its other 
known or expected commitments or liabilities, can be met from its 
existing resources and facilities. The Group’s net debt increased 
from $288m at the beginning of 2013 to $1,613m at the end of 2014, 
representing an overall increase of $1,325m.
The Group’s planned future contributions are considered adequate 
to cover the current underfunded position in the Group’s defined 
benefit plans.

Group statement of changes in equity
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 116
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Basis of preparation
Smith & Nephew plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company 
incorporated in England and Wales. In these accounts, the ‘Group’ 
means the Company and all its subsidiaries. The principal activities 
of the Group are to develop, manufacture, market and sell medical 
devices in the sectors of Advanced Surgical Devices and Advanced 
Wound Management.
As required by the European Union’s IAS Regulation and the 
Companies Act 2006, the Group has prepared its accounts in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) effective as at 31 December 
2014. The Group has also prepared its accounts in accordance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) 
effective as at 31 December 2014. IFRS as adopted by the EU differs 
in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, the 
differences have no impact for the periods presented.
The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires 
management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The 
accounting policies requiring management to use significant estimates 
and assumptions are; inventories, impairment, taxation, liability 
provisions and business combinations. These are discussed under 
Critical accounting policies on page 104. Although these estimates 
are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and 
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively. 
The Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for accounting 
in preparing the annual financial statements. The Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
There have been no new accounting pronouncements impacting the 
Group in 2014.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations are effective for the Group’s annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2015, and have not been applied in preparing 
these consolidated accounts. With the exception of IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue, which the Group does not intend 
to early adopt and for which the extent of the impact is still being 
determined, none of these is expected to have a significant effect on 
the consolidated accounts of the Group.
Consolidation
The Group accounts include the accounts of Smith & Nephew plc and 
its subsidiaries for the periods during which they were members of 
the Group.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls 
an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated in the 
Group accounts from the date that the Group obtains control, and 
continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. 
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income 
and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated on 
consolidation. All subsidiaries have year ends which are co-terminus 
with the Group’s.
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the 
assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and any related components 
of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any 
retained interest in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value.
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
The Group accounts are presented in US Dollars, which is the 
Company’s functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective 
functional currencies of Group companies at exchange rates at the 
dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated to the functional currency at 
the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary items are 
not retranslated.
Foreign operations
Balance sheet items of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair 
value adjustments arising on acquisition are translated into US Dollars 
on consolidation at the exchange rates at the reporting date. Income 
statement items and the cash flows of foreign operations are translated 
at average rates as an approximation to actual transaction rates, with 
actual transaction rates used for large one off transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in Other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in ‘Other reserves’ within equity. These 
include: exchange differences on the translation at closing rates of 
exchange of non-US Dollar opening net assets; the differences arising 
between the translation of profits into US Dollars at actual (or average, 
as an approximation) and closing exchange rates; to the extent that the 
hedging relationship is effective, the difference on translation of foreign 
currency borrowings or swaps that are used to finance or hedge the 
Group’s net investments in foreign operations; and the movement in 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts used to hedge 
forecast foreign exchange cash flows.
The exchange rates used for the translation of currencies into US 
Dollars that have the most significant impact on the Group results were:
2014 2013 2012
Average rates 
Sterling 1.65 1.56 1.58

2 Business segment information
During 2014 for management purposes the Group was organised 
into two global divisions according to the nature of its products which 
represented two reportable business segments – Advanced Surgical 
Devices and Advanced Wound Management. 
As part of the Reinvestment & Group Optimisation programme 
management have created a single unified operating structure with 
a single cost base, led by a managing director in each major country 
(outside the US). The change in structure took effect on 1 January 2015 
and as such the Group will report as a single segment from this date.
The types of products and services offered by each business segment 
in 2014 are:
 – Smith & Nephew’s Advanced Surgical Devices (‘ASD’) business 
offers the following products and technologies:
 – Orthopaedic Reconstruction which includes Hip Implants, Knee 
Implants and ancillary products such as bone cement and mixing 
systems used in cemented reconstruction joint surgery
 – Trauma & Extremities consisting of internal and external devices 
used in the stabilisation of severe fractures and deformity 
correction procedures
 – Sports Medicine Joint Repair, which offers surgeons a broad array 
of instruments, technologies and implants necessary to perform 
minimally invasive surgery of the joints
 – Arthroscopy Enabling Technologies which offer healthcare 
providers a variety of technologies such as fluid management 
equipment for surgical access, high definition cameras, digital 
image capture, scopes, light sources and monitors to assist 
with visualisation inside the joints, radio frequency wands, 
electromechanical and mechanical blades, and hand instruments 
for removing damaged tissue
 – Other ASD which includes gynaecological instrumentation and the 
remaining Clinical Therapies geographies which are in the process 
of being transferred to Bioventus. 
 – Smith & Nephew’s Advanced Wound Management (‘AWM’) business 
offers a range of products:
 – Advanced Wound Care includes products for the treatment of 
acute and chronic wounds, including leg, diabetic and pressure 
ulcers, burns and post-operative wounds
 – Advanced Wound Devices consists of traditional and single-use 
Negative Pressure Wound Therapy and hydrosurgery systems
 – Advanced Wound Bioactives includes biologics and other bioactive 
technologies that provide unique approaches to debridement and 
dermal repair/regeneration.
Management monitors the operating results of its business segments 
separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. Group financing (including 
interest receivable and payable) and income taxes are managed on a 
Group basis and are not allocated to business segments. 
The following tables present revenue, profit, asset and liability 
information regarding the Group’s operating segments as they existed 
during the year. Investments in associates and loans to associates are 
segmentally allocated to Advanced Surgical Devices.
2.1 Revenue by business segment and geography
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Revenue comprises sales of products and services to third parties 
at amounts invoiced net of trade discounts and rebates, excluding 
taxes on revenue. Revenue from the sale of products is recognised 
upon transfer to the customer of the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership. This is generally when goods are delivered to 
customers. Sales of inventory located at customer premises and 
available for customers’ immediate use are recognised when 
notification is received that the product has been implanted or 
used. Appropriate provisions for returns, trade discounts and 
rebates are deducted from revenue. Rebates comprise 
retrospective volume discounts granted to certain customers on 
attainment of certain levels of purchases from the Group. These are 
accrued over the course of the arrangement based on estimates of 
the level of business expected and adjusted at the end of the 
arrangement to reflect actual volumes.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.2 Trading and operating profit by business segment
Trading profit is a trend measure which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions that 
management considers affects the Group’s short-term profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of 
trends. The Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit: 
acquisition and disposal related items including amortisation of acquisition intangibles and impairments; significant restructuring events; gains 
and losses arising from legal disputes; and significant uninsured losses. Operating profit reconciles to trading profit as follows:

3 Operating profit
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Research and development
Research expenditure is expensed as occurred. Internal development expenditure is only capitalised if the recognition criteria in IAS 38 
Intangible Assets have been satisfied. The Group considers that the regulatory, technical and market uncertainties inherent in the development 
of new products mean that in most cases development costs should not be capitalised as intangible assets until products receive approval 
from the appropriate regulatory body. 
Payments to third parties for research and development projects are accounted for based on the substance of the arrangement. If the 
arrangement represents outsourced research and development activities the payments are generally expensed except in limited 
circumstances where the respective development expenditure would be capitalised under the principles established in IAS 38. By contrast, the 
payments are capitalised if the arrangement represents consideration for the acquisition of intellectual property developed at the risk of the 
third party. 
Capitalised development expenditures are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives from product launch.
Advertising costs
Expenditure on advertising costs is expensed as incurred.

These related mainly to charges of $49m (2013 – $nil, 2012 – $nil) incurred in relation to the Group Optimisation programme announced in May 
2014. Charges of $12m (2013 – $58m, 2012 – $65m) were also incurred relating to people costs and contract termination costs associated with the 
structural and process changes announced in August 2011. 
3.5 Legal and other 
The legal and other net credit within operating profit of $2m (2013 – $nil, 2012 – $251m) relates to a settlement credit and past service gain on 
the closure of the US Pension Plan of $46m and a gain on the disposal of a UK manufacturing facility of $9m, offset by a charge of $25m relating 
to the likely costs of a distribution hold on RENASYS in the US pending new regulatory approvals, and a charge of $28m relating to the HP802 
programme which was stopped in the fourth quarter. 
In 2012, a profit on disposal of $251m was recorded relating to the disposal of our Clinical Therapies business.

Foreign exchange gains or losses recognised in the income statement arose primarily on the translation of intercompany and third party 
borrowings and amounted to a net $21m gain in 2014 (2013 – net $1m gain, 2012 – net $5m loss). These amounts were fully matched in the income 
statement by the fair value gains or losses on currency swaps (carried at fair value through profit and loss) held to manage this currency risk.
5 Taxation
ACCOUNTING POLICY
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world and records provisions for taxation liabilities and tax audits when it is 
considered probable that a tax charge will arise and the amount can be reliably estimated. Although Group policy is to submit its tax returns to 
the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, at any time the Group has un-agreed years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax 
audits. Significant issues may take many years to resolve. In estimating the probability and amount of any tax charge, management takes into 
account the views of internal and external advisers and updates the amount of the provision whenever necessary. The ultimate tax liability may 
differ from the amount provided depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations or changes in legislation.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is not recognised for: temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associates where the Group is able to 
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that this will not reverse in the foreseeable future; on the initial 
recognition of non-deductible goodwill; and on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination 
and that, at the time of the transaction, does not affect the accounting or taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. 
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis, and at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting 
date that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. It is recognised in the income statement except when it 
relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised within 
other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, when the Group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.

expenses, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and acquisition related costs. In 2012, the tax charge was increased by $82m as a consequence 
of restructuring and rationalisation expenses, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and legal provision.
The applicable tax for the year is based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax of 21.5% (2013 – 23.3%, 2012 – 24.5%). Overseas taxation is

respect of $47m (2013 – $3m) of these losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised on the remaining unused tax losses as they are not 
expected to be realised in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences in respect of investments in subsidiaries and 
associates for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is approximately $449m (2013 – $nil).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 6 Earnings per ordinary share
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in 
issue during the year, excluding shares held by the Company in the Employees’ Share Trust or as treasury shares.
Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share is a trend measure, which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific 
transactions that management considers affects the Group’s short-term profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in 
their understanding of trends. Adjusted attributable profit is the numerator used for this measure. The Group has identified the following items 
as those to be excluded when arriving at adjusted attributable profit: acquisition and disposal related items including amortisation of 
acquisition intangible assets and impairments; significant restructuring events; significant gains and losses arising from legal disputes and 
significant uninsured losses; and taxation thereon.
The calculations of the basic, diluted and adjusted earnings per ordinary share are based on the following attributable profit and numbers

7 Property, plant and equipment
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the 
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognised in profit or loss. Leased assets are depreciated over  
the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the 
lease term. Freehold land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment is 3–20 years and for 
buildings is 20–50 years. 
Assets in course of construction are not depreciated until they are available for use.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. 
Finance costs relating to the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that take longer than one year to 
complete are capitalised based on the Group weighted average borrowing costs. All other finance costs are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of assets
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing 
value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

Land and buildings includes land with a cost of $20m (2013 – $15m) that is not subject to depreciation. Assets held under finance leases with a net 
book amount of $8m (2013 – $10m) are included within land and buildings.
The impairment charge in the year relates to certain assets which related to the production of HP802, which the Group has decided not 
to continue.
Historically, capital expenditure represents the Group’s expected annual investment in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. 
This varies between 6% and 8% (2013 – 6% and 8%) of annual revenue.
Group capital expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment contracted but not provided for amounted to $27m (2013 – $20m).
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised in 2014 and 2013 was minimal.
129 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 8 Goodwill
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) that is expected to 
benefit from the acquisition. The recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually. The 
CGUs, monitored by management, are at the business segment level, Advanced Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound Management. 
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount then an impairment loss is determined to have occurred. 
Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of 
goodwill and then to the carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU.
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections. 
These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired 
businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results should differ, or changes in 
expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.

In September 2014 and 2013 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, 
including goodwill. These are updated during December, taking into account significant events that occurred between September and December.
For each CGU, the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash flow projections for five years using data 
from the Group’s budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board. These projections exclude 
any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings. The five-year period is in-line with the Group’s strategic 
planning process.
The calculation of value-in-use for the identified CGUs is most sensitive to discount and growth rates as set out below:
The discount rate reflects management’s assessment of risks specific to the assets of each CGU. The pre-tax discount rate used in the Advanced 
Surgical Devices business is 10% (2013 – 10%) and for the Advanced Wound Management business it is 11% (2013 – 10%).
In determining the growth rate used in the calculation of the value-in-use, the Group considered annual revenue growth. Projections are based 
on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements. Each year the 
projections for the previous year are compared to actual results and variances are factored into the assumptions used in the current year. Revenue 
growth rates for the five-year period for the Advanced Surgical Devices business franchises vary from 2% to 15% (2013 – 1% to 20%) and for the 
Advanced Wound Management business franchises from 4% to 19% (2013 – 2% to 22%).
Notes to the Group accounts continued
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 130
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Specific considerations and strategies taken into account in determining the sales growth and trading profit margin for each CGU are:
 – Advanced Surgical Devices – Management intends to deliver growth through continuing to focus on widening access to the customer, 
strengthening our portfolio and global presence, innovative product development and through continuing to make efficiency improvements
 – Advanced Wound Management – Management intends to develop this CGU by focusing on widening access to the customer, the higher added 
value sectors of healing chronic wounds and tissue repair using bioactives, and by continuing to improve efficiency.
Following the detailed first 5 years, management has used an unchanged size of the market and Group’s share thereof in the pre-tax cash flows 
used to calculate the terminal value of both the Advanced Surgical Devices business (2013 – increase at 3% per year) and Advanced Wound 
Management businesses (2013 – increase at 5% per year), which were considered to be the Group’s CGUs in 2014.
Management has considered the following sensitivities:
 – Growth of market and market share – Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and market share. The value-in-
use calculation shows that if the assumed long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of all of the CGUs independently 
would still be greater than their carrying values
 – Discount rate – Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation. The value-in-use 
calculation shows that for the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than its carrying value, the discount rate would have to be increased to 
28% (2013 – 33%) for the Advanced Surgical Devices business and 17% (2013 – 65%) for the Advanced Wound Management business.
9 Intangible assets
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination (including purchased patents, know-how, trademarks, licences and 
distribution rights) are initially measured at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a material business combination (referred to as 
acquisition intangibles) is the fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. All intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful economic lives. The estimated useful economic life of an intangible asset ranges between three and 20 years depending on 
its nature. Internally generated intangible assets are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Purchased computer software and certain costs of information technology projects are capitalised as intangible assets. Software that is integral 
to computer hardware is capitalised as plant and equipment.
Impairment of intangible assets
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing 
value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In carrying out impairment reviews of intangible assets a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow 
projections. These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability 
of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results should differ, or 
changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.

Group capital expenditure relating to software contracted but not provided for amounted to $7m (2013 – $21m).
The carrying values of acquisition intangibles are reviewed for impairment and it was noted that an intangible asset relating to a distribution 
agreement for a brand within our US Advanced Wound Management business had headroom which was highly sensitive to management’s 
estimate of future related earnings growth. Changes in those assumptions of either a decrease in the medium term growth rate from 4% to 1% or 
an increase in the discount rate of 1% to 11.1% would give rise to a $3 million impairment.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 10 Investments
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Investments, other than those related to associates, are initially recorded at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs on the 
trade date. The Group has an investment in an entity that holds mainly unquoted equity securities, which by their very nature have no fixed 
maturity date or coupon rate. The investment is classed as ‘available-for-sale’ and carried at fair value. The fair value of the investment is based 
on the underlying fair value of the equity securities: marketable securities are valued by reference to closing prices in the market; non-
marketable securities are estimated considering factors including the purchase price, prices of recent significant private placements of 
securities of the same issuer and estimates of liquidation value. Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income except 
where management considers that there is objective evidence of an impairment of the underlying equity securities. Objective evidence would 
include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost less any impairment loss previously recognised. 
Impairment losses are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in other reserves to profit or loss.

ACCOUNTING POLICY
Investments in associates, being those entities over which the Group has a significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint 
venture, are accounted for using the equity method, with the Group recording its share of the associate’s profit and loss and other 
comprehensive income. The Group’s share of associates profit or loss is included in one separate income statement line and is calculated after 
deduction of their respective taxes. 
At 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, the Group holds 49% of Bioventus LLC (‘Bioventus’). Bioventus is a limited liability company operating 
as a partnership. The Company’s headquarters is located in Durham, North Carolina, US. Bioventus focuses its medical product development 
around its core competencies of orthobiologic therapies and orthopaedic diagnostics from which it develops and markets clinically proven 
orthopaedic therapies and diagnostic tools, including osteoarthritis pain treatments, bone growth stimulators and ultrasound devices. Bioventus 
sells bone stimulation devices and is a provider of osteoarthritis injection therapies. The loss after taxation recognised in the income statement 
relating to Bioventus was $2m (2013 – loss after taxation $2m).
The carrying amount of this investment was reviewed for impairment as at the balance sheet date. For the purposes of impairment testing 
the recoverable amount of this investment was based on its fair value less cost to sell, estimated using discounted cash flows. The fair value 
measurement was categorised as a level 3 fair value based on the inputs and valuation technique used.
In addition to its 49% ownership interest in Bioventus, the Group held a senior secured five year loan note with Bioventus. The loan note was 
created in May 2012 with a principal amount of $160m and an annual coupon rate of LIBOR plus 5%. In October 2014, the loan note of $160 million 
plus $28m of accrued interest was repaid by Bioventus following a successful external refinancing. The Group continues to hold 49% of investor 
equity in Bioventus.

was $nil (2013 – nil). The Group’s share of loss in 2013 includes a gain of $1m from two Austrian associates. The Group disposed of the Austrian 
associates during the year ended 31 December 2013.
12 Inventories
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Finished goods and work-in-progress are valued at factory cost, including appropriate overheads, on a first-in first-out basis. Raw materials 
and bought-in finished goods are valued at purchase price. All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where lower than cost. Inventory 
acquired as part of a business acquisition is valued at selling price less costs of disposal and a profit allowance for selling efforts.
Orthopaedic instruments are generally not sold but provided to customers and distributors for use in surgery. They are recorded as inventory 
until they are deployed at which point they are transferred to plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic lives of between 
three and five years.
A feature of the orthopaedic business is the high level of product inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and is 
available for customers’ immediate use (referred to as consignment inventory). Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes, have 
to be made available in this way. These outer sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle 
are inevitably in excess of requirements. Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate 
this situation. These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on levels of inventory compared with historical or forecast 
usage. This formula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a product group has been on the market for two 
years. This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience but it involves management judgements on effectiveness 
of inventory deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old products and efficiency of manufacturing planning systems.

Reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were $317m (2013 – $354m, 2012 – $332m). The decrease in reserves of $37m in the year 
comprised releases of $29m, inventory write-offs of $4m and foreign exchange movements of $4m.
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of goods sold amounted to $1,013m (2013 – $958m, 2012 – $906m). In 
addition, $55m was recognised as an expense within cost of goods sold resulting from inventory write offs (2013 – $73m, 2012 – $84m). 
Notwithstanding inventory acquired within acquisitions, no inventory is carried at fair value less costs to sell in any year.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13 Trade and other receivables
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost, less any allowances for uncollectible amounts. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets.
The Group manages credit risk through credit limits which require authorisation commensurate with the size of the limit and which are regularly 
reviewed. Credit limit decisions are made based on available financial information and the business case. Significant receivables are regularly 
reviewed and monitored at Group level. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of 
customers and geographies. Furthermore the Group’s principal customers are backed by government and public or private medical insurance 
funding, which historically represent a lower risk of default. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each 
class of receivable. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

Management considers that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to the fair value.
The provision for bad and doubtful debts is based on specific assessments of risk and reference to past default experience. The bad debt credit 
for the year was $4m (2013 – expense $15m, 2012 – expense $16m). Amounts due from insurers in respect of the macro textured claim of $143m  
(2013 – $138m, 2012 – $137m) are included within other receivables and have been provided in full.

15.4 Liquidity risk exposures
The Board has established a set of policies to manage funding and currency risks. The Group uses derivative financial instruments only to manage 
the financial risks associated with underlying business activities and their financing.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is not able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. The Group’s policy is to ensure 
that there is sufficient funding and facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements. The Group manages and monitors liquidity risk 
through regular reporting of current cash and borrowing balances and periodic preparation and review of short and medium term cash forecasts, 
having regard to the maturities of investments and borrowing facilities.
The Group has available committed facilities of $2.5bn (2013 – $1.7bn).  The interest payable on borrowings under committed facilities is either at 
fixed or floating rates. Floating rates are typically based on the LIBOR (or other reference rate) relevant to the term and currency concerned.
The Company is subject to restrictive covenants under its principal facility agreements. These financial covenants are tested at the end of each 
half year for the 12 months ending on the last day of the testing period. As of 31 December 2014, the Company was in compliance with these 
covenants. The facilities are also subject to customary events of default, none of which are currently anticipated to occur.
The Group’s principal facilities are:

15.6 Finance leases
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as property, plant or equipment and depreciated accordingly. Minimum lease 
payments are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction in the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to 
each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the minimum lease payments are as follows:
2014 
$ million 
2013 
$ million
Within one year 3 3 
After one and within two years 3 3

Total minimum lease payments 15 18

Present value of minimum lease payments can be split out as: $2m (2013 – $2m) due within one year, $10m (2013 – $9m) due between one to five 
years and $nil (2013– $3m) due after five years.
16 Financial instruments and risk management
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast third party and 
intercompany transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income until the associated asset or liability is recognised. Amounts taken 
to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged transaction affects profit and loss. 
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset, the amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial 
carrying value of the asset.
Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are fair valued at year-end. Changes in the fair values of 
currency swaps that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in other comprehensive income against changes in 
value of the related net assets.
Interest rate derivatives transacted to fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings are accounted for as cash flow hedges and changes in the 
fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income. Amounts taken to other 
comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Any ineffectiveness on hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are recognised in the income statement within other finance income/(costs) as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained 
there until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in 
other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Notes to the Group accounts continued
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 140
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 16.1 Foreign exchange exposures
The Group operates in over 100 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure. It is Group policy 
for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional currencies.
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways. Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, 
transactional exposures arising where some or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale. The principal transactional 
exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and 
correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion of costs in Euros.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group 
uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows 
for forecast foreign currency inventory purchases for up to one year. When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are 
normally used to increase the hedge to 100% of the exposure. Cash flows relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within 12 months 
of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to enter into the determination of profit (within cost of goods sold) within a further 
12-month period. The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and Sterling. At 31 December 2014, 
the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $1.5bn (2013 – $1.6bn).
Based on the Group’s net borrowings as at 31 December 2014, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Group’s net 
borrowings would decrease by $6m (2013 – decrease by $2m) as the Group held a higher amount of foreign denominated cash than foreign 
denominated borrowings. In respect of borrowings held in a different currency to the relevant reporting entity, if the US Dollar were to weaken by 
10% against all other currencies, the Group’s borrowings would increase by $1m (2013 – increase by $4m). 
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 
2014 would have been $37m lower (2013 – $34m). Similarly, if the Euro were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the 
forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2014 would have been $26m higher (2013 – $27m). Movements in the fair value of forward 
foreign exchange contracts would be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve. 
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro against all other currencies at 31 December 2014 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the 
amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
The Group’s policy to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash 
flow hedges. The net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value  
of forward foreign exchange contracts is not significant. In addition, the movements in the fair value of other financial instruments used for hedging 
such as currency swaps for which hedge accounting is not applied, offset movements in the values of assets and liabilities and are recognised 
through the income statement. 
16.2 Interest rate exposures
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and certain currency swaps which are all at floating rates. When required the Group 
uses interest rate derivatives to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board. Interest rate derivatives are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve, with the fair value of the interest rate derivatives recorded in the balance sheet. 
The cash flows resulting from interest rate derivatives match cash flows on the underlying borrowings so that there is no net cash flow from 
movements in market interest rates on the hedged items.  
Based on the Group’s gross borrowings as at 31 December 2014, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the 
annual net interest charge would increase by $6m (2013 – $4m). A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an 
equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above.
16.3 Credit risk exposures
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with 
certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum ‘A’ rating from one of the major ratings 
agencies. The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, 
assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the 
instrument. The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk 
as the Group operates within a policy of counterparty limits designed to reduce exposure to any single counterparty.
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2014 was $49m (2013 – $29m), being the total debit fair values on forward 
foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps. The maximum credit risk exposure on cash at bank at 31 December 2014 was $93m (2013 – 
$137m). The Group’s exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries.
Credit risk on trade receivables is detailed in Note 13.

acquisition consideration (denominated in US Dollars and Brazilian Real) totalling $33m (2013 – $21m, 2012 – $8m) on which no interest was 
payable (see Note 14). There are no other significant interest bearing financial liabilities.
Floating rates on liabilities are typically based on the one or three-month LIBOR (or other reference rate) relevant to the currency concerned. The 
weighted average interest rate on floating rate borrowings as at 31 December 2014 was 1% (2013 – 1%).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 16.5 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Measurement of fair values
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial assets and liabilities 
and non-financial assets acquired in a business combination (see Note 21).
When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into 
different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable data (unobservable inputs).
The Group recognises transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change 
has occurred.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value 
hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is  
a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The fair value of forward 
foreign exchange contracts is calculated by reference to quoted market forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair 
value of currency swaps is determined by reference to quoted market spot rates. As a result, foreign forward exchange contracts and currency 
swaps are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 
As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, the fair value of derivatives is net of a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative 
counterparty default risk. The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness for derivatives designated in 
hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value.
The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The valuation model considers the present value of 
expected payment, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The expected payment is determined by considering the possible scenarios, 
which relate to the achievement of established milestones and targets, the amount to be paid under each scenario and the probability of each 
scenario. As a result, contingent consideration is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 
There were no transfers between level 1, 2 and 3 during 2014 and 2013. 
For cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and receivables, overdrafts and other short-term liabilities which have a maturity of less than 
three months the book values approximate the fair values because of their short-term nature.
Long-term borrowings are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost. As the Group’s long-term borrowings are not quoted publicly and 
as market prices are not available their fair values are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows to net present values at the current 
market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments as at the year-end.

Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 144
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17 Provisions and contingencies
ACCOUNTING POLICY
In the normal course of business the Group is involved in various legal disputes. Provision is made for loss contingencies when it is deemed 
probable that an adverse outcome will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Where the Group is the plaintiff in 
pursuing claims against third parties legal and associated expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation. In making its estimates management takes into 
account the advice of internal and external legal counsel. Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect 
developments in the disputes. The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the outcome of court proceedings or 
settlement negotiations or as new facts emerge.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. For the purpose of calculating any onerous lease provision, the Group has taken 
the discounted future lease payments, net of expected rental income. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment 
loss on the assets associated with that contract.
A provision for rationalisation is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either 
has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provided for.

The principal provisions within rationalisation provisions relate to the Group Optimisation programme (mainly severance) announced in May 2014 
and people costs associated with the structural and efficiency programme announced in August 2011.
Included within the legal and other provisions are:
 – A provision of $10m (2013 – $nil) relating to the distribution hold on RENASYS.
 – A provision of $7m (2013 – $nil) relating to the HP802 programme which was stopped in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
 – The remaining balance largely represents provisions for various patent disputes and other litigation.
All provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within three years of 31 December 2014 and none are treated as financial instruments.

17 .2 Contingencies
The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, some of which include claims for substantial damages. The outcome  
of these proceedings cannot readily be foreseen, but management believes none of them are likely to result in a material adverse effect on the 
financial position of the Group. The Group provides for outcomes that are deemed to be probable and can be reliably estimated. There is no 
assurance that losses will not exceed provisions or will not have a significant impact on the Group’s results of operations in the period in which 
they are realised.
In August 2003, the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the macrotextured versions of its OXINIUM femoral knee components. A charge 
of $154m was recorded in 2004 for anticipated expenses in connection with macrotexture claims. Most of that amount has since been applied 
to settlements of such claims, and almost all have been resolved. The aggregate cost at 31 December 2014 related to this matter is approximately 
$215m. The Group has sought recovery from its primary and excess insurers for costs of resolving the claims. The primary insurance carrier has 
paid $60m in full settlement of its policy liability. However, the excess carriers have denied coverage, citing defences relating to the wording of the 
insurance policies and other matters. In December 2004, the Group brought suit against them in the US district court for the Western District of 
Tennessee. Trial has not yet begun. An additional $22m was received during 2007 from a successful settlement with a third party.
17 .3 Legal proceedings
Product liability claims
The Group faces other claims from time to time for alleged defects in its products and has on occasion recalled or withdrawn products from 
the market. Such claims are endemic to the orthopaedic device industry. The Group maintains product liability insurance subject to limits and 
deductibles that management believes are reasonable. All policies contain exclusions and limitations, however, and there can be no assurance 
that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all claims.
In recent years, there has been heightened concern about possible adverse effects of hip implant products with metal-on-metal bearing surfaces, 
and the Group has incurred and will continue to incur expenses to defend claims in this area. As of January 2015 approximately 930 such claims 
were pending with the Group around the world, of which 539 had given rise to pending legal proceedings. Most of the pending legal proceedings 
are in the United States. Most claims relate to the Group’s Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (‘BHR’) product and the Birmingham Hip Modular Head 
(‘BHMH’) and R3 Metal Liner (‘R3ML’) components. In 2012, the Group restricted instructions for use of the BHMH and ceased offering the R3ML.  
In 2013, the Group’s US subsidiary agreed with lawyers representing metal-on-metal claimants to consolidate pre-trial proceedings (such as 
discovery) in their lawsuits in a state court in Memphis, Tennessee, and those lawsuits account for most of the US proceedings. These lawsuits are 
being vigorously defended, but outcomes are difficult to predict and defence costs can be significant. The Group takes care to monitor the clinical 
evidence relating to its metal hip implant products and ensure that its product offerings and training are designed to serve patients’ interests.
The Group has requested indemnity from its product liability insurers for most of these metal-on-metal hip implant claims. In general, the insurers 
are investigating the claims and have reserved rights under their respective policies. As noted above, there can be no assurance that insurance 
will be available or adequate to cover all claims.
Business practice investigations
Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to regulation and review by various government authorities. From time to time authorities 
undertake investigations of the Group’s activities to verify compliance. In September 2007, the SEC notified the Group that it was conducting an 
informal investigation of companies in the medical devices industry, including the Group, regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act (‘FCPA’) in connection with the sale of products in certain countries outside of the US. The US Department of Justice (‘DOJ’) 
subsequently joined the SEC’s request. 
On 6 February 2012, Smith & Nephew announced that it had reached settlement with the SEC and DOJ in connection with this matter. Smith & 
Nephew paid slightly less than $23m in fines and profit disgorgement and committed to maintain an enhanced compliance programme and 
appoint an independent monitor for at least 18 months to review and report on its compliance programme. The monitor’s final report was filed 
in late 2013, and the independent monitorship was terminated. The settlement agreements had three-year terms.  The deferred prosecution 
agreement with the DOJ expired on 6 February 2015 and the DOJ moved to dismiss a related court action against Smith & Nephew. The 
agreement with the SEC is scheduled to expire on 3 March 2015.
Intellectual property disputes
The Group is engaged, as both plaintiff and defendant, in litigation with various competitors and others over claims of patent infringement and 
other intellectual property matters. These disputes are being heard in courts in the US and other jurisdictions and also before agencies that 
examine patents. Outcomes are rarely certain and costs are often significant.
The Group has won a jury verdict in the US district court for Oregon against Arthrex Inc. for infringement of the Group’s patents relating to suture 
anchors. A number of issues have been disputed and appealed since the case was first filed in 2003; Arthrex’s latest appeal was argued in 
January 2015. Arthrex asserted other patents against the Group in 2014 in the US district court for the Eastern District of Texas.
Other matters
In April 2009, the Group was served with a subpoena by the US Department of Justice in Massachusetts requiring the production of documents 
from 1995 to 2009 associated with the marketing and sale of the Group’s EXOGEN bone growth stimulator. Similar subpoenas have been served 
on a number of competitors in the bone growth stimulator market. Around the same time a qui tam or ‘whistle-blower’ complaint concerning 
the industry’s sales and marketing of those products, originally filed in 2005 against the primary manufacturers of bone growth stimulation 
products (including Smith & Nephew), was unsealed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts. A motion to dismiss that complaint was denied in 
December 2010.
Notes to the Group accounts continued
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 146
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group is subject to country of origin requirements under the US Buy American and Trade Agreements Acts with regard to sales to certain 
US government customers. In 2008 the Group voluntarily disclosed to the US Veterans Administration and the US Department of Defense that a 
small percentage of the products sold to the US government may have originated from countries that are not eligible for such sales except with 
government consent. In December 2008, three months after Smith & Nephew’s initial voluntary disclosure, a whistle-blower suit was filed in 
the US district court for the Western District of Tennessee alleging these violations. Smith & Nephew’s motion to dismiss the suit was denied in 
November 2010, and it was settled in 2014.
In January 2014, before agreeing to be acquired by the Group, ArthroCare announced a settlement of charges by the US DOJ relating to securities 
fraud in which certain members of prior management were implicated. ArthroCare paid a $30m fine and signed a deferred prosecution 
agreement that imposes reporting, compliance and other requirements on ArthroCare for a two-year term.
18 Retirement benefit obligations
ACCOUNTING POLICY
The Group’s major pension plans are of the defined benefit type. A defined benefit pension plan defines an amount of pension benefit that an 
employee will receive on retirement, which is dependent on various factors such as age, years of service and final salary. The Group’s 
obligation is calculated separately for each plan by discounting the estimated future benefit that employees have earned in return for their 
service in the current and prior periods. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted to arrive at the net liability.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is performed annually by external actuaries using the projected unit credit method.  
Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on the plan assets net of the costs  
of managing the plan assets. The Group recognises these immediately in other comprehensive income (‘OCI’) and all other expenses, such as 
service cost, net interest cost, administration costs and taxes, are recognised in the income statement.
A number of key assumptions are made when calculating the fair value of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans. These assumptions 
impact the balance sheet asset and liabilities, operating profit and finance income/costs. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, 
the rate of inflation and mortality assumptions to be applied to future pension plan liabilities. The discount rate is based on the yield at the 
reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of AA, denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid and have  
a maturity profile approximately the same as the Group’s obligations. In determining these assumptions management take into account the 
advice of professional external actuaries and benchmarks its assumptions against external data.
The Group determines the net interest expense/(income) on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) for the period by applying the discount rate 
used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability/(asset).
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and 
employees pay fixed contributions to a third party financial provider. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have 
been paid. Contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.

The Group sponsors pension plans for its employees in 16 countries and these are established under the laws of the relevant country. Funded 
plans are funded by the payment of contributions and the assets are held by separate trust funds or insurance companies. In countries where 
there is no Company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered by management to be adequate. Employees’ retirement benefits 
are the subject of regular management review. The Group’s defined benefit plans provide employees with an entitlement to retirement benefits 
varying between 1.3% and 66.7% of final salary on attainment of retirement rage. The level of entitlement is dependent on the year of service 
of the employee.
The Group’s two major defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and US. Both these plans were closed to new employees in 2003 and defined 
contribution plans are offered to new joiners. The US Plan was closed to future accrual in March 2014.
147 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 18 Retirement benefit obligations continued
The UK Plan operates under trust law and responsibility for its governance lies with a Board of Trustees. This Board is composed of representatives 
of the Group, plan participants and an independent trustee who act on behalf of members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and 
Rules and relevant legislation. The UK Plan’s assets are held by the trust. Annual increases on benefits in payment are dependent on inflation. The 
main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the UK Plan are future inflation levels (including the impact of inflation on future 
salary increase) and the actual longevity of the membership.
The US Plan is governed by a US Pension Committee which is composed of both plan participants and representatives of the Group. In the US, the 
Pension Protection Act (2006) established both a minimum required contribution and a maximum deductible contribution. Failure to contribute at 
least the minimum required amount will subject the Company to significant penalties and contributions in excess of the maximum deductible have 
negative tax consequences. The minimum funding requirement is intended to fully fund the present value of accrued benefits over seven years.

No plans invest directly in property occupied by the Group or in financial securities issued by the Group.
The US and UK plan assets are invested in a diversified range of industries across a broad range of geographies. These assets include liability 
matching assets and annuity policies purchased by the trustees of each plan, which aim to match the benefits to be paid to certain members from 
the plan and therefore remove the investment, inflation and demographic risks in relation to those liabilities. 
In December 2014, the low risk asset portfolio held by the UK Plan was transferred into liability driven investments (LDI) in order to maintain the 
same level of hedging against interest rate and inflation risks.
The UK Plan also has an insurance contract with Rothesay Life covering a subset of the UK Plan pensioner liabilities. The terms of this policy define 
that the contract value exactly matches the amount and timing of the pensioner obligations covered by the contract. In accordance with IAS19R 
Employee Benefits, the fair value of the insurance contract is deemed to be the present value of the related obligations which is discounted at the 
AA corporate bond rate.

18.4 Expenses recognised in the income statement
The total expense relating to retirement benefits recognised for the year is $17m (2013 – $72m, 2012 – $72m). Of this cost recognised for the year, 
$32m (2013 – $32m, 2012 – $32m) relates to defined contributions and $15m net income (2013 – $40m expense, 2012 – $40m expense) relates to 
defined benefit plans.
The cost charged in respect of the Group’s defined contribution plans represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans. These were charged to operating profit in selling, general and administrative expenses. There were $nil 
outstanding payments as at 31 December 2014 due to be paid over to the plans (2013 – $nil, 2012 – $nil).
Included in the $15m net income recognised for defined benefits plans are a $35m past service cost credit which arose on the closure of the US 
plan to future accrual in March 2014 and a $11m gain on settlement of benefits as a result of a member buyout in December 2014.
Defined benefit plan costs comprise service cost which is charged to operating profit in selling, general and administrative expenses and net 
interest cost and administration costs and taxes which are reported as other finance costs.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Actuarial assumptions regarding future mortality are based on mortality tables. The UK uses the S1NA with projections in line with the CMI 2011 
table and the US uses the RP2000 table with scale AA. The current longevities underlying the values of the obligations in the defined benefit plans 
are as follows:
2014

2012

Life expectancy at age 60
UK Plan:

Females 28.5 25.5 25.0
Life expectancy at age 60 in 20 years’ time
UK Plan:

Females 33.3 33.2 31.9
US Plan:
Males 27.8 23.8 24.6
Females 30.2 25.5 25.0
18.6 Sensitivity analysis
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions used. The following table summarises the increase/decrease on 
the UK and US defined benefit obligation and pension costs as a result of reasonably possible changes in some of the assumptions while holding 
all other assumptions consistent. The sensitivity to the inflation assumption change includes corresponding changes to the future salary increases 
and future pension increase assumptions. The analysis does not take into account the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan.
Changes to the inflation assumption will not have any affect on the US Pension plan as it was closed to future accrual in 2014.

18.7 Risk
The pension plans expose the Group to the following risks:
Interest rate risk Volatility in financial markets can change the calculations of the obligation dramatically as the calculation of 
the obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds. A decrease in the bond yield will increase the 
measure of plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by increases in the value of matching plan assets 
such as bonds and insurance contracts.
In the UK, the liability matching portfolio held in conventional and index-linked gilts was transferred into liability 
driven investments in order to reduce interest rate risk.
Inflation risk The UK Plan is linked to inflation. A high rate of inflation will lead to a higher liability. This risk is managed by 
holding inflation-linked bonds and an inflation-linked insurance contract in respect of some of the obligation.
In the UK, the liability matching portfolio held in conventional and index-linked gilts was transferred into liability 
driven investments in order to reduce inflation risk.
The US Plan has been closed to future accrual which eliminates the exposure to this risk.
Investment risk If the return on plan assets is below the discount rate, all else being equal, there will be an increase in the plan 
deficit.
In the UK, this risk is partially managed by a portfolio of liability matching assets and a bulk annuity, together 
with a dynamic de risking policy to switch growth assets into liability matching assets over time.
The US Plan has a dynamic de-risking policy to shift plan assets into longer term stable asset classes. The 
policy established ten pre-determined funded status levels and when each trigger point is reached, the plan 
assets are re-balanced accordingly.
Longevity risk The present value of the plans defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the 
mortality of the plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of 
plan participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
The UK Plan, in order to minimise longevity risk, entered into an insurance contract which covers a portion of 
pensioner obligations. 
Salary risk The calculation of the defined benefit obligation uses the future estimated salaries of plan participants. 
Increases in the salary of plan participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
The exposure to salary risk in the US has been eliminated with the closure of the US Plan to future accrual.
18.8 Funding
A full valuation is performed by actuaries for the Trustees of each plan to determine the level of funding required. Employer contributions rates, 
based on these full valuations, are agreed between the trustees of each plan and the Group. The assumptions used in the funding actuarial 
valuations may differ from those assumptions above. Employees are required to contribute to the plans.
UK Plan
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan was undertaken as at 30 September 2012. Valuations are performed every two years, 
however in 2014, the Trustees have agreed that they will defer the 2014 valuation for one year and it will be performed in September 2015. 
Contributions to the UK Plan in 2014 were $33m (2013 – $37m, 2012 – $39m). This included supplementary payments of $23m (2013 – $31m,  
2012 – $30m).
The Group has agreed to pay the supplementary payments each year until 2017 . The agreed supplementary contributions for 2015 are $37m. 
US Plan
Full actuarial valuations were performed annually for the US Plan with the last undertaken as at 20 September 2013 before the closure of the  
Plan to future accrual. Contributions to the US Plan were $22m (2013 – $20m, 2012 – $27m) which included supplementary payments of $20m. 
The agreed contributions for 2015 are $22m.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19 Equity
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares, net of any tax effects, are recognised as a deduction from equity.
When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any 
tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury 
share reserve. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the 
resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premium.

The deferred shares were issued in 2006 in order to comply with English Company law. They are not listed on any stock exchange and have 
extremely limited rights and effectively have no value. These rights are summarised as follows:
 – The holder shall not be entitled to participate in the profits of the Company;
 – The holder shall not have any right to participate in any distribution of the Company’s assets on a winding up or other distribution except that 
after the return of the nominal amount paid up on each share in the capital of the Company of any class other than the deferred shares and the 
distribution of a further $1,000 in respect of each such share there shall be distributed to a holder of a deferred share (for each deferred share 
held by him) an amount equal to the nominal value of the deferred share;
 – The holder shall not be entitled to receive notice, attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Company; and
 – The Company may create, allot and issue further shares or reduce or repay the whole or any part of its share capital or other capital reserves 
without obtaining the consent of the holders of the deferred shares.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Group has adequate funds to continue as a going concern and sufficient 
flexibility within the capital structure to fund the ongoing growth of the business and to take advantage of business development opportunities 
including acquisitions.
The Group determines the amount of capital taking into account changes in business risks and future cash requirements. The Group reviews its 
capital structure on an ongoing basis and uses share buy-backs, dividends and the issue of new shares to adjust the retained capital.
The Group considers the capital that it manages to be as follows:

19 .2 Treasury shares
Treasury shares represents the holding of the Company’s own shares in respect of the Smith & Nephew Employee’s Share Trust and shares 
bought back as part of the share buy-back programme. On 2 May 2013, as part of the new Capital Allocation Framework, the Group announced 
the start of a new share buy-back programme to return $300m of surplus capital to its shareholders. The programme was suspended in February 
2014 following the annoucement of the ArthroCare acquisition. Shares issued in connection with the Group’s share incentive plans are brought 
back on a quarterly basis. During 2014, a total of 4.4m ordinary shares (0.5%) had been purchased at a cost of $72m and 4.4m ordinary shares 
(0.5%) had been cancelled. The maximum number of ordinary shares held in treasury during 2014 was 26.9m (2.8%) with a nominal value of 
$5.4m. 
The Smith & Nephew 2004 Employees’ Share Trust (‘Trust’) was established to hold shares relating to the long-term incentive plans referred to in 
the ‘Directors’ Remuneration Report’. The Trust is administered by an independent professional trust company resident in Jersey and is funded 
by a loan from the Company. The cost of the Trust is charged to the income statement as it accrues. A partial dividend waiver is in place in respect 
of those shares held under the long-term incentive plans. The trust only accepts dividends in respect of nil-cost options and deferred bonus plan 
shares. The waiver represents less than 1% of the total dividends paid.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 21 Acquisitions and disposals
ACCOUNTING POLICY
The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration 
transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for 
impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if 
related to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, 
then it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
21.1 Acquisitions
Year ended 31 December 2014
Acquisition of ArthroCare
On 29 May 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of ArthroCare Corporation, an innovative medical device company with a highly 
complementary sports medicine portfolio. The purchase price was $48.25 per share, paid in cash with the fair value of the total consideration 
equalling $1,715m. The acquisition was financed through existing debt facilities and cash balances, including an existing $1 billion revolving credit 
facility and a new two-year $1.4 billion term loan facility, established in February 2014.
The acquisition is deemed to be a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The fair values shown below are 
provisional. If new information is obtained within the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, the 
acquisition accounting will be revised. The provisional estimate of the goodwill arising on the acquisition is $829m. It relates to the value of the 
additional economic benefits expected from the transaction, including synergies and the assembled workforce. The goodwill recognised is not 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The following table summarises the consideration transferred, and the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date.

Deferred tax liabilities (173)
Net assets 717 
Goodwill 829 
Consideration (net of $169m of cash acquired) 1,546
The recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are different from those disclosed previously as adjustments to provisional 
values continue to be recorded during the measurement period.  None of the adjustments posted to date are material.
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of $21m relating to professional and advisor fees. These costs have been recognised in administrative 
expenses in the income statement.
ArthroCare’s contribution to Group revenue was $207m for the year ended 31 December 2014, representing approximately seven months of 
sales. This gave rise to a pre-tax profit of $28m after amortisation of acquisition intangibles. Had ArthroCare been acquired on 1 January 2014, the 
Group’s revenues would have been $147m higher and pre-tax profit would have been $5m higher.
Acquisition of Brazilian distributor
On 17 March 2014 the Group acquired certain assets and liabilities related to the distribution business for its sports medicine, orthopaedic 
reconstruction, and trauma products in Brazil. The acquisition is deemed to be a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration was $31m and included deferred consideration of $26m and $5m in relation to 
the settlement of working capital commitments. The deferred consideration was subsequently settled during the second quarter.
Notes to the Group accounts continued
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 156
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As at the acquisition date, the estimated value of the net assets acquired was $16m, which included trade and other receivables of $12m, 
identifiable intangible assets of $16m, inventory of $4m, property, plant and equipment of $2m, trade payables of $1m, provisions of $5m, current 
tax payable of $4m and deferred tax liabilities of $8m. As a result, the provisional estimate of goodwill arising on the acquisition was $15m. This is 
attributable to the additional economic benefits expected from the acquisition, including the assembled workforce, which has been transferred as 
part of the acquisition. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
The recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been determined on a provisional basis. If new information is obtained 
within the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, the acquisition accounting will be revised. 
The contribution to revenue and attributable profit from this acquisition for the year ended 31 December 2014 was immaterial. If the acquisition 
had occurred at the beginning of the year its contribution to revenue and attributable profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 would also have 
been immaterial. 
Year ended 31 December 2013
Acquisition of Turkish distributor
On 30 September 2013, the Group acquired certain assets and liabilities in respect of a Turkish business, which distributes products related 
to orthopaedic reconstruction, trauma, sports medicine and arthroscopic technologies. 
The acquisition is deemed to be a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3.
The estimated fair value of the consideration is $63m and included $12m of contingent consideration in respect of agreed milestones and $36m 
through the settlement of working capital commitments. The accounting for acquisition was completed during 2014, with no change to the 
provisional values as at 31 December 2013.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is $12m. It is attributable to the additional economic benefits expected from the transaction, including 
the assembled workforce, which has been transferred as part of the acquisition. The goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for 
tax purposes.
The following table summarises the consideration transferred, and the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date.

Cost of acquisition 63
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of $4m, primarily related to external legal fees and due diligence costs. These costs have been 
recognised in administrative expenses in the Group’s income statement. 
In 2013, the contribution to revenue and attributable profit from the acquisition was immaterial. If the acquisition had occurred at the beginning 
of the year the contribution to revenue and attributable profit would have also been immaterial.
Other acquisitions
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group acquired a Brazilian distributor of its advanced wound management products and a 
business based in India primarily engaged in the manufacture and distribution of trauma products. These acquisitions are deemed to be business 
combinations within the scope of IFRS 3.
The aggregated total fair value of the consideration was $63m and included $2m of contingent consideration and $2m through the settlement of 
working capital commitments. The accounting for both acquisitions was completed during 2014, with no change to the provisional values as at 
31 December 2013.
As at the acquisition date, the aggregated fair value of the net assets acquired was $38 million, which included property, plant and equipment 
of $1m, inventory of $4m, trade receivables and prepayments of $3m, identifiable intangible assets of $47m, payables and accruals of $3m and 
deferred tax liabilities of $14m.
The goodwill arising on the acquisitions is $25m. This is attributable to the additional economic benefits expected from the transactions, including 
the assembled workforces, which have been transferred as part of the acquisitions. The goodwill recognised is not expected to be deductible for 
tax purposes.
In 2013, the contribution to revenue and attributable profit from these acquisitions was immaterial. If these acquisitions had occurred at the 
beginning of 2013 their contribution to revenue and attributable profit would have also been immaterial.

Year ended 31 December 2014
During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Group disposed of a manufacturing facility in the UK for cash consideration of $20 million, resulting in a  
pre-tax gain on disposal of $9 million. The 2014 revenue and profit contribution of the disposed business was immaterial. 
22 Operating leases
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Payments under operating leases are expensed in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.

23.1 Share-based payments
ACCOUNTING POLICY
The Group operates a number of equity-settled executive and employee share plans. For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value 
at the grant date is calculated using appropriate option pricing models. The grant date fair value is recognised over the vesting period as an 
expense, with a corresponding increase in retained earnings.
Employee plans
The Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan (2002) (adopted by shareholders on 3 April 2002) (the Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) plan), the Smith & 
Nephew International Sharesave Plan (2002), Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan (2002), Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan (2012) (the Save 
As You Earn (‘SAYE 2012’) plan) (adopted by shareholders on 12 April 2012), Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan (2012) (adopted by 
shareholders on 12 April 2012) and Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan (2012) (adopted by shareholders on 12 April 2012) are together termed 
the “Employee Plans” .
The SAYE and SAYE 2012 plans are available to all employees in the UK employed by participating Group companies, subject to three months’ 
service. The schemes enable employees to save up to £250 per month and give them an option to acquire shares based on the committed 
amount to be saved. The option price is not less than 80% of the average of middle market quotations of the ordinary shares on the three dealing 
days preceding the date of invitation. The Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan (2002) and Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 
(2012) are available to employees in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, 
Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland 
and the United Arab Emirates. Puerto Rico participants were eligible to receive options under the International Plans up to 2011 and were eligible to 
receive phantom options from 2013 onwards. The Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plans were available to all employees in France up to 2012. 
The International and French plans operate on a substantially similar basis to the SAYE plans. 
Employees in the US are able to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which gives them the opportunity to acquire shares, in the form 
of ADSs, at a discount of 15% (or more if the shares appreciate in value during the plan’s quarterly purchase period) to the market price, through a 
regular savings plan.
Executive plans
The Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 
US Share Plan (adopted by shareholders on 4 April 2001), the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan (adopted by shareholders on 
6 May 2004) and the Smith & Nephew Global Share Plan 2010 (adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2010) are together termed the ‘Executive Plans’.
Under the terms of the Executive Plans, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may at their discretion approve the 
grant of options to employees of the Group to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US 
Share Plan (the ‘US Plan’) and the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan are to acquire ADSs or ordinary shares. For Executive Plans 
adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average quoted price of an ordinary share for the three business days preceding the date of 
grant or the average quoted price of an ADS or ordinary share, for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on 
the date of grant if higher. For the Global Share Plan adopted in 2010 the market value is the closing price of an ordinary share or ADS on the last 
trading day prior to the grant date. With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010, the vesting of 
options granted from 2001 is subject to achievement of a performance condition. Options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share 
Plan 2010 are not subject to any performance conditions. Prior to 2008, the 2001 US Plan options became cumulatively exercisable as to 10% after 
one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years. With effect from 2008, options granted under 
the 2001 US Plan became cumulatively exercisable as to 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third 
year. The 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan was open to certain employees outside the US and the US Plan was open to certain employees 
in the US, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Global Share Plan 2010 is open to employees globally. The 2004 Plan was open to Senior 
Executives only.
The maximum term of options granted, under all plans, is 10 years from the date of grant. All share option plans are settled in shares.
From 2012 onwards Senior Executives were granted share awards instead of share options and from 2013 executives were granted conditional 
share awards instead of share options. The awards vest 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third 
year subject to continued employment. There are no performance conditions for executives. Vesting for senior executives is subject to personal 
performance levels. The market value used to calculate the number of awards is the closing price of an ordinary share on the last trading day prior 
to the grant date.

Plans during 2013 was nil (2012 – 148.7p).
Options granted under Employee Plans are valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management consider that options granted under 
these plans are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date.
For all plans the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant. The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair 
value of options granted:
Employee plans Executive plans

Risk free interest rate % (ii) 1.3 1.3 1.3 – – 1.2
Expected life in years 3.9 3.8 3.8 – – 10.0
(i) Volatility is assessed on a historic basis primarily based on past share price movements over the expected life of the options.
(ii) The risk free interest rate reflects the yields available on zero coupon government bonds over the option term and currency.

23.1 Share based payments continued 
Share-based payments – long-term incentive plans
In 2004, a share-based incentive plan was introduced for Executive Directors, Executive Officers and the next level of Senior Executives. The plan 
included a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) and a Bonus Co-Investment Plan (‘CIP’).
Vesting of the PSP awards is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the 
medical devices industry.
Under the CIP , participants could elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares. If the shares are held for 
three years and the Group’s EPSA growth targets are achieved participants receive an award of matching shares for each share purchased.
From 2009, the CIP was replaced by the Deferred Bonus Plan. This plan was designed to encourage Executives to build up and maintain a 
significant shareholding in the Company. Under the plan, up to one-third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an eligible employee was 
compulsorily deferred into shares which vested, subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years (ie one-third each 
year). No further performance conditions applied to the deferred shares.
From 2010, Performance Share awards were granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 for all Executives other than Executive Directors. Awards 
granted under both plans are combined to provide the figures below.
From 2012, Deferred Bonus Plan and GSP 2010 options for Executive Directors, Executive Officers and the next level of Senior Executives were 
replaced by Equity Incentive Awards (‘EIA’). EIA are designed to encourage Executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in 
the Company. EIA will vest, in equal annual tranches over three years (ie one-third each year), subject to continued employment and personal 
performance. No further performance conditions apply to the EIA.
The fair values of awards granted under long-term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model. Performance Share awards under 
both the PSP and Global Share Plan 2010 contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based 
performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations. 
The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups. A correlation of 40% (2013 – 40%, 2012 – 35%) has also been assumed for 
the companies in the medical devices sector as they are impacted by similar factors. The Performance Target for the Global Share Plan 2010 is 
a combination of Free Cash Flow growth, Revenue in Emerging & International Markets and the Group’s TSR performance over the three-year 
performance period.
The other assumptions used are consistent with the Executive scheme assumptions disclosed earlier in this note.
At 31 December 2014 the maximum number of shares that could be awarded under the Group’s long-term incentive plans was:

the PSP , nil years (2013 – 0.2 years, 2012 – 0.9 years) for the Deferred Bonus Plan, 1.5 years (2013 – 1.8 years) for the EIA and 2.0 years (2013 – 2.1

Company balance sheet
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 166
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Basis of preparation
Smith & Nephew plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales.
The separate accounts of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The accounts have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, modified to include revaluation to fair value of certain financial instruments as described below, and in accordance with 
applicable UK accounting standards. As consolidated financial information has been disclosed under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, 
the Company is exempt from FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. The Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and are presented on pages 110 to 165.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures not to present its related party disclosures as the Group 
accounts contain these disclosures. In addition, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements not to present 
its own cash flow statement as the Group accounts contain a consolidated cash flow.
In applying these policies management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately 
may differ from those estimates.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences are dealt with 
in arriving at profit before taxation.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are 
expected to reverse. These are based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
2 Results for the year
As permitted by Section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. Profit for the year was 
$922m (2013 – $198m).

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Business overview and Group history
Smith & Nephew’s operations are organised into two primary divisions that operate globally: Advanced Surgical Devices and Advanced 
Wound Management.
The Group has a history dating back over 150 years to the family enterprise of Thomas James Smith who opened a small pharmacy in Hull,  
UK in 1856. Following his death in 1896, his nephew Horatio Nelson Smith took over the management of the business.
By the late 1990s, Smith & Nephew had expanded into being a diverse healthcare conglomerate with operations across the globe, producing 
various medical devices, personal care products and traditional and advanced wound care treatments. In 1998, Smith & Nephew announced a 
major restructuring to focus management attention and investment on three global business units – Advanced Wound Management, Endoscopy 
and Orthopaedics – which offered high growth and margin opportunities. In 2011, the Endoscopy and Orthopaedics businesses were brought 
together to create an Advanced Surgical Devices division.
Smith & Nephew was incorporated and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1937 and in 1999 the Group was also listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange. In 2001, Smith & Nephew became a constituent member of the FTSE-100 index in the UK. This means that Smith & Nephew is included 
in the top 100 companies traded on the London Stock Exchange measured in terms of market capitalisation.
Today, Smith & Nephew is a public limited company incorporated and headquartered in the UK and carries out business around the world.

The Group Global Operations strategy includes ongoing assessment of the optimal facility footprint. The Advanced Surgical Devices 
manufacturing facilities in Memphis, Tennessee are largely freehold, a portion of Tuttlingen and the Advanced Wound Management facilities in 
Hull are freehold while other principal locations are leasehold. The Group has freehold and leasehold interests in real estate in other countries 
throughout the world, but no other is individually significant to the Group. Where required, the appropriate governmental authorities have 
approved the facilities.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
Management believes that the Group does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the SEC in item 5E of Form 20-F, that have 
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Group’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, 
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Related party transactions
Except for transactions with associates (see Note 23.2 of Notes to the Group accounts), no other related party had material transactions or loans 
with Smith & Nephew over the last three financial years.

OTHER INFORMATION Risk factors
There are known and unknown risks and uncertainties relating to 
Smith & Nephew’s business. The factors listed below could cause 
the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations to 
differ materially and adversely from expected and historical levels. In 
addition, other factors not listed here that Smith & Nephew cannot 
presently identify or does not believe to be equally significant could 
also materially adversely affect Smith & Nephew’s business, financial 
position or results of operations.
Highly competitive markets
The Group’s business segments compete across a diverse range of 
geographic and product markets. Each market in which the business 
segments operate contains a number of different competitors, 
including specialised and international corporations. Significant 
product innovations, technical advances or the intensification of 
price competition by competitors could adversely affect the Group’s 
operating results.
Some of these competitors may have greater financial, marketing and 
other resources than Smith & Nephew. These competitors may be able 
to initiate technological advances in the field, deliver products on more 
attractive terms, more aggressively market their products or invest 
larger amounts of capital and research and development (‘R&D’) into 
their businesses.
There is a possibility of further consolidation of competitors, which 
could adversely affect the Group’s ability to compete with larger 
companies due to insufficient financial resources. If any of the Group’s 
businesses were to lose market share or achieve lower than expected 
revenue growth, there could be a disproportionate adverse impact on 
the Group’s share price and its strategic options.
Competition exists among healthcare providers to gain patients on the 
basis of quality, service and price. There has been some consolidation 
in the Group’s customer base and this trend is expected to continue. 
Some customers have joined group purchasing organisations or 
introduced other cost containment measures that could lead to 
downward pressure on prices or limit the number of suppliers in certain 
business areas, which could adversely affect Smith & Nephew’s results 
of operations and hinder its growth potential.
Continual development and introduction  
of new products 
The medical devices industry has a rapid rate of new product 
introduction. In order to remain competitive, each of the Group’s 
business segments must continue to develop innovative products 
that satisfy customer needs and preferences or provide cost or 
other advantages. Developing new products is a costly, lengthy and 
uncertain process. The Group may fail to innovate due to low R&D 
investment, a R&D skills gap or poor product development. A potential 
product may not be brought to market or not succeed in the market for 
any number of reasons, including failure to work optimally, failure to 
receive regulatory approval, failure to be cost-competitive, infringement 
of patents or other intellectual property rights and changes in consumer 
demand. The Group’s products and technologies are also subject to 
marketing attack by competitors. Furthermore, new products that are 
developed and marketed by the Group’s competitors may affect price 
levels in the various markets in which the Group’s business segments 
operate. If the Group’s new products do not remain competitive with 
those of competitors, the Group’s revenue could decline.
The Group maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in 
excess of current carrying costs. Marketplace changes resulting from 
the introduction of new products or surgical procedures may cause 
some of the Group’s products to become obsolete. The Group makes 
estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these 
products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
based on historical experience, expiration of sterilisation dates and 
expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand 
or acceptance of new product introductions are less favourable than 
projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may 
be required.
Dependence on government and other funding
In most Established Markets throughout the world, expenditure 
on medical devices is ultimately controlled to a large extent by 
governments. Funds may be made available or withdrawn from 
healthcare budgets depending on government policy. The Group 
is therefore largely dependent on future governments providing 
increased funds commensurate with the increased demand arising 
from demographic trends.
Pricing of the Group’s products is largely governed in most Established 
Markets by governmental reimbursement authorities. Initiatives 
sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private 
sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, 
excise taxes and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where the 
Group has operations. This control may be exercised by determining 
prices for an individual product or for an entire procedure. The 
Group is exposed to government policies favouring locally sourced 
products. The Group is also exposed to changes in reimbursement 
policy, tax policy and pricing which may have an adverse impact on 
revenue and operating profit. In particular, changes to the healthcare 
legislation in the US have imposed significant taxes on medical device 
manufacturers from 2013. There may be an increased risk of adverse 
changes to government funding policies arising from the deterioration 
in macro-economic conditions in some of the Group’s markets.
The Group must adhere to the rules laid down by government agencies 
that fund or regulate healthcare, including extensive and complex rules 
in the US. Failure to do so could result in fines or loss of future funding.
World economic conditions
Demand for the Group’s products is driven by demographic trends, 
including the ageing population and the incidence of osteoporosis 
and obesity. Supply of, use of and payment for the Group’s products 
are also influenced by world economic conditions which could place 
increased pressure on demand and pricing, adversely impacting the 
Group’s ability to deliver revenue and margin growth. The conditions 
could favour larger, better capitalised groups, with higher market 
shares and margins. As a consequence, the Group’s prosperity 
is linked to general economic conditions and there is a risk of 
deterioration of the Group’s performance and finances during adverse 
macro economic conditions.
During 2014, economic conditions worldwide continued to create 
several challenges for the Group, including deferrals of joint 
replacement procedures, heightened pricing pressure, significant 
declines in capital equipment expenditures at hospitals and increased 
uncertainty over the collectability of European government debt, 
particularly those in certain parts of southern Europe. These factors 
tempered the overall growth of the Group’s global markets and could 
have an increased impact on growth in the future.
171 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Political uncertainties
The Group operates on a worldwide basis and has distribution 
channels, purchasing agents and buying entities in over 100 countries. 
Political upheaval in some of those countries or in surrounding regions 
may impact the Group’s results of operations. Political changes in a 
country could prevent the Group from receiving remittances of profit 
from a member of the Group located in that country or from selling 
its products or investments in that country. Furthermore, changes in 
government policy regarding preference for local suppliers, import 
quotas, taxation or other matters could adversely affect the Group’s 
revenue and operating profit. War, economic sanctions, terrorist 
activities or other conflict could also adversely impact the Group. 
These risks may be greater in emerging markets, which account for an 
increasing portion of the Group’s business.
Currency fluctuations
Smith & Nephew’s results of operations are affected by transactional 
exchange rate movements in that they are subject to exposures 
arising from revenue in a currency different from the related costs and 
expenses. The Group’s manufacturing cost base is situated principally 
in the US, the UK, China and Switzerland, from which finished products 
are exported to the Group’s selling operations worldwide. Thus, the 
Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between the US 
Dollar, Sterling and Swiss Franc and the currency of the Group’s selling 
operations, particularly the Euro, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. 
If the US Dollar, Sterling or Swiss Franc should strengthen against the 
Euro, Australian Dollar and the Japanese Yen, the Group’s trading 
margin could be adversely affected.
The Group manages the impact of exchange rate movements on 
revenue and cost of goods sold by a policy of transacting forward 
foreign currency commitments when firm purchase orders are placed. 
In addition, the Group’s policy is for forecast transactions to be covered 
between 50% and 90% for up to one year.
The Group uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency and the US 
Dollar is the functional currency of Smith & Nephew plc. The Group’s 
revenues, profits and earnings are also affected by exchange rate 
movements on the translation of results of operations in foreign 
subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes. See ‘Liquidity and capital 
resources’ on page 115.
Manufacturing and supply
The Group’s manufacturing production is concentrated at 15 main 
facilities in Austin, Memphis, Mansfield and Oklahoma City in the 
US, Hull and Warwick in the UK, Aarau in Switzerland, Tuttlingen in 
Germany, Fort Saskatchewan and Calgary in Canada, Sangameshwar 
in India, Suzhou and Beijing in China, La Aurora in Costa Rica and 
Curaçao. If major physical disruption took place at any of these sites, 
it could adversely affect the results of operations. Physical loss and 
consequential loss insurance is carried to cover such risks but is 
subject to limits and deductibles and may not be sufficient to cover 
catastrophic loss. Management of orthopaedic inventory is complex, 
particularly forecasting and production planning. There is a risk that 
failures in operational execution could lead to excess inventory or 
individual product shortages.
Each of the business segments is reliant on certain key suppliers of raw 
materials, components, finished products and packaging materials or 
in some cases on a single supplier. 
These suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities 
to the Group’s standard of quality requirements. 
Consequently, the Group may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain 
raw materials, which it may not be able to pass on to its customers in 
the form of increased prices for its finished products. In addition, some 
of the raw materials used may become unavailable, and there can be 
no assurance that the Group will be able to obtain suitable and cost 
effective substitutes. Any interruption of supply caused by these or 
other factors could negatively impact Smith & Nephew’s revenue and 
operating profit.
The Group will, from time to time, outsource the manufacture of 
components and finished products to third parties and will periodically 
relocate the manufacture of product and/or processes between 
existing facilities. While these are planned activities, with these 
transfers there is a risk of disruption to supply.
Attracting and retaining key personnel
The Group’s continued development depends on its ability to hire 
and retain highly-skilled personnel with particular expertise. This is 
critical, particularly in general management, research, new product 
development and in the sales forces. If Smith & Nephew is unable 
to retain key personnel in general management, research and new 
product development or if its largest sales forces suffer disruption or 
upheaval, its revenue and operating profit would be adversely affected. 
Additionally, if the Group is unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain  
a talented, competitive workforce, it may not be able to meet its 
strategic business objectives.
Proprietary rights and patents
Due to the technological nature of medical devices and the Group’s 
emphasis on serving its customers with innovative products, the Group 
has been subject to patent infringement claims and is subject to the 
potential for additional claims.
Claims asserted by third parties regarding infringement of their 
intellectual property rights, if successful, could require the Group 
to expend time and significant resources to pay damages, develop 
non-infringing products or obtain licences to the products which are 
the subject of such litigation, thereby affecting the Group’s growth 
and profitability. Smith & Nephew attempts to protect its intellectual 
property and regularly opposes third party patents and trademarks 
where appropriate in those areas that might conflict with the Group’s 
business interests. If Smith & Nephew fails to protect and enforce its 
intellectual property rights successfully, its competitive position could 
suffer, which could harm its results of operations.
Product liability claims and loss of reputation
The development, manufacture and sale of medical devices entail 
risk of product liability claims or recalls. Design and manufacturing 
defects with respect to products sold by the Group or by companies 
it has acquired could damage, or impair the repair of, body functions. 
The Group may become subject to liability, which could be substantial, 
because of actual or alleged defects in its products. In addition, product 
defects could lead to the need to recall from the market existing 
products, which may be costly and harmful to the Group’s reputation.
There can be no assurance that customers, particularly in the US, the 
Group’s largest geographical market, will not bring product liability or 
related claims that would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial position or results of operations in the future, or that the Group 
will be able to resolve such claims within insurance limits.

Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 172
OTHER INFORMATION Regulatory standards and compliance in the 
healthcare industry
Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to regulation 
and review by various government authorities. In general, the trend in 
many countries in which the Group does business is towards higher 
expectations and increased enforcement activity by governmental 
authorities. While the Group is committed to doing business with 
integrity and welcomes the trend to higher standards in the healthcare 
industry, the Group and other companies in the industry have been 
subject to investigations and other enforcement activity that have 
incurred and may continue to incur significant expense. See Note 17  
to the Group accounts. Under certain circumstances, if the Group were 
found to have violated the law, its ability to sell its products to certain 
customers could be restricted.
International regulation
The Group operates across the world and is subject to legislation, 
including anti-bribery and corruption and data protection, in each 
country in which we operate. Our international operations are governed 
by the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) 
which prohibit us or our agents from making, or offering, improper 
payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of 
obtaining or maintaining business or product approvals. Enforcement  
of such legislation has increased in recent years with significant fines 
and penalties being imposed on companies and individuals. Our 
international operations, particularly in the emerging markets, expose 
the Group to the risk that our employees or agents will engage in 
prohibited activities.
Regulatory approval
The international medical device industry is highly regulated. 
Regulatory requirements are a major factor in determining whether 
substances and materials can be developed into marketable products 
and the amount of time and expense that should be allotted to 
such development.
National regulatory authorities administer and enforce a complex 
series of laws and regulations that govern the design, development, 
approval, manufacture, labelling, marketing and sale of healthcare 
products. They also review data supporting the safety and efficacy  
of such products. Of particular importance is the requirement in 
many countries that products be authorised or registered prior 
to manufacture, marketing or sale and that such authorisation or 
registration be subsequently maintained. The major regulatory 
agencies for Smith & Nephew’s products include the Food and 
Drug Administration (‘FDA’) in the US, the Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory Agency in the UK, the Ministry of Health, Labour 
and Welfare in Japan, the China Food and Drug Administration and the 
Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration.  
At any time, the Group is awaiting a number of regulatory approvals 
which, if not received, could adversely affect results of operations.
The trend is towards more stringent regulation and higher standards  
of technical appraisal. Such controls have become increasingly 
demanding to comply with and management believes that this trend 
will continue. 
Regulatory requirements may also entail inspections for compliance 
with appropriate standards, including those relating to Quality 
Management Systems or Good Manufacturing Practices regulations. 
All manufacturing and other significant facilities within the Group 
are subject to regular internal and external audit for compliance with 
national and Group medical device regulation and policies.
Payment for medical devices may be governed by reimbursement tariff 
agencies in a number of countries. Reimbursement rates may be set in 
response to perceived economic value of the devices, based on clinical 
and other data relating to cost, patient outcomes and comparative 
effectiveness. They may also be affected by overall government 
budgetary considerations. The Group believes that its emphasis on 
innovative products and services should contribute to success in 
this environment.
Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could have a 
number of adverse consequences, including withdrawal of approval 
to sell a product in a country, temporary closure of a manufacturing 
facility, fines and potential damage to company reputation.
Failure to make successful acquisitions
A key element of the Group’s strategy for continued growth is to make 
acquisitions or alliances to complement its existing business. Failure to 
identify appropriate acquisition targets or failure to conduct adequate 
due diligence or to integrate them successfully would have an adverse 
impact on the Group’s competitive position and profitability. This 
could result from the diversion of management resources towards 
the acquisition or integration process, challenges of integrating 
organisations of different geographic, cultural and ethical backgrounds, 
as well as the prospect of taking on unexpected or unknown liabilities. 
In addition, the availability of global capital may make financing less 
attainable or more expensive and could result in the Group failing in its 
strategic aim of growth by acquisition or alliance.
Relationships with healthcare professionals
The Group seeks to maintain effective and ethical working relationships 
with physicians and medical personnel who assist in the research and 
development of new products or improvements to our existing product 
range or in product training and medical education. If we are unable  
to maintain these relationships our ability to meet the demands of our 
customers could be diminished and our revenue and profit could be 
materially adversely affected.
Reliance on sophisticated information technology
The Group uses a wide variety of information systems, programmes 
and technology to manage our business. Our systems are vulnerable 
to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, loss of data privacy or any other 
significant disruption. Our systems have been and will continue to be 
the target of such threats. We have systems in place to minimise the 
risk and disruption of these intrusions and to monitor our systems 
on an ongoing basis for current or potential threats. There can be no 
assurance that these measures will prove effective in protecting Smith 
& Nephew from future interruptions and as a result the performance of 
the Group could be materially adversely affected.
Other risk factors
Smith & Nephew is subject to a number of other risks, which are 
common to most global medical technology groups and are reviewed 
as part of the Group’s risk management process.
Factors affecting Smith & Nephew’s results of 
operations
Government economic, fiscal, monetary and political policies are all 
factors that materially affect the Group’s operation or investments of 
shareholders. Other factors include sales trends, currency fluctuations 
and innovation. Each of these factors is discussed further in the ‘Our 
marketplace’ on pages 18 to 20, ‘Segment performance’ on pages 26  
to 33 and ‘Taxation information for shareholders’ on pages 190 to 191.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Non-GAAP Financial Information
These Financial Statements include financial measures that are 
not prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’). These measures, which include trading profit, 
trading profit margin, EPSA and underlying growth, exclude the effect 
of certain cash and non-cash items that Group management believes 
are not related to the underlying performance of the Group. These 
non-IFRS financial measures are also used by management to make 
operating decisions because they facilitate internal comparisons of 
performance to historical results on both a business segment and a 
consolidated Group basis.
Non-IFRS financial measures are presented in these Financial 
Statements as the Group’s management believe that they provide 
investors with a means of evaluating performance of the business 
segments and the consolidated Group on a consistent basis, similar 
to the way in which the Group’s management evaluates performance, 
that is not otherwise apparent on an IFRS basis, given that certain 
non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items that management does 
not otherwise believe are indicative of the underlying performance of 
the consolidated Group may not be excluded when preparing financial 
measures under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures should not be 
considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial 
measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Revenue
‘Underlying growth in revenue’ is used to compare the revenue 
in a given year to the previous year on a like-for-like basis. This is 
achieved by adjusting for the impact of sales of products acquired 
in material business combinations and for movements in exchange 
rates. Underlying growth in revenue is not presented in the accounts 
prepared in accordance with IFRS and is therefore a measure not in 
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (a ‘non-
GAAP’ measure).
The Group believes that the tabular presentation and reconciliation 
of reported revenue growth to underlying revenue growth assists 
investors in their assessment of the Group’s performance in each 
business segment and for the Group as a whole.
Underlying growth in revenue is considered by the Group to be an 
important measure of performance in terms of local functional currency 
since it excludes those items considered to be outside the influence 
of local management. The Group’s management uses this non-GAAP 
measure in its internal financial reporting, budgeting and planning to 
assess performance on both a business segment and a consolidated 
Group basis. Revenue growth at constant currency is important in 
measuring business performance compared to competitors and 
compared to the growth of the market itself.
The Group considers that revenue from sales of products acquired 
in material business combinations results in a step-up in growth in 
revenue in the year of acquisition that cannot be wholly attributed 
to local management’s efforts with respect to the business in the 
year of acquisition. Depending on the timing of the acquisition, 
there will usually be a further step change in the following year. A 
measure of growth excluding the effects of business combinations 
also allows senior management to evaluate the performance and 
relative impact of growth from the existing business and growth from 
acquisitions. The process of making business acquisitions is directed, 
approved and funded from the Group corporate centre in line with 
strategic objectives.
The material limitation of the underlying growth in revenue measure is 
that it excludes certain factors, described above, which ultimately have 
a significant impact on total revenues. The Group compensates for this 
limitation by taking into account relative movements in exchange rates 
in its investment, strategic planning and resource allocation. In addition, 
as the evaluation and assessment of business acquisitions is not 
within the control of local management, performance of acquisitions is 
monitored centrally until the business is integrated. 
The Group’s management considers that the non-GAAP measure of 
underlying growth in revenue and the GAAP measure of growth in 
revenue are complementary measures, neither of which management 
uses exclusively.
‘Underlying growth in revenue’ reconciles to growth in revenue 
reported, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated 
in accordance with IFRS by making two adjustments, the ‘constant 
currency exchange effect’ and the ‘acquisitions and disposals effect’, 
described below.
The ‘constant currency exchange effect’ is a measure of the increase/
decrease in revenue resulting from currency movements on non-
US Dollar sales and is measured as the difference between: 1) the 
increase/decrease in the current year revenue translated into US 
Dollars at the current year average exchange rate and the prior revenue 
translated at the prior year rate; and 2) the increase/decrease being 
measured by translating current and prior year revenues into US 
Dollars using the prior year closing rate.
The ‘acquisitions and disposals effect’ is the measure of the impact 
on revenue from newly acquired material business combinations 
and recent material business disposals. This is calculated by 
comparing the current year, constant currency actual revenue (which 
include acquisitions and exclude disposals from the relevant date 
of completion) with prior year, constant currency actual revenue, 
adjusted to include the results of acquisitions and exclude disposals 
for the commensurate period in the prior year. These sales are 
separately tracked in the Group’s internal reporting systems and are 
readily identifiable.
Reported revenue growth, the most directly comparable financial 
measure calculated in accordance with IFRS, reconciles to underlying 
growth in revenue as follows:
 
2014

2013 
%
2012

growth, by business segment, can be found on page 35.
Trading profit, trading profit margin and trading 
cash flow
Trading profit, trading profit margin and trading cash flow are trend 
measures, which present the long-term profitability of the Group 
excluding the impact of specific transactions that management 
considers affect the Group’s short-term profitability and cash flows. The 
Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to 
be excluded from operating profit and cash generated from operations 
when arriving at trading profit and trading cash flow, respectively: 
acquisition and disposal related items arising in connection with 
business combinations, including amortisation of acquisition intangible 
assets, impairments and integration costs; restructuring events; gains 
and losses resulting from legal disputes and significant uninsured 
losses. In addition to these items, gains or losses that materially impact 
the Group’s profitability or cash flows on a short-term or one-off basis 
are excluded from operating profit and cash generated from operations 
when arriving at trading profit and trading cash flow, respectively.

Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 176
OTHER INFORMATION Underlying growth in trading profit and trading profit margin (trading profit expressed as a percentage of revenue and trading cash flow) are 
measures, which present the growth trend in the long-term profitability of the Group. 
Underlying growth in trading profit is used to compare the period-on-period growth in trading profit on a like-for-like basis. This is achieved 
by adjusting for the impact of material business combinations and disposals and for movements in exchange rates in the same manner as 
underlying revenue growth is determined, as described above. 
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share (‘EPSA’)
EPSA is a trend measure, which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the post-tax impact of specific transactions that 
management considers affects the Group’s short-term profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of 
trends. Adjusted attributable profit is the numerator used for this measure and is determined by adjusting attributable profit for the items that are 
excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit and items that are recognised below operating profit that affect the Group’s short-
term profitability. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS is earnings per ordinary share (‘EPS’).

Transactional and translational exchange
The Group’s principal markets outside the US are, in order of 
significance, Continental Europe, UK, Australia and Japan. Revenues 
in these markets fluctuate when translated into US Dollars on 
consolidation. During the year, the average rates of exchange against 
the US Dollar used to translate revenues and profits arising in these 
markets changed compared to the previous year as follows: the Euro 
remained flat at $1.33 (+0%), Sterling strengthened from $1.56 to 
$1.65 (+6%), the Swiss Franc strengthened from $1.08 to $1.09 (1%), 
the Australian Dollar weakened from $0.96 to $0.90 (-6%) and the 
Japanese Yen weakened from ¥97.6 to ¥105.8 (-8%).
The Group’s principal manufacturing locations are in the US (Advanced 
Surgical Devices), Switzerland (Advanced Surgical Devices), UK (Advanced 
Wound Management and Advanced Surgical Devices) and China (Advanced 
Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound Management). The majority of the 
Group’s selling and distribution subsidiaries around the world purchase 
finished products from these locations. As a result of currency movements 
compared with the previous year, sales from the US became relatively more 
profitable to all of these countries. The Group’s policy of purchasing forward 
a proportion of its currency requirements and the existence of an inventory 
pipeline reduce the short-term impact of currency movements.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Other contractual obligations represent $19m of foreign exchange 
contracts and $33m of acquisition consideration. Provisions that do not 
relate to contractual obligations are not included in the above table.
The agreed contributions for 2015 in respect of the Group’s defined 
benefits plans are: $46m for the UK (including $37m of supplementary 
payments), $22m for the US Plan and $6m for other funded defined 
benefit plans. The table above does not include amounts payable in 
respect of 2016 and beyond as these are subject to future agreement 
and amounts cannot be reasonably estimated.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change in control of the Company or the Group following a 
takeover, such as bank loan agreements and Company share plans. 
None of these are deemed to be significant in terms of their potential 
impact on the business of the Group as a whole. In addition, there are 
service contracts between the Company and its Executive Directors 
which provide for the automatic payment of a bonus following loss of 
office or employment occurring because of a successful takeover bid. 
Further details are set out on page 100.
The Company does not have contracts or other arrangements which 
individually are essential to the business.
2013 Financial highlights
Revenue
Group revenue increased by $214m (5% on a reported basis), from 
$4,137m in 2012 to $4,351m in 2013. The underlying increase is 4% 
after adjusting for the net impact of 2% on the Healthpoint acquisition 
and Clinical Therapies disposal and 1% attributable to the unfavourable 
impact of currency movements.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold increased by $30m (3% on a reported basis) from 
$1,070m in 2012 to $1,100m in 2013. The underlying movement is 2% 
after adjusting for the net impact of 2% on the Healthpoint acquisition 
and Clinical Therapies disposal and 1% attributable to the favourable 
impact of currency movements. The movement in underlying 
costs of goods sold of 2% is largely attributable to the increase in 
underlying trading.
During 2013, $12m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses  
(2012 – $3m) and $5m of acquisition related costs (2012 – $nil) were 
charged to cost of goods sold.
Selling, general and administration expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $160m (8% 
on a reported basis) from $2,050m in 2012 to $2,210m in 2013. The 
underlying movement is 6% after adjusting for the net impact of 3% 
on the Healthpoint acquisition and Clinical Therapies disposal and 1% 
attributable to the favourable impact of currency movements.
The underlying increase of 6% is due to the continuing investment in 
Emerging & International Markets, promotion of new products in ASD 
and AWM and the underlying increase in trading.
In 2013, administrative expenses included $64m of amortisation 
of other intangible assets (2012 – $51m), $46m of restructuring and 
rationalisation expenses (2012 – $62m), an amount of $88m relating 
to amortisation of acquisition intangibles (2012 – $43m) and $26m of 
acquisition related costs (2012 – $11m).
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenditure as a percentage of revenue 
increased by 1.2% to 5.3% in 2013 (2012 – 4.1%). Actual expenditure 
was $231m in 2013 compared to $171m in 2012. The Group continues 
to invest in innovative technologies and products to differentiate it 
from competitors. 
Operating profit
Operating profit decreased by $36m to $810m from $846m in 2012. 
This comprised a decrease of $12m in Advanced Surgical Devices and 
a decrease of $24m in Advanced Wound Management.
The movement in Advanced Surgical Devices is attributable to the 
continuing pressure on margins and its investment in the Emerging & 
International Markets. Advanced Wound Management has continued 
to invest in new products and new geographic markets throughout 
the year.
Net interest receivable/(payable)
Net interest receivable increased, by $2m, from net $2m receivable 
in 2012 to a net receivable of $4m in 2013. This increase is principally 
a consequence of the interest receivable on the Bioventus LLC 
(‘Bioventus’) loan note issued following the disposal of the Clinical 
Therapies business which has been in place for a full year in 2013 
compared to eight months in 2012. This loan note was repaid in full 
in 2014.
Other finance cost
Other finance costs in 2013 remained at $11m and principally relate to 
costs associated with the Group’s retirement benefit schemes.
Taxation
The taxation charge decreased, by $125m, to $246m from $371m in 
2012. The rate of tax was 30.5%, compared with 33.7% in 2012.
After adjusting for specific transactions that management considers 
affect the Group’s short-term profitability (profit on disposal of 
the Clinical Therapies business, restructuring and rationalisation 
expenses, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and acquisition- 
related costs) the tax rate was 29.2% (2012 – 29.9%).

OTHER INFORMATION Non-current assets
Non-current assets increased by $65m to $3,563m in 2013 from 
$3,498m in 2012. This is principally attributable to the following:
 – Property, plant and equipment increased by $23m from $793m in 
2012 to $816m in 2013. Depreciation of $209m was charged during 
2013 and assets with a net book value of $12m were disposed 
of. These movements were offset by $242m of additions relating 
primarily to instruments and other plant & machinery and $5m of 
additions arising on acquisitions in Turkey, Brazil and India. The 
balance relates to unfavourable currency movements totalling $3m
 – Goodwill increased by $70m from $1,186m in 2012 to $1,256m in 
2013. Of this movement, $37m arose on acquisitions in Turkey, Brazil 
and India. An additional $16m arose on finalisation of the of the 
Healthpoint opening balance sheet. The remaining balance relates to 
favourable currency movements totalling $17m
 – Intangible assets decreased by $10m from $1,064m in 2012 to 
$1,054m in 2013. Intangible assets totalling $64m arose on the 
acquisition in Turkey, Brazil and India. There was a reduction of 
$11m on finalisation of the Healthpoint opening balance sheet. 
Amortisation of $152m was charged during the year and assets with 
a net book value of $11m were disposed of. A total of $98m relates 
to the cost of intellectual property, distribution rights and software 
acquired. The balance relates to favourable currency movements 
totalling $2m
 – Investment in associates (including a loan to an associate of $178m 
in 2013, up from $167m in 2012) has increased from $283m in 2012 to 
$285m in 2013. This movement relates to the interest of $11m arising 
on the Bioventus loan note which was largely offset from the disposal 
of the Group’s 49% interest in the Austrian entities Plus Orthopedics 
GmbH and Intraplant GmbH and its 20% interest in the German 
entity Intercus GmbH
 – Deferred tax assets decreased by $19m in the year from $164m in 
2012 to $145m in 2013.
Current assets
Current assets increased by $112m to $2,256m from $2,144m in 2012. 
The movement relates to the following:
 – Inventories rose by $105m to $1,006m in 2013 from $901m in 2012. 
This movement is principally attributable to an increase of $48m in 
the US due to inventory build prior to the launch of JOURNEY II BCS 
and an increase of $17m due to inventory build in our Hull factory 
prior to the transfer of part of our Wound production to China. A 
further increase of $12m arose on the acquisitions in Turkey, Brazil 
and India. The movement also includes $6m of unfavourable 
currency movement
 – The level of trade and other receivables increased by $48m to 
$1,113m in 2013 from $1,065m in 2012. The movement primarily 
relates to the increase in underlying revenues and includes $9m of 
unfavourable currency movements
 – Cash at bank has fallen by $41m to $137m from $178m in 2012.
Non-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities decreased by $129m from $828m in 2012 to 
$699m in 2013. This movement relates to the following items:
 – Long-term borrowings have decreased from $430m in 2012 to 
$347m in 2013
 – The Retirement benefit obligation decreased by $36m to $230m 
in 2013 from $266m in 2012. This was largely due to the Group’s 
additional pension contributions, together with net actuarial gains for 
the year
 – Deferred tax liabilities decreased by $11m in the year from $61m in 
2012 to $50m in 2013.
Current liabilities
Current liabilities increased by $143m from $930m in 2012 to $1,073m 
in 2013. This movement is attributable to:
 – Bank overdrafts and current borrowings have increased by $6m from 
$38m in 2012 to $44m in 2013
 – Trade and other payables have increased by $129m to $785m in 
2013 from $656m in 2012. This increase includes $50m largely 
driven from strong sales performance in the US in quarter four and 
a $23m increase in Europe associated with promotional activities 
in Advanced Surgical Devices. A total of $19m of trade and other 
payables arose on the acquisitions in Turkey, Brazil and India and an 
amount of $5m is attributable to favourable currency movements.
 – Current tax payable is $184m at the end of 2013 compared to $177m 
in 2012.

Revenue
ASD revenue decreased by $93m (-3% on a reported basis) from 
$3,108m in 2012 to $3,015m in 2013. The underlying increase of 1% is 
after adjusting for a net 3% adverse impact from the disposal of the 
Clinical Therapies business in 2012 and the acquisitions completed in 
quarter four 2013, and a 1% unfavourable foreign currency translation.
In the US, revenue decreased by $58m to $1,391m in 2013 from 
$1,449m in 2012 (-4% on a reported basis). The underlying increase of 
1% is after adjusting 5% for the adverse impact of the Clinical Therapies 
disposal in 2012. In Other Established Markets, revenue was $1,204m 
in 2013, a decrease of $94m from $1,298m in 2012 (-7% on a reported 
basis). The underlying decrease was 3% after adjusting for the adverse 
impact of 2% on the Clinical Therapies disposal in 2012, and 2% from 
unfavourable foreign currency translation. Our Emerging & International 
Markets revenue increased by $59m to $420m in 2013 from $361m in 
2012 (16% increase on a reported basis). The underlying increase was 
18% after adjusting 2% for unfavourable foreign currency translation.
In the global Knee Implant franchise, revenue decreased by $9m from 
$874m in 2012 to $865m in 2013 (-1% on a reported basis), representing 
flat underlying revenue performance after 1% of unfavourable currency 
translation. Growth has been impacted by exposure to a weakening 
European market with conditions continuing to deteriorate in Germany, 
our largest European market, and our position in the product life cycle 
versus our peers. Growth improved in the second half of the year 
driven by sales of the Journey II BCS Knee System and benefits from 
the VERILAST bearing surface TV advertising campaign in the US.
Global revenue from the Hip Implant franchise decreased by $13m 
from $666m in 2012 to $653m in 2013 (-2% on a reported basis), which 
represented an underlying revenue decline of 1% after 1% unfavourable 
foreign currency translation. Continuing metal-on-metal headwinds 
have contributed to this decline.
Trauma & Extremities revenue increased by $12m from $474m in 2012 
to $486m in 2013 (3% on a reported basis). This represents underlying 
revenue growth of 4% after 1% of unfavourable foreign currency 
translation. During 2013,benefits were seen from the additional 
extremities US sales representatives recruited earlier in the year.
Sports Medicine Joint Repair revenue increased by $22m from 
$474m in 2012 to $496m in 2013 (5% on reported basis), representing 
underlying revenue growth of 7% and 2% of unfavourable foreign 
currency translation. This reflects a strong contribution across all key 
joint types and geographies.
Global revenue from Arthroscopic Enabling technologies decreased by 
$17m from $458m in 2012 to $441m in 2013 (-4% on a reported basis). 
This decrease represents an underlying revenue decline of 2% and 2% 
of unfavourable foreign currency translation.
The revenue in the Other ASD franchise fell by $88m from $162m in 
2012 to $74m in 2013 following the disposal of the Clinical Therapies 
business in 2012. Excluding the impact of this disposal, underlying 
revenue in the Other ASD franchise, which includes gynaecology,  
grew by 14% with the remaining Clinical Therapies geographies 
contributing $9m.

OTHER INFORMATION Trading and operating profit
Operating profit, the most directly comparable financial measure in 
accordance with IFRS, reconciles to trading profit as follows:
2013 
$ million
2012 
$ million
Operating profit 620 632
Acquisition related costs 7 –
Restructuring and rationalisation costs 44 57
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles 
and impairments 41 39
Trading profit 712 728
Trading profit margin increased from 23.4% to 23.6%. Trading profit 
decreased by $16m to $712m from $728m in 2012. This decrease 
reflects the impact of the CT disposal in May 2012, the impact of the US 
medical device excise tax and the cost of planned investments in the 
Knee Implants and Trauma franchises and Emerging & International 
Markets offset by benefits from our structural efficiency programme.
Operating profit decreased by $12m from $632m in 2012 to $620m in 
2013. This comprises the decrease in trading profit of $16m discussed 
above, an increase in acquisition related costs of $7m, an increase 
in amortisation of acquisition intangibles of $2m, partially offset by a 
decrease in restructuring and rationalisation costs of $13m.
Advanced Wound Management
Revenue
AWM revenue increased by $307m (30% on a reported basis), from 
$1,029m in 2012 to $1,336m in 2013. The underlying increase of 11% is 
after adjusting for an increase of 20% for the acquisitions completed in 
the year and a 1% unfavourable foreign currency translation.
In the US, revenue increased by $269m to $471m in 2013 from $202m 
in 2012 (133% on a reported basis). The underlying increase of 22% is 
after adjusting 111% for the impact of acquisitions. In Other Established 
Markets, revenue was $722m in 2013, an increase of $17m from $705m 
in 2012 (3% on a reported basis). The underlying revenue increase was 
also 3% with the 1% impact of acquisitions offset by 1% of unfavourable 
foreign currency translation. Our Emerging & International Markets 
revenue increased by $21m in 2012 (17% on a reported basis). The 
underlying increase was 20% after adjusting 3% for unfavourable 
foreign currency translation.
Advanced Wound Care revenue decreased by $6m (-1% on a reported 
basis) from $849m in 2012 to $843m in 2013. The underlying growth of 
1% is after adjusting for foreign currency translation. Conditions across 
many European markets remain challenging but the introduction of the 
ALLEVYN Life range continues to make good progress across Europe 
following product introductions and investment in marketing.
Advance Wound Devices revenue increased from $180m in 2012 
to $213m in 2013, a reported increase of $33m and 18%. The 
underlying growth of 20% is after adjusting for unfavourable foreign 
currency translations of 2%. This growth was impacted by continued 
gain in market share in NPWT, and our recent expansion into the 
emerging markets.
Advanced Wound Bioactives revenue of $280m in 2013 (2012 – $nil) 
relates to Healthpoint acquired in December 2012. The underlying 
increase, adjusted to include the results of Healthpoint for the 
commensurate period in 2012, was 47%.
Trading and operating profit
Operating profit, the most directly comparable financial measure in

Acquisition related costs 24 11
Restructuring and rationalisation costs 14 8
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles

Trading profit 275 237
Trading profit margin decreased from 23.1% to 20.6%. Trading profit 
increased by $38m to $275m from $237m in 2012. The increase 
in the year is primarily attributable to the full year benefit of the 
Healthpoint acquisition and growth in the Emerging & International 
Markets, partially offset by additional investment in R&D and sales 
and marketing. The decrease in trading margin reflects these same 
investments, combined with price and mix changes at a gross 
margin level.
Operating profit decreased by $24m from $214m in 2012 to $190m 
in 2013. This comprises of the increase in trading profit of $38m 
discussed above, offset by an increase of $43m in amortisation of 
acquisition intangibles and an increase in acquisition related costs 
of $13m, both due to the Healthpoint acquisition which completed in 
December 2012, and an increase in restructuring and rationalisation 
costs of $6m.

shares in US or UK investments. These operations are commonly 
known as ‘boiler rooms’.

payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if things 
go wrong. If you receive any unsolicited investment advice, obtain the 
correct name of the person and organisation and check that they are 
properly authorised by the FCA by visiting www.fca.org.uk/register/ .
If you think you have been approached by an unauthorised firm 
you should contact the FCA consumer helpline on 0800 111 6768

Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 186
OTHER INFORMATION Dividend history
Smith & Nephew has paid dividends on its ordinary shares in every year since 1937. Following the capital restructuring and dividend reduction in 
2000 the Group adopted a policy of increasing its dividend cover (the ratio of EPSA, as set out in the ‘Selected financial data’, to ordinary dividends 
declared for the year). This was intended to increase the financing capability of the Group for acquisitions and other investments. From 2000 to 
2004 the dividend increased in line with inflation and, in 2004, dividend cover stood at 4.1 times. Having achieved this level of dividend cover the 
Board changed its policy, from that of increasing dividends in line with inflation, to that of increasing dividends for 2005 and after by 10%. Following 
the redenomination of the Company’s share capital into US Dollars the Board re-affirmed its policy of increasing the dividend by 10% a year in US 
Dollar terms.
On 2 August 2012, the Board announced its intention to pursue a progressive dividend policy, with the aim of increasing the US Dollar value of 
ordinary dividends over time broadly based on the Group’s underlying growth in earnings, while taking into account capital requirements and 
cash flows. 
At the time of the full year results the Board reviews the appropriate level of total annual dividend each year. The Board intends that the interim 
dividend will be set by a formula and will be equivalent to 40% of the total dividend for the previous year. Dividends will continue to be declared in 
US Dollars with an equivalent amount in sterling payable to those shareholders whose registered address is in the UK, or who have validly elected 
to receive sterling dividends.
An interim dividend in respect of each fiscal year is normally declared in August and paid in November. A final dividend will be recommended by 
the Board of Directors and paid subject to approval by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
Future dividends of Smith & Nephew will be dependent upon: future earnings; the future financial condition of the Group; the Board’s dividend 
policy; and the additional factors that might affect the business of the Group set out in ‘Special note regarding forward-looking statements’ and 
‘Risk Factors’.

The 2014 final dividend will be payable on 6 May 2015, subject to shareholder approval.
In respect of the proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2014 of 18.6 US cents per ordinary share, the record date will be 17 April 
2015 and the payment date will be 6 May 2015. The sterling equivalent per ordinary share will be set following the record date. Shareholders may 
elect to receive their dividend in either sterling or US Dollars and the last day for election will be 17 April 2015. The ordinary shares will trade ex-
dividend on both the London and New York Stock Exchanges from 16 April 2015. 
The proposed final dividend of 18.6 US cents per ordinary share, which together with the interim dividend of 11 US cents, makes a total for 2014 of 
29.6 US cents.

OTHER INFORMATION Share Capital
The principal trading market for the ordinary shares is the London Stock Exchange. The ordinary shares were listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange on 16 November 1999, trading in the form of ADSs evidenced by ADRs. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares from 14 October 2014, 
before which time one ADS represented five ordinary shares. The ADS facility is sponsored by Deutsche Bank acting as depositary.
All the ordinary shares, including those held by Directors and Executive Officers, rank pari passu with each other. On 23 January 2006 the 
ordinary shares of 12
2
/ 9p were redenominated as ordinary shares of US 20 cents (following approval by shareholders at the extraordinary general 
meeting in December 2005). The new US dollar ordinary shares carry the same rights as the previous ordinary shares. The share price continues 
to be quoted in sterling. In 2006 the Company issued £50,000 of shares in sterling in order to comply with English law. These were issued as 
deferred shares, which are not listed on any stock exchange. They have extremely limited rights and therefore effectively have no value. These 
shares were allotted to the Chief Executive Officer, although the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member of the Board should it 
so wish.
As at 23 February 2015, to the knowledge of the Group, there were 17,824 registered holders of ordinary shares, of whom 90 had registered 
addresses in the USA and held a total of 168,578 ordinary shares (less than 0.02% of the total issued). Because certain ordinary shares are 
registered in the names of nominees, the number of shareholders with registered addresses in the USA is not representative of the number of 
beneficial owners of ordinary shares resident in the USA.
Shareholdings
As at 23 February 2015, 26,707,860 ADSs equivalent to 53,415,720 ordinary shares or approximately 5.97% of the total ordinary shares in issue, 
were outstanding and were held by 92 registered ADS holders.
Major shareholders
As far as is known to Smith & Nephew, the Group is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or by any government and 
the Group has not entered into arrangements, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the Group.
As at 23 February 2015, no persons are known to Smith & Nephew to have any interest (as defined in the Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
of the FCA) in 3% or more of the ordinary shares, other than as shown below. The following tables show changes over the last three years in the 
percentage and numbers of the issued share capital owned by shareholders holding 3% or more of ordinary shares, as notified to the Company

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Purchase of ordinary shares on behalf of the Company
At the AGM, the Company will be seeking a renewal of its current permission from shareholders to purchase up to 10% of its own shares. In 
order to avoid shareholder dilution, shares allotted to employees through employee share schemes are bought back on a quarterly basis and 
subsequently cancelled by the Company. From 1 January 2014 to 23 February 2015, in the months listed below, the Company has purchased 
5,455,000 ordinary shares at a cost of   US$91,595,439.

Exchange controls and other limitations affecting 
security holders
There are no UK governmental laws, decrees or regulations that 
restrict the export or import of capital or that affect the payment of 
dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of 
Smith & Nephew’s securities, except for certain restrictions imposed 
from time to time by Her Majesty’s Treasury of the United Kingdom 
pursuant to legislation, such as the United Nations Act 1946 and the 
Emergency Laws Act 1964, against the government or residents of 
certain countries.
There are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under 
the Articles of Association of Smith & Nephew, restricting the right 
of non-UK residents to hold or to exercise voting rights in respect of 
ordinary shares, except that where any overseas shareholder has not 
provided to the Company a UK address for the service of notices, the 
Company is under no obligation to send any notice or other document 
to an overseas address. It is, however, the current practice of the 
Company to send every notice or other document to all shareholders 
regardless of the country recorded in the register of members, with 
the exception of details of the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan, 
which are not sent to shareholders with recorded addresses in the USA 
and Canada.
Taxation information for shareholders
The comments below are of a general and summary nature and are 
based on the Group’s understanding of certain aspects of current 
UK and US federal income tax law and practice relevant to the ADSs 
and ordinary shares not in ADS form. The comments address the 
material US and UK tax consequences generally applicable to a 
person who is the beneficial owner of ADSs or ordinary shares and 
who, for US federal income tax purposes, is a citizen or resident of the 
USA, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created 
or organised in or under the laws of the USA (or any State therein), or 
an estate or trust the income of which is included in gross income for 
US federal income tax purposes regardless of its source (each a ‘US 
Holder’). The comments set out below do not purport to address all tax 
consequences of the ownership of ADSs or ordinary shares which may 
be material to a particular holder and in particular do not deal with the 
position of shareholders who directly or indirectly own 10% or more of 
the Company’s issued ordinary shares. This discussion does not apply 
to (i) persons whose holding of ADSs or ordinary shares is effectively 
connected with or pertains to either a permanent establishment in 
the UK through which a US Holder carries on a business in the UK or 
a fixed base from which a US Holder performs independent personal 
services in the UK, or (ii) persons whose registered address is inside 
the UK. This discussion does not apply to certain investors subject to 
special rules, such as certain financial institutions, tax-exempt entities, 
insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect to 
use the mark to market method of tax accounting, partnerships or other 
entities treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, 
US Holders holding ADSs or ordinary shares as part of a hedging, 
conversion or other integrated transaction or whose functional currency 
for US federal income tax purposes is other than the US dollar and US 
Holders liable for alternative minimum tax. In addition, the comments 
below do not address the potential application of the provisions of 
the United States Internal Revenue Code, known as the Medicare 
contribution tax, or any US state, local or non-US (other than UK) taxes. 
The summary deals only with US Holders who hold ADSs or ordinary 
shares as capital assets. The summary is based on current UK and US 
law and practice which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive 
effect. US Holders are recommended to consult their own tax advisers 
as to the particular tax consequences to them of the ownership of 
ADSs or ordinary shares. The Company believes, and this discussion 
assumes, that the Company was not a passive foreign investment 
company for its taxable year ended 31 December 2014.
This discussion is based in part on representations by the depositary 
and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and 
any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. 
For purposes of US federal income tax law, US Holders of ADSs will 
generally be treated as owners of the ordinary shares represented 
by the ADSs. However, the US Treasury has expressed concerns that 
parties to whom depositary shares are released before shares are 
delivered to the depositary (‘pre-released’) may be taking actions that 
are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by owners of 
depositary shares. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the 
claiming of the reduced rate of tax, described below, applicable to 
dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders. Accordingly, 
the availability of the reduced tax rate for dividends received by certain 
non-corporate US Holders of ADSs could be affected by actions that 
may be taken by parties to whom ADSs are pre-released.
Taxation of dividends in the UK and the USA
The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid 
by a UK corporation, such as the Company.
Distributions paid by the Company will be treated for US federal 
income tax purposes as foreign source ordinary dividend income 
to a US Holder to the extent paid out of the Company’s current or 
accumulated earnings and profits as determined for US federal income 
tax purposes. Because the Company does not maintain calculations 
of its earnings and profits under US federal income tax principles, it is 
expected that distributions generally will be reported to US Holders 
as dividends. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-
received deduction generally allowed to corporate US Holders.
Information for shareholders continued
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 190
OTHER INFORMATION Dividends paid to certain non-corporate US Holders of ordinary shares 
or ADSs may be subject to US federal income tax at lower rates than 
those applicable to other types of ordinary income if certain conditions 
are met. Non-corporate US Holders should consult their own tax 
advisers to determine whether they are subject to any special rules that 
limit their ability to be taxed at these favourable rates.
Taxation of capital gains
US Holders, who are not resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes 
in the UK, will not generally be liable for UK capital gains tax on any 
capital gain realised upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or 
ordinary shares unless the ADSs or ordinary shares are held in 
connection with a trade carried on in the UK through a permanent 
establishment (or in the case of individuals, through a branch or 
agency). Furthermore, UK resident individuals who acquire ADSs or 
ordinary shares before becoming temporarily non-UK residents may 
remain subject to UK taxation of capital gains on gains realised while 
non-resident.
For US federal income tax purposes, gains or losses realised upon 
a taxable sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares by 
US Holders generally will be US source capital gains or losses and will 
be long-term capital gains or losses if the ADSs or ordinary shares 
were held for more than one year. The amount of a US Holder’s gain or 
loss will be equal to the difference between the amount realised on the 
sale or other disposition and such holder’s tax basis in the ADSs, or 
ordinary shares, determined in US dollars.
Inheritance and estate taxes
The HM Revenue & Customs imposes inheritance tax on capital 
transfers which occur on death, and in the seven years preceding 
death. The HM Revenue & Customs considers that the US/UK Double 
Taxation Convention on Estate and Gift Tax applies to inheritance 
tax. Consequently, a US citizen who is domiciled in the USA and is 
not a UK national or domiciled in the UK will not be subject to UK 
inheritance tax in respect of ADSs and ordinary shares. A UK national 
who is domiciled in the USA will be subject to both UK inheritance 
tax and US federal estate tax but will be entitled to a credit for US 
federal estate tax charged in respect of ADSs and ordinary shares in 
computing the liability to UK inheritance tax. Conversely, a US citizen 
who is domiciled or deemed domiciled in the UK will be entitled to a 
credit for UK inheritance tax charged in respect of ADSs and ordinary 
shares in computing the liability for US federal estate tax. Special rules 
apply where ADSs and ordinary shares are business property of a 
permanent establishment of an enterprise situated in the UK.
US information reporting and backup withholding
A US Holder may be subject to US information reporting and backup 
withholding on dividends paid on or the proceeds of sales of ADSs or 
ordinary shares made within the USA or through certain US-related 
financial intermediaries, unless the US Holder is an exempt recipient 
or, in the case of backup withholding, provides a correct US taxpayer 
identification number and certain other conditions are met. US backup 
withholding may apply if there has been a notification from the US 
Internal Revenue Service of a failure to report all interest or dividends.
Any backup withholding deducted may be credited against the 
US Holder’s US federal income tax liability, and, where the backup 
withholding exceeds the actual liability, the US Holder may obtain 
a refund by timely filing the appropriate refund claim with the 
US Internal Revenue Service.
Certain US Holders who are individuals (and under proposed Treasury 
regulations, certain entities) may be required to report information 
relating to securities issued by a non-US person (or foreign accounts 
through which the securities are held), subject to certain exceptions 
(including an exception for securities held in accounts maintained by 
US financial institutions). US Holders should consult their tax advisers 
regarding their reporting obligations with respect to the ordinary shares 
or ADSs.
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
UK stamp duty is charged on documents and in particular instruments 
for the transfer of registered ownership of ordinary shares. Transfers 
of ordinary shares in certificated form will generally be subject to UK 
stamp duty at the rate of ½% of the consideration given for the transfer 
with the duty rounded up to the nearest £5.
UK stamp duty reserve tax (‘SDRT’) arises when there is an agreement 
to transfer shares in UK companies ‘for consideration in money or 
money’s worth’, and so an agreement to transfer ordinary shares for 
money or other consideration may give rise to a charge to SDRT at the 
rate of ½% (rounded up to the nearest penny). The charge of SDRT will 
be cancelled, and any SDRT already paid will be refunded, if within six 
years of the agreement an instrument of transfer is produced to HM 
Revenue & Customs and the appropriate stamp duty paid.
Transfers of ordinary shares into CREST (an electronic transfer system) 
are exempt from stamp duty so long as the transferee is a member of 
CREST who will hold the ordinary shares as a nominee for the transferor 
and the transfer is in a form that will ensure that the securities become 
held in uncertificated form within CREST. Paperless transfers of ordinary 
shares within CREST for consideration in money or money’s worth are 
liable to SDRT rather than stamp duty. SDRT on relevant transactions 
will be collected by CREST at ½%, and this will apply whether or not the 
transfer is effected in the UK and whether or not the parties to it are 
resident or situated in the UK.
A charge of stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 1½% of the consideration 
(or, in some circumstances, the value of the shares concerned) will 
arise on a transfer or issue of ordinary shares to the depositary or to 
certain persons providing a clearance service (or their nominees or 
agents) for the conversion into ADRs and will generally be payable by 
the depositary or person providing clearance service. In accordance 
with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, any tax or duty payable 
by the depositary on deposits of ordinary shares will be charged 
by the depositary to the party to whom ADRs are delivered against 
such deposits.
No liability for stamp duty or SDRT will arise on any transfer of, or 
agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS, 
provided that the ADS and any instrument of transfer or written 
agreement to transfer remains at all times outside the UK, and provided 
further that any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer 
is not executed in the UK and the transfer does not relate to any matter 
or thing done or to be done in the UK (the location of the custodian as a 
holder of ordinary shares not being relevant in this context). In any other 
case, any transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial 
ownership of an ADS could, depending on all the circumstances of the 
transfer, give rise to a charge to stamp duty or SDRT.
191 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Articles of Association
The following summarises certain material rights of holders of the 
Company’s ordinary shares under the material provisions of the 
Company’s Articles of Association and English law. This summary 
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Companies Act and 
the Company’s Articles of Association. In the following description, 
a ‘shareholder’ is the person registered in the Company’s register 
of members as the holder of an ordinary share.
The Company is incorporated under the name Smith & Nephew plc 
and is registered in England and Wales with registered number 324357.
The Company’s ordinary shares may be held in certificated or 
uncertificated form. No holder of the Company’s shares will be required 
to make additional contributions of capital in respect of the Company’s 
shares in the future. In accordance with English law the Company’s 
ordinary shares rank equally.
Directors
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, a Director may not vote in 
respect of any contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal in which 
he, or any person connected with him, has any material interest other 
than by virtue of his interests in securities of, or otherwise in or through, 
the Company. This is subject to certain exceptions relating to proposals 
(a) indemnifying him in respect of obligations incurred on behalf of the 
Company, (b) indemnifying a third party in respect of obligations of the 
Company for which the Director has assumed responsibility under an 
indemnity or guarantee, (c) relating to an offer of securities in which 
he will be interested as an underwriter, (d) concerning another body 
corporate in which the Director is beneficially interested in less than 1% 
of the issued shares of any class of shares of such a body corporate, 
(e) relating to an employee benefit in which the Director will share 
equally with other employees and (f) relating to any insurance that the 
Company is empowered to purchase for the benefit of Directors of 
the Company in respect of actions undertaken as Directors (and/or 
officers) of the Company.
A Director shall not vote or be counted in any quorum present at a 
meeting in relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote.
The Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the 
Company to borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate 
amount of all monies borrowed after deducting cash and current asset 
investments by the Company and its subsidiaries shall not exceed the 
sum of $6,500,000,000.
Any Director who has been appointed by the Directors since the 
previous Annual General Meeting of shareholders, either to fill a 
casual vacancy or as an additional Director holds office only until 
the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting and then shall 
be eligible for re-election by the shareholders. The other Directors 
retire and are eligible for re-appointment at the third Annual General 
Meeting after the meeting at which they were last re-appointed. If not 
re-appointed a Director retiring at a meeting shall retain office until the 
meeting appoints someone in his place, or if it does not do so, until the 
conclusion of the meeting. The Directors are subject to removal with 
or without cause by the Board or the shareholders. Directors are not 
required to hold any shares of the Company by way of qualification.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association and English law, a Director 
may be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against liabilities 
he may sustain or incur in the execution of his duties.
Rights attaching to ordinary shares
Under English law, dividends are payable on the Company’s ordinary 
shares only out of profits available for distribution, as determined 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK 
and by the Companies Act 2006. Holders of the Company’s ordinary 
shares are entitled to receive final dividends as may be declared by 
the Directors and approved by the shareholders in general meeting, 
rateable according to the amounts paid up on such shares, provided 
that the dividend cannot exceed the amount recommended by 
the Directors.
The Company’s Board of Directors may declare such interim dividends 
as appear to them to be justified by the Company’s financial position. 
If authorised by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders, the Board 
may also direct payment of a dividend in whole or in part by the 
distribution of specific assets (and in particular of paid up shares or 
debentures of the Company).
Any dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend was 
declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and will revert to 
the Company.
There were no material modifications to the rights of shareholders 
under the Articles during 2014.
Voting rights of ordinary shares
Voting at any general meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands 
unless a poll, which is a written vote, is duly demanded and held. 
On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person at a 
general meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares held. 
On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has 
one vote for each ordinary share held by that shareholder. A poll may 
be demanded by any of the following:
 – the chairman of the meeting;
 – at least five shareholders present or by proxy entitled to vote on 
the resolution;
 – any shareholder or shareholders representing in the aggregate 
not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all shareholders 
entitled to vote on the resolution; or
 – any shareholder or shareholders holding shares conferring a right 
to vote on the resolution on which there have been paid-up sums in 
aggregate equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up 
on all the shares conferring that right.
A form of proxy will be treated as giving the proxy the authority to 
demand a poll, or to join others in demanding one, as above.
The necessary quorum for a general meeting is two shareholders 
present in person or by proxy carrying the right to vote upon the 
business to be transacted.
Information for shareholders continued
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 192
OTHER INFORMATION Matters are transacted at general meetings of the Company by the 
processing and passing of resolutions of which there are two kinds; 
ordinary or special resolutions:
 – Ordinary resolutions include resolutions for the re-election of 
Directors, the approval of financial statements, the declaration 
of dividends (other than interim dividends), the appointment and 
re-appointment of auditors or the grant of authority to allot shares. 
An ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority 
of the votes of those persons voting at the meetings at which there is 
a quorum.
 – Special resolutions include resolutions amending the Company’s 
Articles of Association, dis-applying statutory pre-emption rights or 
changing the Company’s name; modifying the rights of any class of 
the Company’s shares at a meeting of the holders of such class or 
relating to certain matters concerning the Company’s winding up. A 
special resolution requires the affirmative vote of not less than three-
quarters of the votes of the persons voting at the meeting at which 
there is a quorum.
Annual General Meetings must be convened upon advance written 
notice of 21 days. Other general meetings must be convened upon 
advance written notice of at least 14 clear days. The days of delivery or 
receipt of notice are not included. The notice must specify the nature 
of the business to be transacted. Meetings are convened by the Board 
of Directors. Members with 5% of the ordinary share capital of the 
Company may requisition the Board to convene a meeting.
Variation of rights
If, at any time, the Company’s share capital is divided into different 
classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, 
subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, with the consent in 
writing of holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued 
shares of that class or upon the adoption of a special resolution passed 
at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every 
such separate meeting, all the provisions of the articles of association 
relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the 
quorum is to be the number of persons (which must be two or more) 
who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal 
value of the issued shares of the class and at any such meeting a poll 
may be demanded in writing by any person or their proxy who hold 
shares of that class. Where a person is present by proxy or proxies, he 
is treated as holding only the shares in respect of which the proxies are 
authorised to exercise voting rights.
Rights in a winding up
Except as the Company’s shareholders have agreed or may otherwise 
agree, upon the Company’s winding up, the balance of assets available 
for distribution:
 – after the payment of all creditors including certain preferential 
creditors, whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors; 
and
 – subject to any special rights attaching to any other class of shares;
 – is to be distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according 
to the amounts paid-up on the shares held by them. This distribution 
is generally to be made in US dollars. A liquidator may, however, 
upon the adoption of any extraordinary resolution of the 
shareholders and any other sanction required by law, divide 
among the shareholders the whole or any part of the Company’s 
assets in kind.
Limitations on voting and shareholding
There are no limitations imposed by English law or the Company’s 
Articles of Association on the right of non-residents or foreign 
persons to hold or vote the Company’s ordinary shares or ADSs, 
other than the limitations that would generally apply to all of the 
Company’s shareholders.
Transfers of shares
The Board may refuse to register the transfer of shares held in 
certificated form which:
 – are not fully paid (provided that it shall not exercise this discretion in 
such a way as to prevent stock market dealings in the shares of that 
class from taking place on an open and proper basis);
 – are not duly stamped or duly certified or otherwise shown to the 
satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from stamp duty, lodged at the 
Transfer Office or at such other place as the Board may appoint and 
(save in the case of a transfer by a person to whom no certificate 
was issued in respect of the shares in question) accompanied 
by the certificate for the shares to which it relates, and such other 
evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of 
the transferor to make the transfer and, if the instrument of transfer 
is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that 
person so to do;
 – are in respect of more than one class of shares; or
 – are in favour of more than four transferees.
Deferred shares
Following the re-denomination of share capital on 23 January 2006 
the ordinary shares’ nominal value became 20 US cents each. There 
were no changes to the rights or obligations of the ordinary shares. In 
order to comply with the Companies Act 2006, a new class of sterling 
shares was created, deferred shares, of which £50,000 were issued 
and allotted in 2006 as fully paid to the Chief Executive Officer though 
the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member of 
the Board should it so wish. These deferred shares have no voting 
or dividend rights and on winding up only are entitled to repayment 
at nominal value only if all ordinary shareholders have received the 
nominal value of their shares plus an additional $1,000 each.
Amendments
The Company does not have any special rules about amendments 
to its Articles of Association beyond those imposed by law.

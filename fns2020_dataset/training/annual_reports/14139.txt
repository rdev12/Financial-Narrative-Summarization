Chairman’s Statement
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
I AM PLEASED TO REPORT A SOLID 
PERFORMANCE BY THE GROUP IN 
2011 WITH SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL, 
STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL 
PROGRESS. THIS WAS ACHIEVED 
AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A 
CHALLENGING PROJECT IN RUSSIA 
WHERE THE UNDERGROUND 
CONDITIONS PROVED TO BE 
EXTREMELY ADVERSE.
Financial results
Revenue for the year grew 24% to GBP226.5 
million (2010: GBP183.1 million). Proﬁ ts showed 
an improvement in 2011 but were impacted by 
different exceptional items in both 2010 and 
2011. Our results for the year were as follows:
 2011 2010
 GBP million GBP million
Proﬁ t before income 
tax pre exceptional items 16.6 12.9 
IPO bonuses (3.1) -
Contract provision 
and settlement - 3.8
Proﬁ t before income 
tax as reported 13.5 16.7
Basic earnings per share was 23.4p on a pre IPO 
Bonus basis (2010: 20.8p pre contract settlement) 
and actual Basic earnings per share after the 
exceptional items was 18.3p (2010: 29.8p). 
The Group ended the year in a good ﬁ nancial 
position with net Cash and Cash Equivalents 
of GBP6.1 million (2010: net Cash of GBP11.1 
million), having invested cash in working 
capital requirements.
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   4 26/04/2012   19:37 5
Dividends
In line with our stated progressive dividend 
policy, we paid a maiden interim dividend of 
2.4p per share in October 2011. The Board has 
recommended a ﬁ nal dividend from the 2011 
results of 4.8p per share payable in June 2012. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual 
General Meeting, the ﬁ nal dividend will be paid 
on 12 June 2012 to shareholders on the register 
as at the close of business on 4 May 2012.
Strategy
Our strategy remains as set out in our Prospectus 
at the time of the IPO. We intend to maintain 
and build on our existing strategic and technical 
strengths, to expand further into the CIS and 
India and to diversify our offering into additional 
end-market applications. We remain alert to 
selective bolt-on acquisition opportunities that 
have the potential to add value to our operations.
Operations
Management have worked hard over the past 
year to secure new projects for the Company. 
The EuroChem project proved particularly 
difﬁ cult with the adverse underground conditions 
encountered. Various alternatives were explored 
with the client to ﬁ nd a more effective way 
of progressing the rate of sinking. EuroChem 
decided to embark upon its own efforts of 
freezing the shaft and thus suspended our 
grouting efforts in December 2011. We have 
chosen to give advance notice of termination with 
effect from 20 April 2012. 
I would like to thank Alon Davidov our Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer and his executive team for 
their efforts in leading the Group through 
a challenging past year with the difﬁ culties 
encountered at EuroChem and with the extremely 
high level of tender activity to respond to. 
Outlook
There continues to be an increase in capital 
expenditures in the mining sector globally 
reﬂ ected in the very high level of tender activity 
we are experiencing.
We have a record level of tendering activity and 
the potential to win further new contract awards. 
We are performing in line with our expectations 
and remain conﬁ dent of the Group’s prospects 
both for 2012 and beyond.

Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s Statement
REVENUE HAS GROWN BY 23.7% 
WITH PROFIT FROM OPERATIONS 
INCREASING 30.2% TO GBP18.5 
MILLION BEFORE EXCEPTIONAL 
ITEMS OF THE EXCEPTIONAL 
IPO BONUS OF GBP3.1 MILLION 
IN 2011 AND A CREDIT FOR 
CONTRACT SETTLEMENT IN 2010 
OF GBP3.8 MILLION. 
After taking account of the exceptional items, 
Proﬁ t from Operations was GBP15.3 million (2010: 
GBP18.0 million). The Group’s net proﬁ t after 
tax for the year on a pre-IPO Bonus basis was 
GBP11.1 million (2010: GBP9.9 million pre contract 
settlement) and after the exceptional items was 
GBP8.7 million (2010: GBP12.6 million). Our return 
on capital employed averaged 8.2% pre the IPO 
Bonus (2010: 6.1% pre contract settlement) and 
our goal is to see this increase into the double 
digits in the next 3 years through our focussed 
strategy in the CIS and India regions. 
South African Operations
South Africa remains the primary region for the 
Group and we are conﬁ dent in the continued 
improvement in revenues in this region. This 
should be supported by the implementation of 
a black economic empowerment shareholding 
arrangement announced during the year.
In the ﬁ rst half of 2011, the Impala 16 and 17 
shafts were impacted by standing time, which in 
turn impacted gross proﬁ t margins. The second 
half saw a recovery at these two projects, which 
will improve gross proﬁ t margins to an acceptable 
level. After the period end, in March 2012, we 
were awarded additional capital development 
contracts at Impala 16, which will improve the 
overall margin at that shaft.
We progressed well with the pre-sink and 
mobilisation work at Afplats’ Leeuwkop shaft. The 
award of the contract has been phased in stages 
and in March 2012 we were awarded the second 
phase of work to sink to a depth of 325.8 meters 
by September 2012.
The Lonmin shafts at Hossy and Saffy performed 
well. Karee 3 has fallen behind plan but measures 
are in place to mitigate operational losses and 
avoid them in the future. Overall, the Lonmin 
projects have beneﬁ ted from additional capital 
development work being undertaken.
Work at the Styldrift project suffered low levels 
of production caused mainly by the introduction 
of new safety procedures and a shortage of 
skilled labour which impacted production cycles 
signiﬁ cantly. Production levels have improved 
in the second half of 2011 and we are currently 
performing close to planned levels, although we 
remain behind the overall project schedule. 
Our project at AngloGold Ashanti’s Moab shaft 
has performed well and is expected to reach 
completion by the end of 2012.
Work on our project at Hernic Ferrochrome’s 
Bokfontein mine continues to progress at a 
satisfactory pace. 
International Operations
Our project at EuroChem’s potash deposit in 
Russia suffered setbacks due to the extremely 
difﬁ cult underground conditions, making progress 
very slow which in the context of EuroChem’s 
broader mine programme, was unacceptable. 
In early December 2011 EuroChem decided 
to suspend our grouting operations and to 
switch to a freezing technique for which the 
shaft is currently being prepared. After making 
various proposals to EuroChem, which were not 
accepted, we have decided to give advance 
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   6 26/04/2012   19:37 7
notice of termination of the contract with effect 
from 20 April 2012. Further information on this 
can be found in the Directors’ report under 
Principal events for the year on page 24. 
In India our T eesta III hydroelectric project is almost 
complete. Work on the second surge shaft stopped 
in the latter half of 2011 following an earthquake 
in the vicinity of the site. There remained very little 
work to complete the shaft at the time and this last 
remaining work is being ﬁ nalised by the client while 
we demobilise our equipment.
Our Mining Engineering and Technical 
Services (METS) division continues to ﬁ nd new 
opportunities for design and EPCM contracts. 
Health and Safety
Our Injury Frequency Rate, one of our safety 
indicators has improved to 1.58 (2010: 4.88) 
compared to the industry benchmark of 3.60. 
Regrettably there were 10 traumatic accidents 
that took place in 2011, including the tragic 
fatality of Mr Macamo on the 5th of April. We 
have redoubled our efforts to improve our safety 
initiatives across all our operations which will 
lead to better awareness of safety across all 
levels in the Company. In 2011 we were awarded 
“Southern Africa Mine SAFE 2011 Mining 
Contractor Companies Best in Safety Class” by 
the Mine Managers Association of South Africa 
and SA Institute of Metallurgy. We continue to 
face the challenge of skills shortages in being 
prepared to take on the many potential projects 
facing the Company at present. To this end, 
we have been building up our team of skilled 
personnel and we are ensuring that we are at the 
forefront of providing attractive retention policies 
and rewarding our skilled staff appropriately. In 
order to cater for our planned growth over the 
forthcoming years, we have bolstered the senior 
executive team at the Executive Committee level, 
having added the positions of Group Business 
Development Manager, Chief Commercial Ofﬁ cer, 
Country Manager CIS Region, Chief Information 
Ofﬁ cer, Chief Operational Ofﬁ cer International 
and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer South Africa. At the 
same time we are increasing our efforts at staff 
retention and recruitment of skilled engineers and 
artisans. While this has added to our operating 
expenses in 2011 and may add a little more to 
2012, we believe we will have reached an optimal 
level of operating support to enable the Group 
to take on the challenges of growth presented 
by the record number of tenders we expect to 
largely convert into long term contracts in 2012.
Black Economic Empowerment
We have implemented a black economic 
empowerment shareholding arrangement 
in Shaft Sinkers Mining (Pty) Ltd, one of our 
South African subsidiaries, whereby 26% of the 
subsidiary’s shares have been issued to historically 
disadvantaged South Africans. 16% of the 
shareholding is earmarked to provide a future 
cash beneﬁ t from dividends for the Category 3 to 
8 South African employees through an employee 
share trust, making this transaction a broad-based 
empowerment transaction for the direct beneﬁ t of 
targeted employees in the Group. Furthermore, 
the Group is pleased to welcome three 
distinguished businessmen, Mr. Mikki Xayiya, Mr. 
Jabu Mabuza and Mr. Aubrey Lekwane as minority 
shareholders into the Group, together holding 
10% of Shaft Sinkers Mining. The Board believes 
this step, which should not materially affect 
expected earnings from existing contracts, will be 
beneﬁ cial to the business in securing new contracts 
in South Africa and will assist the Group in meeting 
the requirements of some of its clients under the 
South African Mining Charter and enhancing the 
long-term sustainability of the business in South 
Africa. The share based payment expense arising 
in the 2011 ﬁ nancial results is GBP0.2 million (refer 
to note 32.1 to the annual ﬁ nancial statement).
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   7 26/04/2012   19:37 8
Order book and tendering activity
At 31 December 2011 the order book stood 
at approximately £301 million (2010: GBP488 
million), including GBP94 million in relation to 
EuroChem (2010: GBP119 million), of remaining 
revenues to be billed on committed contracts.
After completing the pre-sink phase of Afplats’ 
Leeuwkop main shaft which was awarded in 
March 2011, we have been awarded the second 
phase of work to sink to a depth of 325.8 meters 
by September 2012. The bulk of the project 
remains subject to the ﬁ nal approval by the 
Impala board (Afplats is a subsidiary of Impala). 
Management anticipates the approval and 
signing of this contract before the end of the ﬁ rst 
half of 2012. 
Since the last reported results for the half year 
ended 30 June 2011, management has been 
actively pursuing a number of new tenders. The 
new business development roles established in 
2011 have culminated in a more concerted effort 
at identifying opportunities and subsequently 
growing our potential pipeline.
The Group has over £1.0 billion of outstanding 
tenders or price submissions on a total of 10 
projects as at the date of this report. While 
there can be no certainty as to the award of any 
of these contracts, management believes the 
Company remains well placed to secure a number 
of these tenders when they are awarded. The 
current tender pipeline is at a very high level.
Initiatives 
In 2011 we funded an initial investment in a 
technology business that is developing a laser 
based shaft inspection system that will transform 
the way compulsory shaft inspections are being 
performed today. This new system will be much 
safer, quicker and more accurate. Such a system 
would allow Shaft Sinkers to offer an additional 
service to its clients and create a recurring stable 
revenue ﬂ ow. We hope to have a prototype ready 
towards the beginning of 2013. 
We will continue our strategic focus to build 
on our strengths, namely people, safety and 
experience and to seek out and exploit new 
opportunities in the CIS region and India, while 
continuing to build on our strong base in Africa. 
In 2011 the strategic focus has been on further 
improving the performances of the South African 
operations and continuing the expansion of Shaft 
Sinkers internationally. We have been using some 
of the listing proceeds to refurbish key plant 
in preparation for new potential contracts. The 
availability of our own inventory of reconditioned 
winders remains key to our strategy to be well 
positioned for taking on new sinking contracts.
Our goals for 2012 and the next few years is 
to improve on the return on capital employed, 
and adding value to shareholders. This should 
be achieved by being awarded higher margin 
contracts in the CIS and India regions on a now 
steady operating cost base having built up our 
operational readiness to take on a higher volume 
of work. With a number of exciting opportunities 
on the horizon we remain conﬁ dent of our 
continued growth over the next ﬁ ve years.

Operational Review
MARKET AND OVERVIEW
In general in 2011 there was a noticeable 
increase in the tendering and enquiry activity. 
The establishment of a business development 
role and the stronger regional presence have 
contributed to a wider range of enquiries. 
This can be attributed to our wider reach and 
intensifying mining activity globally. 
SAFETY
Safety is of paramount importance for Shaft 
Sinkers. In 2011 we have seen an improvement 
in our lost time injury frequency rate of 1.58 
down from 4.88 in 2010 and below the industry 
benchmark of 3.60. Regrettably there were 10 
serious accidents that took place in 2011 with the 
worst being the fatality of Mr Macamo on the 5th 
of April. We will once again strive for zero harm 
after the unfortunate event.  
Various sites have recorded safety achievements 
by meeting or exceeding their set targets and 
the benchmark, and in 2011 we were awarded 
“Southern Africa Mine SAFE 2011 Mining 
Contractor Companies Best in Safety Class” by 
the Mine Managers Association of South Africa 
and SA Institute of Metallurgy. In 2011 numerous 
new initiatives were introduced. “Snakes for 
Safety” campaign uses live snakes to identify 
various safety hazards. This campaign has had 
a signiﬁ cant impact on the work force. Another 
campaign called “Unplugged” uses motivational 
speakers and industrial theatre to reinforce 
safety behavioural concepts. We are constantly 
searching for new and innovative ways to instil a 
safety culture at every level of the organization.
OPERATIONS
In the ﬁ rst half of 2011, the Impala 16 and 
17 shafts had suffered from rope failures and 
winder problems that resulted in standing time, 
which has a lower rate, therefore impacting 
average gross proﬁ t margins. The second half 
saw a recovery on these two projects, which will 
improve gross proﬁ t margins to an acceptable 
level. We have been awarded additional capital 
development contracts at Impala 16, after the 
period end in March 2012, which will improve the 
overall margin at that shaft.
We progressed well with the pre-sink and 
mobilisation work at Afplats’ Leeuwkop shaft. The 
award of the contract has been done in stages 
and in March 2012 we were awarded the second 
phase of work to sink to a depth of 325.8 meters 
by September 2012. 
The Lonmin shafts at Hossy and Saffy performed 
well. Karee 3 has fallen behind plan due to past 
inefﬁ ciencies and civil construction delays but 
measures are in place to mitigate operational 
losses and avoid them in the future. Overall, the 
Lonmin projects have beneﬁ ted from additional 
capital development work being undertaken.
Work at the Styldrift project suffered low levels 
of production caused mainly by the introduction 
of new safety procedures, mechanical kibble 
handling, and was further aggravated by skilled 
labour shortages. These factors impacted 
production cycles signiﬁ cantly. Cycle times, which 
are the daily measurement for sinking progress, 
reached an unacceptable level of 60 hours for a 3 
meter advance. Production levels have improved 
in the second half of 2011 and we are currently 
performing close to planned levels of an average 
of 24 hours per 3 meters sunk, although we 
remain behind the overall project schedule. 
Our project at AngloGold Ashanti’s Moab shaft 
has performed well and is expected to reach 
completion by the end of 2012.
Work on our project at Hernic Ferrochrome’s 
Bokfontein mine continues to progress at a 
satisfactory pace and we continue to rent out our 
winders to the Kalagadi Manganese project.
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   9 26/04/2012   19:37 10
Our project at EuroChem’s potash deposit in 
Russia suffered setbacks from the extremely 
difﬁ cult underground conditions with ﬁ ne grained 
and inhomogeneous unconsolidated running 
sands combined with water, making progress 
very slow while needing to pump large quantities 
of grouting materials to seal the ingression of 
water and to stabilise the ground surrounding 
the shaft. The rate of progress was unacceptable 
to the client in the context of the broader 
mine programme and in early December 2011 
the client decided to suspend our grouting 
operations and to switch to a freezing technique 
for which the shaft is currently being prepared. 
After various proposals made by the Company 
to EuroChem, which were not accepted, we have 
decided to give advance notice of termination of 
the contract with effect from 20 April 2012. We 
expect to demobilise from the project over the 
next few months.
The carrying amounts of net assets in the Group’s 
accounts at 31 December 2011 in relation to 
this project are USD6.3 million. A further USD6.3 
million of expenditures are estimated to have been 
incurred on this project through to the date of this 
report. In addition, there remains a ﬁ xed fee of 
USD13.2 million which has not yet been recorded 
in the Group’s accounts as income as well as likely 
demobilisation and termination costs, all of which 
will be billed to EuroChem in 2012. The Board is of 
the view that the Group’s contract with EuroChem 
properly provides for the full recovery of all 
amounts incurred on the project.
In India our Teesta III hydroelectric project has 
practically come to an end. Work on the second 
surge Shaft stopped in the latter half of 2011, 80 
meters short of holing through on the second 
surge shaft, following an earthquake at the site. 
There remained very little work to complete the 
shaft at the time and this last remaining work is 
being ﬁ nalised by the client while we demobilise 
our equipment.
Our Mining Engineering and Technical 
Services (METS) division continues to ﬁ nd new 
opportunities for design and EPCM contracts. 
Most notably in 2011 it had signed a new 
feasibility study for Amari’s Kongoni manganese 
mine in the Kalahari region which now awaits 
the award of the sinking contract. This is a good 
example of the strategic value of METS to the 
business development initiatives of Shaft Sinkers. 
During 2012 we will continue to strive to improve 
safety and improve efﬁ ciency at our South African 
operations. In anticipation of new international 
contract awards we have placed emphasis on our 
operational readiness for the different regions we 
are targeting. We have introduced roles with the 
speciﬁ c task of improving our regional capabilities. 
In the CIS we established a small ofﬁ ce with 
business development and technical capabilities 
to better serve the region. We continue to 
develop our learnership candidates and provide 
constant training to our work force. In 2011 we 
have provided skills training in Sinking, Mining 
and Engineering techniques to 1,089 Category A 
employees and 2,924 Category 3-8 employees. 
We have intensiﬁ ed our emphasis on research 
and development that is required to keep us in 
line with industry requirements for safer sinking 
and mining practices. These requirements are 
aimed at the reduction of personnel at the 
bottom of the shaft and reduced exposure to high 
noise levels. Separately we have advanced funds 
for a new technology development aimed at 
transforming the archaic shaft inspection activity. 
It is mandatory to inspect the integrity of the shaft 
at regular intervals, in South Africa once a week. 
Typically this activity is carried out manually and 
is time consuming and hazardous. SightPower, 
the company developing this new technology, is 
hoping to replace this activity with an automated 
mechanised scanning device that will be much 
quicker and safer.

Financial Review
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The ﬁ nancial information presented has been 
prepared on a basis consistent with that used 
in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements 
for the 2010 ﬁ nancial year. There have been no 
changes in accounting policy or new standards 
applied which have had an effect on reported 
performance in comparison to the prior year.
In connection with the Company’s listing in 2010, 
the Group was restructured and a new Isle of 
Man holding company incorporated. We have 
used the common control method of accounting 
for the business restructuring in order to present 
Group consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
OVERVIEW
The 2011 ﬁ nancial year has largely been in line 
with our plans to continue to expand the business 
in pursuit of additional contracts and despite 
having seen some of these projects moved out 
to 2012, our actual results are ahead of our 
budgeted results before taking account of the 
exceptional item of an IPO Bonus.
The Group remains ﬁ nancially sound and despite 
the economic slow-down we have seen an ever-
increasing number of tender enquiries which 
should add to the order book in the year ahead.
The Group’s cash position remains strong after 
having utilised part of the funds raised at the 
IPO on winder refurbishment and part to expand 
working capital. We have paid a maiden interim 
dividend of 2.4p per share in October 2011 and 
the Board is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend of 
4.8p per share payable in June 2012.
The events surrounding the suspension of our 
project at EuroChem’s potash deposit in Russia 
has led to a higher inventories, trade debtors 
balances and interest free advances at 31 
December 2011. The carrying amounts of net 
assets in the Group’s accounts at 31 December 
2011 in relation to this project are USD6.3 
million. A further USD6.3 million of expenditures 
are estimated to have been incurred on this 
project through to the date of this report. In 
addition, there remains a ﬁ xed fee of USD13.2 
million which has not yet been recorded in the 
Group’s accounts as income as well as likely 
demobilisation and termination costs, all of which 
will be billed to EuroChem in 2012. The Board 
is of the view that the Group’s contract with 
EuroChem properly provides for the full recovery 
of all amounts incurred on the project.
ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
Income Statement
Proﬁ ts for the year have decreased by 31.0% in 
GBP terms after taking account of the exceptional 
items in 2010 and 2011. When considered before 
the exceptional items of a credit for contract 
settlement in 2010 of GBP3.8 million and a charge 
for IPO Bonuses in 2011 of GBP3.1 million and 
after the effective tax impacts of GBP1.1 million 
and GBP0.7 million respectively, 2011 proﬁ ts 
increased by 12.6%. The effect of the slightly 
weaker ZAR average exchange rate for the year at 
ZAR11.58 compared to an average of ZAR11.34 in 
2010 is to lower proﬁ t by GBP0.2 million. 
Revenue
Revenues grew by 23.7% in 2011, to GBP226.5 
million (2010: GBP183.1 million). The increase is 
mainly attributable to higher revenues at Lonmin’s 
Saffy and Hossy shafts where we have additional 
capital development contracts, at AngloGold 
Ashanti’s Moab shaft, Impala’s 16 shaft, Anglo 
Platinum/Royal Bafokeng’s Styldrift project with 
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   11 26/04/2012   19:37 SHAFT SINKERS REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2011

the beneﬁ t of a full year of work in 2011 having 
commenced late 2010, the newly awarded 
Leeuwkop project for Afplats and the EuroChem 
project where revenue received in advance was 
recognised following the commissioning of the 
winder, offset by lower revenues at the Teesta 
project in India drawing to a close.
Gross proﬁ t
Gross proﬁ t increased by 31.2% to GBP38.3 
million (2010: GBP29.2 million). This increase can 
be ascribed to the following factors:
•  Improved gross proﬁ t margins at Impala’s 
17 shaft;
•  Margin from the new Leeuwkop project 
for Afplats;
•  Higher gross proﬁ t margins from the Russian 
EuroChem project;
offset by:
•  Lower gross proﬁ t margins from the Teesta 
project in India as it drew to a close;
Gross proﬁ t margins in 2011 improved to 16.9% 
(2010: 15.9%). 
Operating income
Operating income increased by GBP1.4 million 
in 2011 due to a gain in foreign exchange 
differences and a loss on disposal of equipment 
in 2010. 
Operating expense
Operating expenses increased by GBP6.2 million 
due to the following factors:
•  additional costs associated with being a 
listed company; 
•  increased salary and performance 
bonus expenses;
•  an increase in the provision for potential 
doubtful debts of GBP2.1 million;
IPO Bonuses
On admission in December 2010, the Group 
announced in its Prospectus that it would pay 
an IPO Bonus to a range of middle to senior 
management in the amount of ZAR44.5 million. 
This was accounted for and paid in two tranches, 
half accruing at 30 June 2011 and the other 
half at 31 December 2011. The amount paid 
was ZAR41.9 million (equivalent to GBP3.1 
million), less than initially approved, due to some 
individuals no longer being in the Company’s 
employ on the qualifying dates.
Finance expense
In December 2010 the Group drew down on 
borrowing facilities provided by the Standard 
Bank of South Africa Limited in the amount of 
GBP24.4 million. The interest burden of this debt 
for the full ﬁ nancial year of 2011 has led to the 
increase in ﬁ nance expense to GBP2.2 million 
(2010: GBP1.6 million). The interest bearing debt 
was reduced during the ﬁ nancial year by GBP3.9 
million. The average interest rate paid on this ZAR 
debt was 9.3% for the year.
Taxation 
The South African tax rate remains unchanged 
in 2011 from 2010 at 28%. The Secondary Tax 
on Companies (STC) in South Africa is charged 
at a rate of 10% of dividends paid to persons 
outside of the South African group. In theory this 
gives an effective company tax rate of 34.56% if 
all current proﬁ ts after tax were to be declared 
as a dividend. Effective from 1 April 2012, the 
Secondary Tax on Companies was replaced by a 
dividend withholding tax of 10%.
In 2011 the Group’s effective tax rate was 35.5% 
(2010: 24.4%) reﬂ ecting the charge of STC 
amounting to GBP0.5 million on dividends from 
South African subsidiaries.
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   12 26/04/2012   19:37 13
Effect of exchange difference on translation 
from functional to presentation currency
The Group reports in GBP while the functional 
currency of the main operating subsidiaries of the 
Group is ZAR. The average rate of exchange for 
2011 was ZAR11.58 to the GBP (2010: ZAR11.34). 
The spot rate at 31 December 2011 strengthened 
even further to ZAR12.54 (2010: ZAR10.23). The 
translation of income statement items at the 
average rate for the year, monetary items in the 
balance sheet at the closing spot rate and historical 
items at historical rates, gives rise to a loss of 
GBP7.0 million (2010: gain of GBP4.7 million).
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, tax and depreciation 
for the year were GBP24.9 million (2010: 
GBP25.2million), a decrease of 1.2%. Depreciation 
was higher at GBP9.6 million (2010: GBP7.2 
million). Before exceptional items, EBITDA was 
GBP28.1 million (2010: GBP21.4 million).
Earnings per share
Earnings per share was calculated on the 47.5 
million shares in issue throughout the year. In 2010, 
earnings per share was calculated on a theoretical 
number of shares in issue for that ﬁ nancial year, 
on the basis of a common control transaction. The 
actual shares that were issued on 23 December 
2010 which were not intended to raise additional 
cash for the Company, but rather to reﬂ ect the 
number of shares that had been issued to replace 
the former holdings of International Mineral 
Resources and the former minority shareholders in 
the Group, were used as a basis for the calculation. 
Added to that was the weighted average number 
of shares issued on 23 December 2010 to raise 
additional cash for the company, weighted for a 
period of 9 days in that year.
Earnings per share decreased to 18.3 pence 
(2010: 29.8 pence), a decrease of 38.4%. The 
effect of awarding incentive shares to the 
executive directors of the Company is reﬂ ected in 
a diluted earnings per share of 18.2 pence, taking 
into account the share price at 31 December 
2010 and comparing it to the target growth in 
price of at least 13% per annum for LTIP shares to 
vest each year and a net proﬁ t target growth rate 
of 20% per annum.
Dividend policy
The Group has adopted a progressive dividend 
policy with dividends moving broadly in line with 
earnings over time. Dividends are expected to be 
paid semi-annually in respect of each year with an 
interim dividend for each year paid in September 
and a ﬁ nal dividend paid in June of the following 
year in each case subject to the satisfaction of the 
Solvency Test. 
Interim dividends are expected to represent 
around one third and ﬁ nal dividends around 
two thirds of the full year dividend for each year. 
Annual dividends per share are expected to be 
covered some 2.5–3.0 times by earnings per share. 
FINANCIAL POSITION
Total assets decreased to GBP143.8 million (2010: 
GBP162.1 million) and net assets increased to 
GBP48.0 million (2010: GBP46.5 million).
Interest-bearing debt to equity has decreased to 
33.7% (2010: 52.5%). The facilities granted to the 
Group by Standard Bank of South Africa Limited 
in December 2010 have been reduced by GBP3.9 
million in accordance with the amortisation 
schedule of the facilities.
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   13 26/04/2012   19:37 14
The Group’s net cash (deﬁ ned as interest bearing 
debt minus net cash) has decreased to GBP6.1 
million (2010: net cash of GBP11.1 million). 
This was largely due to a lack of new cash from 
advances from clients with no new major projects 
having started in 2011 and cash utilised in the 
increase in working capital, notably inventories.
The Group’s net current assets decreased 
to GBP16.8 million (2010: net current assets 
GBP24.6 million). 
PPE
New additions to plant and equipment amounted 
to GBP10.5 million (2010: GBP12.1 million). 
This was largely as a result of project plant and 
equipment still being procured for the Styldrift 
project, which only commenced towards the 
last quarter of 2010, and expenditures on the 
refurbishment of winders.
Disposals of plant and equipment in 2011 were 
GBP1.0 million (2010: GBP6.8 million, relating 
mostly to the lapsed Kalagadi Manganese project).
Inventories
Inventories increased to GBP16.2 million 
(2010: GBP8.3 million) due primarily to the 
increase in grouting materials required for the 
EuroChem project.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables decreased to 
GBP49.0 million (2010: GBP50.1 million) as a 
result of not starting any new major contracts 
in 2011. An amount of GBP2.3 million has 
been raised for impairment of trade and other 
receivables (2010: GBP0.1 million).
Order book
The Group’s order book at ﬁ nancial reporting 
period end is calculated to represent the total 
value of estimated outstanding project revenues 
for contractually committed projects, excluding 
any escalation which is typically built into the 
contracts. The order book at 31 December 2011 
amounted to GBP301.1 million (2010: GBP488.2 
million). The decrease is due to a lack of award of 
new major contracts in 2011, having consumed a 
signiﬁ cant portion of the order book by billing the 
Company’s clients during the year.
Cash
The Group ended the year with a favourable cash 
balance of GBP22.3 million (2010: GBP35.6 million). 
The cash utilisation went towards working capital 
increases of GBP18.5 million of which inventories 
accounted for GBP10.3 million and accounts 
receivable GBP10.9 million. Further, expenditures 
on interest and taxes of GBP6.5 million and 
dividends of GBP1.1 million reduced cash on hand. 
Interest bearing debt was repaid to the extent of 
GBP3.9 million. The expenditures for project-related

capital equipment of GBP10.5 million were more 
than offset by advance revenue received from 
clients in the amount of GBP12.2 million.
At 31 December 2011 the Group held its cash in 
the following currencies:
• British Pounds   
 GBP10.2 million
•  United States Dollars  
USD3.9 million   (GBP2.6 million)
•  Russian Roubles  
RUR12.3 million  (GBP0.2 million)

•  Indian Rupees   
INR2.8 million  (GBP0.01 million)
•  South African Rands  
ZAR115.7 million (GBP9.2 million)
Share capital and common control reserve
The Company was admitted to trading on the 
London Stock Exchange under the Premium 
Listing regime on 23 December 2010. Although 
the Company was established in the Isle of Man 
in October 2010, the Shaft Sinkers Group is 
considered to have remained under common 
control since its acquisition by International 
Mineral Resources BV (IMR) as major shareholder in 
November 2007 until its listing became effective.
For the purpose of presenting Group consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements, the restructuring of the Group 
with the newly-formed Isle of Man Company as the 
Holding Company, it was considered appropriate 
to use the common control method of accounting 
for the business restructuring.
Under this method, the equity at the earliest date 
of the comparative information is restated to 
reﬂ ect the shares that would have been in issue 
had the restructuring taken place at that date. In 
this case, it is assumed that the 22,817,524 shares 
which were issued on 23 December 2010 to 
reinstate the holding of IMR and the 19,437,150 
shares issued to buy out the former minority 
shareholders, were issued retrospectively at 1 
January 2009. The additional shares that were 
issued by the Company to raise cash for the 
business were treated as a new share issue from 
23 December 2010.
As the comparative balance sheet for 2009 was 
presented without further alteration besides 
equity, the difference between the lower original 
share capital at 1 January 2009 and the higher 
restated share capital gave rise to a debit reserve 
for common control, effectively arriving at the 
same net balance. 
Capitalised IPO expenses
Listing expenses in 2010 amounted to 
approximately GBP3.4 million. Of these expenses 
GBP2.3 million were capitalised as a charge to 
share capital in 2010 and the remaining GBP1.1 
million were expensed against proﬁ ts in 2010. 
The basis for the capitalisation was a prorated 
52% of costs related to the listing of shares 
other than the IMR shares and the full brokers 
commission on those shares. 
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   15 26/04/2012   19:37 16
Deferred revenue
Deferred revenue represents the revenues 
received in advance from clients in accordance 
with the Groups contracting model. Clients are 
generally required to fund the procurement of 
capital expenditures necessary for a project in 
advance of the Group procuring those assets. 
These revenues received in advance are deferred 
for recognition as and when the plant and 
equipment is brought into use on the project and 
amortised to revenue over the remaining life of 
the project.
The other expenditures on projects such as labour 
and consumable materials are billed to clients 
monthly and are generally paid within 30 days 
of  billing.
Deferred revenues in the statement of ﬁ nancial 
position decreased to GBP12.8 million (2010: 
GBP23.4 million), primarily as a result of the 
recognition of a portion of the revenues received 
in advance in earlier years without the award of 
any new major contract which would have added 
to the balance.
Deferred revenues released to proﬁ ts during 
the year amounted to GBP14.1 million (2010: 
GBP4.4 million) against cash received from clients 
for advance revenue of GBP12.2 million (2010: 
GBP15.2 million).
Interest bearing borrowings
In December 2010 the Group drew down on new 
facilities provided by the Standard Bank of South 
Africa Limited, including term debt of ZAR250.0 
million (GBP24.4 million). During the 2011 
ﬁ nancial year, a total of GBP3.9 million was repaid 
from these facilities.
The loans with Standard Bank are subject to a 
“cash sweep” (a right for the bank to receive 
an advance repayment) of an amount similar 
to any dividend distribution made by the 
wholly-owned South African subsidiaries to the 
Group shareholders. Despite the contractual 
commitment by the Company to a cash sweep, 
Standard Bank did not require a cash sweep for 
the ZAR60.0 million dividend distributed by the 
South African subsidiary to the holding company 
in 2011.
Interest-free advances from clients
Interest-free advances from clients relate to 
advances received for the funding of project 
expenditures. In Russia, the nature of the contract 
is a cost reimbursable contract with a ﬁ xed fee. Our 
client Eurochem agreed to advance funds to the 
Company for project expenditures on the basis of 
evidence of the expenditure about to be incurred, 
with a cap on the total amount of these advances, 
and for the advances to be set off against regular 
monthly billing for those same expenditures. 
Although these advances may be set off against 
amounts not yet paid by the client, they have been 
treated as loans for accounting purposes.
At 31 December 2011, total interest free 
advances outstanding amounted to GBP24.4 
million (2010: GBP19.3 million).

Internal controls and risk management
Introduction
This section explains the Group’s internal 
control environment, the process for assessing 
its effectiveness and the way in which risk is 
evaluated and managed within the Group. 
There is also a brief discussion of the principal 
risks identiﬁ ed by the Group and the mitigating 
strategies adopted.
INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Group’s internal control system comprising 
the policies, procedures and work methods 
that combine to ensure an effective and 
efﬁ cient operation. They are intended to allow 
the business to respond appropriately to 
signiﬁ cant operational, ﬁ nancial, compliance 
and other business risks facing the Group on 
a daily basis. This includes stringent safety 
procedures, procedures for the safeguarding 
of assets against loss and fraud, and managing 
exposure to liabilities where possible so as to 
ensure the sustainability of the Group’s ongoing 
business. The Group’s systems of information 
ﬂ ow are critical to ensure that no unnecessary 
risks arise from lack of or poor communication. 
The Group is vigilant to ensure it complies with 
applicable laws and regulations and keeps 
abreast of developments in these areas. The 
Group monitors the effectiveness of the systems 
of internal control on a regular basis through 
its internal audit function, the external audit 
function, an annual review of risk approved by 
the board and through ongoing reconciliations 
and reviews of ﬁ nancial transactions on a regular 
monthly basis.
The Group has complied with the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code on 
internal controls and the relevant parts of the 
Turnbull guidance for the ﬁ nancial periods 
under review. Internal controls form an integral 
part of the Group’s culture. While the system of 
internal control mitigates, it cannot eliminate 
the possibility of poor judgement in decision-
making; human error; control processes being 
deliberately circumvented by employees and 
others; management overriding controls; and 
the occurrence of unforeseeable circumstances. 
It can only therefore provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance that the control objectives 
are met, it cannot provide guaranteed protection 
against the Group failing to meet its business 
objectives or avoiding all material errors, losses, 
fraud, or breaches of laws or regulations.
Responsibilities
The board of directors acknowledges its 
responsibility for the Group’s system of internal 
control. It has set appropriate policies on internal 
control and seeks regular assurance that the 
system is functioning effectively. The board 
endeavours to ensure that the system of internal 
control is effective in managing risks in the 
manner which it has approved.
The board considers the following factors in 
determining the adequacy of the Group’s system 
of internal control:
•  the nature and extent of the risks facing 
the Group;
•  the extent and categories of risk that it 
regards as acceptable for the Group to bear;
•  the likelihood of the risks concerned 
materialising;
•  the Group’s ability to reduce the incidence 
and impact on the business of risks that may 
materialise through mitigating strategies; and
•  the costs of operating particular controls 
relative to the beneﬁ t thereby obtained in 
managing the related risks.
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   17 26/04/2012   19:37 18
Management implement policies set by the 
board on risk and control. Management identify 
and evaluate the risks faced by the Group for 
consideration by the board and design, operate 
and monitor a suitable system of internal control 
which implements the policies adopted by 
the board.
The Group’s employees share the responsibility 
for internal control as part of their accountability 
for achieving objectives. They participate in 
setting and carrying out the Group’s objectives 
and assist in designing the mitigating strategies 
to avoid the risks the Group faces.
Reviewing the effectiveness of 
internal control
The board reviews the effectiveness of internal 
control on a regular annual basis. The board 
forms its own view on the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control after due and careful 
enquiry based on the information and assurances 
provided to it. Management is accountable to 
the board for monitoring the system of internal 
control and provides assurance to the board that 
it has done so. The role of each of the board 
committees in the review process, including that 
of the audit committee, has been set out by the 
board. The various board committees report 
to the board at each quarterly board meeting 
on the matters set out in their respective terms 
of reference and the board carefully considers 
these reports. The board takes responsibility for 
the disclosures on internal control in the annual 
report and accounts.
Process of preparing consolidated accounts
The consolidation of ﬁ nancial performance and 
assets and liabilities is performed on the Group’s 
software systems which have appropriate access 
controls. All signiﬁ cant movements and unusual 
items in data which are submitted are reviewed 
by a senior member of the ﬁ nance team. Key 
consolidation journals relating to data submitted 
by Group companies are reviewed within the 
ﬁ nance department in accordance with their 
signiﬁ cance. A reconciliation and analysis of 
consolidation journals is reviewed by the Chief 
Financial Ofﬁ cer for the country concerned. 
Internal ﬁ nancial reports are produced monthly by 
the ﬁ nance department and reviewed by senior 
members of the Group’s ﬁ nance and operations 
teams and then distributed to management and 
the board.
The ﬁ nancial department produces quarterly 
instructions and an annual timetable to be 
followed by Group companies in the preparation 
of monthly and quarterly forecasts and the 
annual budget. The ﬁ nance department monitors 
compliance with the instructions and timetable 
and follow up any cases of non-compliance.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the signiﬁ cant risks 
faced by the Group that has been in place for the 
year under review and up to the date of approval 
of the annual report and accounts. This process 
is regularly reviewed by the board and is in 
accordance with the Turnbull guidance.
The executive management of the Group 
conducts regular monthly operational reviews for 
each site and for each operational department 
against measurable performance targets, budgets 
and other key performance indicators, to ensure 
risks are being communicated and managed.
Risk assessment
The principal risks faced by the Group are 
considered and formally reviewed by the board 
on an annual basis. The key risks faced by the 
Group are summarised below, without any 
speciﬁ c order of ranking.

Strategic risk
The risk of ineffective or poorly executed strategy 
failing to meet shareholder objectives is one of 
the primary risks facing the Group. The board 
gets involved in setting the broad strategic 
objectives and monitors executive management’s 
performance against these annually set goals by 
frequent communication and regular quarterly 
review of ﬁ nancial performance.
Safety risk
Due to the nature of the Group’s operations, 
a signiﬁ cant part of our risk relates to safety. A 
dedicated Safety, Health, Environment, Quality 
and Training department (SHEQT) monitors safety 
statistics and events on a daily basis. Each site 
has a dedicated safety ofﬁ cer responsible for 
managing safety matters, including monitoring 
the progress of action plans, reporting on safety 
incidents and ensuring the Group’s policies in 
this regard are being adhered to. In this way, the 
Group ensures accountability and responsibility 
for these matters remains with the operational 
management team. The Safety Committee of the 
board meets quarterly to review reports from the 
SHEQT department.
Safety is one of the cornerstones of the Group’s 
success. As a result, executive management adopt 
a daily monitoring of safety statistics with weekly 
presentations should any incident arise resulting 
in lost time injuries. The Safety Committee reviews 
the performance on a quarterly basis and reports 
to the board with recommendations should 
they be required. A comprehensive set of safety 
procedures are regularly reviewed and updated for 
any new risks identiﬁ ed. 
Financial risk
The risk of inadequately funding or 
inappropriately managing the funding of the 
business is one of the primary risks that could 
lead to ﬁ nancial adversity in an environment 
where the business is in a growth pattern. 
Regular daily reviews of cash management with 
rolling forecasts and strong controls over the 
management of cash are implemented by the 
executive management. The board sets prudent 
policies for the hedging of currency and interest 
rate risk and the Audit and Risk Committee 
reviews these aspects on a quarterly basis. 
Insurance is taken to protect the Group against 
the risk of fraud or theft of funds.
Other signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial risks include the 
safeguarding of assets, inappropriate tendering 
prices that could cause the Group to lose 
potential contracts, corrupt procurement practices 
resulting in excessive costs and mismanagement 
of expenditures. For each of these the Group 
has implemented appropriate policies and 
procedures and executive management regularly 
reviews performance against set targets. 
The Group is in the process of upgrading its 
information systems to further enhance controls, 
improve the efﬁ ciency of reporting of information 
and to ensure its tendering process has the latest 
accurate information on costs with less time and 
effort required.
Legal and regulatory breach
We are aware that some of the jurisdictions in 
which the Group operates pose particular and 
often heightened reputational issues that need 
to be managed appropriately. We are conscious 
of the risk of failure to comply with anti-bribery, 
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   19 26/04/2012   19:37 SHAFT SINKERS REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2011
20
anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and/or 
sanctions laws and regulations which could lead 
to share price devaluation, ﬁ nancial penalties and 
criminal prosecutions.
We are committed to high standards of corporate 
responsibility. We adhere to the principles of self-
regulation backed by appropriate policies and 
management review. We are developing a Group-
wide anti-bribery and corruption compliance 
function. The rolling out of an enhanced 
compliance framework is in progress.
For a further discussion on the Group’s exposure 
to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, refer 
to notes 27.1, 27.2 and 27.3 to the ﬁ nancial 
statements on pages 73 to 78.
External risk
The political, social or economic environment 
in any jurisdiction may change leading to the 
inability to realise the expected results from our 
projects. By diversifying into other industrial 
applications and geographic regions, the board 
has sought to mitigate these risks to the extent 
possible through the strategic direction of the 
business. The Group is aware of the political 
risks in some of the geographies in which it 
operates and has implemented appropriate risk 
mitigating strategies, both on a ﬁ nancial and 
legal framework level.
Operational risks
The risk of operating below best industry 
standards could lead to lost contracts in the 
long run or could lead to short-term costs to the 
Group. The contracting models of the Group 
have been established to mitigate some of these 
risks but strong disciplines within the operations 
departments and the focus on attracting and 
retaining key skills is a vital part of the strategy 
of the Group. Regular planning by executive 
management on securing the appropriate resources 
for current and future projects is part of the 
mitigating strategies constantly receiving attention 
at all levels of management and the board.
Internal audit
The Internal Audit function of the Group 
reviews the various business cycles of the 
Group throughout the year on a cyclical basis 
and follows up on all risk mitigating strategies 
identiﬁ ed for implementation at the annual risk 
planning sessions held by the Group. The Group 
has retained the services of Deloitte as internal 
auditors for the larger assignments. The Group’s 
Internal Audit Manager has a direct reporting line 
to the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee 
and also a reporting line to the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer. Internal Audit has unfettered access to all 
areas of the Group and follows an annual plan set 
by the Audit and Risk Committee. Internal Audit 
encourages employees to make use of a whistle-
blowing facility on an anonymous basis.

Sustainability Review and Corporate 
Social Investment
Introduction
T o remain at the forefront of shaft sinking and 
underground development, both in South Africa 
and abroad requires innovative strategies to 
attract and retain the best talent as well as being a 
responsible social partner in order to be sustainable 
over the long term. Investing in our people and the 
communities within which we operate are key pillars 
to ensure sustained success in a highly specialised 
and competitive environment.
While remaining at the forefront of the industry 
in terms of our remuneration levels to retain and 
attract scarce skills, this comes at a price of facing 
more severe competition on price from within 
the territories where we compete in the market 
or alternatively from competitors bidding for the 
same work at a lower cost of labour. One of the 
primary concerns to us is the safety and quality 
of our operations and our investment in people 
is testimony to our track record which often 
counts more to potential clients than the direct 
cost of labour. In the long term, a quality product 
delivered to our clients is more sustainable and 
yields better economics. 
Community
The Group has adopted a focussed approach since 
the latter part of 2009 to invest in carefully selected 
initiatives within the communities surrounding our 
operations. The focus is to create self-sustaining 
meaningful employment opportunities.
The Company has taken a multi- pronged 
approach to the development of the community 
by investing in micro-sized enterprises. Some 
initiatives have included, for example, the building 
of three fully-equipped food trailers with a view to 
providing our employees access to refreshments 
close to their place of work and at the same time 
providing employment to an entrepreneur from 
the local community. The focus is on sustainability 
which will allow the entrepreneurs to integrate 
into the local community once Shaft Sinkers has 
completed its project. 
In keeping with the focus on sustainability, 
Shaft Sinkers invests in enterprise development 
initiatives which include contributing towards 
the funding of several new businesses for 
entrepreneur development through a professional 
service provider. The types of businesses 
supported are diverse and range from wetcrete 
applications for underground operations, waste 
removal (oil recycling) to catering. 
Investment in our People 
We acknowledge that our people are the core 
asset of the business and we are therefore 
continuously exploring ways of maintaining and 
building on this asset.
Competitive salaries and bonus schemes with 
good quality beneﬁ ts are minimum requirements 
to ensure good quality skills are obtained 
and retained. The differentiating factors to be 
the employer of choice are often hidden in 
other beneﬁ ts. 
We provide for the debrieﬁ ng of staff on site by 
qualiﬁ ed psychologists in the event of a traumatic 
event and includes face-to-face counselling 
for personal issues including HIV counselling, 
professional assistance with debt management, etc.
We have two Adult Based Education Training 
(ABET) centres with two full-time ABET 
facilitators, which provides adult basic education 
to employees after work hours at our Impala and 
Lonmin projects. 
We engage full-time engineering learners 
(apprentices) in various trades to ensure a 
constant supply of these scarce resources to our 
business and to help develop the communities in 
which we operate.

Directors’ report – Business Review
THE DIRECTORS HAVE PLEASURE IN PRESENTING THE 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS OF SHAFT SINKERS 
HOLDINGS PLC (THE ‘COMPANY’ AND, TOGETHER WITH 
ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE ‘GROUP’) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 
31 DECEMBER 2011.
Principal activities
The Group is a leading diversiﬁ ed shaft sinking and underground 
excavation group providing services in the areas of shaft sinking, 
engineering design, tunnelling, large underground storage caverns, 
contract mining and mine operations. Assets are principally located 
in the Republic of South Africa, Russia and India. The Group has two 
main service divisions, shaft sinking and mining engineering technical 
services (METS) and two main segments for reporting purposes: 
South Africa and Rest of World.
Business Review
The Business Review has been prepared to provide the Company’s 
shareholders and other interested parties with a fair review of the 
business of the Group and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing it. The Business Review incorporates by reference 
into this report the following which collectively contain a discussion 
of the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development, 
performance and position of the Company’s business and the 
strategy for preserving value and for delivering objectives:
Chairman’s Statement on pages 4 and 5.
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s Statement on pages 6 to 8.
Operational Review on pages 9 and 10.
Financial Review on pages 11 to 16.
Internal Controls and Risk Management on pages 17 to 20.
2011 Key Performance Indicators on pages 21 and 22.
Sustainability Review and Corporate Social Investment on page 23.
The Business Review has been prepared to provide the Company’s 
shareholders with a fair review of the business of the Company and 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing it. It may 
not be relied upon by anyone, including the Company’s shareholders, 
for any other purpose. The Business Review is designed to provide 
shareholders with an understanding of the Company’s business and 
the environment in which it operates, and of necessity only focuses 
on material issues and facts. The omission of reporting on any speciﬁ c 
topic should not be taken as implying that it is not being addressed.
The Business Review and other sections of this report contain forward-
looking statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve 
a number of risks, uncertainties and future assumptions because they 
relate to events and / or depend on circumstances that may or may 
not occur in the future and could cause actual results and outcomes 
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-
looking statements. No assurance can be given that the forward-
looking statements in the Business Review will be realised. Statements 
about the Directors’ expectations, beliefs, hopes, plans, intentions 
and strategies are inherently subject to change and they are based on 
expectations and assumptions as to future events, circumstances and 
other factors which are in some cases outside the Company’s control. 
The information contained in the Business Review has been prepared 
on the basis of the knowledge and information available to Directors at 
the date of its preparation and the Company does not undertake any 
obligation to update or revise the Business Review during the ﬁ nancial 
year ahead. It is believed that the expectations set out in these 
forward-looking statements are reasonable, but they may be affected 
by a wide range of variables which could cause actual results or trends 
to differ materially. The forward-looking statements should be read in 
particular in the context of the speciﬁ c risk factors for the Company 
identiﬁ ed in the Business Review. The Company’s shareholders 
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking 
statements. Shareholders should note that the Business Review has not 
been audited or otherwise independently veriﬁ ed. 
Principal events of the year
The principal events of the year are covered in the Business Review. 
The key event during the year was the suspension of grouting efforts 
on the EuroChem project.
Events that led to the suspension of our grouting efforts on the 
EuroChem project and our decision to give advance notice of 
termination of the contract are more fully described in the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer’s Statement on pages 6 to 7 and the Operational 
Review on page 10. The carrying amounts of net assets after allowing 
for advance payments in the Group’s accounts at 31 December 2011 
in relation to this project are USD6.3 million. A further USD6.3 million 
of expenditures are estimated to have been incurred on this project 
through to the date of this report. In addition, there remains a ﬁ xed fee 
of USD13.2 million, which has not yet been recorded in the Group’s 
accounts as income as well as likely demobilisation and termination 
costs, all of which will be billed to EuroChem in 2012. The Board is of 
the view that the Group’s contract with EuroChem properly provides for 
the full recovery of all amounts incurred on the project. 
Dividends
The Company paid its maiden interim dividend of 2.4 pence per 
share in October 2011. In the absence of unforeseen circumstances 
and subject to shareholder approval, the Company is recommending 
a ﬁ nal dividend of 4.8 pence per share in respect of the 2011 results, 
payable in June 2012.

ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The rights 
and obligations attaching to the Company’s shares, in addition to 
those conferred on their holders by law, are set out in the Articles of

Relationship agreements
International Mineral Resources BV (“IMR”) and the Company 
entered into a relationship agreement on 20 December 2010 (the 
‘‘Relationship Agreement’’) which regulates the on-going relationship 
between IMR and the Group with a view to ensuring that the Group 
is capable of carrying on its business independently of IMR, and that 
transactions and relationships between the Group and IMR are at 
arm’s length and on a normal commercial basis.
IMR, its direct and indirect beneﬁ cial owners and any subsidiary 
(not including the Company) are referred to in this paragraph as its 
‘‘Shareholder Group’’. For the purposes of the Relationship Agreement, 
an “Independent Director” broadly means a Director of the Company 
who is not a current or recent director, ofﬁ cer, employee or shareholder 
of, or consultant to, or a person having a relationship, association or 
interest which is material to him with or in, or who has been nominated 
by IMR or any associate (as deﬁ ned in the Relationship Agreement) of 
IMR or with or in any person having a relationship which is material to it 
or him with IMR or any associate of IMR.
Under the Relationship Agreement, IMR and the Company agree, 
inter alia, that:
(a)   IMR shall not vote on any shareholder resolution that is required 
pursuant to applicable law or regulation to alter the Company’s 
Articles or Memorandum of Association which would be contrary 
to the maintenance of the Company’s ability to manage and run 
its business independently of IMR and the Shareholder Group, 
unless such resolution is supported by the votes of the majority of 
Independent Directors;
(b)   there shall at all times be a majority of Independent Directors 
on the Board, whose number shall not be less than the number 
of directors nominated by IMR. In addition, the number of 
non-executive Independent Directors shall not be less than the 
number of non-Independent Directors. IMR shall exercise the 
voting rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares held from time to 
time, directly or indirectly by it and/or by any of its Shareholder 
Group (and shall use reasonable efforts to procure, so far as it 
is able, that the non-Independent Directors shall exercise their 
voting rights on the board) so that if it becomes aware that an 
Independent Director ceases to be an Independent Director 
of the Company for any reason, that Independent Director will 
(insofar as may be necessary to ensure that there continues to 
be a majority of Independent Directors on the Board and that 
the number of non-executive Independent Directors shall not be 
less than the number of non-Independent Directors) be replaced 
or supplemented as the case may be by a new executive or 
non-executive director, as the case may be, who is also an 
Independent Director;

26
(c)   save to the extent required by law or as otherwise contemplated 
in the Relationship Agreement, they shall exercise their powers 
in a manner which shall not prevent the Company from being 
managed in accordance with the principles and provisions set out 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code;
(d)   they shall, and shall respectively use reasonable efforts to procure 
that all subsidiaries of IMR and the Company respectively shall, 
conduct all transactions and relationships with IMR and all 
subsidiaries of IMR (as the case may be) on arms’ length terms;
(e)   no material agreement, arrangement or transaction between the 
Group and any associate of the Controlling Shareholder shall be 
entered into, novated, varied, abrogated nor shall any agreement 
be materially amended unless approved by a resolution of the 
Board which has been voted for by a majority of the Independent 
Directors. The Group must enforce the terms of agreements with 
IMR and associates of IMR unless there is a bona ﬁ de commercial 
reason not to do so and such action has been approved by 
resolution of the Board which has been voted for by a majority of 
the Independent Directors;
(f)   if, within ﬁ ve years of the date on which the Relationship 
Agreement is executed, IMR is presented with an opportunity to 
develop or acquire a business principally concerned with shaft 
sinking, it will ﬁ rst offer to the Company the chance to take up 
such opportunity (and if the Company does not conﬁ rm in writing 
within 14 days of being so informed that it wishes to pursue the 
opportunity then it shall be deemed to have declined it); and
(g)   save where the approval of the Board has been given, IMR shall 
not, and shall procure that no other member of its Shareholder 
Group shall, recruit, solicit or entice any senior employee (of the 
Company or any member of its group) with a salary in excess of 
GBP100,000. This prohibition shall not apply where such senior 
employee independently approaches IMR. 
IMR shall have the right to appoint two directors to the board so 
long as it, its group or its Shareholder Group controls 25 per cent. or 
more of the voting rights at general meetings of the Company. Where 
such percentage control is 15 per cent. or more (but less than 25 per 
cent.), the right is to appoint one director. 
At the date of this report the only director appointed by IMR is Mr. 
Amre Youness.
Relations with shareholders
The Group aims to provide a high level of transparency and 
communication to investors and analysts on a regular and timely 
basis, through announcements, meetings and seminars. The Group 
seeks to develop a regular dialogue with investors and analysts and 
to respond to their challenges and to understand their sentiments 
and concerns.
All shareholders have the opportunity to attend and raise questions at 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting. The Group aspires to have 
an investor relations programme that meets the aspirations of all of its 
current and potential shareholders and that lends itself to the growth 
of the Group’s business and future sustainability.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer aim to meet 
all major shareholders at least twice a year and to meet with a 
wide range of shareholders and prospective investors in the United 
Kingdom. These discussions will focus on the results and businesses 
of the Group but will also seek to learn of any concerns amongst 
investors and to gain a deeper understanding of their strategic 
objectives. The Group will also seek to meet with sell-side analysts to 
raise the Group’s proﬁ le and to build the research coverage.
The Chairman and non-executive Directors are encouraged to attend 
investor relations meetings or to request meetings with investors 
or analysts independent of the Group’s management. The Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director, Stephen Oke, remains available 
to shareholders and encourages a dialogue between shareholders 
and the Company.
Transactions with Related Parties
Loans to and from related parties are disclosed in note 22 to the 
annual ﬁ nancial statements. Loans amounting to ZAR7.4 million 
(GBP0.7 million) previously made by the Group’s subsidiaries Shaft 
Sinkers (Pty) Limited and Capstone 615 (Pty) Limited to Mmakau 
Mining (Pty) Limited for the acquisition of shares in Shaft Sinkers (Pty) 
Limited and for the acquisition of shares in Alpha Resources Limited, 
a previously held investment of the Group, were both repaid during 
the 2010 ﬁ nancial year. Loans of ZAR5.0 million (GBP0.5 million) 
were made by Shaft Sinkers (Pty) Limited to IMR South Africa (Pty) 
Limited in the 2010 ﬁ nancial year prior to admission by the Company 
to trading on the London Stock Exchange. These loans have been 
repaid in 2011. Loans made by IMR BV to Capstone 615 (Pty) Limited 
in 2007 for the acquisition of shares in Shaft Sinkers (Pty) Limited to 
the extent of ZAR5.0 million (GBP0.5 million) at 31 December 2010 
were repaid to IMR BV in 2011. 
Employees
The Group employed approximately 7,100 people as at the end 
of the 2011 ﬁ nancial year. Further information about employees is 
disclosed in the Sustainability Review on page 23.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy is to agree terms of trading with suppliers in 
advance and to make payment in accordance with these terms. The 
Group does not follow any speciﬁ c published code or standard on 
payment practice. Suppliers in Russia often require prepayment while 
the standard terms in South Africa to which the group generally 
adheres are typically 30 days after month-end statement.

Post balance sheet events
The directors are not aware of any other matter or circumstance not 
disclosed in this report and arising since the end of the ﬁ nancial 
year, not otherwise dealt with in the annual ﬁ nancial statements, 
which signiﬁ cantly affects the ﬁ nancial position at 31 December 2011 
or the results of the Group’s operations or cash ﬂ ows for the year 
then ended.
Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s ﬁ nancial risk management, objectives and 
policies, are described in the Internal Controls and Risk Management 
Report on page 19 and in note 27 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements on pages 73 to 78.
Charitable and political donations
No political donations were made during the year and no donations 
were made to any political party, representative or candidate in any 
part of the world. During the year, the Group pledged a donation to 
the Bhavishya Bharat fund for the rehabilitation of the earth-quake 
struck Sikkim province in India. Furthermore, the Group funded a 
number of long term corporate social investment projects in South 
Africa as part of its corporate social responsibility programme. Refer 
also to the Sustainability Review which can be found on page 23 of 
this annual report.
Signiﬁ cant agreements and other potential legal 
impediments
The following represent signiﬁ cant agreements and other potential 
legal impediments which may entitle the counterparties to exercise 
termination or other rights in the event of a change of control of the 
Company. The remaining essential contractual arrangements can be 
summarised as follows:
•   Contracts for the purchase of inputs – while most of the supplies 
needed to operate the Group’s projects are secured through 
competitive tendering in the open market, the Group in South 
Africa is largely dependent on Scaw Metals for the supply of 
winder ropes.
Financing arrangements – the Company and Group have a number 
of bank facilities which we believe could be replaced in the open 
market.
•   Contracts relating to labour and services – the principal 
arrangements essential to the Group’s business in South Africa 
are collective agreements with trade unions representing the 
majority of the Group’s employees, most notably with the 
National Union of Mineworkers in South Africa.
Signiﬁ cant Agreements – change of control
A number of agreements take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, such as 
borrowing facilities and contracts with clients. These are deemed to 
be signiﬁ cant to the Group’s business. The Group’s banking facilities 
with Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (“Standard Bank”)
amounting to ZAR250 million (GBP19.9 million) require the approval 
of Standard Bank in the event of a change of ultimate control of its 
subsidiaries, Shaft Sinkers (Pty) Limited or Capstone 615 (Pty) Limited. 
The Group does not have agreements with any Director or employee 
that would provide compensation for loss of ofﬁ ce or employment 
resulting from a takeover.
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
The Group’s external auditors, KPMG Audit LLC, have indicated their 
willingness to continue in ofﬁ ce and a resolution seeking to reappoint 
them will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. Each of the Directors 
at the date of approval of this report conﬁ rms that:
1)   so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
2)   the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware 
of the information.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectations 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the ﬁ nancial statements.
The underlying assumptions and considerations in arriving at this 
conclusion include: the Group’s favourable net cash position at 31 
December 2011, the business model adopted by the Group whereby 
clients are required to pay for the major project capital expenditures 
in advance and the policy adopted for several major projects being 
on a cost plus basis. The controls around cash management referred 
to under Financial Risk on page 19 and the facilities afforded to the 
Group by its bankers as referred to in note 20 on pages 68 and 69 
add further support these assumptions.

Directors’ report – Corporate Governance
Compliance with the Code
Shaft Sinkers Holdings plc is committed to high standards of 
corporate governance. This report details how the Company 
has applied the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) which was published in June 2010 by 
the Financial Reporting Council and which applies to the Company 
since 1 January 2011. Throughout the Company’s reporting period 
ended 31 December 2011, the Company has been in compliance 
with the provisions of the Code with the exception of Provision 
A.3.1, which requires that: ‘The Chairman should on appointment 
meet the independence criteria set out in B.1.1’. The independence 
criteria in B.1.1 includes, amongst other factors, determining whether 
a director has, or has had within the last three years, a material 
business relationship with the company either directly, or as a partner, 
shareholder, director or senior employee of a body that has such a 
relationship with the company.
Mr. Amre Youness, the Chairman of the Group, is also the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer of IMR Management Services Limited, a company 
related to IMR BV which is a major shareholder in the Company, and 
is therefore not independent. The Board, however, is of the view that 
Mr. Youness possesses the requisite leadership skills and experience 
in the mining industry and that the retention of his expertise is of 
signiﬁ cant importance in the Group’s continuing success and growth. 
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for promoting the long-term success of 
the Company and ensuring that its principal aim is to enhance the 
Company’s long-term value for the beneﬁ t of shareholders, whilst 
having regard to the interests of other stakeholders. At its regular 
meetings the Board reviews the Group’s long-term strategic direction, 
capital expenditure and budget plans and monitors on a regular basis 
the Company’s operating and ﬁ nancial performance and its approach 
to risk management and Corporate Governance. In addition, it agrees 
key objectives for the Chief Executive on an annual basis and will 
monitor performance against these. The Board evaluates critically 
on a regular basis its own performance, that of its committees 
and individual Directors. The Board also reviews management 
performance and succession planning and assesses whether the 
Group has the necessary resources in place to meet its objectives.

Directors
Details of the current Directors of the Company and their biographies 
are set out on pages 2 and 3.
Current directors were reappointed on 8 June 2011. Details of 
reappointment and resignation of directors are as follows:
•  Amre Youness was reappointed Non-executive Chairman of the 
Group
•  Stephen Oke was reappointed Senior Independent Non-

Under the Company’s Articles of Association, directors retire by 
rotation and all Directors are subject to election at the ﬁ rst Annual 
General Meeting after their appointment and to re-election at intervals 
of no more than three years. In accordance with the recommendations 
and requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code of June 2010 
published by the Financial Reporting Council (the “Code”), all directors 
should be subject to annual election by the shareholders, unless the 
company is a smaller company below the FTSE 350. The Chairman 
conﬁ rms that, although no formal internal performance evaluation has 
as yet been carried out due to the recent composition of the board and 
listing of the Company on the London Stock Exchange, each of the 
current directors’ individual performance continues to be effective and 
to demonstrate commitment to the role. 
Directors are appointed and may be removed in accordance with the 
Articles of Association of the Company and the provisions of the Isle 
of Man Companies Act 2006. The Board believed that each director 
who sought election on 8 June 2011 was an effective member of 
the Board and demonstrated commitment to their respective role. 
Further details and biographical information can be found on pages 2 
and 3 of this annual report.
The board considers that Stephen Oke, Roger Williams and 
Ian Watson are independent directors in accordance with the 
requirements of the Code. The terms and conditions of their 
appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
address.

Board responsibility and accountability
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board and sets 
the agenda for all Board meetings. The Chairman also ensures the 
effectiveness of the Board on all aspects of its role. The Non-Executive 
Directors assist in setting the overall strategy of the Group and 
maintaining a sound risk management and internal control systems. 
The Board is provided with regular, timely and relevant information in a 
form that enables it to discharge its duties. Board papers are generally 
distributed ﬁ ve days in advance of meetings to enable directors to 
obtain a thorough understanding of the matters to be discussed. 
The Board strives to meet quarterly to assess the performance of the 
Group. All directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising the Board on 
corporate governance matters and ensuring that board procedures and 
applicable laws and regulations are followed. The Company Secretary 
provides regular updates to the Board on the legal and regulatory 
environment and assists in providing any training needs of the Board. 
The Company ensures that related party transactions are identiﬁ ed, 
disclosed and a regular report is presented to the Board for approval. 
All directors declare their interests in other businesses on appointment 
to the Board and a review of any conﬂ icts of interest is carried out at 
each Board meeting. On appointment, directors are provided with 
adequate information to ensure that they fully understand the business 
of the Group and their legal and regulatory responsibilities as a director 
of the Company. The Board undertakes an annual review of its own 
performance.
The Board has put in place a procedure whereby all Directors 
have access, through the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer or the Company 
Secretary, to independent professional advice at the expense of 
the Company. The Company also maintains an appropriate level of 
Directors’ and Ofﬁ cers’ liability insurance. 
Board evaluation
The Board is recently formed and has not yet carried out a formal 
evaluation of its performance. It has adopted a policy that it shall 
monitor on a regular basis the Group’s performance against an 
agreed strategy and business plan. In addition, it shall agree key 
objectives for the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer on an annual basis and will 
monitor performance against these.
The Board shall also evaluate critically on a regular basis, 
commencing in 2012, its own performance, that of its committees 
and individual Directors.
Board Committees
The Board has established four principal committees as follows:
Nominations  Remuneration Audit Safety
Committee Committee Committee Committee
Chaired by
Amre Youness Stephen Oke Roger Williams Ian Watson
Other members 
Stephen Oke Roger Williams Stephen Oke Stephen Oke
Roger Williams Ian Watson Ian Watson
Audit Committee
Each member of the Audit Committee is considered to have 
extensive commercial and business leadership experience. In 
particular, Roger Williams and Stephen Oke have relevant and recent 
ﬁ nancial skills and experience. 
Under its terms of reference which are available from the Company 
Secretary, the Audit Committee shall consist of at least three 
members all of whom shall be independent non-executive directors. 
The Chairman of the Board shall not be a member of the Committee. 
Only members of the Audit Committee have the right to attend and 
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   31 26/04/2012   19:37 SHAFT SINKERS REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2011
32
vote at Committee meetings. However, other individuals such as 
the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer, other directors, the head of internal audit and representatives 
from the ﬁ nance function may be invited to attend all or part of any 
meeting as and when appropriate. The external auditors will be 
invited to attend meetings of the Committee on a regular basis.
Appointments to the Committee shall be for a period of up to 
three years, which may be extended for further three year periods, 
provided the director remains independent.
The Company Secretary or their nominee shall act as the secretary 
of the Committee. The Secretary shall also act as a co-ordinating 
intermediary between the Board and the Committee.
The primary responsibilities of the Audit Committee include the 
following:
• to monitor the integrity of the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements;
•   to review the Group’s internal control and risk management 
systems;
•   to review the Group’s whistle blowing and fraud prevention 
procedures;
•   to review the Group’s systems and controls for the prevention of 
fraud and bribery and receive reports on non-compliance;
•   to monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit 
function; and
•   to oversee the relationship with the Group’s external auditors.
External audit
The overall performance of the external auditors is reviewed annually 
by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible to the 
Board for ensuring that the external auditors remain independent 
of the Company in all material respects and that KPMG Audit LLC, 
as external auditors, are adequately resourced so as to enable 
the delivery of an objective audit to the shareholders. The Audit 
Committee is also responsible for making formal recommendations 
each year to the Board in respect of the continuation of the external 
auditors in ofﬁ ce. KPMG have been the Group’s auditors since 2007 
and before it was listed on the London Stock Exchange in December 
2010. The Group underwent a formal tendering process in 2008 and 
KPMG was chosen as the Group’s worldwide auditors. The Audit 
Committee is satisﬁ ed with their effectiveness and independence. 
Accordingly, the Audit Committee has not considered it necessary to 
require the ﬁ rm to tender for its audit work. The external auditors are 
required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group and 
subsidiary audits every ﬁ ve years and the current lead partner has 
been in place for the ﬁ rst time from the 2010 ﬁ nancial year.
The Audit Committee also reviews the level and nature of any non-
audit work to be performed during the year and considers whether it 
is appropriate for this work to be carried out by the external auditors. 
The external auditors are precluded from engaging in non-audit 
services that would compromise their independence and objectivity 
or violate any laws or regulations affecting their appointment as 
external auditors.
Internal Audit
The head of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee at each 
of its meetings of the principal subsidiary of the Group and provides 
assurance, independent of the assurance provided by the Chief 
Financial Ofﬁ cer, that control activities, which have been subject to 
audit by his team, are operating effectively.
The Internal Audit function follows an Internal Audit Charter, 
approved by the Committee and has contributed towards the 
improvement of the Group’s internal control systems. The basis 
of the Internal Audit Charter states that the head of Internal Audit 
is accountable to the Audit Committee and is to provide Group 
management with the objective of providing positive assurance on 
the effectiveness of internal controls in mitigating inherent risks of 
audited processes or signiﬁ cant projects or initiatives. The Internal 
Audit function has, through the services of Deloitte, a whistle-blowing 
policy which enables employees to raise any concerns they may have 
about workplace fraud or mismanagement with local management 
on a conﬁ dential basis. The complaint is then investigated in the 
ﬁ rst instance and a decision taken about further steps. Feedback is 
provided to the person making the complaint. Written records are 
kept of all whistle-blowing incidents and a regular status report is 
presented at each Audit Committee meeting.
Safety Committee
The Safety Committee is chaired by Ian Watson and its other member 
is Stephen Oke. The committee will meet at least twice a year and has 
responsibility for making recommendations to the Board to ensure a safe 
and healthy workplace is created and maintained for all employees.
The role of the Safety Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight 
of the following:
•  safety, health, environment, quality and training;
•   the Group’s compliance with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements associated with health, safety, environment and 
training matters;
•   the Group’s performance in relation to health, safety, environment 
and training and monitoring sustainable development; and
•   the preparation of a report by the Committee to be included in 
the Annual Report.

33
Further details of the work of the Safety Committee are set out in the 
Sustainability Review on page 23.
Nomination Committee
The Nominations Committee shall consist of not less than three 
members. A majority of the members shall be unconnected with 
the management of the Group and free from any business or other 
relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgement. The Chairman of the Committee shall be 
either the Chairman of the Board or an independent non-executive 
director who shall be appointed by the Board. The Chairman of 
the Board shall not chair the Committee when it is dealing with the 
matter of succession to the chairmanship. Appointments to the 
Committee shall be for a period of up to three years, which may be 
extended for a further three year periods, provided the majority of 
the committee remains independent.
Only members of the Committee shall have the right to attend and 
vote at Committee meetings. However, other individuals such as 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer of the Company, the Company’s head 
of human resources and external advisers of the Company may 
be invited to attend for all or part of any meeting as and when 
appropriate. The Committee shall meet at least twice a year and at 
such other times as the Chairman of the Committee shall require.
The main duties of the Nominations Committee include:
•   to regularly review the structure, size, diversity and composition 
of the Board and make recommendations to the Board with

other senior executives;

including the time commitment expected;
•   to review the results of the board performance evaluation process 
that relates to the composition of the board, and;

regarding the appointments to the various committees.
Remuneration Committee
The role of the Committee is to establish a framework for setting and 
maintaining at appropriate levels the remuneration of the Group’s 
executive directors and senior management in general and for setting 
the remuneration for the executive directors in particular.
The Committee shall be made up of at least three members, all of 
whom shall be independent non-executive directors. The Chairman 
of the Board may also serve on the committee as an additional 
member if he or she was considered independent on appointment as 
Chairman. The Chairman of the Board shall not be chairman of the 
committee. Appointments to the Remuneration Committee shall be 
for a period of up to three years, which may be extended for further 
three-year periods, provided the director still meets the criteria for 
membership of the committee.
Only members of the Remuneration Committee have the right to 
attend and vote at Committee meetings. However, other individuals 
such as the Chief Executive, the head of human resources and 
external advisers may be invited to attend for all or part of any 
meeting as and when appropriate.
No member of the Board (or of the Remuneration Committee) shall 
attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee where his or her 
own remuneration arrangements are determined.

•  to determine and agree with the Board the framework or broad 
policy for the remuneration of the Group’s Chief Executive

The Directors have pleasure in presenting their report on Directors’ 
remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a formal committee of the Board. Its 
remit is set out in terms of reference formally adopted by the Board in 
December 2010. The terms of reference are designed to enable the 
Committee to comply with the requirements relating to remuneration 
policy set out in the Code. A copy of the terms of reference can be 
obtained from the Company Secretary.
The principal responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are:
•  to determine and agree with the Board the framework or broad 
policy for the remuneration of the Group’s Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, 
Chairman, the executive directors, the Company Secretary 
and such other members of the executive management as it is 
designated to consider;
•  to review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the 
remuneration policy;
•  to approve the design of, and determine targets and upper limits for, 
any performance related pay schemes operated by the Group and

•  to review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by 
the Board and shareholders. For any such plans, determine each 
year whether awards will be made, and if so, the overall amount 
of such awards, the individual awards to executive directors and 
other senior executives and the performance targets to be used.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee, all of whom are independent non-
executive directors and were appointed on 19 November 2010, are 
as follows:
•  Stephen Oke (Chairman)
•  Roger Williams
•  Ian Watson
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. The 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and the head of human resources and 
external advisors also attend Committee meetings by invitation, but 
none is present when the Committee discusses issues relating to their 
own remuneration.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has retained the services of Kepler 
Associates in 2011 and 2012 to carry out a review of the senior 
executive remuneration and to provide advice in relation to the Long 
Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). Other than as described above, no other 
service was provided by Kepler Associates to the Group during the 
2010 and 2011 ﬁ nancial years. Kepler Associates have no connection 
with the Group other than as consultants.
Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy is focused upon providing a level of 
remuneration which attracts, retains and motivates Directors and senior 
executives of sufﬁ cient calibre to achieve the Group’s strategic goals 
and enhance shareholder value, whilst ensuring that remuneration is 
consistent with best practice and provides an appropriate alignment 
with personal and business performance. The Committee recognises 
that there is a competitive market for successful executives with 
experience in the mining industry and that the provision of appropriate 
rewards for superior performance is important for the continued growth 
of the business. The Committee’s aim in formulating remuneration 
policy is to assess relevant benchmark data from sources such as other 
companies listed on the London Stock Exchange of a similar size and 
complexity, international mining companies and the market generally. 
In setting remuneration within this framework, the Committee aims to 
give senior executives every encouragement to enhance the Group’s 
performance whilst ensuring that they are fairly, but responsibly, 
rewarded for their personal contributions. 
The Committee believes that it is important to benchmark the 
remuneration packages of senior executives. In April 2011, the 
Committee instructed Kepler Associates to carry out a review of 
senior executive remuneration packages and the incentive schemes in 
place for other senior managers. A similar review was again requested 
in April 2012.
Components of Executive Directors’ remuneration
Remuneration packages are structured to provide an appropriate 
balance between ﬁ xed and variable elements. The main components 
of the two Executive Directors’ and one former executive director’s 
remuneration and the percentage of each element as part of the 
total package are detailed below. The Group Chief Operating Ofﬁ cer 
position was vacated and remains so since the resignation of Robert 
Schroder which became effective 31 December 2011 following his 
notice period.

These charts have been calculated on amounts earned in 2011 and 
exclude the once-off IPO bonus awarded for 2011. The LTIP award 
value is the amount expensed based on a Monte Carlo simulation of 
the value in 2011 since its award in December 2010. The CEO was 
formerly employed in a different capacity by the Group. From 2011 his 
remuneration structure fell in line with the other executive directors. 
Salaries
Salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee and take account of 
the relevant benchmark data, pay quantum and structure.
Bonuses
For the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010, the performance 
measures for the annual bonus were based on a Group ﬁ nancial 
performance target and on personal performance. The bonus 
arising from the performance target is up to 75% of annual salary 
for the Chief Operating Ofﬁ cer and 50% of annual salary for the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer with a potential to earn an additional 15% if 
targets are exceeded by 10%. If performance is 10% below target, 
no target performance bonus is paid. In 2011 and 2010 the targets 
were exceeded by more than 10%. The bonus arising from personal 
performance is up to 15% of annual salary for the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer, the Chief Operating Ofﬁ cer and the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer. 
Speciﬁ c ﬁ nancial targets have not been disclosed as they are 
considered to be commercially conﬁ dential but they are deemed 
to be appropriately challenging. The personal performance bonus 
is paid in December of the same year of measurement, while the 
ﬁ nancial performance target bonus is deferred for 1 year and paid in 
December of the year following measurement. The Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer was not part of the bonus scheme up to 31 December 2010 
but has participated from 1 January 2011.
Provident fund
The Group’s principal subsidiary, Shaft Sinkers (Pty) Limited, 
contributes towards a Provident Fund. The Fund is a deﬁ ned 
contribution fund. The Group contributes 15% of a base salary for 
each eligible member.
IPO Bonus
Pursuant to admission to trading on the London Stock Exchange, 
the Group declared a bonus (“IPO Bonus”) of an estimated ZAR44.5 
million (GBP4.4 million) of which an estimate ZAR13.4 million (GBP1.3 
million) would be paid to executive directors and senior management 
and an estimated ZAR31.1 million (GBP3.1 million) to other 
employees. These employees were to receive two cash payments, 
the ﬁ rst payment six months following admission (June 2011) and 
the second payment one year following admission (December 2011), 
conditional in each such case on continued employment by the 
Group at that date. The executive directors received their IPO bonus 
as follows:

Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The LTIP allows the Committee to make awards which are 
a conditional right to receive shares in the Company for nil 
consideration. An award will normally vest (i.e. become exercisable) 
over a three year period from the date of its grant with a third being 
eligible for vesting each year to the extent that the applicable 
performance conditions have been satisﬁ ed. Beneﬁ ts in the LTIP are 
not pensionable.
The initial awards of 2,250,000 ordinary shares in the Company were 
made as to 750,000 to Alon Davidov, 750,000 to Robert Schroder 
and 750,000 to Christopher Hall. Following the resignation of Robert 
Schroder in 2011, he has forfeited his rights to receive these LTIP 
shares. The LTIP consists of a total of 2,500,000 Ordinary Shares. The 
Remuneration Committee will determine the allocation and offer of 
awards over the balance of 250,000 Ordinary Shares.
The total number of Ordinary Shares issued under the LTIP on 
any date of issue, when aggregated with the number of Ordinary 
Shares issued or issuable under any other share scheme for senior 
employees of the Group in any rolling ten year period, may not 
exceed ﬁ ve per cent of the Company’s issued Ordinary Shares.
If an award is forfeited or becomes incapable of vesting, the Ordinary 
Shares subject to that award may not be reallocated for future awards.
The performance conditions applicable to these initial awards are 
measured in stages over each of the vesting periods and are linked to:
•   growth in earnings per share of the Company (‘‘EPS’’); and
•   growth in the Company’s share price.
EPS: In respect of the ﬁ nancial year ending 31 December 2011 and 
for each of the ﬁ nancial years ending 31 December 2012 and 31 
December 2013, the Company will need to achieve growth in EPS of 
at least 20 per cent per annum in comparison to the previous ﬁ nancial 
year for the relevant proportion of awards to be capable of vesting 
225014 Shaft_Sinkers_R&A_2012_pages.indd   36 26/04/2012   19:37 SHAFT SINKERS REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2011
37
in full. Should the Company only achieve between 10-20 per cent 
per annum growth in EPS in the ﬁ nancial year under measurement, 
between 50-100 per cent of the relevant proportion of awards will 
be capable of vesting on a straight line basis between those two 
growth points. Should the Company not achieve at least 10 per cent 
per annum growth in EPS in the ﬁ nancial year under measurement, 
none of the relevant proportion of awards will be capable of vesting. 
If, however, over the full three years’ vesting periods the Company 
has achieved a compound average growth in EPS of 20 per cent per 
annum despite not having achieved that growth rate in any particular 
ﬁ nancial year, then the EPS performance criteria shall be deemed to 
have been achieved and awards shall be capable of vesting in full.
Share Price: In respect of the ﬁ nancial year ending 31 December 
2011 and for each of the ﬁ nancial years ending 31 December 2012 
and 31 December 2013, the Company will need to achieve a growth 
in its share price of at least 26 per cent per annum for the relevant 
proportion of awards to be capable of vesting in full. The base 
share price for the ﬁ nancial year ending 31 December 2011 shall be 
the Placing Price (124 pence) and thereafter any increase shall be 
measured by reference to the average of the Company’s closing share 
prices for the 30 days following the announcement of the Company’s 
audited results for each ﬁ nancial year. Should the Company only 
achieve between 13-26 per cent per annum growth in its share price 
in the ﬁ nancial year under measurement, between 50-100 per cent 
of the relevant proportion of awards will be capable of vesting on 
a straight line basis between those two growth points. Should the 
Company not achieve at least 13 per cent per annum growth in 
share price in the ﬁ nancial year under measurement, none of the 
relevant proportion of awards will be capable of vesting. If, however, 
the average of the Company’s closing share prices over the 30 days 
following announcement of the Company’s audited results for the 
year ending 31 December 2013 is 100 per cent or more above the 
Placing Price, despite not having achieved a 26 per cent growth in its 
share price in any particular year, then the share price performance 
criteria shall be deemed to have been achieved and awards shall be 
capable of vesting in full.
Each award is split into three equal annual tranches. Within each 
annual tranche, vesting of 50 per cent of that tranche will be subject 
to the EPS performance criteria and 50 per cent to the share price 
performance criteria. The Remuneration Committee will determine 
whether and to what extent the applicable performance conditions 
have been satisﬁ ed shortly after the announcement of the Company’s 
audited results for each of the years ending 31 December 2011, 
31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 respectively, (and, if 
applicable, to total EPS or share price growth over the full 3 year 
vesting period).
The Remuneration Committee may, at any time, amend the LTIP 
in any respect provided that the prior approval of the Company in 
general meeting is obtained for amendments to the provisions of 
the LTIP relating to eligibility, the overall limits on the issue of new 
shares, the maximum entitlement for any participant and the basis for 
determining that entitlement where such changes are to the material 
advantage of participants. Shareholder approval is not, however, 
required for minor amendments to beneﬁ t the administration of the 
LTIP , to take account of changes in legislation or to obtain or maintain 
favourable taxation or regulatory treatment for participants or for any 
member of the Group.
The grant date fair value of the LTIP was measured based on the 
Monte Carlo Simulation option pricing model. Volatility was based on 
the historical share price data of the constituents of the Oil services 
and equipment sector on the London Stock Exchange. The inputs 
used in the measurement of the fair values at grant date of the LTIP 
were as follows:

DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS
Executive Directors
The executive directors have service agreements which can be 
terminated by either the Group or the executive director giving 
at least 6 months’ notice. Under the terms of the agreements, the 
Group reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to terminate an 
executive director’s employment by making a payment in lieu of 
notice. In the event of a contract being terminated, the Remuneration 
Committee would determine the level of any compensation to be 
paid, normally by reference to ﬁ xed elements of remuneration and 
the notice period. Any annual bonus payment or vesting of shares 
under the LTIP would be dealt with in accordance with the rules of 
the particular scheme. Payments would normally be pro-rated and 
subject to the performance conditions under which the awards were 
granted. The executive directors are subject to restrictive covenants 
which seek to prevent them from soliciting customers or employees 
and/or competing with the Company’s business for six months 
following termination of employment.
Dates of the service agreements are:
Name Date of agreement Notice period
Alon Davidov 20 December 2010 6 months
Christopher Hall 20 December 2010 6 months
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive directors do not have service agreements with the 
Company, but each has a Letter of Appointment. Details of the 
Letters of Appointment are summarised below.
Name Effective date of appointment Unexpired term
Amre Youness 20 December 2010 2 years
Stephen Oke 20 December 2010 2 years
Roger Williams 20 December 2010 2 years
Ian Watson 20 December 2010 2 years
The unexpired term is subject to re-election at the AGM of the 
Company following the 3rd anniversary of appointment.
Copies of all executive directors’ service agreements and the 
Letters of Appointment of the non-executive directors are available 
for inspection during normal business hours at the ofﬁ ce of the 
Company Secretary.
Non-executive Directors’ fees
The remuneration of the non-executive directors (other than the 
Chairman) is a matter for the Chairman and the executive directors. 
Fees are designed to ensure that the Company attracts and retains 
high calibre individuals. They are reviewed on an annual basis 
and account is taken of the level of fees paid by other companies 
of a similar size and complexity. Non-executive directors do not 
participate in any annual bonus plan, long-term incentive plan or 
pension arrangements. 
Directors’ fees, including Committee fees, on an annual basis are 
as  follows:
  Annual fees payable
Non-executive director Position GBP

Statement of directors’ responsibility for the 
annual report and accounts
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors Report and the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. In addition, the directors have elected 
to prepare the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board.
The ﬁ nancial statements are required to give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and of the proﬁ t or loss of the Group 
for that period. 
In preparing these ﬁ nancial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
•  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards; and
•  prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Parent 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that are sufﬁ cient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time its 
ﬁ nancial position. They have general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and ﬁ nancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of 
ﬁ nancial statements may differ from one jurisdiction to another.
The Directors conﬁ rm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the ﬁ nancial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and just 
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t or loss of 
the Group; and
•  the Directors Report includes a fair view of the development and 
performance of the business and position of the Group, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that the 
Group faces.

Independent auditors’ report
REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, KPMG AUDIT 
LLC, TO THE MEMBERS OF SHAFT SINKERS HOLDINGS PLC
We have audited the ﬁ nancial statements of Shaft Sinkers Holdings 
plc for the period ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the 
Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Statements 
of Financial Position, the Group Statement of Cash Flows and the 
Group Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes. 
The ﬁ nancial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IFRS’s).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 40, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of ﬁ nancial statements that give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion on, the ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements sufﬁ cient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁ nancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁ cant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
Opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements
In our opinion the ﬁ nancial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2011 and of the Group’s proﬁ t for the year then 
ended; and
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs.

Notes to the consolidated annual ﬁ nancial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2011  
1.1 Reporting entity      
The consolidated annual ﬁ nancial statements of Shaft Sinkers Holdings PLC (“the Company”) as at and for the year ended 31 December 2011 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group” and individually as the “Group entities”) and the Group’s 
interest in associates and jointly controlled entities. The Group is primarily involved in shaft sinking, contract mining, mine operation, tunnelling 
and large underground excavations.           
1.2 Basis of preparation      
1.2.1 Statement of compliance      
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). 
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the listing rules of the London Stock Exchange.  
1.2.2 Basis of measurement      
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items in the 
consolidated statement of ﬁ nancial position.      
- derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are measured at fair value      
- ﬁ nancial instruments at fair value through proﬁ t or loss are measured at fair value      
- land and buildings are measured at fair value      
The methods used to measure fair value are discussed further in note 1.3.20.      
1.2.3 Basis of preparation      
Group restructuring      
For the purposes of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, the Group restructuring, whereby shareholders in Capstone 615 (Proprietary) 
Limited received shares in the Company, has been treated as a Group restructuring. Common control accounting principles have been applied 
for the Group restructuring, such that the consolidated results of Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc have been prepared on the basis that the current 
Group has been in existence since the inception of common control and therefore the consolidated comparative ﬁ gures relate to Capstone 
615 (Proprietary) Limited.      
Going concern      
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue to be able 
to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future. Refer to Directors report on page 27.    
Presentation currency      
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are presented in British Pounds, which is the functional and presentation currency of the holding company.
1.2.4 Use of estimates and judgements       
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Accounting estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.      
In particular, information about signiﬁ cant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have a 
signiﬁ cant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements is supplied in the following notes:     
-       Note 6.2: valuation of land and buildings      
-       Note 6.5: useful lives of property, plant and equipment      
-       Note 23: measurement of post retirement beneﬁ t obligations      
-       Note 26.1: lease classiﬁ cation

Notes to the consolidated annual ﬁ nancial statements 
(continued) 
for the year ended 31 December 2011  
1.3 Signiﬁ cant accounting policies      
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented in these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 
1.3.1 Basis of consolidation      
Subsidiaries       
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The ﬁ nancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements 
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned with the policies 
adopted by the Group.       
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identiﬁ ed separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-
controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling interest’s 
share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the non-controlling 
interest’s share of changes in equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the non-controlling interest has a 
binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.       
Acquisitions from entities under common control      
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the control of the shareholder that controls the Group are 
accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or, if later, at the date that 
common control was established. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at the carrying amounts recognised previously in the 
Group controlling shareholder’s consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. The components of equity of the acquired entities are added to the same 
components within Group equity and any gain / loss arising is recognised directly in equity.    
Equity accounted investments      
Associates are those entities in which the Group has signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence, but no control, over the ﬁ nancial and operating policies. Signiﬁ cant 
inﬂ uence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of another entity. Joint ventures are 
those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for 
strategic ﬁ nancial and operating decisions.      
Investments in associates and jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are 
recognised initially at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identiﬁ ed on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include the Group’s share of the income and expenses and equity movements of equity accounted investees, 
after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence or joint control commences 
until the date that signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence or joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted 
investee, the carrying amount of that interest, including any long-term investments, is reduced to nil, and the recognition of further losses is 
discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.   
Acquisition of non-controlling interest      
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is 
recognised as a result. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a 
proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.      
Special purpose entities      
Special purpose entities classiﬁ ed as such in accordance with SIC 12 Consolidation – special-purpose entities. Special purpose entities are 
those companies in which the Group has an interest of 50% or more of the voting rights or otherwise has the power to exercise control over 
the operations and derive the beneﬁ ts there from. Due to the fact that a special purpose entity is deemed to be controlled by the Group, the 
ﬁ nancial statements of a special purpose entity are included in the consolidated annual ﬁ nancial statements.   
Transactions eliminated on consolidation      
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in 
preparing the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees and joint ventures 
are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as 
unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

1.3.2 Foreign currency       
Foreign currency transactions      
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary company at the exchange rate at the 
transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional 
currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between the amortised cost 
in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised 
cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that their fair value 
was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in proﬁ t or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.  
Foreign operations      
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to British 
Pounds at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in 
hyperinﬂ ationary economics, are translated to British Pound at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.   
Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve 
(“translation reserve”) in equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation 
reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassiﬁ ed to proﬁ t or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only 
part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is 
re-attributed to non-controlling interests.      
When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable 
future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign 
operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income.       
1.3.3 Financial instruments      
Non-derivative ﬁ nancial assets      
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other ﬁ nancial assets (including 
assets designated at fair value through proﬁ t or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.      
The Group derecognises a ﬁ nancial asset when the contractual rights to the cash ﬂ ows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive 
the contractual cash ﬂ ows on the ﬁ nancial asset in a transaction in which substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the ﬁ nancial asset are 
transferred. Any interest in transferred ﬁ nancial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability. 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of ﬁ nancial position when, and only when, the Group 
has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends to either settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group has the following non-derivative ﬁ nancial assets: ﬁ nancial assets at fair value through proﬁ t or loss and loans and receivables.
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁ t or loss      
A ﬁ nancial asset is classiﬁ ed at fair value through proﬁ t or loss if it is classiﬁ ed as held for trading or is designated as such upon initial 
recognition. Financial assets are designated at fair value through proﬁ t or loss if the Group manages such investments and makes purchase 
and sale decisions based on their fair value in accordance with the Group’s risk management and investment strategy. Upon initial recognition, 
attributable transaction costs are recognised in proﬁ t or loss as incurred. Financial assets at fair value through proﬁ t or loss are measured at fair 
value, and changes therein are recognised in proﬁ t or loss.        
Loans and receivables      
Loans and receivables are ﬁ nancial assets with ﬁ xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are 
recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition loans and receivables are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.   
Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, loans receivable, loans to related parties and cash and cash equivalents.

1.3.3 Financial instruments (continued)
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits, with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are 
repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose of the statement of cash ﬂ ows.      
Non-derivative ﬁ nancial liabilities      
The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they are originated. All other ﬁ nancial 
liabilities (including liabilities designated at fair value through proﬁ t or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.      
The Group derecognises a ﬁ nancial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.   
The Group has the following non-derivative ﬁ nancial liabilities: loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and trade and other payables.
Such ﬁ nancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition 
these ﬁ nancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.    
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of 
cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash ﬂ ows.      
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments      
The Group holds derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk exposure. Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; 
attributable transaction costs are recognised in proﬁ t or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair 
value and changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in proﬁ t or loss 
as they arise.      
Share capital      
Ordinary shares      
Ordinary shares are classiﬁ ed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised 
as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.      
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including any directly attributable costs, is 
recognised as a deduction from equity.      
1.3.4 Property, plant and equipment      
Recognition and measurement      
Items of plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of 
materials and direct labour, and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the 
costs of dismantling and removing items and restoring the site on which they are located.      
Property, comprising land and buildings, is measured at fair value at the date of revaluation, less, for buildings, accumulated depreciation since 
the date of revaluation.      
Any revaluation reserve will be realised to retained earnings once the underlying properties are disposed of, rather than realising the reserve 
systematically through usage.      
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major 
components) of property, plant and equipment.      
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the 
carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net within other income in proﬁ t or loss. When revalued assets are sold, 
the amounts included in the revaluation reserve are transferred to retained earnings.      
Subsequent costs      
The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that 
the future economic beneﬁ ts embodied within the part will ﬂ ow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the 
replaced part is derecognised. The cost of day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in proﬁ t or loss as incurred.

1.3.4 Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Depreciation      
Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. 
Depreciation is recognised in proﬁ t or loss on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant 
and equipment, since this most closely reﬂ ects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic beneﬁ ts embodied in the asset. 
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.      
The estimated useful lives are: 2011 2010
Buildings 50 years 50 years
Plant and equipment 1-20 years 1-20 years 
Furniture, ﬁ ttings and ofﬁ ce equipment 2-6 years 2-6 years
Motor vehicles 4 years 4 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each ﬁ nancial year-end and adjusted if appropriate. Estimates in respect 
of certain items of plant and equipment were revised in 2011 – refer to note 6.5. 
1.3.5 Intangible assets      
Goodwill      
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. For measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, see 
note 1.3.1.      
Subsequent measurement      
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill 
is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including 
goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee.      
1.3.6 Leased assets      
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nance leases. Upon initial 
recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. 
Other leases are operating leases and, the leased assets are not recognised in the Group’s statement of ﬁ nancial position.  
1.3.7 Inventories      
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the ﬁ rst-in-ﬁ rst-out principle, and 
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their 
existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress cost includes an appropriate share of production 
overheads based on normal operating capacity.      
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. 
Obsolete, redundant and slow moving inventories are identiﬁ ed on a regular basis and are written down to their estimated net realisable values. 
1.3.8 Construction work in progress      
Construction work in progress represents the gross unbilled amount expected to be collected from customers for contract work performed to 
date. It is measured at cost plus proﬁ t recognised to date less progress billings and recognises losses. Cost includes all expenditure related 
directly to speciﬁ c projects.      
Construction work in progress is presented as part of trade and other receivables in the statement of ﬁ nancial position for all contracts in which 
costs incurred plus recognised proﬁ ts exceed progress billings. If progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised proﬁ ts, then the 
difference is presented as deferred revenue in the statement of ﬁ nancial position.      
1.3.9 Impairment      
Financial assets      
A ﬁ nancial asset not carried at fair value through proﬁ t or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective 
evidence that it is impaired. A ﬁ nancial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition 
of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash ﬂ ows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

1.3.9 Impairment (continued)
Objective evidence that ﬁ nancial assets (including equity securities) are impaired include default or delinquency by a debtor, restructuring of an 
amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, the 
disappearance of an active market for a security. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a signiﬁ cant or prolonged decline in its fair 
value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.      
The Group considers evidence of impairment for receivables at both speciﬁ c asset and collective level. All individually signiﬁ cant receivables 
are assessed for speciﬁ c impairment. All individually signiﬁ cant receivables found not to be speciﬁ cally impaired are then collectively assessed 
for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identiﬁ ed. Receivables that are not individually signiﬁ cant are collectively assessed for 
impairment by grouping together receivables with similar risk characteristics.      
In assessing collective impairment the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default, timing of recoveries and the amount of loss 
incurred, adjusted for management’s judgement as to whether the current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are 
likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends.      
An impairment loss in respect of a ﬁ nancial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present 
value of the estimated future cash ﬂ ows discounted at the asset’ s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in proﬁ t or loss and reﬂ ected in 
an allowance account against receivables. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a 
subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through proﬁ t or loss.
Non-ﬁ nancial assets      
The carrying amount of the Group’s non-ﬁ nancial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is an indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing the 
value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂ ects the current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together 
into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inﬂ ows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inﬂ ows of other assets 
or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”).          
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in proﬁ t or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated ﬁ rst to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group 
of units) on a pro rata basis. In the case of land and buildings, the revaluation decrease is recognised directly in other comprehensive income 
against the revaluation reserve.      
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at 
each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
1.3.10 Employee beneﬁ ts      
Short-term employee beneﬁ ts      
Short-term employee beneﬁ t obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or proﬁ t-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal 
or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably. 
Share based payment transactions      
The grant-date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as an expense 
is adjusted to reﬂ ect the number of awards for which the related service and nonmarket vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that 
the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance 
conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the share-based 
payment is measured to reﬂ ect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.

1.3.10 Employee beneﬁ ts (continued)
Deﬁ ned contribution plan      
A deﬁ ned contribution plan is post-employment plan under which an entity pays ﬁ xed contributions into a separate legal entity and will have no 
legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to deﬁ ned contribution pension places are recognised as an 
employee beneﬁ t expense in proﬁ t or loss in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognised 
as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. Contributions to a deﬁ ned contribution plan that is due 
more than 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the services are discounted to their present value.
Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan      
A deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan is a post-employment plan other than a deﬁ ned contribution plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future beneﬁ t that employees have earned in return for their 
service in the current and prior periods; that beneﬁ t is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognised past service costs and the 
fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The calculation is performed annually by a qualiﬁ ed actuary using the projected unit method.
The Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising from deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans in proﬁ t or loss. 
1.3.11 Black economic empowerment (BEE) transactions
Where the Group disposes of a portion of a South African based subsidiary or operation to a BEE company or employee beneﬁ t trust at 
a discount to fair value, the transaction is considered to be a share based payment (in line with the principles contained in South Africa 
interpretation AC503 Accounting for Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Transactions. The discount provided or value given is calculated in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments and included in the determination of the proﬁ t or loss on disposal. 
1.3.12 Provisions      
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, 
and it is probable that an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash ﬂ ows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the 
liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as ﬁ nance cost.      
Onerous contracts      
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected beneﬁ ts to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected 
cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group 
recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 
1.3.13 Interest free advances
Interest free advances are received from clients primarily to enable the Group to meet its procurement obligations in respect of the contract. 
Interest free advances are offset against normal monthly invoices issued to the client and are reﬂ ected in the statement of ﬁ nancial position as 
an undiscounted amount.     
1.3.14 Revenue      
Revenue comprises the net invoiced value of contracts and other services rendered (excluding value added tax).   
Services      
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in proﬁ t or loss in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. 
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed.      
Contract revenue      
Contract revenue includes the initial amount agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments to 
the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. As soon as the outcome of the contract can be 
estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses are recognised in proﬁ t or loss in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. 
Contract expenses are recognised as incurred unless they create an asset related to future contract activity.    
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed. When the outcome of the contract cannot be estimated 
reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. An expected loss on a 
contract is recognised immediately in proﬁ t or loss.

1.3.15 Lease payments      
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in proﬁ t or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
Minimum lease payments made under ﬁ nance leases are apportioned between the ﬁ nance expense and the reduction of the outstanding 
liability. The ﬁ nance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability.      
Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease      
At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A speciﬁ c asset is the subject of a 
lease if fulﬁ lment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that speciﬁ c asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the 
arrangement conveys to the Group the right to control the use of the underlying asset.      
At inception or upon reassessment of the arrangement, the Group separates payments and other consideration required by such an 
arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If the Group concludes for a ﬁ nance 
lease that it is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, an asset and a liability are recognised at an amount equal to the fair value of the 
underlying asset. Subsequently the liability is reduced as payments are made and an imputed ﬁ nance charge on the liability is recognised using 
the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.      
1.3.16 Finance income and costs       
Finance income comprises interest income of funds invested, dividend income, gains on the disposal of available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets, 
changes in fair value of ﬁ nancial assets at fair value through proﬁ t or loss, and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in proﬁ t or 
loss. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in proﬁ t or loss on the date 
that the Group’s right to receive payment is established.      
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, changes in the fair value of ﬁ nancial assets 
at fair value through proﬁ t or loss, impairment losses recognised on ﬁ nancial assets, and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised 
in proﬁ t or loss. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are 
recognised in proﬁ t or loss using the effective interest method. Foreign currency gains or losses are reported on a net basis.  
1.3.17 Income tax      
Income tax expense comprises current taxation, deferred taxation and Secondary Taxation on Companies (being a South African taxation on 
dividends). Income tax expense is recognised in proﬁ t or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in 
other comprehensive income.      
Current taxation is the expected taxation payable on taxable income for the year, using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustments to taxation payable in respect of previous years.      
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁ nancial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.      
Deferred taxation is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁ t, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and 
jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred taxation is 
not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.      
Deferred taxation is measured at the taxation rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on 
the laws that have been enacted or substantively been enacted by the reporting date.      
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current taxation liabilities and assets, and they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities, but they intend to settle current 
taxation liabilities and assets on a net basis or their taxation liabilities and assets will be realised simultaneously.  
A deferred taxation asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred taxation assets are reviewed at 
each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related taxation beneﬁ t will be realised.

1.3.18 Earnings per share      
The Group presents basic earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the proﬁ t or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, 
adjusted for the Company’s own shares. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting proﬁ t or loss attributable to the ordinary 
shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held and for the effects of all diluted 
potential ordinary shares, which may comprise convertible notes and share options granted to employees.   
1.3.19 Segment reporting      
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, 
including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All operating segments‘ operating 
results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s executive management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to 
assess its performance, and for which discrete ﬁ nancial information is available.      
Segment results that are reported to executive management include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be 
allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate overhead expenses and income tax assets and liabilities. 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other 
than goodwill.      
1.3.20 Determination of fair values      
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial 
assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When 
applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes speciﬁ c to that asset or liability.
Property, plant and equipment       
The fair value of property is based on market values. The market value of property is the estimated amount for which a property could be 
exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing wherein 
the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.       
Trade and other receivables      
The fair value of trade and other receivables, excluding construction work in progress, is estimated as the present value of future cash ﬂ ows, 
discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. The fair value is determined for disclosure purposes.   
Derivatives      
The fair value of derivatives is based on their listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not available, then the fair value is 
estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the 
contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds).      
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future 
cash ﬂ ows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the measurement date
Fair values reﬂ ect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Group and counterparty 
when appropriate.      
Non-derivative ﬁ nancial liabilities      
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash ﬂ ows, 
discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. In respect of the liability component of convertible notes, the market rate of 
interest is determined by reference to similar liabilities that do not have a conversion option. For ﬁ nance leases the market rate of interest is 
determined by reference to the rate per the agreement, which is linked to the prime lending rate of South Africa.   
Investments in equity      
The fair value of ﬁ nancial assets at fair value through proﬁ t or loss, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets is 
determined by reference to their quoted bid price at the reporting date. The fair value of held-to-maturity investments is determined for 
disclosure purposes only.

Share based payments      
The fair value of the Group’s long term share incentive scheme is measured using Monte Carlo Simulation model. Measurement inputs include 
the share price at measurement date, the expected volatility (based on an evaluation of the Company’s historic volatility, particularly over the 
historic period commensurate with the expected term of the instruments), the expected term of the instruments, expected dividends and the 
risk free interest rates based on government bonds. Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken 
into account in determining fair value.      
1.3.21 New standards and interpretations      
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2011, and 
have not been applied in preparing these consolidated annual ﬁ nancial statements. None of these is expected to have a signiﬁ cant effect on 
the consolidated annual ﬁ nancial statements of the Group.

3.1 Proﬁ t from operations before exceptional items
The results of the Group were affected by exceptional items during both the 2011 and 2010 ﬁ nancial years. A reconciliation has therefore 
been prepared below, whereby the proﬁ t from operations as reﬂ ected in the consolidated income statement is reconciled to the proﬁ t from 
operations before exceptional items. Details around the nature of the exceptional items are more fully described below.

3.2 Contract provision and settlement      
The Group was involved in a dispute with one of its clients towards the end of the 2009 ﬁ nancial year due to the non-payment by the client 
of invoices issued by the Group for services rendered. At the end of the 2009 ﬁ nancial year this client owed the Group GBP 3.0 million for 
services rendered by the Group and held assets of the Group to the value of GBP 2.5 million. Due to the fact that the dispute had turned into a 
legal matter, management considered it prudent to raise an impairment provision against both the outstanding receivable as well as the plant 
and equipment of the Group which the client had under its control due to the uncertainty around the recovery of these assets. An impairment 
provision of GBP 5.5 million was therefore raised at 31 December 2009.      
In April 2010 the Group reached a settlement with the client mentioned above and in terms of the settlement the client agreed to pay a 
portion of its outstanding debts owing to the Group as well as purchase a portion of the Group’s plant and equipment that were held by the 
client. The plant and equipment items that were not acquired by the client was returned to the Group. The settlement agreement removed 
the conditions that existed at the time on which the impairment provision was raised and resulted in the reversal of impairment provisions 
amounting to GBP 3.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2010.      
3.3 IPO bonusses      
The Group announced in its propsectus that it would pay a once-off IPO bonus to a range of middle to senior management. The amount was 
accrued for and paid in two tranches i.e. 30 June 2011 and 31 December 2011. The amount paid amounted to ZAR 41.9 million, which is 
equivalent to GBP3.1 million.

The Group’s foreign tax rate differential increased to 33.7% in 2011 from 26.7% in 2010. The increase in the foreign tax rate differential is primarily due 
to Secondary Tax on Companies (“STC”) that is levied in South Africa on dividends that are declared. STC charged on dividends declared by Capstone 
615 (Proprietary) Limited amounted to GBP0.5 million during 2011, which directly contributed to the increase in the foreign tax rate differential.
The Company is subject to tax in the Isle of Man at the standard tax rate of 0% (2010: 0%).

6 Property, plant and equipment (continued) 
6.2 Land and buildings      
Land and buildings include:      
- Portion 6 of Erf 53, Eastgate and Portion 701 of the farm Zandfontein No. 42 IR, including ofﬁ ce buildings.    
- Portion 305 of the farm Scheerpoort No. 477 JQ, including residential buildings and improvements.    
The Group’s land and buildings are encumbered by a cession to Standard Bank of South Africa Limited, as security for its guarantee and 
banking facilities as set out in note 20.3. The previous cession to ABSA Bank Limited was released at the end of 2010 as part of the settlement 
of the Group’s obligations to ABSA Bank Limited.      
The Group’s land and buildings were revalued by eValuations Enhanced Property Appraisals (Proprietary) Limited, an independent sworn 
appraiser, on 31 December 2011. The fair value of the land and buildings was determined with reference to market prices. The cost of the land 
and buildings, prior to any revaluation at 31 December 2011 is GBP6 057 271 (2010 – GBP6 019 641). It is the Group’s policy to revalue its land 
and buildings on an annual basis.      
6.3 Plant and equipment funded by instalment sale agreements      
Plant and equipment with a carrying value of GBP61 146 (2010 – GBP789 620) were funded by instalment sale agreements during the year by 
the Group. The instalment sale obligations are secured by these assets (refer note 20.3).      
6.4 Impairment loss      
No impairment indicators arose which indicated that any of the Group’s property, plant and equipment was impaired during the year. During 
the 2010 ﬁ nancial year an impairment loss of GBP54 199 was recognised in other operating expenditure.   
No reversals of impairment losses were made during the 2011 ﬁ nancial year, however during April 2010 a settlement agreement was signed 
between the Company and its client whereby it was agreed that the plant and equipment that was impaired during the 2009 ﬁ nancial year 
would either be sold to the client or be returned to the Company. A reversal of impairment amounting to GBP1.5 million was therefore 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income during the 2010 ﬁ nancial year.       
The impairment losses that were reversed are all allocated to the South African segment of the Group.   
6.5 Change in estimate      
During the year under review the useful lives of items of plant and equipment were reassessed resulting in a decrease in useful life and an 
additional depreciation charge of GBP1.0 million (2010: GBP0.9 million) being processed. The effect of the change in estimates on future 
periods is expected to be an increase of GBP 1.0 million in depreciation.      
The following key assumptions were used during the re-assessment of useful lives:      
•  mechanical stress, which refers to forces and loads applied to assets which lead to degradation over time;
•  electrical loading, which refers to stresses such as continuous loading, temporary overloading and exposure to short circuit fault current;
•  operational practices, which refers to how frequently an asset is subject to operations;
•  environmental conditions, including pollution, salt, acid rain, humidity and extreme temperature that are prevalent and causes long term 
degradation; and
•  maintenance practices, which refers to the frequency of routine inspection and maintenance that is performed on plant and equipment.

7 Goodwill     
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Rossal 126 (Proprietary) Limited by the Group during 2007. It represents the excess of the cost of the 
acquisition over the fair value of the identiﬁ able assets and liabilities of Rossal 126 (Proprietary) Limited.

Closing balance   2,172,667 2,663,560 
Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units      
Goodwill has not been allocated to individual cash generating units as it is believed that goodwill relates to the specialised industry expertise 
and experiences within the Group itself that allows the Group to operate in various different geographical segments.   
Impairment testing      
An impairment test was performed on 31 December 2011 on the goodwill balance of the Group, whereby the recoverable amount of the 
Group’s underlying assets was based on its value in use, which was determined using a discounted cash ﬂ ow model.  
The recoverable amount was compared to the carrying amount of goodwill and it was found that the recoverable amount exceeded the 
carrying amount.       
Key assumptions used in the discounted cash ﬂ ow projections      
The budgeted and forecast earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation for the period 2012 to 2014 are consistent with 
budgets and forecasts approved by the Board of Directors; and   
A weighted average cost of capital of 18.27% was used as the discount rate in determining the present value of future cash ﬂ ows.
8 Equity accounted investees
The Group held a 25% investment in an associate company, Alpha Resources Limited (“Alpha Resources”), incorporated in Jersey, Channel 
Islands, and its wholly owned subsidiary Delta Gold Zimbabwe (Private) Limited (“Delta Gold”), incorporated in Zimbabwe.  
On 11 October 2010 the Group entered into a sale of shares agreement with Mmakau Mining (Proprietary) Limited whereby the Group 
disposed of its 25% interest and loan claims in Alpha Resources and Delta Gold for a purchase consideration of ZAR1. Loans amounts owing to 
the Group of GBP 1.8m (ZAR 20 million) were repaid.      
The purchase consideration and loan repayment was received on 27 October 2010 resulting in the derecognition of the Group’s investment.
Prior to the derecognition of the Group’s investment in equity accounted investees, the directors fully impaired the investment in the associate. 
During the 2010 ﬁ nancial year an impairment allowance of GBP 741,692 was raised due to the extent of the uncertainty regarding the 
recoverability of the loans granted by the Group to its associate.       
The disposal of the Group’s shares in Alpha Resources resulted in a recovery of previously impaired claims against Alpha Resources and a 
reversal of impairment allowances amounting to GBP 1,763,078 was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in 2010.

27 Financial risk instruments and risk management        
The Board’s overall policy is to maintain a strong capital base as to maintain investor, creditor and market conﬁ dence. Having sufﬁ cient and 
extensive capital, in the form of plant and equipment, is the key to success of the Group. Having the necessary equipment available gives the 
Group a competitive edge in the tendering process and avoids delays in the start-up of new contracts. Certain key plant items are scarce in the 
market and have a long lead time from ordering to receiving.        
The Group has exposure to the following risks          
– market risk           
– credit risk           
– liquidity risk           
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and process for 
measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantative disclosures are included throughout these 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.           
Exposure to currency and credit risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. Forward exchange contracts are used as a means of 
reducing exposure to ﬂ uctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Group generally does not speculate in derivative instruments. There were no 
forward exchange rate contracts at the reporting date.        
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management. The audit committee has 
been mandated with the responsibility of developing and monitoring the Group’s risk management policies. The committee is assisted in its 
role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk managements controls and procedures, the results of 
which are reported to the audit committee. The Group audit committee reports to the Board of Directors on a regular basis.  
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls, and monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂ ect changes in market 
conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group through its training, management and safety standards and procedures, aims to develop a 
disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations, as well as the importance of 
maintaining safety standards.           
27.1 Market risk           
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices that will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of ﬁ nancial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market 
risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.       
Foreign currency risk           
The Group is exposed` to currency risk on contract revenue, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the 
respective functional currencies of the Group, primarily the South African Rand (ZAR), U.S. Dollar (USD), Russian Rouble (RuR), the United Arab 
Emirate Dirham (Dirham), the Swiss Franc (CHF), the Euro and the Indian Rupee (Rupee).      
The Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary 
to address short term imbalances. The Group invoices in foreign currencies where possible where its cost base is also in foreign currencies in 
order to achieve a natural hedge position. In volatile markets the Group will consider using forward exchange contracts to mitigate foreign 
currency risks. Board approval will however be obtained before the Group enters into any forward foreign exchange contracts.

Sensitivity analysis           
A 15 percent strengthening of the British Pound against the South African Rand, US Dollar, the Russian Rouble, the Dirham, the Franc, the 
Euro and the Indian Rupee would have resulted in changes in equity and proﬁ t by the following amounts. The analysis assumes all variables, in 
particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed in the same manner for 2010.

A 15 percent weakening in the British Pound would have had an opposite effect.       
Interest rate risk           
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows and invests excess funds at both ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating interest rates. The risk is managed 
by maintaining an appropriate mixture between ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating rate borrowings and placings within the market exposure expectations. The 
Group also uses interest rate swaps, where deemed necessary to hedge its exposure to ﬂ oating interest rates.    
Interest rates used to discount estimated cash ﬂ ows where applicable, are based on the bank prime lending rate at reporting date and were as 
follows:.           
Variable interest rates:           
-   Loans and borrowings are linked to the Johannesburg Inter-Bank Agreed Rate (JIBAR) and ranges between JIBAR plus 2.2% to JIBAR plus 6.8%.
-   Finance lease obligation are linked to the prime lending rate of South Africa and had an average effective borrowing rate of 9.3% (2010: 9.3%)
-   Loans to and from related parties bears interest at the prime lending rate of South Africa less 2.00% per annum.   
At the reporting date the interest rate proﬁ le of the Group‘s interest bearing ﬁ nancial instruments were:

27.2 Exposure to credit risk           
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁ nancial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁ nancial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables to customers. 
Trade and other receivables           
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is inﬂ uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer as well as the demographics of the 
Group’s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate.   
Management has established a policy of spreading the customer base outside of Africa and into Eastern and Western Europe and India. This is 
to optimise geographical concentration of credit risk.        
The Board of Directors has established parameters which, if these are to be exceeded, prior approval from the Board is required before 
submission of a tender to the potential new customer. These parameters are based on items such as the value of the contract, the type of 
contract, and location of the contract.           
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The 
main component of this allowance is a speciﬁ c loss component that relates to individually signiﬁ cant exposure and a collective loss component 
established of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identiﬁ ed. The collective loss allowance is determined 
based on historical data of payment statistics for similar ﬁ nancial assets.

The impairment raised during the current year relate to projects where operations were suspended during the year and was raised based on 
management’s assessment.           
Management have raised impairments based on key assumptions and estimates in terms of the contract. Should management estimates of the 
future not reﬂ ect actual events, further impairments may be necessary.    
The Group believes that no further impairments are necessary other than those raised above, in respect of trade receivables. The balance of 
trade receivables relate to customers that have had a good track record with the Group in the past.     
The Group has ceded its trade receivables to Standard Bank of South Africa, as security for its guarantee and banking facilities (refer note 20.3).

The maximum credit risk exposure by customer type at reporting date was within the mining, fertiliser and hydro electrical power industries, 
which comprises the full outstanding balance at the reporting date.        
Loans and other recievables           
The Group has provided funding to related parties and employees in the form of loans and ﬁ nance lease receivables respectively. These loans 
and other receivables are considered low risk by management as these receivables are mostly secured by the underlying asset in the case of 
ﬁ nance lease receivables. No allowances for impairment is therefore deemed necessary for these loans. The maximum exposure of the Group 
to credit risk relating to loans and other receiavbles are reﬂ ected by the carrying amount of these instruments and are summarised below:

  1,667,084  2,217,177 
Cash and cash equivalents     
Management considers the credit risk relating to its cash and cash equivalents to be low due to the fact that all of its cash and cash equivalents 
are invested at reputable ﬁ nancial institutions with good credit ratings, which are monitored by the Board of Directors on an ongoing basis.

27.3 Liquidity risk           
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meets its ﬁ nancial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufﬁ cient cash ﬂ ow and marketable securities to meet its obligations when they 
fall due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group ensures that it has sufﬁ cient cash on hand to meet unexpected operational expenses as they fall due, including the servicing of 
ﬁ nancial obligations. This excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot be reasonably predicted, such as natural disasters. 
In addition, the Group maintains overdraft facilities to cover periods where high volumes of the operational liabilities are expected to fall due.
The following are the contractual maturities of ﬁ nancial liabilities, undiscounted, including interest payments and excluding the impact of 
netting agreements:

27.4 Capital risk management           
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern, while maximising the return 
to stakeholders through optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings as disclosed in note 20, and equity attributable to owners of 
the parent, comprising reserves and retained earnings as disclosed.
The board reviews the capital structure and as part of this review, considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of 
capital. In addition the board of directors considers the liquity and solvency of the Group on an ongoing basis.
With the exception of the debt covenants imposed by the Group’s ﬁ nancier - as per note 20, the Group’s capital structure remains unchanged 
since 2010. The Group manages its capital in order to ensure that no contravention of the covenants occurs.
There has been no change to how the Group manages as capital, the strategy for capital maintenance from 2010.

30 Share based payment arrangements 
Long term share incentive plan (“LTIP”)        
Description of the share based payment arrangements        
On 23 December 2010 the three executive directors of the Company were given awards over a number of ordinary shares of the Company. 
This share based payment arrangement will be satisﬁ ed at the end of the vesting periods and will be effected through the transfer of ordinary 
shares to the participants. This share based payment arrangement is therefore considered to be equity settled as deﬁ ned in IFRS 2 - Share 
based payments.           
Terms and conditions of the share based payment arrangements        
The share based payment arrangement comprise of two performance conditions that will be measured in stages over the vesting periods. The 
performance conditions, described below, are independent of each other and therefore have been accounted for as separate share based 
payment arrangements.            
The performance conditions that are applied for the share based payment arrangements are as follows:    
- growth in earnings per share of the Company (“EPS”)         
- growth in the Company’s share price           
EPS share based payment arrangement           
In order for the shares attributable to the growth in earning per share of the Company to vest, the Group has to achieve a growth in earnings 
for each of the ﬁ nancial years ending 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2013 of at least 20 per cent per annum. In the event that the growth 
in earnings is between 10 and 20 per cent per annum, between 50 to 100 percent of the shares will vest on a straight line basis. In the event 
that the growth in earnings is less than 10 percent, none of the shares will vest.      
In the event that the compounded growth per annum over the three year period is 20 percent per annum all of the shares will vest to the 
participants despite not having achieved the targeted growth rate in a particular year.

30 Share based payment arrangements (continued)        
Share price based payment arrangement          
In order for the shares attributable to the growth in share price of the Company to vest, the share price of the Company has to achieve growth 
of at least 26 per cent per annum for each of the ﬁ nancial years ending 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2013. The base price for the 
ﬁ nancial year ending 31 December 2011 is the placing price at which the Company’s shares were listed i.e. GBP 1.24 per share. In the event 
that the growth in share price is between 13 and 26 percent per annum, between 50 to 100 percent of the shares will vest on a straight line 
basis. In the event that the share price growth rate is less than 13% per annum, none of the relevant shares will vest.  
In the event that the closing share prices over the 30 days following the announcement of the Group’s audited results for the ﬁ nancial year 
ending 31 December 2013 is 100 percent or more above the placing price, despite not having achieved the 26 percent per annum growth in 
its share price in any year, the share price performance criteria will be deemed to have been achieved and the participants will be entitled to 
100 percent of the share awards.           
Inputs for measurement of grant date fair values          
The grant date fair value of the share based payment arrangements was measured based on the Monte Carlo Simulation option pricing 
model. Volatility was based on the historical share price data of the constituents of the oil services and equipment sector on the London Stock 
Exchange. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at grant date of the share based payment arrangements were as follows:

34 Segmental reporting           
Information about reportable segments           
The Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic divisions. The strategic divisions of the Group 
are geographically different and are managed separately due to the unique challenges and risks that are present when operating in different 
jurisdictions. Although the METS division is a strategically important part of the business it is not regarded as a separate operating segment as 
deﬁ ned in IFRS 8 due to the fact that the contribution that the METS division contributes to the Group is less than 10% of the total contribution 
of the Group’s contracting activities.           
The following describes the Group’s operating segments:        
- South Africa - Contract services provided to clients within the Republic of South Africa.     
- Rest of world - Contract services provided to clients outside of the borders of the Republic of South Africa.    
The Group’s foreign revenues are mostly derived from contract services provided in Russia and India, with the revenues generated from Russia 
making up the majority of foreign revenues.          
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment proﬁ t before 
income tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s executive management. The information is 
prepared under IFRS and is consistent with the Group’s accounting policies. Segment proﬁ t is used to measure performance as management 
believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments taking into consideration the unique risk 
characteristics of each of these segments.
Other corporate activities comprise activities that do not by deﬁ nition form part of the operating segments as well as the head ofﬁ ce activities 
which could not be assigned to an individual segment. Inter segment transactions are concluded on an arm’s length basis.

Questions at the Annual General Meeting
9.   Any shareholder attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any such question 
relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the 
preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of conﬁ dential information, (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the 
form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question 
be answered.
Conduct at meeting
10.   We ask all those present at the Annual General Meeting to facilitate the orderly conduct of the meeting and reserve the right, if orderly 
conduct is threatened by a person’s behaviour to require that person to leave. For security reasons, all hand luggage may be subject to 
examination prior to the entry to the Annual General Meeting. Cameras, tape recorders, laptop computers and similar equipment may not 
be taken into the Annual General Meeting.

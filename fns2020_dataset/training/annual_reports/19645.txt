 SOVEREIGN
REVERSIONS PLC
Providing a fuller life
in later years
Annual Report 
and Accounts 2006 Our business is to provide finance to homeowners in their later years through
equity release. Home & Capital Trust Limited, our associate, offers home reversion
plans and manages them for a number of investors. We acquire new home
reversions from this source and also buy equity release assets in the secondary
market. 
We intend 
• to be a market leader in providing finance to elderly homeowners through
equity release
• to play an active role in developing and promoting standards of best practice
in the equity release industry
• to become a substantial investor in home reversions and equivalent equity
release assets
• to provide shareholders with relatively low risk capital growth from our
investment activity and an enhanced return from our participation in the equity
release market.

Chairman’s Statement
In my first year as Chairman, the Group has continued the
process of building a substantial portfolio of equity release
assets. 
Investments
Our portfolio grew by 10.3% from £46.6m to £51.4m during the
year. Purchases came almost entirely from new home reversions
arranged by our associate, Home & Capital Trust Limited. In May
2006, we completed the purchase of a portfolio of 112 shared
equity loans for £3.2m, to give us a good start to the current
year. We are continuing to implement a balanced investment
strategy of acquiring both new and secondary market assets.
During the year our net assets per share (diluted for warrants and
options) grew by 4.0% from 331.5 pence to 344.6 pence.
Embedded value per share increased by 6.3% from 498.8 pence
to 530.2 pence.
Financial performance
Earnings per share, based on historical profits (after revaluation
transfers), our principal yardstick for measuring profit
performance, increased by 42.3% from 8.71 pence to 12.43
pence. The main reason for this growth was the increase in our
profit on the sale of equity release assets from £1.61m to
£2.94m. This excellent result reflects the success of the
investment policy we have been pursuing over a number of
years, which has achieved a high proportion of acquisitions in the
secondary market, where the maturity profile tends to be more
rapid than for new reversions.
Our associate, Home & Capital Trust Limited, has expanded its
activities following a capital injection, continues to trade profitably
and is providing us with an increasing flow of new reversions.
Dividends
In the last year we increased our annual dividend by 8.0% from
2.50 pence per share to 2.70 pence per share, in two equal half-
yearly payments. We are increasing our first interim dividend in
the current year by 7.4% from 1.35 pence to 1.45 pence per
share. Whilst continuing to give priority to net asset performance,
our policy is to seek to provide steadily increasing annual
dividends where circumstances permit.
Industry development
We continue to play an active role in the development of the
home reversion product within the equity release industry. The
main legislation has now been passed to enable home reversions
to be regulated by the FSA. Through Graeme Marshall, our Chief
Executive, we are actively involved in the consultation process
and expect regulation to be implemented in 2007. Regulation
should boost both consumers’ and intermediaries’ confidence in
home reversion plans and thus provide a significant boost to this
sector of the equity release market in the two to three years
following implementation. 
Outlook 
The changes now taking place in the equity release market will
bring both challenges and opportunities to the Group. I am
confident that we are equipped to meet the challenges and that
we are in a good position to take advantage of the growth and
other developments in the industry. Sovereign continues to be
the only specialist vehicle through which investors can participate
in the equity release market through shares which can be traded. 
I am delighted that Robert Lo, my predecessor as Chairman,
who has been a director since inception, remains as a non-
executive director. We continue to benefit from his contribution to
the Board. During his six years as Chairman he oversaw a
transformation of the Group from a small BES company, through
a number of private and public acquisitions, to an AIM listing. We
will be seeking to achieve further substantial progress in the next
few years.

The Equity Release Market
Equity release
Equity release provides a means for homeowners in later years to
convert into cash some of the capital embedded in their homes.
In the last year, over £1bn was raised in this way to improve the
lifestyles of retired homeowners, or to provide for contingencies,
such as long-term care. Many people taking advantage of equity
release spend part of the money raised to achieve a lifestyle not
provided for by their pension arrangements and savings.
As 70% of the over 65s own their own home, equity release
already offers a widely available solution for the retired. Industry
commentators are expecting this market to grow rapidly. This
view is shared by the Government, which is in the process of
The main equity release products
The home reversion plan, such as those arranged by our
associate Home & Capital Trust Limited and financed by the
Group, involves the sale of all or part of the property in exchange
for a cash lump sum and a lifetime rent-free lease. The proportion
of the home sold is purchased at a discount, reflecting the
homeowner’s life expectancy. A series of payments may be
arranged. A lifetime mortgage is a loan secured on the property
on which no interest is paid until the property is sold.
These two core equity release products provide a choice for
customers reflecting inter alia different risk profiles and attitudes
to inheritance, as well as opinions on how the value of their home
might change over time. 
A homeowner taking out a home reversion plan retains a defined
percentage interest in the property, assuming a shared ownership
reversion, under which only part of the home is sold. The product
tends to appeal to homeowners who do not wish to borrow in
later life. The degree of certainty which is a feature of a home
reversion brings a number of advantages. Reversion plan holders
can always raise further sums later through selling an additional
percentage of the home to supplement their income or provide
finance for future generations in time of need.
introducing comprehensive regulation of the industry for the
protection of consumers.
The forecast substantial growth of the equity release industry is
likely to be underpinned by the pensions requirements of future
generations. The recent Pensions Commission review has
estimated a £57bn shortfall in pensions, as a result of rising life
expectancy, lower birth rates and recent low stock market
returns. It seems inevitable that equity release will come to be
regarded as a mainstream financial planning tool to help bridge
this gap.
A lifetime mortgage enables borrowers to continue to own 100%
of their home and thus benefit from the whole of any increase in
the value of the property over and above interest costs. However,
where there is a falling property market and the homeowner
exceeds normal life expectancy by some years, there is a risk
that the effect of compound interest may reduce or eliminate the
borrower’s equity interest in their home when the plan comes to
an end. Lifetime mortgages meeting the minimum standards of
Safe Home Income Plans (“SHIP”) feature a “no negative equity
guarantee” which ensures that, even if the property value
ultimately falls short of the outstanding loan, this will not result in
any cost to the borrower’s estate. This is a key protection for a
consumer taking out a lifetime mortgage.
Expectations of likely house price growth are therefore a major
factor in the decision on which type of plan to choose. The
strong increase in the value of residential property in the early
2000s has tended to influence homeowners and their financial
advisers in favour of a lifetime mortgage, on the basis that the
likely benefits of house price growth outweighed the risks of
rolling up compound interest over an uncertain period. However,
when the short-term direction of house prices is uncertain, the
home reversion plan is likely to appeal to more risk-averse equity
release customers, in view of the degree of certainty it provides.  5

How my home kept me rolling
Car enthusiast Derrick Payne is in big demand at weddings when
he volunteers to get the bride to the church on time. His
gleaming white 1971 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow adds a touch of
class to the big day. However, Derrick, 74, thought he might have
to give up his chauffeuring hobby because the car needed an
expensive overhaul. But now, by releasing value from his
bungalow near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, he can afford to have
the work done on the car, plus some house renovations,
including new windows and a conservatory.
The former RAF engineering officer says: ‘I am a widower and
have no dependants, so I am not looking to leave the house to
anyone. I felt that I should be making the most of my money now
— before I fall off my peg.’
He is one of a growing number of retired property owners who
choose to release equity from their home through a reversion
scheme. Derrick arranged his reversion through Home & Capital
Trust and was paid just under half of today’s market value for a
100 per cent interest in his property.

bought by Sovereign and was sourced by and is

SHIP reported a year-on-year 7% fall in total equity release
business conducted through its members from £1.19bn in 2004
to £1.10bn in 2005. Home reversion transactions grew by 35%
from £40.5m to £54.6m, whilst sales of lifetime mortgages fell
from £1.15bn to £1.05bm — a 9% fall. While a number of factors
contributed to this decline in value of business written, the main
cause was concern about the short-term direction of the
property market. This resulted in both a reduction in activity
(mirroring the sharp fall in transactions in the housing market) and
a slight shift from lifetime mortgages to home reversions.
Home reversion transactions are continuing their slow but steady
climb back to the levels of three years ago, as we have been
anticipating.
The regulation of the home reversions industry is proceeding to
timetable. The primary legislation was passed in December 2005.
The Treasury has completed its consultation on the secondary
legislation and the FSA’s consultation on the regulations
themselves will close in July 2006. The FSA is targeting bringing
in formal regulation in the spring of 2007.
The scope of the proposed regulation is wider than we had
expected. It will encompass both homeowners taking out
reversion plans and investors in home reversions, who under
certain circumstances will be deemed to be reversion providers
requiring regulation. We have responded to the Treasury
Consultation on the scope of the secondary legislation and will
shortly be submitting our views to the FSA on the detailed
regulations which will flow from this. The regulation of investors in
home reversions is likely to lead to considerable reorganisation
within the industry. Some participants will cease investment
altogether; others will continue to invest through regulated
vehicles. These changes can only strengthen consumer
protection in the long term. At the same time, regulation may also
cause some private investors to cease investing in home
reversions, which will deprive the market of a long-standing and
reliable source of funding. The changes in the industry which new
regulation will bring about should provide opportunities for the
Group, as well as challenges.

“The overall value of our investment
portfolio grew by 10.3%.”
We expect one effect of regulation will be to bring more providers
into the home reversion market. We are already seeing some
indication of new interest through recent applications to join SHIP ,
where, for the first time for a number of years, new applicants are
generally offering reversion products, rather than lifetime
mortgages.
Currently financial intermediaries sell around two thirds of lifetime
mortgages, but less than half of home reversion plans sold.
Following regulation, we expect that financial intermediaries will
become more active in selling home reversions.
While expectations for short-term performance of residential
property remain generally low, the home reversion frequently
provides the best option for elderly homeowners seeking to
release equity. Market regulation will increase confidence in this
product and we believe that these factors will underpin the
sustained growth of the home reversion market.
The Development of our Investment
Portfolio
Investment policy
Our investment policy is to seek to reduce portfolio risk through:
•
holding a wide number of individual assets, with no one asset
representing more than 1% of the portfolio;
•
having a spread of ages in our tenant profile with a view to
achieving a smooth realisation pattern; and
•
spreading our investments geographically, to minimise
exposure to regional property cycles.

The overall value of our investment portfolio grew by 10.3%
during the year. We continue to seek to build it through the
combination of regular purchases of individual new home
reversions arranged by Home & Capital Trust Limited and buying
in the secondary market portfolios of home reversions or
equivalent equity release assets. The assets acquired in the
secondary market are normally plans arranged some years earlier
and therefore have more rapid realisation profiles than new home
reversions. Our programme of acquiring new home reversions,
which we started in 2001, is designed to enhance embedded
Chief Executive’s Report continued
value and provide a continuation of this vacancy profile as our
existing portfolio matures. 
No portfolios were acquired during the year, but in May 2006 we
acquired a portfolio of 112 shared equity loans for £3.2m. The
average age of the borrowers in this portfolio is 85. 
As a result of the portfolio purchase just after the year end, we
now have interests in property with a vacant possession value of
over £140m, with the average property in which we have an
interest being worth £189,000.
Our portfolio deliberately has a wide geographical spread. The
objective of this policy is to minimise exposure to regional
property cycles. Thirty-eight per cent in terms of value of our
investments are held outside the south of England. Although we
have increased our investments in London during the year, our
overall exposure to Greater London, which we perceive as having
greater volatility than the UK residential market as a whole,
remains low at around 6% of the value of our portfolio.  
A fuller analysis of our portfolio at the year end is provided on

“Home & Capital Trust Limited
continues to be an industry leader
both in practice and in new
products and to invest in the
future.”
It is the secondary market element which has driven the increase
in our realisations in recent years. With new reversion plans, we
would expect comparatively few realisations in early years, as
homeowners arranging home reversion plans will almost
invariably be in good health but we should see a reasonable
growth in the value of these investments as they mature.
Valuation 
Assets acquired prior to 31 October 2005 have been
independently valued by Allsop LLP as at 30 April 2006; assets
acquired since that date have been valued by the directors at
cost. One-third of the independently valued properties were
inspected externally. Where properties were not inspected, Allsop
has applied a composite average of indices to the value when
previously inspected by them. 
Sovereign’s home reversions and shared equity loans are carried
in the Group’s accounts at an average of 61% of their vacant
possession value, the same as the previous year. The increased
maturity of our occupant profile has been offset by the lower rate
paid on new reversions acquired during the year. We continue to
adopt a conservative basis for discounting the vacant possession
value of properties to allow for tenants’ lifetime occupancy, with
the result that a substantial part of the discount is only released
when the tenancies end.  
Home & Capital Trust Limited
Our 40.5% shareholding in Home & Capital Trust Limited gives us
a strategic stake in one of the leading home reversion providers.

reversion plans in 1976 and Home & Capital Trust Limited has

Chief Executive’s Report continued
Chairman and Chairman of the Home Reversion Board it still
plays an active role in setting industry standards. Recently it has
been actively considering the shape of future legislation.  
Although our shareholding was only acquired in July 2004, our
relationship with the firm goes back to our own origins, as it
arranged some of our home reversion plans in 1993/94. Prior to
my involvement in Sovereign Reversions plc, I was Home &
Capital Trust Limited’s Deputy Chairman, then Chief Executive
from 1998 until October 2003, when my colleague, Rupert
Pearce Gould became its Executive Chairman. It has been
managing our reversion portfolio since 1999 and in recent years
has been instrumental in not only sourcing new reversions but
also managing the home reversion plans over their life and
obtaining maximum value from them when they come to an end.
In the past year Home & Capital Trust Limited has strengthened
its capital base with a £500,000 rights issue, which was taken up
in full by all shareholders. This has enabled it to establish a new
subsidiary, HCT Equity Release Limited, which is regulated by the
FSA and advises on equity release (both home reversions and
lifetime mortgages) and related financial products.
Home & Capital Trust Limited continues to be an industry leader
both in practice and in new products and to invest for the future.
In the year to 31 October 2005, it made a profit of £91,000 and it
continues to trade profitably during the current year. 
Financial Performance
Performance measures
Our objective is to achieve long-term growth in capital value,
which can be measured in terms of the increase in net asset
value per share (“NAVPS”) over a period of years. NAVPS has
grown by 13.4 % compound per annum over the last five years,
in addition to dividend payments. However, the Board considers
that growth in embedded value per share (“EVPS”), which reflects
potential future asset growth, is an equally important measure of
performance. EVPS reached 723.3 pence immediately before our
equity issue in April 2004, which had the effect of reducing EVPS
to 477.3 pence. In the last two years EVPS has grown by 11.0%
to 530.2 pence.
Profits from investment activity
Historical cost profits were £1.693m last year, an increase of
50.0% over the previous year.
The profit from the sale of investment properties is the key driver
of our profit performance. The chart opposite shows the result of
our investment activity over the last five years.
In the last financial year, our total profit on sale of investments
increased by 82% over the previous year from £1.613m to
£2.936m. The comparable figure for the year to 30 April was
lower than normal against the background of a stagnant property

market, resulting in our holding an abnormally high number of 23
properties for sale. In the year to April 2006, we experienced a
slight revival of activity in the property market, and benefited from
improved service levels from Home & Capital Trust Limited.
Consequently, we realised 41 asset sales, compared with just 18
in the previous year. Under normal circumstances, we would
expect asset sales to track the maturity pattern referred to on
page 9.
Although we were operating in an exceptionally quiet market for
the first half of the year, there were no distress sales and sales
proceeds were in excess of previous valuations. The compound
gross internal rate of return per annum on reversions sold during
the year ranged between 11% p.a. and 40% p.a. on the majority
of our sales. 
Administrative expenses 
Gross administrative expenses (before rental income) increased
from £686,000 to £845,000. There was a 44% increase in
reversion management fees payable to Home & Capital Trust
Limited, mainly due to the increase in the size of our asset
portfolio; these fees are on normal commercial terms and directly
relate to the number of properties being managed. There has been
a £149,000 increase in direct remuneration costs. In the year to
April 2005, two of the directors were provided through Home
Equity Limited prior to its acquisition at the end of the first quarter;
two non-executive directors joined the Board during that year. In
the current year all directors were paid for the full year. Some of
the increase is as a result of the decision taken last year to employ
a financial controller directly, rather than share costs with Home &
Capital Trust Limited. Our audit and tax compliance fees have also
increased, partially because we have become a larger group.

Cash Generation and Financing
Cash generation
Despite the long-term nature of our home reversion investments,
the Group now consistently generates cash for reinvestment.
Sale proceeds from investment properties last year continued to
be well in excess of our operating expenses and debt service
requirements; we expect this to be a continuing feature that
facilitates our financial planning. 
Investment Philosophy
We continue to seek to build a substantial portfolio of equity
release assets whose returns will contain an actuarial element,
but be substantially driven by the performance of the residential
property market. 
We believe that, over time, the residential property market will deliver
very satisfactory returns for investors. In 2005, demand for housing
was estimated to grow by 290,000 dwellings; supply, although
higher than in the previous year, was 160,000 units. There is already
a massive deficit in new housing supply over demand. The most
recently announced government target is to increase housing
construction from 160,000 units to 190,000 units by 2016. As
annual growth in demand is not expected to abate, it seems to be
widely accepted that the shortfall in housing supply will continue to
grow for many years to come. Against this background, we expect
house prices ultimately to rise substantially from current values.
We recognise that short-term house price movements will be
influenced by other factors, including interest rate adjustments
and consumer spending patterns. When the property market is
performing poorly, or less well than alternative investments, this is
likely to create opportunities for us as buyers in the equity release
market. We will not eschew these opportunities to invest, merely
because the short-term outlook for residential property is dull.
In the light of this strategic objective, we are likely to continue to
be investors, irrespective of short-term conditions in the
residential property market. We expect this strategy to produce
the best returns for shareholders over the long term.
Outlook
The equity release market, and the home reversion sector in
particular, are now undergoing rapid change in anticipation of
FSA regulation, which is to embrace the whole market in 2007.
As well as playing an active role in shaping the industry, we
expect to be an active participant in the opportunities which
these changes will create.
Market development and relatively slow growth in the residential
property market will present opportunities for us to execute 
our investment strategy of building a substantial investment portfolio.
We are looking forward to the challenges of the new financial year.

Bank funding
In the light of the funds received from our equity-raising in April
2004, we have made little use of our bank facilities during the
year. We continue to have loan facilities immediately available. We
are now starting to draw down on these facilities to make new
investments and have done so in relation to our £3.2m portfolio
purchase since the year end. We are confident that our available
asset security, and the support we enjoy from two key banking
relationships, will give us access to further funding if required.
Access to further equity
We remain adequately capitalised for the purpose of continuing
our regular programme of buying new reversions in parallel with
further portfolios should they become available. However, there
may be occasions where it is advantageous for us to provide
some consideration in the form of equity, or issue equity in the
course of acquiring a larger portfolio. At the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting we are again seeking from shareholders a
renewal of our annual mandate for the Board to issue shares for
cash and disapply pre-emption rights.  13

Corporate Responsibility
We are committed to high ethical standards in all our dealings.
We are particularly conscious of our responsibilities in our
relationships with elderly people. Our values are shared by our
associate, Home & Capital Trust Limited, whose specialist
business depends on marketing and managing home reversion
plans and building a long-term relationship of trust with elderly
people.
Sovereign only buys new home reversions that comply with
SHIP’s code of practice. These are generally arranged by Home
& Capital Trust Limited, which is also our reversions manager.
We aim to achieve high service standards in the management of
our reversion plans. Occupants are visited regularly by
professionals from Home & Capital Trust Limited who assist them
with any problems associated with the maintenance of their
homes. Visitors regularly provide advice to occupants on
independent living as they grow older, including moving house, if
this best suits their needs.
Our Chief Executive, Graeme Marshall, has represented our
associate, Home & Capital Trust Limited, on the Board of SHIP
since 1999 and is chairman of the SHIP Reversions Board.
Home & Capital Trust was a founder member of SHIP . Through
his participation in the Board of SHIP , Graeme Marshall has been
active in developing industry best practice in a changing
regulatory environment.
Protection for homeowners arranging equity release
Homeowners arranging home reversion or other equity release
plans are advised to do so only through members of SHIP , a
voluntary body established by the industry in 1991 to set
standards of consumer protection.  
SHIP’s safeguards include, in addition to a no negative equity
guarantee: 
•
security of tenure for life;
• the ability to move home without financial penalty;
•
clear presentation of its plans; and
•
a requirement that no plan may be taken out without the
customer having first received independent legal advice.
The sale of lifetime mortgages has been regulated by the FSA
since 2004 and home reversion plans are expected to be
regulated in 2007. However, SHIP requires from its members
standards of product design and advice which go beyond
regulation and therefore represent best practice for the industry.
SHIP is therefore expected to play an important role in consumer
protection even after the industry is fully regulated.  
Current protection for homeowners arranging home reversions
Prior to the introduction of formal regulation of home reversions,
SHIP has taken a number of steps to ensure that its members
conduct the sale of home reversions in a manner which is as far
as possible equivalent to the new regulatory regime for lifetime
mortgages. An independent Reversions Complaints Board has
been established, with powers to compensate customers and
fine product-providers. The SHIP Reversions Board has also
issued a Guidance Note requiring a Product Description Letter to
be issued for all reversions sold by members, containing
equivalent information to a lifetime mortgage product. These
steps ensure as far as possible that, in industry best practice, the
sale of a home reversion is akin to the sale of a regulated
product. 15
Job no.12255 Date 30/06/2006 Proof 03
Corporate Governance
The Board is accountable to shareholders for the good corporate
governance of the Group. The principles of corporate
governance and a code of best practice are set out in the
Combined Code. Under the rules of the Alternative Investment
Market the Group is not required to comply in full with the Code,
nor to state where it departs from it. The Board considers that
the size and nature of the Group does not warrant compliance
with all the Code’s requirements. This statement sets out how the
principles of the Code are applied to Sovereign Reversions plc.
Board of Directors
The directors of the Company are listed on page 13. The roles of
Chairman and Chief Executive are split. There are three non-
executive directors (including the Chairman), of whom The Rt.
Hon. JS Gummer MP and RA Lo are considered to be
independent. The Company has not designated a senior
independent director as required by the Combined Code as,
having regard to the size of the Board, such a designation is not
considered necessary.
The Board meets regularly to discuss issues relating to strategy,
budgets, acquisitions, financing policy, the approval of interim
and preliminary announcements and dividend policy. It also
requires the Chief Executive to report at each meeting on
corporate governance issues. There are four such regular
meetings per annum; directors hold additional meetings as
required.
Board Committees
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a
Remuneration Committee. Each Committee is chaired by Robert
Lo and the additional member is Paul Spencer.
Reports from the Audit and Remuneration Committees are set
out on pages 16–19.
Going Concern
Having made appropriate enquiries, the directors are satisfied
that the Group has adequate resources to continue its operations
for the foreseeable future. The directors therefore continue to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Relationship with Shareholders
The Board considers relations with shareholders to be important.
Regular presentations are given to institutional shareholders and
the Board considers the Annual General Meeting an opportunity
to communicate with all shareholders. 16 Sovereign Reversions plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
Job no.12255 Date 30/06/2006 Proof 03
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing accounting
procedures and controls and for the publication of the Group’s
accounts, and also reviews risk management and the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal financial control.
The Committee receives reports from, and consults with, the
Company’s external Auditors. It also considers matters relating to
the appointment, independence and objectivity of the Auditors
and reviews the results and effectiveness of the audit.
Internal Control and Risk Management
The Group maintains a system of internal financial control and
risk management in order to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance of:
•
the maintenance of proper accounting records and the
reliability of financial information used within the business and
for publication;
•
the safeguarding of assets against unauthorised use or
disposition; and 
•
the assessment of areas of risk and managing them in order
to achieve the Group’s objectives.
The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s
system of internal controls which include:
•
a management reporting system that includes a regular
evaluation of our working capital position;
•
regular reporting to the Board on financial and treasury
matters;
•
a detailed authorisation process to ensure that no
commitments are entered into without appropriate
authorisation and that no director participates in any decision
in the Group in which he has an interest; 
•
ensuring that the Group’s Controls and Procedures Manual and
Business Risk Statement are subject to regular review; and
•
ensuring that any subcontracted functions are subject to an
internal audit.
External Auditors
The Board regularly reviews its relationship with all its professional
advisers. As part of this process, audit and tax advisory services
were submitted for tender during the year. Following the
completion of this exercise, BDO Stoy Hayward LLP was invited
to become the Group’s auditors and tax advisers.
International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”)
Following an initial analysis in 2005, the Board continues to
consider the implications and timetable for implementing IFRS.
As an AIM company, the latest implementation date will be in
respect of the year ending 30 April 2008. Although the Board
considers that the application of the changes required to restate
the Group’s balance sheet under IFRS will be relatively
straightforward, its concerns regarding changes required to the
Income Statement remain. 
The Board considers that the major effects of the implementation
of IFRS on the Group’s balance sheet will be:
a) to provide for deferred taxation on the Group’s unrealised
gains on its investments, which is not permitted under UK
GAAP;
b) to eliminate negative goodwill;
c) to continue to value the Group’s investment in associate at
fair value. Any goodwill arising will not be amortised, but
subject to annual impairment review.
The impact of these adjustments on the Group’s Net Asset Value
as at 30 April 2006 is set out in the table below.
£000
Shareholders’ funds — per audited accounts 47,749
Provision for deferred tax (5,846)
Negative goodwill released 462
Home & Capital Trust Limited — goodwill provision
written back 68
Shareholders’ funds — under IFRS 42,433
With regard to the Income Statement, IFRS require operating
performance to be combined with unrealised movements in asset
values, which does not, in the Board’s opinion, present to
shareholders a clear picture of the Group’s operating
performance. The directors consider that IFRS have not yet fully
addressed the particular circumstances of the industry in which
the Group operates, or indeed for property investment
companies in general. The Board will be reviewing the position
with its auditors in the coming months and may well benefit from
the first IFRS statements issued during this period by similar
listed companies. A further statement on IFRS will be issued
when the Group announces its interim results, or earlier if the
Board elects for earlier implementation.

Job no.12255 Date 30/06/2006 Proof 03
The remuneration of GCW Marshall and RA Pearce Gould is
determined by the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration
Committee is chaired by Robert Lo; Paul Spencer is its other
member. 
During the financial year, the Remuneration Committee has taken
independent professional advice from New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP on the Chief Executive’s salary including
identifying the appropriate comparator Group and the quantum
and structure of remuneration packages within this Group.
Following this advice, the Remuneration Committee determined
that an element of the Chief Executive’s remuneration package
should be in the form of performance-related bonuses set
against agreed objectives. 
Directors’ remuneration for the financial year was as follows:
The remuneration disclosed for GCW Marshall and RA Pearce
Gould in 2005 relates to the period from 1 August 2004, prior to
which they were remunerated through Home Equity Limited
which was manager to the Group up to that date. In the quarter
ended 31 July 2004, Home Equity Limited received £2,500 in
respect of GCW Marshall’s services and £2,500 in respect of RA
Pearce Gould’s services which are included in the table below.
Fees of £83,135 for corporate management paid to Home Equity
Limited, out of which it paid Home & Capital Trust Limited
£24,112 for property and administration services, have not been
included above.
Since the year end, The Remuneration Committee has reviewed
remuneration, following which GCW Marshall has elected to
waive any bonus due in respect of the financial year to April 2006
and GCW Marshall and RA Pearce Gould have agreed that their
remuneration should not be increased. The Remuneration
Committee has agreed to review the position if the level of activity
picks up and/or if circumstances change.

Service contracts
GCW Marshall’s service contract is terminable on twelve months’
notice. 
The services of RA Pearce Gould are retained under a
consultancy agreement with Cambridge Corporate Consultants
Limited and that company is responsible for all benefits and
employment and office costs of RA Pearce Gould. From 1 May to
31 August 2005, this was at a fixed rate of £55,000 per annum
(plus VAT). During the year the terms of the contract were varied
to provide for a lower level of fixed remuneration of £30,000 
per annum (plus VAT) for services as a director, including
providing administrative support, plus fees charged at an 
hourly rate for ad hoc work. The new terms have been effective
since 1 September 2005. The contract has a twelve month
notice period. 
All other directors have service contracts terminable on three
months’ notice. Director’s fees paid to RA Lo are paid to 
NWCF LLP .
Directors’ long-term incentive arrangements
The terms of P Spencer’s employment included the grant of
50,000 options under a non-approved option scheme. These
options are exercisable during the financial year to 30 April 2009
at a price of 260 pence per share and have, inter alia,
performance conditions attached. To vest in full, the Company’s
total shareholder return (“TSR”) has to achieve a minimum of
12% compound per annum between 12 October 2004 and 
31 July 2008. No options will vest unless a minimum TSR of 10%
compound per annum is achieved over this period. The
Company’s mid-market share price at the date on which the
option was agreed was 257.5 pence. The option was formally
granted on 29 November 2004, on which date the Company’s
mid-market share price was 283.7 pence.
Both GCW Marshall and RA Pearce Gould are beneficially
interested in warrants in the Company which are exercisable up
to 30 April 2009 and which are disclosed in full in the Directors’
Report. These warrants were granted in 1999 to all shareholders
in Sovereign Reversions plc. Following advice from New Bridge
Street Consultants LLP , it has been agreed by the Remuneration
Committee that, as the warrants are unrelated to the
remuneration of these directors, they should not be taken into
account in reviews of their remuneration.

Tax Status
The Company has agreed with the Inland Revenue that, with
effect from 1 May 2004, it has been treated as a trading
company for tax purposes. The directors and the auditors
consider that Sovereign is an investment company and will
continue to present accounts accordingly.
The consequences of being treated as a trading company for tax
purposes are:
a) it is not entitled to indexation relief on capital gains after 
30 April 2004; and
b) the Company’s shares may qualify to be treated as Business
Assets for taper relief purposes.
Financial Instruments
The main risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments is
interest rate risk. As all balances are denominated in sterling, no
currency risk arises. Details of the Group’s financial instruments
are set out in Note 16 to the Financial Statements.
Payment of Creditors
The Group’s policy is to agree terms of payment when entering
into major business transactions, to ensure that the supplier is
aware of these terms, and to abide by the agreed terms of
payment. No amounts for which invoices had been received were
due to suppliers at 30 April 2006 or at 30 April 2005.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view
of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of
the Company for that period. In preparing these financial
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent; 
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website in
accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may
vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and
integrity of the Group’s website is the responsibility of the
directors. The directors’ responsibility also extends to the
ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
All of the current directors have taken all the steps that they
ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any
information needed by the Company’s auditors for the purposes
of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that
information. The directors are not aware of any relevant audit
information of which the auditors are unaware.
Auditors
During the year the directors reviewed the position of the auditors
and following on from presentations from three firms, the
directors resolved to appoint BDO Stoy Hayward LLP as its
auditors. A resolution to confirm the appointment of BDO Stoy
Hayward LLP , Chartered Accountants, as auditors will be put to
the members at the Annual General Meeting.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the 
Shareholders of Sovereign Reversions plc
We have audited the Group and parent company financial
statements (the “financial statements”) of Sovereign Reversions
plc for the year ended 30 April 2006 which comprise the
Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, the Consolidated
Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Note of
Historical Cost Profits and Losses, the Consolidated and
Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statement and the related notes. These financial statements have
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
whether the information given in the Directors’ Report is
consistent with those financial statements. We also report to you
if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions
is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. The other information comprises the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Report, the Corporate
Responsibility statement, the Corporate Governance statement,
the Audit Committee Report, the Remuneration Report and the
Directors’ Report. We consider the implications for our report if
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant to the requirements of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. No person is
entitled to rely on this report unless such a person is a person
entitled to rely upon this report by virtue of and for the purpose of
the Companies Act 1985 or has been expressly authorised to do
so by our prior written consent. Save as above, we do not
accept responsibility for this report to any other person or for any
other purpose and we hereby expressly disclaim any and all such
liability.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in
the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed. 23
Job no.12255 Date 30/06/2006 Proof 03
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
•
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at
30 April 2006 and of its profit for the year then ended;
•
the parent company financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the parent company’s
affairs as at 30 April 2006;
•
the financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
•
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent
with the financial statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention (modified to include the revaluation of
investment properties) in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
In preparing these financial statements the Group has adopted for the first time FRS 21 ‘Events after the balance sheet date’,
FRS 22 ‘Earnings per share’, presentational requirements of FRS 25 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and presentation’ and FRS
28 ‘Corresponding amounts’. Further details are given in Note 2.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate those of Sovereign Reversions plc and of its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiaries acquired during the year are consolidated using the acquisition method. Their results are incorporated from the date
control passes. All financial statements are made up to 30 April 2006. 
An entity is treated as an associated undertaking where the Group has a participating interest and exercises significant influence
over its operating and financial policy decisions.
In the Group accounts, interests in associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The
consolidated profit and loss account includes the Group’s share of the operating results, interest, pre-tax results and attributable
taxation of such undertakings based on audited financial statements as disclosed in Note 13. In the consolidated balance sheet
the interests in associated undertakings are shown as the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets, including any unamortised
premium paid on acquisition.
Intangible assets
Where the cost of acquiring subsidiaries exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired, goodwill is recognised on consolidation, is
capitalised and written off to the profit and loss account over the directors’ estimate of its useful economic life. Where the fair
value of the assets acquired exceeds the purchase consideration, negative goodwill is recognised on consolidation, is capitalised
and is written back to the profit and loss account over an appropriate period. Negative goodwill, which relates to acquisitions of
companies invested in home reversions, is being amortised over the expected life of non-monetary assets acquired of five years.
Positive goodwill, which relates to the acquisition of Home Equity Holdings Limited, which holds the Company’s investment in
Home & Capital Trust Limited, is being amortised over its expected useful economic life of 20 years.
Impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill are undertaken:
•
at the end of the first full year following acquisition
•
in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable on a long- 
term basis.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets, comprising home reversions and shared equity loans, are included in the financial statements once an
irrevocable purchase contract has been entered into. They are accounted for in accordance with SSAP 19: “Accounting for
Investment Properties”, which provides that these assets should not be subject to periodic depreciation charges (unless held on
short lease), but should be shown at open market value. Open market value in the case of the Group’s tangible assets reflects
the fact that they are subject to lifetime occupancy rights. Annual revaluations to investment properties are credited to the
revaluation reserve and are released to the profit and loss reserve when the revaluation is realised. This treatment is contrary to
the Companies Act 1985, which states that, subject to any provision for depreciation or diminution in value, fixed assets are
normally to be stated at purchase price or production cost.   28 Sovereign Reversions plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
Job no.12255 Date 30/06/2006 Proof 03
The treatment of these assets under the Companies Act would not, in the opinion of the directors, give a true and fair view as
they are not held for consumption in the business but as investments, the disposal of which would not materially affect any
operations of the enterprise. In such a case it is the current value of these investments, and changes in that current value, which
are of prime importance. Consequently, for the proper appreciation of the financial position, the accounting treatment required by
SSAP 19 is considered by the directors to be appropriate for the Group’s tangible assets.
Details of the carrying value and historic cost information for tangible assets are disclosed in Note 11.
Assets held for resale
Assets held for resale are investment properties which have become vacant and are accounted for in a similar way to investment
properties above. They are valued by the directors at the year end and are included in the financial statements on the basis of
their net realisable value. This is net of provisions and estimated disposal expenses.
Sales of assets held for resale are recorded once an irrevocable sale contract has been entered into, provided that the sale has
been legally completed by the date on which the relevant financial statements are approved by the directors.
Investments
The investments of the Company are stated at the net holding cost of acquiring subsidiaries and are disclosed in Note 12. The
Group’s investments are stated at the net assets of the associate company plus goodwill as disclosed in Note 13.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date,
where contractual transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the
future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its
results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which
timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been substantially enacted by the balance
sheet date.  
Financial instruments
The financial instrument of the Company consists of a hedging agreement with the bank to the effect that the interest rate on
certain borrowings is capped. Cash flows arising on interest rate swaps used to manage the Group’s exposure to cash flow and
fair value interest rate risks are accounted for as an adjustment to the interest payments on the hedged borrowings. Details of the
financial instrument are disclosed in Note 15.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the financial instruments disclosures in note 16.
Finance costs
Finance costs are charged to profit over the term of the debt to which they relate.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance of the financial instrument’s contractual obligations, rather
than the financial instrument’s legal form.
Segmental analysis
The Group has one class of business activity and carries out this activity in one geographical region only.

2 CHANGES TO ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR RESULTS
FRS 21: ‘Events after the balance sheet date’
The Group has adopted FRS21 ‘Events after the balance sheet date’. Previously, equity dividends declared after the balance
sheet date were recognised as liabilities at the year end, as required by company law and SSAP17 ‘Accounting for post-balance
sheet events’. In accordance with FRS21 and recent changes in law, if a final equity dividend is declared after the balance sheet
date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue, the dividend is not recognised as a liability at the balance 
sheet date.
The adoption of FRS 21 has resulted in an increase in shareholders’ funds of £177,000 as at 1 May 2005 (2004: £159,000) due
to the exclusion of the dividend proposed at 30 April 2005.
FRS 22: ‘Earnings per share’
The Group has adopted FRS 22 ‘Earnings per share’ as disclosed in Note 9. There is no financial effect on the financial
statements.
FRS 25: ‘Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation’
The Group has adopted the presentational requirements of FRS 25 ‘Financial Instruments: disclosure and presentation’. There is
no financial effect on the financial statements.
FRS 28: ‘Corresponding amounts’
The Group has adopted FRS 28 ‘Corresponding amounts’. There is no financial effect on the financial statements.
Restatements
In addition to the restatement required as a result of FRS 21 as noted above, there was a restatement made to the 2005 profit for
the year. The profit and loss account was restated in the prior year by £393,000 to reflect an adjustment necessary between the
realised profits on sale of investment properties and realisation of property revaluation gains of previous periods. This reduced the
profit and loss “profit for the year” from £145,000 to a “loss for the year” of £248,000. There was no overall impact on the profit
and loss reserves in the balance sheet for the prior year.
For the year ended 30 April 2006 we have amended the presentation of the three primary statements of the Profit and Loss
Account, Note of Historical Cost Profits and Losses and the Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses to provide to readers a
more visible indication of the results of the Group.

At 30 April 2006 the amount of deferred tax unprovided on the surplus on revaluation of fixed assets is £5,845,791 (2005:
£4,813,396). 32 Sovereign Reversions plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006

Unsolicited approaches to shareholders
We are aware that in the course of the year a number of our private shareholders have been contacted by financial
intermediaries purporting to be appointed by Sovereign. We understand that these intermediaries are generally not authorised or
regulated and are seeking to sell research or recommend shares in smaller companies.  
We are obliged under Company Law to provide a copy of our share register to any person who requests it. However, we never
make use of our share register in connection with financial promotions. If an intermediary contacts any shareholder “on behalf of
Sovereign” you should be aware that this approach is without our authority and should exercise appropriate caution. In
particular, no shareholder should be induced to make any payment to such intermediary without taking professional advice.     
In the event that any shareholder receives an unsolicited proposition in relation to Sovereign shares, which may also involve the
payment of money, please inform the Company immediately. We will always take action under these circumstances.  SOVEREIGN

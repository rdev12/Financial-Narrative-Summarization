What we do
Market sectors
Carillion’s principal market sectors together
with their 2007 revenues in the UK,
Middle East and Canada and the
Caribbean are described in more detail 
on the following pages. 
The overall outlook across these market sectors is positive. 
In our UK and international support services sectors we continue
to target revenue growth at stable margins of between four and
five per cent. 
In Private Finance, we continue to use the strong positions we
have established in our chosen sectors in both the UK and Canada
to win and deliver Public Private Partnership projects in which 
our equity investments create significant value for the Group.
In the Middle East, we are focused on revenue growth and expect
to increase the revenue we generate in this region from the 2007
level of £337 million to over £600 million over the next two years,
at margins of some six per cent.
In our UK construction sectors we are focused on improving
margins by maintaining a selective approach to the projects 
we undertake. 
In Canada and the Caribbean, we expect to deliver healthy growth
in our construction services sectors at stable margins.
Overall, we expect to improve the combined margins of our
construction activities in the UK, Canada and the Caribbean and
the Middle East towards three per cent over the next three years.
Defence
In this sector we provide project finance, design,
construction, maintenance, facilities management and
consultancy services, together with integrated service
solutions, which combine our wide range of skills and 
resources, to meet the specific needs of our Ministry 
of Defence customers. 
In 2007, the revenue we generated from the Defence sector
increased by 97 per cent to £458 million (2006: £232 million),
as we benefited from full-year contributions from a number 
of Joint Venture contracts that were mobilised in 2006. These
include two Public Private Partnership projects – the £12 billion
Allenby Connaught project and the £0.9 billion Permanent
Joint Headquarters project – that are expected to generate in
the region of £10 billion of revenue for Carillion over the next
35 years, and two support services contracts – the Housing
Prime and Regional Prime Central contracts, together worth 
in excess of £600 million to Carillion over seven years. 
The outlook in this sector is for further growth. In 2007,
Carillion was awarded £100 million of construction work 
in association with our Regional Prime Central contract. 
The £280 million Royal School of Military Engineering project,
for which Carillion is the preferred bidder, is expected to 
reach financial close in 2008. In addition, potential extensions
to our Housing Prime and Regional Prime Central contracts,
together with further major expenditure by the Ministry of
Defence on upgrading military accommodation across our
other projects, could increase contract revenues by up to a
further £650 million.

Health
In this sector we provide project finance, design,
construction, maintenance, facilities management and
consultancy services, together with integrated service
solutions, which combine our wide range of skills and
resources, to meet the specific needs of our NHS and
private sector customers. 
In 2007, we generated £200 million of revenue from the
Health sector (2006: £229 million). Overall, revenue from this
sector reduced, due to the timing of construction contract
starts and completions. However, support services revenue
from this sector increased substantially as a result of full-year
contributions from non-clinical facilities management in three
of our Public Private Partnership hospitals – the John Radcliffe
Hospital, Oxford, Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth 
and Lewisham Hospital – and from our £330 million contract
to provide non-clinical facilities management for the Barts 
and the London Hospital. During 2007 we were awarded 
our third Local Improvement Finance Trust (LIFT) project for
Dudley Infracare worth approximately £27 million. 
The outlook in this sector remains positive. Carillion is the
preferred bidder for two Independent Sector Treatment Centre
projects – Hertfordshire and North London – that are expected
to reach financial close in 2008 and generate some £300
million of revenue over the next five years. We are also the
preferred bidder for a further five LIFT projects worth around
£75 million. We continue to target selected projects in the
Government’s £7 billion investment programme for Public
Private Partnership hospitals and Carillion is currently
shortlisted for one project, North Bristol, worth around 
£300 million. As a framework contractor appointed by 
the Office of Government Commerce for public sector
outsourcing, we also expect further opportunities to provide
facilities management services for Primary Care Trusts.

Education
In this sector we provide project finance, design,
construction, maintenance, facilities management and
consultancy services, together with integrated service
solutions, which combine our wide range of skills and
resources, to meet the specific needs of our Local
Authority, University and private sector customers. 
In 2007, we generated £93 million of revenue from the
Education sector (2006: £162 million), with the reduction 
due to the timing of construction contract starts and
completions. However, we reached financial close on 
two new contracts in 2007 – the £76 million South 
Ayrshire Schools Public Private Partnership project and 
the £175 million South Tyneside and Gateshead project, 
which is part of the UK Government’s Building Schools for 
the Future (BSF) programme. We also won other new
contracts during 2007 for schools, colleges and universities
worth around £60 million. 
Going forward, we expect the BSF programme, in which 
some £45 billion has still to be invested, to be a major driver
of growth. During 2007, Carillion was shortlisted for three
further BSF projects – Nottingham, Tameside and Durham –
together worth in the region of £850 million. Since the year
end, Carillion has been appointed as the preferred bidder 
for the £208 million Nottingham BSF project. Following our
appointment as a framework contractor for the £1.6 billion
Academy Schools programme, Carillion has been shortlisted 
to provide Academy Schools in Nailsea, Somerset, and East
Basildon, Essex, which we estimate would generate up to
£100 million of revenue. With the UK Government also
planning to commence a £10 billion investment programme 
in primary schools in 2008, the outlook in this sector
continues to be positive.

What we do
Market sectors
continued
Facilities management and services
We provide public and private sector customers with a
wide range of facilities management and other support
services for buildings and infrastructure, from single
services such as mechanical and electrical engineering
maintenance to fully integrated property lifecycle
solutions for major estates. 
We generated £837 million of revenue from this sector in
2007 (2006: £656 million). This substantial organic growth
was due primarily to full-year contributions from major 
new contracts won in the second half of 2006, including 
a £110 million, five-year contract for Virgin Media and a 
£360 million, three-year contract for Norwich Union to
manage insurance claims. 
New order intake in 2007 remained healthy and we won 
a number of new contracts for both private and public 
sector customers. Our appointment as an Office of
Government Commerce framework contractor for Local 
and Central Government is a major market opportunity. 
For example, in 2007 Carillion was awarded contracts by
Northamptonshire County Council and the Forensic Science
Service that are initially worth in excess of £60 million over
four years, with the potential for this to increase as the scope
of work develops under the terms of the framework contract. 
We ended the year with an unprecedented level of
opportunities for new orders that have since been 
converted into contracts worth around £0.9 billion in 
the first two months of 2008. We expect to continue to
benefit from these positive market conditions and deliver
significant growth in this sector in 2008 and beyond.
Rail
In this sector, we provide services for network
enhancements to Network Rail, the Channel Tunnel 
Rail Link (CTRL), Passenger Transport Executives and
Transport for London, and also maintenance services 
for the CTRL.
We generated £280 million of revenue from this sector in
2007 (2006: £368 million). As expected, the outlook in the
sector remained uncertain in 2007 and the overall decline in
rail infrastructure investment experienced in 2006 continued
during the year. 
However, in view of the investment proposed by Network 
Rail in its 2007 Business Plan and the benefits of having
restructured our rail business to reduce overheads and 
focus on sustainable areas of the rail infrastructure sector, 
we expect to achieve modest growth in this sector in 2008.
The proposed investment over the next two years, the last 
of the Office of Rail Regulation’s current five-year control
period, is expected to offer sufficient opportunities to more
than offset the effect of losing around £80 million of annual
revenue as a result of Carillion ceasing to provide track
renewal services to Network Rail from January 2008.

Building 
Our building activities in the UK are focused on 
long-term key customers in selected sectors of the 
non-housing new-build market, including airport
developments, retail, offices, mixed used developments,
nuclear, prisons, industrial and urban regeneration.
Revenue from UK building in 2007 was £887 million 
(2006: £848 million). Trading conditions across our key sectors
of the UK non-housing new-build market remained positive
and we continued to focus on growing margins ahead of
revenue through a selective approach to the projects we
undertake. New order intake in 2007 reflected this selective
approach, with significant new contracts secured for key
customers across our target sectors. These included a pre-
construction contract for BAA for the £300 million, second
satellite at Heathrow Terminal 5, a £90 million contract for the
first phase of the £2 billion King’s Cross Central Regeneration
project, a £70 million contract for the new Rolls Building in
London, a £47 million contract for the Scottish Prison Service
and a £20 million contract to provide new offices for the
Welsh Assembly. In 2007, we were also appointed preferred
bidder for the £155 million Lumiere Development in Leeds, 
for which we were awarded the contract in March 2008.
The outlook for the UK non-housing, new-build market
remains positive, with real terms growth forecast over the 
next three years. We shall continue to adopt a selective
approach to the contracts we undertake in order to maintain
our focus on improving margins ahead of revenue.
Roads
In this sector we provide road management and
maintenance services to the Highways Agency and 
Local Highway Authorities, together with construction
services for new roads and improvement schemes,
primarily under the Government’s Early Contractor
Involvement (ECI) programme. 
Revenue from this sector increased to £276 million in 2007
(2006: £224 million), largely due to increased activity on ECI
construction contracts and increased expenditure on road
maintenance. In 2007, Carillion secured a 20-year extension 
to its contract for maintenance of the 123 kilometres of 
the M40 between Junction 1, Denham, and Junction 15,
Warwick, worth in the region of £100 million and a
framework contract for the Midlands Highway Alliance, 
which comprises ten Local Highway Authorities and the
Highways Agency, worth up to an estimated £16 million 
a year to Carillion. 
Going forward we have a healthy pipeline of new prospects,
but we expect revenue from this sector to reduce slightly as
we continue to apply a selective approach to the projects for
which we bid, particularly in respect of new construction
where we will remain focused on ECI road contracts. Carillion
continues to be an equity partner in a consortium that has
been shortlisted for the £5 billion Design, Build, Finance and
Operate project for widening and maintaining the M25. 
Our interests in this project lie in being an equity investor 
and in providing road maintenance services over the life 
of the concession contract. The Highways Agency is expected
to select a preferred bidder for this project during 2008.

Civil engineering
We provide civil engineering services, including
integrated solutions, for customers in a wide range of
sectors, notably transport infrastructure, marine works,
coastal and river defences, industrial developments,
water, wind energy, micro-tunnelling and piling. 
In 2007, we generated £239 million of revenue from our 
civil engineering activities (2006: £241 million). Revenue
remained broadly unchanged as we continued to consolidate
our activities in this sector through applying strict selectivity
criteria to the projects undertaken by our civil engineering
business, which we acquired with Mowlem in 2006. The
process of consolidation is now complete and the business 
is moving forward following a number of notable successes 
in 2007. These included new contracts for transport
infrastructure projects including the Rugby Western Bypass
and Bedford Western Bypass, together worth around 
£55 million, a £19 million contract for London City Airport
and an £11 million contract for Northumberland Water.
We believe the outlook for our civil engineering business is
positive and we expect continuing opportunities for growth 
in 2008 in our chosen areas of this market, particularly
highways, the water sector, wind farms and rail civil
engineering. 
Public Private Partnership projects
Carillion has played a leading role in the development
of the UK Private Finance Initiative since its inception 
in the early 1990s. Today, we have strong positions in
our chosen sectors of the Private Finance and Public
Private Partnership projects market, namely Defence,
Health, Education, Transport, Prisons and other
Government accommodation in the UK and the 
Health sector in Canada.
Our ability to win and deliver projects successfully, by
integrating our skills and resources in project finance, design,
construction, maintenance and facilities management,
continues to create substantial value for the Group, through
the equity we invest in these projects and also from providing
construction, maintenance and facilities management services
over the life of concession contracts, typically 25 to 35 years.
At 31 December 2007, we had a portfolio of 23 financially
closed projects, in which we had invested, or had
commitments to invest, £175 million of equity. The Directors’
valuation of these investments at 31 December 2007 was
£266 million, based on discounting the cash flows from 
these investments at an average of eight per cent, which
reflects the different discount rates applied to equity invested 
in projects that are in operation and projects that are still
under construction. Carillion has also played a leading role 
in establishing the value of equity investments in Public Private
Partnership projects through a number of equity sales, which
have helped to create a strong secondary market for these
investments and demonstrate the significant value being
created for shareholders. 
The overall outlook in our chosen sectors of the Public Private
Partnership projects market is for continuing growth, both 
in the UK and Canada, and we expect to continue to build 
a portfolio of good quality investments.

Middle East 
Our well-established Joint Venture businesses in 
the Middle East provide construction and facilities
management services for high quality developments 
in Dubai and Oman and in 2008 we will extend our
operations to Abu Dhabi and Egypt.
In 2007, Carillion’s share of the revenues of these Joint
Venture businesses was £342 million (2006: £274 million),
which has more than doubled over the last three years (2005:
£165 million). Over the next two years we expect a further
substantial increase in revenue to over £600 million, at
margins of around six per cent. This strong growth reflects 
both the high level of demand in our principal market sectors
and our robust business model in the region, in particular 
the strong relationship we have with the Al Futtaim Group, 
a key Joint Venture partner and customer. 
In 2007, Al Futtaim Carillion was appointed preferred bidder
for two major contracts – a £220 million contract for the 
first phase of the £2 billion Cairo Festival City project and a
£250 million contract for the initial phase of the £10 billion 
Al Raha Beach development in Abu Dhabi for Aldar, one of
the Emirates premier developers. Al Futtaim Carillion also
signed a new framework agreement for the next phase of
Dubai Festival City, worth around £3.5 billion over the 
next six years. 
We are well positioned to build on our success in 2007 with
potential framework agreements for the remainder of Cairo
Festival City, worth around £1.8 billion, and for a second
major project for Aldar in Abu Dubai – the £250 million
Racetrack Hotel on Yas island – which is expected to start in
early 2008. We also expect opportunities to secure further
phases of the Al Raha Beach development in Abu Dhabi and 
a number of major projects for established customers in
Dubai, including Union Properties, Emaar and Dubal. 
Canada and the Caribbean
In Canada we have market leading positions in Public
Private Partnership hospital projects and in road
maintenance. In the Caribbean we have well established
positions in building and civil engineering.
We generated revenue of £186 million from this region in
2007 (2006: £163 million), with growth driven primarily by
Public Private Partnership projects and road maintenance in
Canada and general construction in the Caribbean. In 2007, 
a Carillion Joint Venture completed the new William Osler
Hospital in Toronto, our second Public Private Partnership
hospital in Canada, which moved successfully into the
operational phase, with Carillion providing non-clinical facilities
management. A Carillion Joint Venture also achieved financial
close on a third Public Private Partnership hospital in Canada,
the £200 million Sault Area Hospital, which is now under
construction. In the Caribbean, we continued to make progress
in our construction and facilities management markets.
The outlook in our principal markets in this region is positive.
In Canada, we are shortlisted for two more Public Private
Partnership hospitals, the Niagara and Woodstock hospitals in
Ontario, estimated to be worth up to £450 million of revenue,
and in which we would invest up to £14 million of equity.
With opportunities to bid for further Public Private Partnership
hospitals and road maintenance contracts in Canada and to
build on the progress we have made in the Caribbean, 
we expect continuing growth in 2008.

Winter maintenance is a vital part of 
the service provided by Carillion for the
Highways Agency and Local Highway
Authorities in the UK and for Provincial
Governments in Canada. Total revenue, including Joint Ventures, increased by 13 per cent 
to nearly £4 billion (2006: £3.5 billion), primarily due to organic
growth in support services and Middle East construction services
together with a full twelve months revenue contribution from the
businesses acquired with Mowlem in February 2006.
Underlying profit before tax from continuing operations increased
by 23 per cent to £101.8 million (2006: £82.6 million) and
underlying earnings per share from continuing operations on 
the same basis rose by 22 per cent to 28.9 pence per share 
(2006: 23.7 pence). 
Underlying cash flow from operations of £135.7 million 
(2006: £99.1 million) comfortably exceeded underlying operating
profit. Net borrowing at 31 December 2007 was £44.9 million 
(2006: £108.0 million) and average net borrowing in 2007 
was £130.3 million (2006: £148.0 million post the acquisition 
of Mowlem).
The Group has continued to develop the strong positions it holds
in a wide range of growth markets, winning new orders during
the year worth some £4.0 billion. At 31 December 2007 the Group’s
forward order book stood at £16.0 billion (2006: £16.0 billion)
and its pipeline of probable new orders had increased significantly
to £3.6 billion (2006: £1.6 billion).
Given the strength of the Group’s performance in 2007 
and prospects for 2008 and the medium term, the Board is
recommending a final ordinary dividend for 2007 of 7.5 pence 
per share, making the total full-year dividend for 2007 11.0 pence
per share, an increase of 22 per cent on the total paid in respect 
of 2006 (9.0 pence). The final dividend will be paid on 
20 June 2008 to shareholders on the register at close of business
on 25 April 2008.
As I announced in my 2006 report to shareholders, Chris Girling
retired from the Board in April 2007 and was succeeded as Group
Finance Director by Richard Adam who joined the Board from
Associated British Ports Holdings plc where he had been Group
Finance Director since 1999. In January 2008, we were delighted
to welcome David Hurcomb to the Board as an Executive Director.
David joined Carillion in 2005 having held a number of senior
positions in our industry. With extensive experience of our key
market sectors, David will make a valuable contribution to
Carillion’s development.
The credit for what Carillion has achieved is due to the 
leadership of our management team and the commitment and
professionalism of our people. On behalf of the Board I should 
like to thank all our employees for the contribution they have
made to Carillion’s success in 2007. 
The acquisition of Alfred McAlpine in February 2008 has
further strengthened Carillion’s position as a leading support
services and integrated solutions business and the Board
expects the Group to make further strong progress in 2008
and deliver materially enhanced earnings in 2009.

2007 was another strong year for
Carillion. The Group delivered record
profits and continued its strategic
development to support sustainable,
profitable growth. In particular, the
successful integration of the Carillion 
and Mowlem businesses has created 
a stronger, more resilient business, 
with enhanced positions in selected
growth markets.

Our performance
Chairman’s statement
Section 03 – Our performance 16 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Our performance
Group Chief Executive’s review
More specifically, in 2007 we said that going forward we will 
focus on
• growing revenue in support services at stable margins of
between four and five per cent
• using the strong positions we have established in our chosen
sectors of the Private Finance market in the UK and Canada 
to win projects in which equity investments will create
significant value for the Group
• more than doubling Carillion’s share of revenues from our 
Joint Venture businesses in the Middle East from £274 million 
in 2006 to over £600 million within the next three years, at 
margins of some 6 per cent
• improving the combined margins of our construction activities 
in the UK, Canada and the Caribbean and the Middle East
towards 3 per cent over the next three years.
We also set seven key performance indicators for 2007 in respect
of which Carillion has performed strongly, as we continued to
build on the step change in Carillion’s development that we
achieved in 2006 through the acquisition and successful
integration of Mowlem. 
Key performance indicators in 2007
1. Attract, develop and retain excellent people by 
becoming an employer of choice
Delighting our customers by meeting or exceeding their
expectations depends primarily on the quality of our people.
Therefore, our ability to attract, develop and retain excellent
people by becoming an employer of choice continues to be our
top priority. 
In 2007, we made further good progress towards this objective
through the leadership, personal development and employee
engagement programmes we have introduced across the 
Group to help all our people fulfil their potential and contribute 
to Carillion’s success. 
Creating a culture of trust and open communication is essential 
to the success of our people policies and programmes. Our
managers and supervisors seek to engage with all our people
through regular one-to-one meetings, individual performance 
and development reviews and monthly team talks, supported 
by newsletters and our Company newspaper, Spectrum that 
once again received the top national award in 2007 from
‘Communicators in Business’ as the best UK company newspaper.
Listening to what our people tell us and acting upon it is vital to
good communication. To that end and to help us monitor and
measure our progress, we conduct employee surveys. For example,
every year we hold ‘The Great Debate’, an interactive survey in
which our people, selected randomly from across the Group, 
share their views on a wide range of issues, which are important
to their development and satisfaction and to the success of
Carillion. In 2007, around 2,500 people took part in ‘The Great
Debate’, the results of which showed that we are making good
overall progress on these issues and that our average scores
compared favourably with those of other top UK companies.
Carillion’s success continues to be based
on implementing our consistent and
successful strategy for sustainable,
profitable growth of
> growing support services and Public
Private Partnership (PPP) projects
organically and by acquisition
> developing and marketing integrated
solutions tailored to the needs of
customers, including project finance,
design and construction, maintenance
and lifetime asset management, and
> maintaining a strong and selective
construction capability focused on
higher added-value contracts for long
term customers.

Group Chief Executive’s review

2. Be the recognised leader in the delivery of safety
and sustainability
The Health and Safety of our people and everyone who works
with us or is affected by our operations is paramount. In 2005, 
we set the demanding objective of eliminating reportable
accidents by 2010. 
Known as ‘Target Zero’, this objective is led by our Board and
requires the constant vigilance and commitment of everyone in
Carillion to ensure that safe working practices are consistently
adopted and supported by rigorous reviews, audits and training.
We are pleased to report that in 2007 we made further progress
towards ‘Target Zero’. The Group’s Accident Frequency Rate (AFR)
reduced by 22 per cent to 0.14 reportable accidents per 100,000
man hours worked (2006 AFR: 0.18), which ranks with the best 
in our sector. This follows year on year reductions in our AFR of 
25 per cent in 2006 and 35 per cent in 2005.
Despite a nine per cent increase in the total number of hours
worked in 2007 to over 210 million, the total number of
reportable accidents under RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, 
Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995) reduced
by 15 per cent to 295 (2006: 347) and also follows year on year
reductions of 24 per cent in 2006 and 27 per cent in 2005.
We deeply regret that one fatal traffic accident, involving a 
Joint Venture employee, occurred on one of our international
project sites in 2007. One prosecution of Carillion and one of 
its sub-contractors by the Health and Safety Executive, relating 
to incidents that occurred in 2004, was concluded in 2007. 
No other enforcement notices were received by Carillion or 
any of its sub-contractors in 2007 in respect of work being 
carried out by Carillion or on the Company’s behalf.
In 2007, Carillion once again submitted information on the 
Health and Safety performance of all its UK business units to 
the Corporate Health and Safety Performance Index, having 
been the first and only major construction company to do so in
2006. This Index, which is sponsored by the Health and Safety
Commission, covers all aspects of Health and Safety management
and performance. A wide range of industries participate in the
Index, which enables us to benchmark our performance beyond
our own industry sector. In 2007, we improved our Index score 
to 7.4 (2006: 6.4), which was well above the mean score of 6.7.
Our commitment to sustainability has made Carillion the
recognised leader in the development and adoption of responsible
business practices, as we demonstrated by topping our sector 
with a Gold performance ranking in Business in the Community’s
2006 Corporate Responsibility Index. We say more about our
programme for sustainable development on pages 33 to 35 of 
this report. 
More detailed information on Health and Safety and sustainability
will be published in our 2007 Sustainability Report on our website
at www.carillionplc.com/sustainability in April 2008. 
3. Deliver revenue growth of a minimum of five per cent
through exceeding our customers’ expectations 
In 2007, revenue increased by 13 per cent, which after allowing
for a full year contribution from the businesses acquired with
Mowlem in February 2006, means we achieved organic growth 
of eight per cent and ahead of our objective of five per cent.
Organic growth was driven mainly by a 20 per cent increase 
in UK support services revenue, particularly in the defence and
private sector facilities management sectors, and a 25 per cent
increase in Middle East construction services revenue, reflecting
our strong markets in both Dubai and Oman. 
4. Deliver Mowlem integration cost savings at a run 
rate of £26 million per annum by the end of 2007 
We delivered integration cost savings at a run rate of £26 million a
year, in line with our objective and significantly above the original
target run rate of £15 million a year, which we announced at 
the time of acquisition. These hard, measurable savings were
achieved in a number of areas, including eliminating management
duplication, the adoption of Carillion’s shared services model for
central and back office functions, property rationalisation and
more efficient and effective supply chain management.
5. Deliver materially enhanced earnings in 2007
Revenue and margin growth resulted in 23 and 22 per cent 
increases in underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings
per share, respectively. Increasing margins, particularly in the
businesses acquired with Mowlem, through applying Carillion’s
strict project selectivity criteria and risk management processes was
identified at the time of acquisition as an important opportunity
for earnings growth. Overall operating margins increased to 
2.6 per cent (2006: 2.3 per cent), with increases in group
construction services (excluding the Middle East) to 0.7 per cent
(2006: 0.6 per cent) and in Middle East construction services to
7.5 per cent (2006: 5.2 per cent). 
6. Generate cash-backed operating profit
Underlying cash flow from operations of £135.7 million
comfortably exceeded underlying profit from operations of 
£101.2 million. Strong cash management is fundamental to
delivering sustainable profitable growth and the consistent 
delivery of cash-backed profit remains a key performance 
indicator for the Group.
7. Achieve average net borrowing in the full-year of 
around £150 million
Average net borrowing was £130.3 million and well below 
our full-year target. Achieving this objective and reducing net
borrowing at 31 December to £44.9 million (2006: £108.0 million)
follows our success in delivering a strong cash flow from
operations, in line with our continuing focus on cash
management.  19 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Key performance indicators in 2008
In order to maintain the Group’s strong momentum we have 
set the following key performance indicators for 2008
• continue to attract, develop and retain excellent people 
by being an employer of choice
• be the recognised leader in the delivery of safety 
and sustainability
• deliver revenue growth of a minimum of five per cent 
• successfully integrate Alfred McAlpine and deliver 
integration cost savings that put us on track to achieve 
savings at a run rate of £30 million by the end of 2009
• achieve earnings per share growth that puts us on track 
to deliver materially enhanced earnings per share in 
2009 following the Alfred McAlpine acquisition
• generate cash-backed operating profit
• achieve year-end net borrowing in the region of £300 million.
Acquisition of Alfred McAlpine
In December 2007, we announced the terms of a recommended
shares and cash offer for the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine plc.
The acquisition, which received the overwhelming support 
of Carillion and Alfred McAlpine shareholders, was completed 
on 12 February 2008 and valued Alfred McAlpine’s share capital 
at £554.5 million. The acquisition was funded by the issue of 
112.9 million new Carillion shares, £171.7 million in cash and 
£1.3 million of loan notes. 
Alfred McAlpine is an excellent strategic fit and the acquisition is
expected to deliver significant value for shareholders by generating
substantial synergy cost savings and enhanced operational
performance. Combining the complementary skills and market
strengths of Carillion and Alfred McAlpine will create
• a leading UK support services business with annual support
services revenues of approximately £2.6 billion (based on 
2007 revenues) 
• an enhanced capability to provide integrated solutions, including
design, construction, maintenance, facilities management and
private finance
• a strong and selective construction business that will continue 
to target margin improvement through the application of
Carillion’s project selectivity and risk management processes
• synergy cost savings at a run rate of £30 million per annum 
by the end of 2009 for a one-off cost of £30 million
• financial returns well ahead of Carillion’s weighted average 
cost of capital
• materially enhanced earnings in 2009.
The integration of the Carillion and Alfred McAlpine businesses
has already commenced and is progressing very well. We look
forward to working with our 8,500 new colleagues during 2008
and beyond in order to create an even stronger business from
which all stakeholders can benefit.
Outlook and prospects 
Through the acquisition of Mowlem we have created a stronger,
more resilient business, with enhanced positions in a wide range
of growth markets. 
At 31 December 2007 we had a £16 billion order book, of which
£13.5 billion is for support services and Public Private Partnerships
projects, and a pipeline of probable new orders worth £3.6 billion.

Construction services 
(excluding the Middle East)
The overall outlook in our principal market sectors in the UK 
and international regions, which are described in more detail 
on pages 4 to 11 of this report, is expected to remain positive. 
In summary
• the UK support services market is forecast to grow in real terms
by between two and three per cent per annum over the next
five years from £115 billion in 2007 to £130 billion by 2012
• we expect continuing opportunities for Public Private Partnership
projects in 2008 and over the medium term in both the 
UK and Canada and to continue to build a portfolio of good 
quality investments
• in the Middle East we expect our markets to remain very 
strong and we are confident of growing revenues from 
this region to over £600 million, from the 2007 level of 
£337 million, within the next two years, at margins of 
some six per cent
• the UK non-housing new-build construction market is 
forecast to grow in real terms by over two per cent per annum
over the next three years
• in Canada and the Caribbean we expect continuing healthy
growth driven by Public Private Partnership projects and roads
maintenance services. 
In view of the Group’s strengths and positive outlook, I believe 
we are well positioned to make further strong progress in 2008 
and deliver materially enhanced earnings in 2009.

Operating and financial review
In 2007, Carillion has again delivered strong earnings growth from
its UK and International businesses and we remain well placed to
make further strong progress in 2008 and over the medium term.
Carillion provides support services and integrated solutions,
including design, construction, maintenance and private 
finance, to deliver life-time asset management for buildings and
infrastructure. The Group has operations in the UK, Middle East
and Canada and the Caribbean and our principal market sectors
and activities are described on pages 4 to 11 of this report.
Accounting policies
The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards and there have been no changes in accounting policies
during 2007, except for disclosures in respect of financial
instruments in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standard, IFRS 7, which are set out in Note 28 on pages 93 to 95.
The Group’s significant accounting policies are described on pages
64 to 67.
Group overview 
Total revenue from continuing operations in 2007 increased 
by 13 per cent to £3,951.7 million (2006: £3,512.4 million),
including revenue from Joint Ventures of £621.0 million 
(2006: £528.5 million).
Total underlying profit from continuing operations increased by 
24 per cent to £101.2 million (2006: £81.3 million), including
profit from Joint Ventures of £36.8 million (2006: £31.6 million). 
The underlying profit from operations margin increased to 
2.6 per cent (2006: 2.3 per cent) and reflected our continuing
drive to improve margins through contract selectivity, cost
reduction and greater efficiency. In particular, improving margins
over time in the businesses acquired with Mowlem and increasing
the contribution from our businesses in the Middle East continue
to represent opportunities for enhancing earnings growth. 
After a net financial income of £0.6 million, underlying profit
before tax was £101.8 million, an increase of 23 per cent 
(2006: £82.6 million). Underlying earnings per share on 
the same measure increased by 22 per cent to 28.9 pence 
(2006: 23.7 pence).
Intangible amortisation and impairment of other investments
amounted to £21.5 million (2006: £17.2 million including 
goodwill impairment), restructuring costs £14.2 million 
(2006: £22.6 million) and non-operating income £28.3 million
(2006: £25.3 million), leaving reported profit before tax of 
£94.4 million (2006: £68.1 million). 
I am pleased to report that Carillion 
made good progress in 2007 and that 
we either achieved or exceeded all of our 
key financial and strategic objectives.

£9.9 million, interest tax and dividend payments of £30.4 million
and a net cash inflow from acquisitions and disposals of 
£9.6 million, net borrowing at 31 December reduced by 
£63.1 million to £44.9 million (31 December 2006: 
£108.0 million). Average net borrowing was £130.3 million 
(2006 post the acquisition of Mowlem: £148.0 million) and
significantly better than our objective of £150 million.
Segmental reporting and analysis
Operating profit by financial reporting segment is summarised 
in the table on this page and a detailed segmental analysis of 
the Group’s businesses is provided in Note 2 to the financial
statements on page 68. Operating performance in each of 
our financial reporting segments is discussed in more detail on
pages 22 to 29. 
We have made two changes to the way we report our financial
results and how we group together activities of a similar type 
and risk profile in order to make it easier to value our earnings 
on a consistent basis. Previously, we reported our results in 
three segments – support services, investments and construction
services. We now report our activities in four segments – 
support services, Public Private Partnership projects, Middle East
construction services and construction services (excluding the
Middle East). Our Middle East construction activities, which 
were previously included within construction services, are now
being reported separately, because of their higher margins and
lower risk profile compared with construction services in the UK.
In addition, to provide greater clarity, the investments segment 
has been re-named Public Private Partnership projects, but there
has been no change to the results we report in this segment,
namely the equity returns on our investments in Public Private
Partnership projects.

Section 03 – Our performance Support services
In this segment we report the results of our facilities
management, facilities services, rail, road maintenance 
and consultancy businesses.
Revenue in support services increased by 23 per cent to 
£1,793.6 million of which some 20 per cent was due to 
organic growth, with the remainder attributable to having a 
full 12 months’ contribution from the businesses acquired with
Mowlem in February 2006. Organic growth was due primarily 
to increased revenues from facilities management and services,
both for public and private sector customers, notably the 
Ministry of Defence, BT, Virgin Media and Norwich Union, 
and from highways maintenance in the UK and Canada, 
partially offset by lower volumes in rail infrastructure. 
Underlying operating profit increased by 26 per cent to 
£73.9 million, reflecting revenue growth, particularly in the
Defence sector, including Joint Venture contracts, and in 
the facilities management and road maintenance sectors.
Overall, new order intake in support services has remained 
healthy and the value of our order book for this segment at 
31 December 2007 was £8.4 billion (December 2006: £8.4 billion). 
The outlook in this segment continues to be very positive with
forecast real growth in the UK support services market of between
two and three per cent per annum over the next five years.
Outscourcing by public and private sector customers is expected 
to continue to provide significant opportunities for growth in
facilities management and services and roads maintenance. 
This is already evident in the number of major new orders 
won by Carillion and its Joint Venture partners in the first two
months of 2008 for established ‘blue chip’ customers, including
BT, AXA and Philips, worth around £0.9 billion. 
We also expect modest growth in our UK rail infrastructure
activities as a result of planned increases in expenditure on
network and station enhancement projects. We expect to achieve
growth despite the effects of ceasing to provide track renewal
services to Network Rail from the beginning of 2008 and the sale
of our rail operations in Scandinavia, which together generated
around £100 million of revenue in 2007. 
In addition, growth in the outsourcing of roads maintenance in
Canada and in our facilities management markets in the Middle
East and in Canada continue to offer opportunities for our
businesses in these regions to increase the contributions they
make to this segment.

Section 03 – Our performance Public Private Partnership projects
In this segment we report the equity returns on our
investments in Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects 
in our chosen sectors of Defence, Health, Education,
Transport, Secure and other Government accommodation.
At 31 December 2007, we had a portfolio of 23 equity investments
(31 December 2006: 24) in financially closed PPP projects in 
which we had already invested some £78 million of equity and
commitments to invest a further £97 million, which will bring 
our total equity investment in these projects to £175 million. 
The Directors’ valuation of our portfolio at 31 December 2007
increased by 12 per cent to £266 million (31 December 2006: 
£238 million), based on discounting the cash flows from these
investments and commitments at 8 per cent. 
As expected, underlying operating profit in this segment reduced
slightly to £25.4 million, with growing returns from our maturing
portfolio of investments offset by two principal factors. First, 
the sale of eight equity investments in September 2006, at an
exceptional profit of £25.6 million, reduced operating profit in
2007 by some £7 million. Second, Group operating profit in 
2006 benefited from a one-off fee as a result of achieving financial
close on the £12 billion Allenby Connaught project 
for the Ministry of Defence in April 2006. 
We also sold investments in a further three mature PPP projects,
namely the Great Western Hospital, Swindon, Harplands Hospital,
North Staffordshire and Glasgow Southern General Hospital, in
December 2007. The sale generated proceeds of £21.5 million 
and an exceptional profit of £23.6 million. The proceeds reflected
a net present value for the cash flows from these investments
based on a discount rate of under 5.5 per cent. Once again the
sale of equity in mature projects has demonstrated the substantial
value being generated for the Group through our ability to 
win and deliver PPP projects successfully by integrating our 
skills in project finance, design, construction, maintenance and
facilities management. 
During the year, Carillion Joint Ventures achieved financial close on
the £200 million Sault Area Hospital in Ontario, Canada, in which
we will invest £3.5 million of equity, and on the £175 million
South Tyneside and Gateshead Building Schools for the Future
(BSF) project, in which we will invest £0.9 million of equity. 
Since the year end, a Carillion Joint Venture has been appointed
preferred bidder for the £208 million Nottingham BSF project in
which we expect to invest approximately £2.0 million of equity.
We are also the preferred bidder for two NHS Independent Sector
Treatment Centre projects – London North and Hertfordshire – in
which we expect to invest up to £6 million of equity. In addition,
we are shortlisted for a further 10 projects with a potential 
equity requirement of up to £96 million. Beyond that we expect
continuing opportunities to bid for further PPP projects in the 
UK and in Canada. 
Overall, the outlook in our chosen sectors of the PPP market, both
in the UK and Canada, remains positive and we expect further
opportunities in 2008 and over the medium term to continue to
build a portfolio of good quality investments that will generate
significant value for the Group.

Section 03 – Our performance Middle East construction services
In this segment, we report the results of our building 
and civil engineering activities in the Middle East.
Revenue from our businesses in the Middle East increased by 
25 per cent and underlying operating profit by 83 per cent 
as a result of continuing strong organic growth in our existing
markets in Dubai and Oman, with operating margins improving
from 5.2 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
Carillion and its Joint Venture partners have continued to use 
their strong market positions and reputation for high quality
services to negotiate substantial new work in our existing markets
in Dubai and Oman and also in Abu Dhabi and Egypt, where 
we will begin construction work on major new projects in 2008. 
At 31 December 2007, our Middle East order book stood 
at £0.7 billion (2006: £0.3 billion) and we had a pipeline of
probable new orders worth over £1.0 billion (2006: £0.1 billion).
There were a number of notable successes in 2007. These
included a £120 million contract for Carillion Alawi to build the
House of Musical Arts for the Oman Royal Court Affairs and the
appointment of Al Futtaim Carillion as the preferred bidder for
two major contracts – a £250 million, 24-month contract for 
the first phase of the £10 billion Al Raha Beach development in
Abu Dhabi and a £220 million, 30-month contract for the first
phase of the £2 billion Cairo Festival City development. Al Futtaim
Carillion also signed a six-year framework agreement for a further
£3.5 billion of work on the Dubai Festival City development.  
The outlook in our markets in the Middle East is for continuing
strong growth. Current opportunities include the remainder 
of the Cairo Festival City development, worth around 
£1.8 billion, further contracts in Dubai worth up to £700 million, 
a £250 million contract for the Racetrack Hotel on Yas Island 
in Abu Dhabi and contracts in Qatar worth in the region of 
£300 million.
Given the major contracts, preferred bidder positions and
framework agreements already secured, together with numerous
opportunities for further work in this region, we remain confident
that we will substantially increase our share of revenues from 
the Middle East from £337 million in 2007 to over £600 million
over the next two years, at margins of around 6 per cent.

Section 03 – Our performance Construction services 
(excluding the Middle East)
In this segment, we report the results of our UK building,
civil engineering and developments businesses and our
construction activities in Canada and the Caribbean.
Revenue in construction services increased by 2 per cent to 
£1,667 million, due to having a full 12 months’ contribution 
from the businesses acquired with Mowlem in February 2006. 
The substantial organic growth we achieved in the UK defence
and roads sectors was more than offset by reduced activity in 
UK building, where our focus is on increasing margins ahead 
of revenue. 
Underlying operating profit reduced by 14 per cent, because 
the contribution from Joint Ventures was substantially lower 
than in 2006, which benefited from a number of contract
settlements not repeated in 2007. Underlying Group operating
profit increased by 22 per cent, reflecting revenue growth and
improved margins, in line with our selective approach to the
projects we undertake. 
While overall opportunities for new orders in this segment 
have remained strong, we have maintained our focus on long
term customers and projects that enable us to improve margins
rather than simply growing revenue. Notable new contracts in
2007 included a pre-construction contract for the £300 million
second satellite at Heathrow Terminal 5 and a £90 million 
contract for the first phase of the £2 billion Kings Cross Central
regeneration project. This disciplined approach to project 
selectivity was reflected in our order book for construction 
services (excluding the Middle East), which stood at £1.8 billion 
at 31 December 2007 (December 2006: £2.6 billion).
The outlook in our construction markets is for continuing growth.
In the UK, the non-housing new construction market is forecast 
to grow in real terms by an average of over two per cent per
annum over the next three years. However, we shall continue 
to focus on using these buoyant market conditions to improve
margins ahead of revenues. In Canada, there are also prospects 
for further healthy growth, primarily from the construction of
Public Private Partnership projects, particularly hospitals.

Intangible amortisation and impairment of goodwill 
and other investments
Intangible amortisation and impairment of £21.5 million 
(2006: £17.2 million including goodwill impairment) continues 
to predominantly reflect the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006.
Restructuring costs
A summary of restructuring costs is provided in the table below.
2007 2006
£m £m
Mowlem integration costs 9.5 18.4
Operational structure review costs 4.5 –
Rail activities review costs 0.2 4.2
14.2 22.6
The integration of the Carillion and Mowlem businesses was
completed earlier than expected in 2007, at a total one-off cost 
of £27.9 million, of which £18.4 million was incurred in 2006 
and £9.5 million in 2007. This will generate savings of at least £26
million per annum from the beginning of 2008 – substantially
more than the £15 million that was originally expected at the time
of the Mowlem acquisition. Following the Group’s rapid growth,
both organically and by acquisition, we reviewed and rationalised
our operational structure at the end of 2007 at a cost of £4.5
million. This will generate further operational efficiencies and
increase the Group’s profitability in 2008 and beyond.
Non-operational items
Non-operational items amounted to £28.3 million in 2007 
(2006: £25.3 million) and largely related to the disposal of
investments in mature Public Private Partnership projects, as
described on page 24.
Net financial income 
The Group had a net financial income of £0.6 million (2006: 
£1.3 million). This comprised a net expense of £11.1 million in
respect of borrowings, interest received in respect of loans to
Special Purpose Companies for Public Private Partnership projects
of £4.9 million and a net interest credit from retirement benefit
schemes of £6.8 million. 
Taxation
The effective tax rate on the Group’s and Joint Venture’s
underlying profit was 25 per cent and we currently expect to
maintain this rate over the medium term. Our effective tax rate
reflects the agreement of certain prior year tax issues with the 
tax authorities, together with a mechanism for the use of certain
tax losses acquired with Mowlem plc, both in 2007 and in future
years. At 31 December 2007 the Group had £232 million of
corporate tax losses in the UK that are available to reduce 
future tax liabilities.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share from continuing operations
increased by 22 per cent to 28.9 pence (2006: 23.7 pence). 
This substantial increase reflected strong organic growth in the
Group’s operations and the benefits of successfully integrating 
the Carillion and Mowlem businesses earlier than originally
expected, in particular the delivery of integration cost savings 
at a run rate of £26 million by the end of 2007. The 22 per cent
increase in underlying earnings per share from continuing
operations achieved in 2007 also comfortably exceeded the 
profit forecast made by the Group on 12 December 2007 as part
of the process of acquiring Alfred McAlpine plc, when the Group
forecast that its 2007 growth in underlying earnings per share
from continuing operations would be at least 20 per cent
compared with 2006.
Discontinued operations
Three non-core businesses were sold in 2007 and treated as
discontinued, namely, Pall Mall, Sovereign Soft Services and the
Group’s rail activities in Sweden and Denmark. These sales
generated a net loss of £6.2 million together with £1.4 million 
of trading losses in 2007 up to the dates of sale. Details of these
sales are given in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements
on page 76.
Dividend 
Carillion has a progressive dividend policy of increasing the
dividend paid to shareholders broadly in line with earnings growth,
after taking account of the investment needs of the business.
Consistent with this policy, the Board has recommended a final
dividend in respect of 2007 of 7.5 pence, making the full-year
dividend 11.0 pence, an increase of 22 per cent on the total 
paid in respect of 2006 (9.0 pence). Underlying dividend cover 
was 2.6 times and similar to that in 2006.

One-year total shareholder return
Retirement benefits
The Group’s ongoing pensions charge against profit in 2007 was
£29.3 million (2006: £35.1 million) calculated on the basis of
International Accounting Standard 19. After the additional cash
payments of £46.3 million that were made to the Group’s pensions
schemes in line with our pension deficit recovery plan, the Group’s
pension schemes had a deficit net of tax at 31 December 2007 
of £13.8 million (31 December 2006: £75.8 million). 
Committed bank facilities
In September 2007, Carillion renegotiated and increased its main
corporate borrowing facility from £329 million to £590 million 
to support the ongoing development of the Group. This new 
five year facility, which is repayable on 30 September 2012, was 
over-subscribed and secured on attractive terms. Syndication of 
the new facilities was led by four core banks, The Royal Bank of
Scotland, Bank of Scotland plc, Bayerische Landesbank, London
Branch, and Lloyds TSB Bank plc. It was particularly pleasing 
to secure these facilities during the challenging conditions of 
the global debt markets, which demonstrated the banking
community’s strong support for, and confidence in, the 
Carillion Group. These new facilities also proved to be more 
than adequate to finance the £171.7 million cash element of 
the total £554.5 million consideration for the acquisition of 
Alfred McAlpine plc that completed in February 2008.
31 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Additional cash payments to the Group’s pension’s schemes
increased to £46.3 million in line with our pension deficit recovery
plan. There was a net cash inflow from assets of £4.4 million,
because capital expenditure of £25.1 million was more than 
offset by income from the sale of assets, including rail plant and
property. The substantial cash outflow in respect of acquisitions
and disposals in 2006 was due to the acquisition of Mowlem; 
the net inflow in 2007 reflected proceeds from the disposal of
businesses, including the three mature Public Private Partnership
projects disposed of during the year, partially offset by investments
in Public Private Partnership projects and a Joint Venture business
in Canada.

Net operating assets 547.8 541.7
Net borrowing (44.9) (108.0)
Net assets 502.9 433.7
The reduction in property, plant and equipment was due to asset
disposals, including rail plant and property. Intangible assets
reduced, reflecting amortisation and the disposal of Pall Mall. 
The increase in investments in Joint Ventures reflected the 
Group’s equity investments in Public Private Partnership projects.
The substantial reduction in the Group’s net retirement benefits
liability, reflected the substantial improvement in equity values
during the year, together with the additional cash payments made
to our pensions schemes under our deficit recovery plan.
Share price 
Carillion’s share price closed at 351.25 pence on 31 December
2007, a reduction of 11.5 per cent on the closing price on 
31 December 2006.
In common with many companies in our sector, Carillion’s total
shareholder return reduced in 2007. The overall reduction of 
9.4 per cent compared with an increase of 5.9 per cent for 
the FTSE 350. However, over the last five years Carillion’s total
shareholder return has significantly outperformed that of the 
FTSE 350. The FTSE 350 was chosen by the Board as the best
comparator to illustrate Carillion’s performance against a broad
equity market index.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Our performance
Operating and financial review
continued
the Joint Venture partners and secured on the assets of the SPC. 
A number of SPCs have entered into interest rate derivatives as a
means of hedging interest rate risk. These derivatives are interest
rate swaps that effectively fix the rate of interest payable.
Operational risk management
Carillion has rigorous policies and processes in place to identify,
mitigate and manage operational risks. These enable us to 
address strategic risks and those specific to individual businesses
and contracts, including economic, social, environmental and
ethical risks. 
The more significant areas of risk where our failure to perform 
well or changes to macro-economic or market environments
would affect our business, can be summarised as follows
• attracting, developing and retaining excellent people: the 
success and growth of our business depends primarily on the 
quality of our people
• winning new work: our ability to remain competitive by
adapting our strategy and service offering to the changing
needs of our markets and customers is essential to the
continuing success of our business
• managing major contracts: completing contracts on time 
and to the required standards avoids financial penalties and
damage to our brand and reputation
• managing our pension schemes: the costs to Carillion of 
funding its pension schemes depends on the macro-economic
environment, equity market stability and regulatory requirements 
• financial discipline: strong cash management and the delivery 
of cash-backed profits remain fundamental to the success of 
our business
• integration of the Carillion and Alfred McAlpine businesses:
delivery of the substantial cost synergy and operational 
benefits of the acquisition depends on the successful 
integration of these businesses. 
We apply our risk management processes to every aspect of our
operations from choosing our market sectors and the contracts 
we bid for to the selection of our suppliers and sub-contractors.
We also apply them to every stage of a contract from inception 
to completion, in order to deliver the cash-backed profit we expect
and high-quality services for our customers.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that, after making enquiries, they have a
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Richard Adam FCA
Group Finance Director
5 March 2008
Treasury policy and risk management
The Group has a centralised Treasury function whose primary role
is to manage funding, liquidity and financial risks. In addition,
Treasury sources and administers contract bond and guarantee
facilities for the Group. Treasury is not a profit centre and does not
enter into speculative transactions. The Board sets policies within
which Treasury operates that ensure the most effective financing
of the Group’s operations and limit exposure to financial risk.
Financial risk
The areas of significant financial risk facing the Group relate 
to funding, liquidity, counter party risk, foreign exchange and
interest rates.
Funding and liquidity 
In addition to Carillion plc’s principal borrowing facilities described
above, money market and short-term overdraft facilities are
available to Carillion plc and certain subsidiaries. Operating leases 
are also employed to fund longer-term assets. The quantum of
committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is regularly
reviewed by the Carillion Board and is designed to satisfy the
requirements of the Group’s business plan.
Counter party risk
The Carillion Group undertakes significant financial transactions
only with counter parties that have strong credit ratings. The limits
and requirements in respect of such transactions are reviewed
regularly by the Board of Carillion plc.
Foreign exchange
The Group hedges all significant currency transaction exposures
using foreign exchange risk management techniques. In order to
protect the Group’s balance sheet from the impact of exchange
rate volatility, foreign currency net assets are hedged using
matching currency loans, where these assets exceed the 
equivalent of £10 million. Profits arising within overseas
subsidiaries are not hedged unless it is planned to make a
distribution. Such distributions are then treated as currency
transactions and hedged accordingly.
The average and year end exchange rates used to translate the
Group’s overseas operations were as follows:
Average year end
£sterling 2007 2006 2007 2006
Middle East (US Dollar) 2.00 1.85 1.99 1.96
Oman (Rial) 0.77 0.71 0.77 0.75
UAE (Dirhams) 7.63 6.79 7.31 7.19
Canada (Dollar) 2.14 2.09 1.96 2.28
Trinidad (Dollar) 12.64 11.68 12.52 12.17
Interest rates
The Group’s borrowing facilities are at floating rates of interest
linked to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate. The Group has 
not entered into interest rate derivatives to fix or hedge interest
rate risk and currently none are outstanding. Certain longer-term
assets have been financed using fixed rate leases.
Carillion has invested equity in a number of Joint Venture Special
Purpose Companies (SPC) to deliver Public Private Partnership
projects. SPCs obtain funding for these projects in the form of
long-term bank loans or corporate bonds without recourse to  33 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Our performance
Sustainability review
In this section of our Annual Report we
have summarised what we are doing 
to make our business more sustainable. 
A more detailed account will be published
in our 2007 Sustainability Report, on our
website, in April 2008.
We believe that our leadership in sustainability will increasingly
differentiate us from our competitors and help us to win more
orders, minimise our social, environmental and ethical risks, 
control costs and deliver better services to our customers.
Strategy
We have a well established strategy model for sustainable
development, which is aligned with the four priority areas 
defined by the UK Government in its sustainable development
strategy, ‘Securing the Future’, namely
• sustainable communities
• natural resource protection and environmental enhancement
• climate change and energy
• sustainable consumption and production.
We have identified 12 behaviours and activities across these 
four priority areas, as illustrated in our ‘sun diagram’ below, 
which affect the delivery of our business objectives.
Managing sustainability 
Our commitment to sustainability is driven by our Board,
supported by a Sustainability Advisory Committee. This Committee
is chaired by our Group Chief Executive, John McDonough, and
includes a number of senior Directors, drawn from across our
businesses, to ensure that it maintains close links with the Group’s
operational activities. The Committee also benefits from expert
advice from two external members, Jonathon Porritt, Chair of the
UK Government’s Sustainable Development Commission, and Julia
Cleverdon, Chief Executive of Business in the Community (BITC).

Behaviours and activities
affecting sustainable development
In 2007, we also established a forum in which our senior business
leaders can meet regularly to share best practice and support the
development of our sustainability strategy and its dissemination
across the Group. In addition to the annual sustainability plans 
and objectives we set for all our businesses, we also organise 
a ‘sustainability week’, a Group-wide programme that 
coincides with World Environment Day that focuses on how
individuals and teams can adopt a more sustainable lifestyle 
and contribute to making Carillion a sustainable business. 
Our performance
In 2007, we continued to set specific targets for each of our
business units and for the Group as a whole. In addition, we
focused on five key areas, namely
• communicating simply and consistently to all our people 
to ensure a common understanding of our strategy and
objectives for sustainability
• establishing new internal branding for sustainability
• developing a clear policy for understanding and managing 
our carbon emissions
• introducing quarterly progress reviews of performance 
against our key performance indicators and sustainability
excellence model and
• improving our performance in Business in the Community’s
Corporate Responsibility Index.
The Group’s key sustainability objectives for 2007 were based on
14 specific and measurable targets. In order to drive continuous
improvement, these were demanding targets and our performance
against them has been independently audited by Bureau Veritas. 
A full report on what we have achieved, including our scores
against these targets and key objectives, will be published in our
2007 Sustainability Report in April 2008. 
Participating in Business in the Community’s Corporate
Responsibility Index enables us to benchmark our performance
externally. Since the inception of the Index in 2003, Carillion has
improved its score each year. In the 2006 Index (published in 2007)
Carillion achieved a ‘gold’ performance ranking of 92.5 per cent,
topping the construction and building materials sector. The
average score of all participating companies was 87 per cent,
which demonstrates that Carillion not only continues to be the
leader in its sector, but that our performance compares favourably 
with that of companies in all sectors. 
Carillion continues to be a member of the FTSE4Good index 
and we were also delighted to be ranked among the top 
20 most ethical firms in the UK in 2007 by The Observer’s
‘Good Company Guide’. 
Our sustainability strategy also won the top award for the best
Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy at both the Corporate
Communications magazine awards and the Midlands Region 
PRide Awards.
We say more about what we are doing to improve our impacts 
in the four priority areas of the Government’s sustainable
development strategy, ‘Securing the Future’, on pages 34 and 35.

Sustainable Communities and Workforce
Creating a sustainable business requires the commitment
of all our people – the ‘Carillion community’. We seek to
achieve this through our Health and Safety, leadership,
personal development and employee engagement
programmes, which are described in more detail on
pages 16, 18, 40 and 41. 
How we do business is based on our belief that it’s not only
what we do that matters, but also how we do it, which drives
our commitment to ‘living’ our values in everything we do.
Through our Values Awards we recognise the outstanding
contributions our people make to our success in delivering 
an excellent service to our customers and 1,500 Carillion
people received these awards in 2007. 
Our commitment to sustainable communities extends beyond
our own people. We have a community engagement strategy
for all our major worksites and projects and we encourage 
our people to understand how we can have positive impacts
on the communities in which we operate and to participate 
in community activities. 
Carillion is a member of Business in the Community’s ‘PerCent
Club’, which comprises companies that contribute over one
per cent of their pre-tax profits in cash or in kind to community
activities. We support the Business Action on Homelessness
campaign designed to help homeless people break the cycle of
‘no home, no job’ and in 2007, we supported 57 people
through the ‘Ready to Work’ programme. 
As one of the UK’s leading providers of training for support
services and construction skills, we contribute to the
development of individuals and communities. In 2007, around
1,200 apprentices successfully completed their training in one
of our 18 UK training centres and some 200 people received
training for entry level jobs in the construction industry. 
Natural Resource Protection and 
Environmental Enhancement
Carillion has developed and implemented environmental
management systems across the Group and over 99 
per cent of our UK operations are now accredited to 
ISO 14001 by a registered third party.
What we do and how we do it can have significant impacts
on the use of natural resources and the environment and 
we use our knowledge and skills in developing sustainable
solutions to create positive impacts in these areas.
The preservation of natural habitats and the wildlife they
support is important both socially and environmentally. Seven
years ago we entered into a partnership with the Wildlife
Trusts and established the Carillion Natural Habitats Fund. 
To date we have contributed over £185,000 to the fund to
finance 32 projects and provide opportunities for our people
to volunteer and support the preservation of natural habitats. 
In recognition of our leadership in sustainability, Carillion was
represented on two of the working groups that supported 
the UK Government’s Sustainable Procurement Taskforce 
and helped in the development of its ‘Flexible Framework’.
Under the framework there are four ‘levels’ of achievement 
in respect of sustainable procurement. We were delighted to
achieve Level 1 in 2007 and plan to achieve Level 4 by 2010.
Carillion continues to be a member of the WWF-UK Forest
and Trade Network and we purchase timber from Forest
Stewardship Council certified sources wherever possible. We
also report the volumes and sources of the timber we use to
the WWF annually.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Climate change and energy
Global warming and climate change are now widely
accepted as areas of major international concern.
Carillion is committed to addressing these issues and 
in 2007 we calculated our carbon footprint for our
emissions in 2006. 
This focused on all the areas relevant to our business,
including air, train and road travel (company cars, commercial
vehicles and hire cars), the consumption of electricity, 
gas, fuel oil and paper and the production, re-use and
recycling of waste. 
This was our first major step towards gaining a comprehensive
understanding of our carbon footprint. Our findings from 
this study showed that we generated 62,296 tonnes of CO
2
in 2006, which has set the benchmark for our programme 
to reduce emissions year on year.
We employ around 50,000 people in the Group and as 
the nature of our business involves extensive travel we are
studying the effects of our travel policies on our carbon
footprint. We have already introduced Company policies to
promote diesel powered vehicles and to reduce overall travel. 
Our commitment to tackling climate change is also reflected
in the way we work with our customers to provide sustainable
buildings, infrastructure and lifetime facilities management
and services. 
Carillion’s Joint Venture business, ‘Aspire Defence Capital
Works’, which is responsible for the construction element of
our £12 billion Allenby Connaught Public Private Partnership
project for the Ministry of Defence, won the top awards for
Sustainable Development of the Year and Best Sustainable
Initiative for the Public Sector, at the 2007 Building magazine
Sustainability Awards. 
Sustainable Consumption and Production
Carillion’s leadership in developing and implementing
its sustainability strategy model, which relates our
impact on the environment and on society to business
performance, has made a major contribution to the
Group’s risk management policies and processes. These
address strategic risks and those specific to individual
businesses and contracts, including economic, social
environmental and ethical risks, and are therefore
fundamental to the management of the Group at 
every level of our activities.
In 2007 we undertook a Group-wide customer perception
survey, which sought the views of our customers on a wide
range of issues, including the importance of sustainability. 
68 per cent of our customers believe sustainability and our
ability to deliver sustainable solutions to be very important.
We believe that our leadership in sustainability differentiates
us from competitors. We seek to understand the needs of 
our customers and their objectives in respect of sustainability
and use our knowledge and skills to meet their needs by
developing sustainable solutions. We also seek to promote
sustainable solutions by explaining to all our customers how 
a sustainable approach can not only create positive impacts 
on the environment and on society, but also reduce costs,
increase efficiency and improve the quality of the services 
we offer. 
The Eco-Depot in York, completed in 2007 and pictured
above, is an outstanding example of what can be achieved
through applying the principles of sustainable design and
construction. This is the largest timber frame straw bale clad
building in Europe, which uses 76 per cent less energy than 
a traditional air-conditioned office.

Employees
Information relating to employee numbers and remuneration is
given in Note 6 on page 74.
Employees are key to achieving Carillion’s business strategy and
the Group is committed to improving their skills through training
and development and nurturing a culture in which employees 
feel valued for their contribution and are motivated to achieve
their full potential. 
Carillion’s core values of openness, collaboration, mutual
dependency, sustainable profitable growth, professional delivery
and innovation have been developed to emphasise the changing
working practices required to succeed in an environment where
partnership and integrated solutions are becoming the norm. 
It is Carillion’s aim to foster a working environment in which all
employees are treated with courtesy, dignity and respect. Carillion
strives continually to eliminate all bias and unlawful discrimination
in relation to job applicants, employees, business partners and
members of the public. Employees who become disabled are,
wherever possible, retrained or provided with equipment so that
they can continue their employment.  41 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
The objectives of Carillion’s Equal Opportunity and Diversity 
Policy are
• to have a workforce that represents and responds to the
diversity of customers and today’s society
• improved safety and quality provided by a balanced and
productive workforce
• better public image and market position, leading to improved
links with the community in which Carillion works
• adherence to legal requirements
• lower staff turnover, absenteeism and sickness levels leading 
to cost savings
• to provide a fair working environment in which discrimination
will not be tolerated
• to create a working environment free from discrimination,
harassment, victimisation and bullying
• to work towards finding ways for under represented groups 
to fully realise their potential within the Carillion Organisation
and to take reasonable steps to help such groups 
• to ensure that all employees are aware of the Group Equal
Opportunities and Diversity Policy and to provide any necessary
ongoing training to enable them to meet their responsibilities
under it
• Carillion plc also recognises the merit of developing a workforce
that incorporates the many diverse skills and backgrounds
available from within the total population and accordingly, will
strive to become an organisation that will recognise, value and
understand diversity and to provide its employees with genuine
opportunities to improve and reach their full potential.
Carillion places great importance on open and regular
communication with employees through both formal and informal
processes. As part of this commitment, a Group newspaper,
‘Spectrum’, is produced on a regular basis for all employees. 
The views of employees on matters affecting their interests are
also sought through ‘The Great Debate’. This is a major exercise
which was undertaken by the Group in each of the last five years
to capture the feelings and views of as wide a range of employees
as possible. These views are then taken into account in the
development of work related initiatives as part of Carillion’s
strategy to become an employer of choice. In 2007, around 
2,500 UK employees attended ‘The Great Debate’ sessions.
Carillion stages ‘The Great Debate’ as part of the ongoing quest
for cultural change and to produce step changes which
• raise understanding of what drives motivation, morale,
engagement and performance
• allows employees to take ownership and be empowered to
build and implement solutions
• demonstrates Carillion’s desire to change attitudes and
behaviours based on listening to the views of its employees.
Additionally, ‘Team Talk’ which is held monthly provides Carillion
employees with a face-to-face communication with their line
managers and facilitates two-way communication, discussion 
and feedback. It focuses on local issues and key corporate
messages and information. 
One-to-one meetings between individual employees and their 
line managers are also held to discuss performance and progress.
Employees can also exchange best practice information via a
Knowledge Management Forum on the Group intranet.
Carillion seeks to involve all employees in its leading edge
programmes to integrate safety into everything it does and

General principles
The Board is firmly committed to high standards of corporate
governance. During the year to 31 December 2007 and as
detailed below and in the Remuneration Report, the Company
complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (June 2006). 
Ethics and Business Integrity Policy
Carillion has a clear and unequivocal approach to business
integrity and ethics which underlies the Carillion values of
openness, collaboration, mutual dependency, sustainable,
profitable growth, professional delivery and innovation. 
The Ethics and Integrity Policy demonstrates how Carillion 
will conduct its business to the highest ethical standards.
The policy applies to all employees of any Carillion group
company. The way Carillion delivers this policy is and will be
reflected in the way the Group competes for business, through 
the quality and value of its work and through the reliability 
and reputation of its employees.
The policy is
• business integrity: we do not give or accept bribes. We do 
not sanction or accept any illegal payments, allowances, or
gifts-in-kind. We will investigate fully all alleged breaches. 
We will dismiss any employee who has breached this policy
• mutual respect: we do what we say we will do. We treat 
our people fairly and with respect at all times, avoiding
discrimination and bullying. We provide a safe and healthy
working environment, and respect sustainable principles in 
all our dealings
• trust: we engender trust within our work groups and
companies, respecting diverse traditions and cultures. 
We respect the trust placed in us by others, not least when 
we are asked to take responsibility for aspects of their business 
or resources. We maintain and demand high professional
standards and demand honesty and openness. We avoid
conflicts of interest wherever possible, and we proactively
declare any unavoidable conflicts for open scrutiny and
resolution
• legality: we respect the rule of law in all our dealings. 
We clearly communicate procedures for disciplining those 
who do not comply with the law or our standards and policies. 
We maintain a system for confidential reporting of breaches 
of our standards and policies
• human rights: we support the belief that human rights are
universal and adhere to the principles of human rights in our
operations. We support the United Nations Universal
Declaration on Human Rights.
This policy is carried into Carillion’s business through a series of
detailed procedures. They allow Carillion to carry into practice 
its reputation for conducting business to the highest ethical
standard which is essential to its relationships with customers,
business partners, employees, shareholders and the public. 
The detailed procedures reflect the way Carillion competes for
business, through the quality and value of its work and through
the reliability and reputation of its people.
The Ethics and Business Integrity Policy and its implementation 
is reviewed annually by the Board.
Governance
Corporate Governance Report
Directors
The Board
With effect from 1 January 2008, the Company is led by a Board
comprising five Executive and five Non-Executive Directors.
Throughout 2007, however, the Chairman and the Non-Executive
Directors comprised more than half of the Board. The Chairman
and each of the Non-Executive Directors are considered to be
independent of management. They each have wide areas of
experience and have no business or other relationship that could
materially interfere with their independent judgement. David
Garman is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
In accordance with the Combined Code, the Executive Directors’
service contracts are terminable by one year’s notice. 
A detailed internal evaluation of the Board’s corporate governance
procedures and compliance was again conducted in 2007 by the
Chairman in conjunction with the Company Secretary. The internal
evaluation took into account the views of each of the Directors 
on (i) the role of Directors, (ii) the performance of the Board, the
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, (iii) Board Committees,
(iv) leadership and culture, (v) Corporate Governance (vi) Directors’
remuneration, (vii) relations with shareholders and (viii) Board
accountability and audit. The Board at its meeting in November
2007 reviewed the results of the internal evaluation and, where
required, issues were acted upon in order to further enhance the
effectiveness of the Board’s procedures and working practices. 
This is the sixth year that this process has taken place and will 
be repeated annually as the Board considers it satisfactory. 
In addition, reviews of the performance of each of the Directors 
has taken place. 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the
Group Chief Executive has been agreed by the Board and
encompasses the following parameters
• the primary job of the Chairman of a public company is to
provide continuity, experience and governance while the 
Group Chief Executive provides leadership, energy, imagination
and the driving force
• the Chairman is viewed by investors as the ultimate steward 
of the business and the guardian of the interests of all the
shareholders. Nonetheless, it is essential that the outline 
of their respective roles encourages the Chairman and 
Group Chief Executive to work well together to provide
effective and complementary stewardship
• the Chairman must:
– take overall responsibility for the composition and capability
of the Board
– consult regularly with the Group Chief Executive and be
available on a flexible basis for providing advice, counsel and
support to the Group Chief Executive.
• the Group Chief Executive must: 
– manage the Executive Directors and the Group’s day to 
day activities
– prepare and present to the Board strategic options for 
growth in shareholder value
– set the operating plans and budgets required to deliver 
the agreed strategy
– ensure that the Group has in place appropriate risk
management and control mechanisms.

The Board had a programme of ten meetings in 2007 and also
meets on an ad hoc basis as required.
A formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board for
consideration and decision is maintained. These matters include
• statutory matters such as the approval of final and interim
financial statements and the recommendation of dividends
• appointments to, and removals from, the Board and the terms 
of reference and membership of Board committees
• approval of Group strategy and annual budgets
• approval of authority levels, financial and treasury policies
• authorisation for any acquisition or disposal

All Directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is
responsible to the Board for ensuring that agreed procedures 
and applicable rules and regulations are observed. The Board
approves the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary. 
Any Director may, in furtherance of his duties, take 
independent professional advice when necessary, at the 
expense of the Company. 
The Board is provided with regular and timely information on 
the financial performance of businesses within the Group, and 
of the Group as a whole, together with reports on trading
matters, markets, sustainability and other relevant issues.

The principal Board Committees are the Remuneration Committee,
the Audit Committee and the Nominations Committee. The
Company Secretary acts as secretary to each of these committees.

Other Board matters
Policy on external appointments
Recognising that external appointments can broaden their
knowledge and so be of benefit to the Company, Executive
Directors are permitted, at the discretion of the Board, to 
accept a limited number of such appointments and retain the 
fees received for such appointments. John McDonough is a 
Non-Executive Director of Tomkins plc and Richard Adam is 
a Non-Executive Director of SSL International plc. 45 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Nomination and remuneration of Directors
The appointment of a Director is a matter for resolution by 
the Board as a whole, taking advice from the Nominations
Committee.
For the Board appointment made in 2007, the Nominations
Committee used the services of the executive recruitment
consultant JCA. Details of potential candidates were provided 
by JCA and initially reviewed by a sub-committee of the
Nominations Committee. Meetings with selected candidates 
were then held with Directors. Subsequently, the Nominations
Committee met to recommend an appointment, which was 
then approved by the Board.
In the case of Non-Executive Directors, initial appointments are
normally for three years; re-appointment is subject to review and 
is not automatic. 
The fees of Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board 
as a whole, taking into account the commitment required and
participation in the work of committees and other advisory 
services in relation to the business of the Group. In advising the
Board on such fees, it is the policy of the Executive Directors to 
seek independent external advice concerning the appropriateness 
of the amounts by comparison with general practice. The level of 
fees currently payable to the Non-Executive Directors is based on
independent external advice.
The remuneration of the Directors is dealt with in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 55.
Retirement of Directors by rotation
All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election 
at least every three years. The Directors retiring and seeking 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
7 May 2008 are Philip Rogerson and David Garman.
Additionally, new Directors are subject to election by shareholders
at the first opportunity following their appointment. Accordingly,
David Hurcomb will seek election at the 2008 Annual General
Meeting.
The service contracts of the Executive Directors and the terms 
and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are
available for inspection at the registered office of the Company
during normal business hours on any weekday (bank holidays
excepted) and at the Annual General Meeting.
Induction and development of Directors
Directors are provided with a comprehensive information pack 
on joining the Company and are advised of their legal and other
duties and obligations as a director of a listed company. In
addition, all new Directors receive induction on their appointment
covering such matters as the operation and activities of the 
Group, the role of the Board and the Company’s corporate
governance procedures. Directors are also briefed by the
Company’s external advisors, where appropriate, on changes 
to legislation or regulation or market practice as well as 
receiving briefings from business groups throughout the year.
At least once a year, the Board visits an operational site and in
November 2007 the Directors visited the Group’s operations in
Dubai. Directors also visit other operations and staff. 
The regular updating of Directors’ skills and knowledge is
encouraged and a procedure has been established whereby the
Company Secretary is notified by Directors of their requirements 
in this respect.
Relations with shareholders
In addition to communicating with shareholders generally from
time to time, the Executive Directors and the Director of Group
Corporate Affairs meet regularly with representatives of major
shareholders in order to foster the mutual understanding of
objectives. The details of these meetings are reported to the 
Board. The Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive
Director are available for meetings with representatives of major
shareholders as required.
Private and institutional shareholders are encouraged to attend 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
The Company complies fully with the provisions of the Combined
Code in respect of the notice, content of agenda and conduct of
its Annual General Meetings. The Chairmen of the Remuneration
and Audit Committees will be present at the Annual General
Meeting on 7 May 2008 to respond to shareholders’ questions.

The Audit Committee has in attendance at meetings, by invitation
of the Committee, Executive Directors, representatives of the
external auditors (KPMG Audit Plc), the Group Head of Risk 
and the Head of Internal Audit. It is also able to invite others 
as it requires from time to time. The Committee also meets
privately with both the external and internal auditors.
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include
• the review of the annual and interim financial statements
• consideration of the impact of changes to accounting
regulations and the financial and accounting policies of the
Carillion Group 
• compliance with statutory and other external requirements
• reviewing the role of the internal audit function and the 
results of its audit work and the response of management 
• reviewing the scope and results of the external audit and 
its cost-effectiveness
• ensuring that the internal and external audit functions are
complementary
• monitoring the independence and objectivity of the external
auditors and ensuring that the services provided (including 
non-audit services) provide a proper balance between
objectivity and value for money
• recommending to the Board the external auditors to be
proposed to shareholders for appointment.
The Committee is authorised by the Board to (i) seek any
information necessary to fulfil its duties, (ii) call any member of 
staff to be questioned at a meeting of the Committee as and
when required and (iii) obtain external professional advice, at 
the Company’s expense, which might be necessary for the

In 2007, the Committee met on four occasions and dealt with the
following matters
• internal audit reports including control of risk 
• annual and interim financial statements 
• KPMG audit review 
• top ten risks 
• reappointment of KPMG 
• 2007 audit plan 
• internal audit review 
• assessment of the going concern basis 
• review of compliance with the Combined Code 
• the external audit fee.
The members of the Committee receive fees as Non-Executive
Directors which also reflect their membership of the Audit
Committee and other Board committees. See page 49 for details.
Main activities of the Audit Committee in the 
year to 31 December 2007
Financial statements
The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management
and the external auditors the annual and interim statements. 
In this context, the Committee also reviews the written reports 
of KPMG on issues arising from the annual audit and the review 
of the interim results.
Internal controls
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of
internal control. This responsibility includes clearly determining the
control environment and reviewing annually the effectiveness of
the internal control system. However, such a system can provide
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance for Directors ‘Internal
Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’, the 
Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the significant risks (both financial and
non-financial and including Corporate Social Responsibility risks)
faced by the Group (including Joint Ventures and overseas
businesses). The process has been in place for the year under
review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts and is regularly reviewed by the Board. 
Assurance over the design and operation of internal controls
across the Group is provided through a combination of techniques
• Internal Audit carries out audits to assess the adequacy and
effectiveness of internal controls over the key risks faced by 
the business and reports its findings to management, the
Executive Directors and the Audit Committee. The Audit Plan 
is presented to and approved by the Audit Committee annually
• recommendations to improve the system of control are made
by Internal Audit. The implementation of these
recommendations is followed up and reported on quarterly
• Internal Audit independently reviews the risk identification
procedures and control processes implemented by
management 
• a process of Control Risk Self-Assessment is used in the 
Group where Directors and senior managers are required to
detail and certify controls in operation to ensure the control
environment in their business areas is appropriate. They also
confirm annually, in writing, that risk management processes
and appropriate controls are in place and are operating
effectively
• Internal Audit advises on aspects of the design and application
of internal controls in key business projects and on policy and
procedure changes.
Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Audit Committee reviews the assurance procedures and
ensures that the level of confidence required by the Board is
obtained. It also ensures the financial reporting process is 
credible and reliable. The Audit Committee presents its findings 
to the Board regularly and the Head of Internal Audit has direct
access to the Audit Committee members. 
Any significant internal control issues would be disclosed in 
this report.
Risk management
The Group Head of Risk is responsible for advising on strategic 
risk issues across the Group, and for oversight of risk training. 
The Group Head of Risk is also responsible for carrying out an
independent appraisal of all projects before submission to the
Major Projects Committee (see below). This appraisal ensures 
that the differentiating factors of the Group’s offer have been
properly identified so maximising the opportunities available; 
it also involves ensuring that all inherent and residual risks
associated with the project have been properly identified 
and considered. 47 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
In addition, the Risk Forum, a committee of risk professionals from
each of the business groups, meets on a quarterly basis to assess
the strategic risks facing the Carillion Group. The conclusions of
the Risk Forum are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Major Projects Committee, a committee of the Board, acts 
as the sanctioning body for major commitments and transactions
including capital expenditure, major contracts and company and
business acquisitions and disposals. This committee has delegated
authority up to specified levels of risk as determined by a risk
assessment matrix, beyond which Board approval is required.
Practical guidance for all staff is maintained in Group policy and
procedure documents regarding the authorisation levels for
commitments, contract selectivity and bidding, the provision of
guarantees and management accounting as well as reporting 
and resolution of suspected fraudulent activities. The Board has 
a policy to prosecute individuals found to have defrauded the
Company or its subsidiaries. Learning points for management 
are identified and action plans implemented to minimise the
recurrence of fraud. 
Employees are encouraged to raise genuine concerns about
malpractice at the earliest possible stage and a confidential
‘whistleblowing’ hotline provided by an independent third party 
is available.
Management is responsible for the identification and evaluation 
of significant risks applicable to its areas of business together 
with the design, operation and monitoring of suitable internal
controls. These risks are assessed on a continual basis and may 
be associated with a variety of internal or external sources,
including control breakdowns, disruption in information systems,
competition, corporate social responsibility, natural catastrophe
and regulatory requirements. Management is also responsible 
for timely and accurate reporting of business performance and 
for ensuring compliance with the policies set by the Board in its
areas of business. Regular performance review meetings are 
held where management reports to the Executive Directors 
on business performance, risk and internal control matters. 
The results of these meetings are presented to the Board.
The Executive Directors report to the Board on material changes in
the business and the external environment that affect significant
risks. The Group Finance Director provides the Board with regular
financial information, which includes key performance indicators
and a summary of risk. These key performance indicators and risks
are listed in the Group Chief Executive’s Review on pages 16 to
19. Where areas for improvement are identified, the Board
considers the recommendations made both by the Executive
Directors and by the Audit Committee.
This report is reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.
Audit independence
The Audit Committee and Board place great emphasis on the
objectivity of the Group’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, in their
reporting to shareholders.
The KPMG audit director and manager are present at Audit
Committee meetings to ensure full communication of matters
relating to the audit.
The overall performance of the auditor is reviewed annually 
by the Audit Committee, taking into account the views of
management, and feedback is provided to senior members of
KPMG unrelated to the audit. This activity also forms part of
KPMG’s own system of quality control. The Audit Committee 
also has discussions with the auditor, without management being
present, on the adequacy of controls and on any judgmental
areas. These discussions have proved satisfactory to date.
The scope of the forthcoming year’s audit is discussed in advance
by the Audit Committee. Audit fees are reviewed by the Audit
Committee after discussions between the businesses and the 
local KPMG offices and are then referred to the Board for
approval. Rotation of audit director’s responsibilities within 
KPMG is required by their profession’s ethical standards. The
current audit director responsible for the Carillion engagement is
in his third year of signing the report.There is also rotation of key
members within the audit team. 
Assignments awarded to KPMG and its associates have been 
and are subject to controls by management that have been 
agreed by the Audit Committee so that audit independence is 
not compromised. In summary, the procedures are
• audit related services: as auditor this is the main area of work
of KPMG and its associates. If any additional accounting
support is required then this is considered competitively
• tax consulting: in cases where they are best suited, Carillion
uses KPMG and its associates but the Group also uses other 
tax consultancies. Significant pieces of tax work are evaluated
competitively
• general and systems consulting: all significant consulting
projects are subject to competitive tender.
Other than audit, the Group Finance Director is required to give
prior approval of work carried out by KPMG and its associates 
in excess of a predetermined threshold; part of this review is to
determine that other potential providers of the services have 
been adequately considered.
These controls provide the Audit Committee with adequate
confidence in the independence of KPMG in their reporting on 
the audit of the Group.
Health and safety
A review of the Group’s progress on health and safety is provided
in the Group Chief Executive’s report on page 18 and the Group’s
Sustainability performance is contained in the Sustainability review
on pages 33 to 35.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Governance
Remuneration Report
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act (Schedule 7a) and Section 1 of the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance (June 2006). 
The Board is responsible for determining policy for remuneration
of the Directors of Carillion plc and key members of the senior
management team. The Remuneration Committee consists
exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors, namely 
David Garman (Chairman), David Maloney, Steve Mogford and
Vanda Murray and is responsible for formulating policy and
recommending to the Board the remuneration of the Executive
Directors. The Board determines the fees of the Non-Executive
Directors based on independent external advice.
The Remuneration Committee is assisted in remuneration decisions
by Susan Morton, Group HR Director and by John McDonough,
Group Chief Executive. The Group Chief Executive is consulted on
the remuneration of his direct reports and other senior executives.
No Executive Director or employee is present when his or her
remuneration is being discussed.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee uses Deloitte & Touche
LLP to provide salary survey and benchmarking information.
Deloitte & Touche LLP , which was appointed in 2005, also advises
the Company on pensions investment but otherwise has no other
connections with the Company.
Remuneration policy 
It is the policy of the Company to ensure that remuneration and
other benefits attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors and
senior managers of the required calibre to achieve the Board’s
objectives, including that of achieving growth in shareholder 
value. Remuneration and other benefits are determined with
regard to competitive market practice and, where considered
appropriate, are supported by external independent surveys. 
The main elements of remuneration of the Executive Directors are
basic salary and pension benefits, together with an annual bonus
linked to the Group’s financial performance and share based
incentives linked to both financial and share price performance 
to ensure that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned 
to those of shareholders. It is anticipated that the Company will
continue this approach to the structure of remuneration for the
foreseeable future. 
The Group’s remuneration policy is also based upon Carillion’s
strategic objectives, which specifically include achieving high
standards in respect of sustainability, which encompasses Carillion’s
health and safety, environmental and social performance.
Service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are terminable 
by one year’s notice from the Company. On termination of their
employment, Executive Directors of the Company have no
additional entitlement to compensation for loss of their office 
as Directors. The service contracts contain provision for early
termination. In determining compensation for early termination of
a service contract, the Remuneration Committee will consider the
specific circumstances together with the Company’s commitments
under the individual’s contract (including future bonuses).

John McDonough 1 January 2001 12 months rolling
Richard Adam 2 April 2007 12 months rolling
Roger Robinson 29 July 1999 12 months rolling
Don Kenny 1 July 2006 12 months rolling
David Hurcomb 1 January 2008 12 months rolling
Non-Executive Directors are not employed under contracts of
service, but are generally appointed for fixed terms of three years
renewable for further terms of one to three years if both parties
agree. David Maloney, Steve Mogford and Vanda Murray are in 
their initial three year terms.
Basic salary and other benefits
The basic salaries and other benefits of the Executive Directors 
are set by the Remuneration Committee and are determined 
taking into account individual performance and information
provided by independent sources on the rate of salary for similar
posts in comparable companies. The aim is to reward Directors 
fairly and competitively.
Other benefits typically include a company car, private healthcare
and salary supplements in place of approved pension provision for
salary over the internal earnings cap.
Annual performance bonus and deferred bonus plan
Annual bonuses are reviewed each year by the Remuneration
Committee, which sets performance targets geared to key financial
indicators and individual performance objectives. In 2007, the
Executive Directors had the potential to earn annual bonuses 
up to a maximum of 100 per cent of their basic salary for
outstanding performance. The bonus arrangement for 2007 set 
a financial performance target based on earnings per share and
individual, detailed and confidential personal performance objectives
that support the strategic objectives of the Company. The maximum
bonus opportunity of 100 per cent comprises an annual cash
payment limited to 30 per cent of salary with a deferred bonus 
of shares of the Company with a value of up to 70 per cent of
salary vesting after two years. The number of shares allocated 
is determined by the price prevailing at the date the bonus is
confirmed and the amount by which the bonus earned exceeds 
30 per cent of basic salary at the end of the bonus year in question.
The shares are released on the condition that the recipient makes
funds available to the Company at the point of transfer to allow 
the Company to meet its tax and National Insurance obligations on
the value of the shares transferred. The potential bonus available 
in 2008 will be 100 per cent of basic salary comprised of a cash
payment of up to 30 per cent of basic salary with a deferred bonus
of shares with Company up to the value of 70 per cent of salary
vesting after two years. Richard Adam will participate in these 
bonus arrangements during 2007 and, for 2007 only, will be
guaranteed to receive a minimum bonus payment of 33 per cent 
of his annual salary. 49 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
In relation to the 2006 bonus arrangement, the Executive
Directors, on 7 April 2007 received a deferred bonus of shares 
as follows:
Number of shares
John McDonough 75,911
Roger Robinson 47,857
Don Kenny 15,794
These shares will be held in Trust for two years for John
McDonough and Roger Robinson and then transferred in April
2009 following payment of the tax and National Insurance
obligations. Don Kenny’s shares will be held in Trust for one 
year and will be transferred to him in April 2008. 
Pension benefits 
With the exception of Richard Adam and David Hurcomb, the
Group makes contributions to a Registered defined benefit scheme
on behalf of the Executive Directors in respect of earnings up to
the internal earnings cap. In addition, a salary supplement is paid
in respect of earnings over the internal cap equal to the payments
the Group would have paid to the Registered defined benefit
scheme had the cap not been in operation. Salary supplements 
are taxed at source. For Richard Adam and David Hurcomb, 
the Company makes contributions to a Registered defined
contribution pension plan (up to the internal earnings cap) 
and a salary supplement in respect of earnings in excess of 
the internal cap. During the year, the Company contributed
£35,220 to the Carillion Pension Plan for Richard Adam.

Executive pensions
Until April 2003, it was the Company’s policy to offer membership
of the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme to Executive Directors and
other senior employees. This scheme was operational from 
1 October 1999. The scheme is a funded, HMRC Registered,
defined benefit scheme to which members contribute 7% of
pensionable earnings. The main features are
• pension payable at the normal retirement age of 60 
(save in cases of ill health or early retirement)
• pension accrual rate for Executive Directors of 1/30th of 
final pensionable salary for each year of service subject to 
a limit on pension of two thirds of final pensionable salary 
• increases to pensions in payment (in excess of the State
Guaranteed Minimum Pension) in line with price indexation 
up to five per cent per annum for service to 5 April 2006 
and 2.5% per annum for service after that date
• life assurance of four times salary 
• pensions payable in the event of ill health, and
• on death (in service or after retirement), spouse’s and/or
dependent’s pension at two thirds of member’s 
prospective pension.
The Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme was closed to new entrants 
with effect from 1 April 2003. Pension provision for senior
managers and Executives is now through their existing Carillion
scheme (for current employees) or the Carillion Pension Plan 
(for new employees and existing employees who opted for
membership). The Carillion Pension Plan is a defined contribution
pension arrangement that provides members with pensions at
retirement based on the accumulated value of their notional
pension account within the plan.
The current Executive Directors are subject to an internal earnings
cap and their pensionable salary is limited accordingly. They are
provided with additional benefits by way of a salary supplement
equal to the contribution the Group would have made to the
Registered scheme had the earnings cap not been in operation. 
In all cases, any contributions made to these arrangements in
respect of the year are disclosed separately above. As these
additional arrangements are limited to the balance of basic salary
in excess of the earnings cap, bonus paid to Executive Directors
does not count towards pension benefits. The Company does 
not contribute to any pension arrangements for Non-Executive
Directors. The Company agreed with the Trustees of the Carillion
pension schemes to continue to operate an earnings cap after
April 2006 when the external cap was removed. The Carillion cap
commenced at the level of £110,000 for the tax year 2006/07 
and will rise in line with the published increases in HMRC’s Life
Time Allowance up until 2010 in line with the table below.

pensioned through the Carillion B Pension Scheme or, in 
the case of Richard Adam and David Hurcomb, the Carillion 
Pension Plan.

Share incentive schemes
Following a review of share incentives, a new long term incentive
plan for senior executives, the Carillion plc 2006 Long Term
Incentive Plan was approved at the Annual General Meeting in
2006. Following the introduction of the Carillion plc 2006 Long
Term Incentive Plan, no further share awards have been made
under the existing Long Term Incentive Plan and Executive Share
Option Scheme.
The objective of the Carillion plc 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan
(known internally as the Leadership Equity Award Plan (LEAP)) is 
to motivate employees and to encourage them to invest in the
future success of the Group. It has a challenging performance
criterion which applies similarly to all participants. 
A Sharesave Scheme also operates to give UK employees the
opportunity to have a financial stake in the Company.
Carillion plc Long Term Incentive Plan 2006 (LEAP)
The Leadership Equity Award Plan (LEAP) provides key persons in
the Company with the opportunity to earn a potentially higher
level of reward but only where there is commitment by those
individuals and stretching performance targets are met. 
Executive Directors may receive an award under the LEAP in any
financial year over shares worth 150% of their basic annual salary
(excluding bonuses, commissions and benefits in kind), other
senior executives may receive an award under the Plan in any
financial year over shares worth up to 100% of their basic annual
salary. The extra 50% awarded to Executive Directors will only 
vest if exceptional performance is achieved.
The rules allow for higher awards, but only if exceptional
circumstances exist which justify a first award of up to 200% of
salary will such an award be made. Richard Adam participated at
this level in the 2007 scheme. For subsequent years, the maximum
opportunity will be 150% of basic salary.
Under the terms of the Plan, awards of ordinary shares in the
Company or grants of options over ordinary shares (with a zero 
or 0.01 pence per share exercise price) can be made.
No payment will be required for the grant of an award. The
Committee will determine the exercise price of an option which
shall be zero or 0.01 pence per share, provided that where new
issue shares are involved, the exercise price is not less than the
nominal value of a share. 
The participants will not be entitled to receive the shares for a
period determined by the Committee which is generally no earlier
than three years from the date of award. 
The vesting of awards at the end of the performance period will
be subject to the relevant participant remaining in employment
and the achievement of specified stretching performance
conditions. Each Executive Director will be required to hold any
shares acquired through this Plan until the value of their total
shareholding is at least equal to the value of their annual salary
(with the exception of shares sold to meet the tax liability on the
shares acquired through the Plan).
The awards are subject to achievement of a performance target
based on annual average growth in earnings per share above the
Retail Price Index. The progression is linear between each of the
target levels specified.
Growth in earnings per share:
Growth in earnings per share:
Level 1 RPI + 3% pa 30% vests
Level 2 RPI + 7% pa 50% vests 
Level 3 RPI + 12% pa 100% vests 
Level 4 RPI + 25% pa Extra 50% vests
Levels 1 to 3 apply to all participants, level 4 applies to the
Executive Directors.
Awards were made in July 2006 and April 2007. At 31 December
2007 a total of 1,862,063 shares were outstanding under the LEAP .
Executive Share Option Scheme 
Share options have been granted to the Executive Directors 
and certain senior managers under the Executive Share Option
Scheme. The options were granted at an exercise price equal to
the market value of the Company’s shares on the three business
days immediately preceding the date of grant.
Options under the Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share
Option Scheme 1999 (which carries certain tax advantages for 
UK employees) and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 
are exercisable normally between three and 10 years after the 
date of grant, subject to the achievement of the performance
condition. For options granted in 2001 and 2002, the
performance condition required that the earnings per share 
of Carillion over a rolling three-year period must increase by a
percentage that is not less than the increase in the UK Retail 
Price Index over the same period, expressed as a percentage, plus
four percentage points per annum. This performance condition
was selected in order to provide an incentive which aligns the
interests of executives with those of shareholders in growing the
Company’s earnings per share. However, as this performance
condition no longer complied with best practice, at the 2003
Annual General Meeting, shareholders resolved that future 
options granted under both schemes become exercisable in
accordance with the following table:
Average compound annual earnings 
per share growth (before exceptional items) 
in excess of RPI over the three year period Percentage of option
following grant that becomes exercisable
Less than 4% 0%
4% 30%
Above 4% and below 10% 30% to 100% 
(straight-line basis)
10% or more 100%
To the extent that this performance condition is not met in full 
at the end of the three-year period following grant, there is 
the opportunity for no more than one re-test of performance
(from a fixed base) at the end of the following year. 
Section 04 – Governance 52 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Governance
Remuneration Report
continued
Grants of options using this new performance condition were
made in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
The aggregate value of options granted to an employee under 
the Executive Share Option Schemes cannot normally exceed 
their basic salary in any year without the prior approval of the
Remuneration Committee.
With regard to the options granted on 1 July 2003, Carillion met
the performance target such that 80% of the shares under option
are now exercisable. Similarly, the performance target relating to
the options granted on 31 March 2004 was met such that 71% 
of the options are exercisable.
At 31 December 2007, Executive Share Options were outstanding
over 2,073,978 shares (2006: 2,705,579 shares) under both
schemes at exercise prices ranging from 125.2 pence to 
242.75 pence.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan were
made to the Executive Directors and key members of senior
management, in recognition of the contribution that these
individuals can make to the Group’s success.
There is no subscription price for the shares, the award of which 
is conditional on the Company’s performance during a three-year
period in delivering Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against a
comparator group of companies in the Construction and Building
Materials and Support Services sectors or, in respect of the awards
made in 2005, the FTSE 250 index.
The companies comprising the comparator group for Long Term
Incentive Plan awards made in January 2002 were Amec plc, WS
Atkins plc, Balfour Beatty plc, Interserve plc, Jarvis plc, Kier Group
plc, Alfred McAlpine plc, Mowlem plc and Taylor Woodrow plc.
(Amey plc was in the comparator group but was removed as it
delisted from the London Stock Exchange in June 2003).
Carillion subsequently came second in this comparator group at
the end of the three-year performance period for these 2002
awards with the result that 85% of the awards vested and a total
of 172,913 shares transferred to two participants in March 2005.
Following review in 2003, the Remuneration Committee
considered that with a comparator group of 10 companies, the
removal of one company (through take-over or otherwise) would
have a proportionately greater impact on the extent of the vesting
of awards than if the comparator group was larger. Consequently,
shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting approved that
future awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan would
be subject to Carillion’s TSR performance against an expanded
group of companies as follows: 
Carillion ranking at Percentage of
end of three years award that will vest
First place 100%
Between the median and first place Straight line vesting 
between 30% at the 
median and 100% 
for first place
Median 30%
Below the median No award
The comparator group for awards made in accordance with 
this 2003 shareholder approval were Amec plc, WS Atkins plc,
Balfour Beatty plc, Interserve plc, Jarvis plc, Kier Group plc, Alfred
McAlpine plc, Mowlem plc Morgan Sindall plc, John Laing plc and
Serco Group plc. (Again, Amey plc was in this comparator group
until it was delisted, as were Mowlem plc and John Laing plc until
they were taken over.)
Awards with this performance condition were made on 
1 July 2003 and 31 March 2004. 
With regard to the awards made on 1 July 2003, Carillion came
fourth in the comparator group at the end of the three-year
performance period with the result that 61.8% of the awards
vested. A total of 324,727 shares vested to nine participants 
on 12 September 2006. The Carillion plc share price on 
12 September 2006 was 326.5p.
Similarly, the awards made on 31 March 2004 came third in the
comparator group with 72% of the awards vesting. A total of
499,283 shares vested to 11 participants on 2 April 2007. The
Carillion plc share price on 2 April 2007 was 402p.
Awards equivalent to 100% of annual salary were also made 
to Executive Directors on 15 March 2005: the Remuneration
Committee resolved that these 2005 awards will have a
performance condition based on Carillion’s TSR performance
against the FTSE 250. 
The performance conditions were chosen in order to align 
the interests of Directors and senior managers with those of
shareholders in growing total shareholder return against
comparator companies and sectors.
At 31 December 2007, Long Term Incentive Plan 
awards were outstanding over a total of 993,975 shares 
(2006: 1,696,417 shares).
Conditional awards made to Executive Directors under the Long
Term Incentive Plan are set out in the table of share incentives 
on page 53. The awards represent the maximum number of 
shares that could be awarded to Executive Directors under the
performance periods commencing on 1 January 2004 and 
1 January 2005. The monetary value of the conditional 
awards attributed to each Director was based on their annual 
basic salary at the date of award and the number of shares was
calculated using the share prices of 143 pence and 225 pence, 
the average share prices over the six weeks immediately before 
the commencement of the respective performance periods. 53 Carillion plc

The market price of Carillion shares on 2 April 2007 was 402.3p. The net asset value received by these Directors was therefore,
respectively, £410,173, £263,321 and £177,233.
The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the above table.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Performance Graph
The following graph shows the TSR of Carillion plc compared with
the TSR of the FTSE 350 Index for the period from 1 January 2003
to 31 December 2007. 
The FTSE 350 was chosen as the comparator group in order to
illustrate the Company’s TSR performance against a broad equity
market index of the UK’s leading companies.
The Sharesave Scheme
The Company operates a Sharesave Scheme which provides a
savings and investment opportunity for employees in the UK. 
The options may normally be exercised on completion of a three
or five-year savings contract, at a price equivalent to not less 
than 80% of the market value of the shares at the time of grant.
Options were granted in November 1999 over 6,140,194 shares,
in October 2002 over 3,995,803 shares and in November 2006
over 2,580,461 shares. 
The five-year options granted in November 1999 became
exercisable for a six month period commencing 1 January 2005 
at an option price 109.1p. A total of 983,369 shares were issued
following maturity.
The three-year options granted in October 2002 became
exercisable for a six month period commencing 1 January 2006 
at an option price of 126.6p. A total of 1,829,888 shares were 
issued following maturity.
At 31 December 2007, options over 2,167,635 ordinary shares 
of 50p each were outstanding under the Sharesave Scheme 
(2006: 2,580,181 ordinary shares of 50p each).
The Carillion share option and share incentive schemes comply
with the share dilution guidelines.

The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the above table.
* The option over 254,532 shares at an option price of 210.7p granted to John McDonough in March 2002 under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 was made later in the year than had been
specified at the time of his appointment which resulted in an increased option price of 67.3p. Therefore, in order to ensure that he will be in no worse nor better a position as a result of the delay in the
grant, a maximum cash adjustment of 67.3p per share (less tax) will be made when and if the option is exercised.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect 
of the Annual Report and Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements, in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and
applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company
financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards
and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Standards).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides 
in relation to such financial statements that references in the
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true 
and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The Parent Company financial statements are required by law 
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Parent
Company. In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company
financial statements, the Directors are required to
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Parent Company financial statements
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement 
that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 57 Carillion plc

Independent auditors’ report to
the members of Carillion plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial
statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Carillion plc for the year
ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the Consolidated
Income Statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance
Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and the related
notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the Remuneration Report that is described as
having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we may state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the EU, and for preparing the Parent Company
financial statements and the Remuneration Report in accordance
with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities on page 56.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the 
part of the Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be 
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report 
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.The
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific
information presented in the Operating and Financial Review 
that is cross referred from the Principal Activities and Business
Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for audit, or information
specified by law regarding Director’s remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We
are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures
or its risk and control procedures, 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the International
Standards for Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report 
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in preparation 
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity 
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial
statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to 
be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of
the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its profit
for the year then ended
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation 
• the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2007
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of
the Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the financial statements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
64 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
1. Significant accounting policies
Carillion plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the United
Kingdom (UK). The consolidated financial statements of the
Company for the year ended 31 December 2007 comprise the
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’)
and the Group’s interest in jointly controlled entities.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance
on 5 March 2008.
Statement of compliance
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared and
approved by the Directors in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted
IFRSs’). The Company has elected to prepare its parent company
financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP). These are presented on pages 108
to 114.
Basis of preparation
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently 
in dealing with items which are considered material in relation 
to the Group’s financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. They 
are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following
assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative
financial instruments, pension scheme assets and financial
instruments classified as available-for-sale.
The company has adopted IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosure’
and the amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’
which are mandatory for years ending 31 December 2007. This has
resulted in additional disclosures but no impact on reported profit
or net assets.
The following standards and interpretations have been endorsed
by the EU by the year end but are not yet effective for the year
ending 31 December 2007
• International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 11
‘Group and treasury share transactions’
• International Financial Reporting Standard 8 
‘Operating Segments’.
The Group has considered the impact of these new standards 
and interpretations in future periods and no significant impact is
expected on reported profit or net assets. The Group has chosen
not to early adopt any of the above standards and interpretations.
Presentational changes have been made to the income statement,
cash flow statement and segmental reporting note compared 
with the presentation in the Annual Report and Accounts for the
year ended 31 December 2006 in order to facilitate a greater
understanding and improve the transparency of the Group’s
reported results.
Basis of Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial
statements of the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the
Company drawn up to 31 December 2007. Control exists when
the Group has direct or indirect power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic benefits
from its activities. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date that control transfers to the
Group until the date that control ceases. The financial statements
of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements are prepared for the same reporting year as the 
Parent Company.
The purchase method is used to account for the acquisition 
of subsidiaries.
(b) Joint Ventures
A Joint Venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group
undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control
with third parties. The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities 
are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method the
Group’s share of the profits less losses of jointly controlled entities
is included in the consolidated income statement and its interest 
in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated
balance sheet. Where the share of losses exceeds the interest in
the entity the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of
further losses is discontinued. Interest in the entity is the carrying
amount of the investment together with any long-term interests
that, in substance, form part of the net investment in the entity.
Financial statements of jointly controlled entities are prepared for
the same reporting period as the Group except for
• Carillion Enterprise Ltd
• Modern Housing Solutions (Prime) Ltd.
Both of these entities now have 31 March year ends.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled operation,
that company accounts for the assets it controls, the liabilities and
expenses it incurs and its share of the income. Such arrangements
are reported in the consolidated financial statements on the 
same basis.
Other non-current asset investments
Other non-current asset investments are classified as available-
for-sale financial assets and are recognised at fair value. Changes
in fair value in the year are recognised directly in the statement 
of recognised income and expense. Dividend income from
investments is recognised when the right to receive payment 
is established.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions that have occurred since 
1 January 2004 represents the difference between the fair value 
of the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an acquired entity.  65 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Consideration includes the attributable costs of the acquisition. 
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 goodwill is
included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents 
the amount recorded under previous Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles.
Positive goodwill is recognised as an asset in the consolidated 
balance sheet and is subject to an annual impairment review.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised
separately as an intangible asset in the consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of jointly controlled entities 
is included within the carrying value of the investment. Negative
goodwill is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is based on 
the useful economic lives of the assets concerned, which are
principally as follows.
Computer software and licences
• Straight line over three to five years. 
Customer contracts and lists
• Planned Maintenance Group
Consumption of economic benefits over six years
• Mowlem plc
Consumption of economic benefits over 35 years.
Impairment
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to
amortisation and are tested for impairment at each balance sheet
date. Assets subject to depreciation and amortisation are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised in the income statement based on the amount by
which the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the asset.
Construction contracts
When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated
reliably, contract revenue and costs are recognised by reference 
to the degree of completion of each contract, as measured by 
the proportion of total costs at the balance sheet date to the
estimated total cost of the contract.
Insurance claims, incentive payments and variations arising from
construction contracts are included where they have been agreed
with the client.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be
estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent 
of contract costs incurred where it is probable those costs will 
be recoverable.
The principal estimation technique used by the Group in
attributing profit on contracts to a particular period is the
preparation of forecasts on a contract by contract basis. 
These focus on revenues and costs to complete and enable an
assessment to be made of the final out-turn of each contract.
Consistent contract review procedures are in place in respect of
contract forecasting.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total
contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which
they are incurred.
Where costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses
exceed progress billings, the balance is shown as due from
customers on construction contracts within trade and other
receivables. Where progress billings exceed costs incurred plus
recognised profits less recognised losses, the balance is shown 
as due to customers on construction contracts within trade and
other payables.
Pre-contract costs
Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until the Group is
appointed preferred bidder. Provided the contract is expected 
to generate sufficient net cash inflows to enable recovery and 
the award of the contract is probable, pre-contract costs incurred
post the appointment as preferred bidder are included in amounts
owed by customers on construction contracts. Where pre-contract
bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, the proceeds are initially
applied against the asset included in amounts owed by customers
on construction contracts. Any excess recoveries are carried
forward as deferred income and released to profit over the 
period of the contract.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable,
excluding Value Added Tax, for services supplied to external
customers. It also includes the Group’s proportion of work 
carried out under jointly controlled operations during the year.
Revenue from service contracts is recognised by reference to
services performed to date as a percentage of total services 
to be performed. Revenue from construction contracts is
recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy 
on construction contracts.
Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is based on historical cost, less the estimated residual
values, and the estimated economic lives of the assets concerned.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment 
is depreciated in equal annual instalments over the period of their
estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows:
Freehold buildings 40-50 years
Leasehold buildings and improvements Period of lease
Plant, machinery and vehicles 3-10 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter
of the term of the lease or the expected useful life of the asset.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Leasing
Operating lease rental charges are charged to the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease. 
Assets held under finance leases are included in property, plant
and equipment at the lower of fair value at the date of acquisition
or present value of the minimum lease payments. The capital
element of outstanding finance leases is included in financial
liabilities. The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the
income statement at a constant periodic rate of charge on the
outstanding obligations.
Inventories
Inventories comprise raw materials and land for development and
are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is
calculated using the weighted average method.
Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case 
it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for 
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect
of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method,
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or
settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax
benefit will be realised.
Foreign currencies
In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into sterling and recorded using the
exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance
sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included 
in the income statement.
On consolidation, the balance sheets of overseas entities are
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. Income statements and cash flows of overseas
entities are translated into sterling at rates approximating to the
foreign exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Gains or
losses arising from the consolidation of overseas entities are
recognised in the translation reserve.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved
through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign
currencies. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion
of the hedges are recognised in equity and ineffective portions
are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Employee benefits
(a) Retirement benefit obligations
For defined contribution pension schemes operated by the 
Group, amounts payable are charged to the income statement 
as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the International Accounting
Standard (IAS) 19 cost of providing benefits is calculated annually
by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
The charge to the income statement reflects the current service
cost of such obligations and, where applicable, past service cost.
The expected return on plan assets and the interest cost of scheme
liabilities are included within financial income and expenses in the
income statement.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet
represents the excess of the present value of the scheme liabilities
over the fair value of scheme assets. When the calculation results
in an asset to the Group, the amount recognised is limited to the
net total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present
value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future
contributions to the plan. Differences between the actual and
expected returns on assets and experience gains and losses 
arising on scheme liabilities during the year, together with
differences arising from changes in assumptions, are recognised 
in the statement of recognised income and expense in the year. 
The Group’s contributions to the scheme are paid in accordance
with the scheme rules and the recommendations of the actuary.
(b) Other post-retirement benefit obligations 
Certain Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare
benefits to their employees. The expected costs of providing 
these benefits are accrued over the period of employment and 
are calculated by independent actuaries based on the present
value of the expected liability.
(c) Share-based payments
Members of the Group’s senior management team are entitled to
participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), the Long
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Leadership Equity Award Plan
(LEAP). In addition, UK employees are able to participate in the
Sharesave scheme. 67 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
The fair value of the ESOS, LEAP and Sharesave schemes at 
the date of grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing
model. The fair value of the LTIP scheme is estimated using a
bespoke model that factors in the probabilities of achieving 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance conditions. For all
schemes the fair value determined at grant date is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the period in which any performance
conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant
employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting date).
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the Group constructs
qualifying assets. All other borrowing costs are written off to 
the income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs incurred within the Group’s jointly controlled
entities relating to the construction of assets in PPP projects 
are capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into
operational use. 
Borrowing costs are charged to the income statement using the
effective interest method.
Share capital
The ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded at 
the proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental 
issue costs.
Consideration paid for shares in the Company held by the
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust are deducted from
the retained earnings reserve. Where such shares subsequently
vest in the employees under the terms of the Group’s share option
schemes or are sold, any consideration received is included in the
retained earnings reserve.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past
event, and where it is probable that an outflow will be required 
to settle the obligation.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has an
approved restructuring plan that has either commenced or been
announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The principal
financial assets and liabilities of the Group are as follows:
(a) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and then 
are stated at amortised cost.
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at
amortised cost. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, 
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand,
including bank deposits with original maturities of three months 
or less. Bank overdrafts are also included as they are an integral
part of the Group’s cash management.
(c) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and then 
are stated at amortised cost.
(d) Bank and other borrowing
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are
recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
All borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with 
the difference between initial net proceeds and redemption 
value recognised in the income statement over the period 
to redemption.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the
contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured in future
periods at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting
change in fair value is dependent on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument.
A number of the Group’s Public Private Partnership jointly
controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as 
a means of hedging interest rate risk. The effective part of the
change in fair value of these derivatives is recognised directly in
equity. Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the
income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled 
to the income statement in the periods when the hedged items
will affect profit or loss. The fair value of interest rate swaps is 
the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to
terminate the swap at the balance sheet date.
The Group also enters into forward contracts in order to hedge
against small and infrequent transactional foreign currency
exposures. In cases where these derivative instruments are
significant, hedge accounting is applied as described above. 
Where hedge accounting is not applied, movements in fair value
are recognised in the income statement. Fair values are based 
on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.

The over-provision relating to prior years in 2006 of £7.3m principally arose from agreement being reached on various projects with 
the UK and Republic of Ireland tax authorities and the release of a potential overseas tax liability in respect of the ownership of Carillion
Alawi based in Oman.

8. Discontinued operations
The Group disposed of non-core rail activities in Sweden and Denmark in July 2007 and Pall Mall Holdings Limited and Sovereign Soft
Services Limited in September 2007. The disposal of the rail businesses in Sweden and Denmark marks the Group’s exit from activities 
in the region. The disposal of Pall Mall Holdings Limited and Sovereign Soft Services Limited reflects the divestment of non-core activities
acquired with Mowlem plc in 2006. On this basis, these operations have been classified as discontinued and the income statement and
cash flow statement for 2006 have been restated accordingly.
The results of these operations in total, which were previously reported in the support services segment, were as follows.

466.4 484.4
In 2007, as in each year or whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, in accordance with
IAS 36, the Group has reviewed the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash-generating units. In the absence of any identified
impairment risks, tests were performed based on internal valuations of each cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount of goodwill attaching to cash-generating units is based on value in use calculations using discounted cash 
flows. Those calculations use cash flows based on three-year business plans and forecasts and a perpetual growth rate of five per cent  
(2006: five per cent) thereafter, discounted at the Group’s estimated weighted average cost of capital of 12.0 per cent (2006: 9.5 per cent).
As at 31 December 2007, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management concluded that the recoverable value of the cash
generating units tested exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge
The amortisation charge of £20.6m (2006: £17.8m) is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement. Amortisation 
of the intangible asset of £119.0m arising on the acquisition of Mowlem plc is in line with the expected discounted cash flows 
arising from the intangible asset and will be 79 per cent complete by 2016. The remaining amortisation charge is incurred over the
following 25 years.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items.
2007 2006
£m £m
Tax losses 65.0 63.1
The tax losses do not expire under current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses due 
to the lack of certainty concerning the quantum and timing of future years’ taxable profits of the companies concerned.
Deferred tax includes a liability associated with temporary differences arising from unremitted earnings from investments in overseas
subsidiaries, branches and jointly controlled entities of £7.0m (2006: £5.7m).

requirements following the acquisition of Mowlem plc and is expected to be utilised in the next 12 months. The restructuring provision
created in the year of £4.5m arises from a rationalisation of the operating structure at the end of 2007.
The onerous lease provision relates to a number of onerous leases acquired with Mowlem plc and has been increased by £3.2m in the
year in relation to the former Mowlem Head Office. The provision is expected to be utilised over a period of eight years.

Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign
operations that are not integral to the operations of the Group, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Group’s net
investment in foreign operations. The translation reserve also includes any related current taxation.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related 
to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, together with any related deferred taxation.
Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is
derecognised, together with any related deferred taxation.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999. The reserve increased on the acquisition of Mowlem plc 
on 23 February 2006 whereby the consideration included the issue of 66.2m Carillion shares. The Group has credited the merger 
reserve as permitted by The Companies Act 1985 and prior year information has been restated accordingly. The £18.6m transfer to 
the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on the Mowlem acquisition.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings include the reserve for the Company’s own shares which comprises of the cost of the Company’s shares held by the
Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP). The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the
Group’s share incentive schemes. The movements in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007
In addition to the ESOP , the Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘Quest’). During the year, 2,643
ordinary shares in the Company held by the QUEST were transferred to employees of the Group following the exercise of options under
the Sharesave Scheme. At 31 December 2007 the total number of shares held under the QUEST amounted to 219,763 (2006: 222,406)

Group
Carillion JM Limited (CJM) (formerly Mowlem) has been the subject of the Office of Fair Trading’s (OFT) on-going investigation of cover
pricing in the construction industry (under The Competition Act 1988). The investigation relates to CJM’s construction business and 
relates entirely to periods prior to CJM’s acquisition. No other member of the Group has been subject to the investigation. CJM has 
been co-operating fully with the OFT. Any fine ultimately arising would be subject to the statutory maximum financial penalty of 
10 per cent of world wide revenue of the undertaking concerned in the business year prior to the infringement. Group management
believes that it is extremely unlikely that any fine that is imposed will approach this amount. Carillion also does not believe that 
customers have suffered any loss or damage as a result of any actions taken by CJM. 
Guarantees and counter indemnities have been given to financial institutions in respect of the provision of performance and other 
contract-related bonds that are issued in the normal course of business.
Claims under contracts and other agreements, including joint arrangements, are outstanding in the normal course of business.
The Group, in the normal course of its construction activities, is the subject of certain legal proceedings. The resolution of these
proceedings is regarded as unlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Group’s financial position.
There are no contingent liabilities of Joint Ventures for which the Group is contingently liable.
28. Financial instruments
Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed
primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The overall aim of the Group’s financial risk management
policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Group’s treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board 
of Directors. Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. In order to protect the
Group’s balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 
£10m equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 50 per cent of the net asset value. Net investment hedging of overseas operations
is achieved through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign currencies or where this is not practicable in a currency which the
relevant currency closely follows. Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the hedges in equity and to
recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution. Such distributions are then treated 
as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
Primarily the Group has small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures. Any individual exposures that are significant are
hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
A general weakening of the Canadian Dollar (specifically a one per cent rise in the Sterling:Canadian Dollar rate) would have a nil impact
on reported profit and an increase of £0.1m in equity.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest-bearing debt is predominantly sterling borrowing that arose from the acquisition of Mowlem plc, on-going working
capital requirements and foreign currency denominated borrowing for hedging net assets of overseas operations. Such borrowing is
subject to floating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate. No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the
Group’s subsidiaries. However, a number of the Group’s Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities have entered into interest 
rate swaps. A one percentage point rise in respect of US Dollar denominated borrowings interest rates would increase the annual net
interest charge by approximately £0.1m, in respect of Canadian Dollar denominated borrowings an increase of £0.2m, and in respect 
of Sterling denominated borrowings an increase of £1.1m.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the
need to carry significant net debt over the medium-term. The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core
relationship banks in the form of a syndicated loan and short-term overdraft facilities. The quantum of committed borrowing facilities
available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Section 05 – Financial statements 28. Financial instruments (continued)
Credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging. Policies and
procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history. Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging
transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main Board
level or within predetermined limits.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by
management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance 
sheet date. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable. 
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.

Provision as at 31 December 13.4 11.3
There are £26.2m of trade receivables that are past due at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against. There are no
indications as at 31 December 2007 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables
recognised in the balance sheet that are past due and unprovided.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.

Forward foreign currency contracts – 0.7 0.8 –
In addition to the above, a number of the Group’s Private Public Partnership (PPP) jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate
derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk. Interest-bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP
jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group. The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge
future movements across a range spanning up until September 2035. At 31 December 2007 the Group’s share of the total net fair value
liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to £34.5m (2006: £27.8m) of which £23.0m (2006: £13.7m)

Disposals in 2007
During the year, the Group disposed of certain non-core businesses which have been classified as discontinued operations. The effect 
on the Group of the disposal of these businesses is disclosed in note 8. In addition, in September 2007 the Group disposed of Sovereign
Harbour Marina Limited, generating cash consideration of £10.7m and a non-operating profit of £3.7m.
In December 2007, the Group disposed of equity investments in three Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities. The disposal 
generated cash consideration of £21.5m (after deducting disposal costs of £50,000) and a non-operating profit of £23.6m.
Disposals in 2006
During the acquisition of Mowlem plc, certain businesses were identified as being non-core operations for disposal. In addition, there 
were a number of businesses which had been identified as available for sale by Mowlem plc prior to acquisition.
In the post-acquisition period the Group disposed of the following Mowlem plc businesses:
Edgar Allen Limited
Charter Builders Ltd
Mowlem Environmental Sciences Group
Barclay Mowlem Limited
Carillion Energy Limited (formerly Mowlem Energy Limited)
Carillion Utility Services Limited (formerly Mowlem Utility Services Limited)
These businesses were included in the acquisition balance sheet of Mowlem plc as assets and liabilities held for sale and were therefore
carried at fair value, which represents proceeds on disposal less costs to sell. These fair values were realised on subsequent disposal and
consequently no profit or loss has arisen.
The cash effect has been reflected in the Group cash flow statement as follows.

the projected unit credit method. The market value of the schemes’ assets at the date were £485.0m and £106.4m respectively, which
represented approximately 90 per cent and 94 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date on an ongoing basis,
after allowing for future increases in salaries. The regular on-going contributions paid during the year were £10.7m (2006: £10.8m) in

£0.2m per annum to the Staff and ‘B’ schemes, respectively are scheduled to commence from March 2010 and cease at the end of 
2015. The next actuarial valuations are normally due at 31 December 2008.

The majority of employees who participate in these schemes are in defined benefit arrangements. The defined benefit section of the
Mowlem Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme closed to new entrants on 1 January 2003.
A defined contribution section was opened for new employees from 1 April 2003. Existing final salary members could opt to continue 
on that basis from 1 April 2003 if they agreed to pay a higher member contribution or could pay the same rate and accrue benefits 
on a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) basis from that date.
An actuarial valuation of the Mowlem Staff scheme was undertaken by independent actuaries as at 31 December 2006 using the 
attained age method. The market value of the schemes assets at that date were £459.6m, representing approximately 93 per cent of 
the benefits that had accrued to members at that date on an ongoing basis, after allowing for future increases in salaries. An actuarial
valuation of the Mowlem (1993) scheme was undertaken by independent actuary as at 31 December 2004 using the attained age
method. The market value of the schemes assets at that date were £30.3m, representing approximately 71 per cent of the benefits 
that had accrued to members at that date on an ongoing basis, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
The regular ongoing contributions paid during the year were £7.1m (2006: £7.7m) in respect of the Mowlem Staff scheme and 
£2.5m (2006: £1.9m) in respect of the Mowlem (1993) scheme.

in respect of the Mowlem Staff scheme continuing until 2012 and £1.6m per annum in respect of the Mowlem (1993) scheme continuing
until 2016.
The Group expects to pay regular ongoing contributions of approximately 20.3 per cent and 28.2 per cent to the Mowlem Staff and
Mowlem (1993) schemes during 2008. An actuarial valuation of the Mowlem (1993) scheme by the Trustees’ independent actuaries 
as at 31 December 2007 is currently being undertaken.

commercial obligations under Private Finance Initiative, Public Private Partnership and Best Value contracts with public sector employers.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the Trustees’ independent actuaries as at 31 December 2004 using the 
attained age method. The market value of the schemes’ assets at that date was £74.9m, which represented approximately 82 per cent 
of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date on an ongoing basis, after allowing for future increases in salaries. The regular
ongoing employer contributions paid during the year were £3.1m (2006: £2.7m).
As part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, additional payments of £4.3m (2006: £2.0m) were made during 2007. 
Further payments of £2.3m per annum are scheduled to be paid until 2015.
The Group expects to pay regular contributions of approximately £2.9m during 2008 representing 23.2 per cent of pensionable salaries 
at the end of 2007. 
If any employees are admitted into the Scheme through PFI, PPP or Best Value contracts during 2008 the level of contributions will
increase. An actuarial valuation of the scheme by the Trustees’ independent actuaries as at 31 December 2007 is currently being
undertaken. 101 Carillion plc

Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS)
Employees of GTRM and Centrac, and former employees of British Rail transferred to these businesses, have pension provision via Shared
Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme. Both the GTRM and Centrac Sections are closed to new entrants.
Shared cost arrangements are such that the employer and members share the cost of future service liabilities on a 60/40 split respectively
and any surplus or deficit emerging over time is dealt with on a similar basis.
Independent actuaries appointed by the Railways Pension Trustee Company Limited carried out a formal valuation of the Railways Pension
Scheme at 31 December 2004 using the attained age method for GTRM and the attained age method for Centrac. The market values 
of the scheme assets of the GTRM Section and Centrac Section at 31 December 2004 were £195.4m and £27.4m respectively, which
represented approximately 94 per cent and 102 per cent of benefits that had accrued to members at that date on an ongoing basis, 
after taking account of future increases in salaries, contributions payable and reserves. The regular ongoing contributions paid by the
employer during the year were £3.1m (2006: £3.9m) for GTRM and £0.3m (2006: £0.3m) for Centrac.
As part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, a payment of £2.0m (2006: £2.0m) was made during 2007 to the GTRM
sector. A further payment of £2.0m is due in January 2008. 
The Group expects to pay regular on-going contributions in 2008 for both sections representing 16.02 per cent and 16.56 per cent of
pensionable salaries for GTRM and Centrac respectively. An actuarial valuation of the scheme by the Trustees’ independent actuaries as

defined contribution pensions provided where required by the Joint Industries Board Working Rules Agreements.
Various companies within the Group participate in admission agreements with local authorities in order to allow former public sector
employees to continue membership of the Local Government Pension Scheme. Contributions during the year, which have been 
accounted for on a defined contribution basis, were £0.2m (2006: £0.2m).
IAS 19 disclosures
The weighted average of the principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were.
31 December 2007 31 December 2006
UK Canada UK Canada
Rate of increase in salaries 4.90% 3.20% 4.25% 3.00%
Rate of increase in pensions 3.40%

Inflation rate 3.40% 2.20% 3.00% 2.00%
Discount rate 5.60% 5.55% 5.00% 5.20%
(1) Where schemes have adopted the new 2.5 per cent per annum cap on increases to pensions in payment, the assumption is 2.4 per cent per annum (2006: 1.9 per cent) rather than the higher amount
shown above.
The market values of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change
before they are realised. The present values of the schemes’ liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA
corporate bonds. The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.
For all schemes the mortality basis is in line with the basis used by the respective Trustee at the last valuation. All the schemes, except 
the Railways Pension Scheme, have adopted a basis using the medium cohort tables on the recommendation of the Scheme Actuary. 
The Railways Pension Scheme uses scheme specific assumptions based on industry experience. 103 Carillion plc

32. Retirement benefit obligations (continued)
The Carillion Staff Scheme, the Carillion Public Sector Scheme, the Mowlem Staff Scheme and the Mowlem (1993) Scheme adopted 
the ‘PA92(YOB=1965)mc + 2 years’ table for non-retired member’s mortality and the ‘PA92(YOB=1935)mc + 2 years’ for retired 
members’ mortality at the last valuation. The previous bases were ‘PA92(Base) – 3 years’ and ‘PA92(Base) – 1 year’ respectively.
The life expectancies for a male aged 65 are shown below.
2007 2006
PA92(YOB=1965)mc + 2 yrs PA92(YOB=1965)mc + 2 years
Non-retired members 21.3 years 21.3 years
PA92(YOB=1935)mc + 2 yrs PA92(YOB=1935)mc + 2 years
Retired members 19.7 years 19.7 years
The Canadian Actuary annually undertakes an actuarial valuation and accounting exercise for reporting on local employee benefits 
under local GAAP , CICA 3461. The same assumptions have been used for local medical and dental inflation rates in relation to the Post
Retirement Benefit Plan. The immediate trend rate is 10 per cent per annum with an ultimate trend rate of five per cent per annum (2013).
An increase of one per cent in the valuation trend would increase liabilities by £0.6m and the total service cost by £0.1m. The decrease 
of one per cent in the valuation trend would reduce liabilities by £0.5m and total service cost by nil.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long-term interest rates, the yield on gilts or Treasury 
stock and the Actuary’s recommendation on the allowance for the potential long-term extra return from investing in equities.
Carillion has adopted immediate recognition of any actuarial gains or losses through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense 
as permitted under IAS 19.
The IAS 19 position for the schemes is as follows.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 1 January 2004 in the Group Statement of Recognised Income

transition to IFRS of £85.2m and taken directly to total equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense before 1 January 2004.

33. Accounting estimates and judgements
Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting 
policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
discussed below:
Construction contracts
In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in 
relation to final out-turn on each contract. On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome
cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable. Once the outcome can 
be estimated reliably the estimates of final out-turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the specific risks 
within each contract that have been identified during the early stages of the contract. The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular
basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate. However, the nature of the risks on contracts are such that they
often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project. Management continually
reviews estimated final out-turn on contracts and makes adjustments where necessary.
Intangible assets
In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in 
relation to final out-turn on construction contracts, discount rates and expected future cash flows and profitability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached. Note 12 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations
In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made. 
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group:
• Expected return on plan assets
• Inflation rate
• Mortality
• Discount rate
• Salary and pensions increases
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 32.
34. Post-balance sheet events
On 12 February 2008, the Company acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Alfred McAlpine plc for a total consideration 
of £554.5m. The total consideration was satisfied by the issue of 112.9m Carillion plc shares valued at the quoted mid-market price at 
the close of business on the day preceding the effective date of acquisition of 337.75p and £171.7m in cash and £1.3m of loan notes. 
In addition, attributable costs are estimated to be £9.2m. The acquisition has had no impact on reported profit during 2007. Due to the
short period of time that Alfred McAlpine plc has been within the Group’s ownership prior to the approval of these financial statements, 
it has not been possible to determine the fair value of the business acquired. The fair value will be determined prior to the announcement
of the 2008 interim results and full disclosure will be made in the 2008 interim financial statements.

Notes to the Company financial statements
109 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
1. Significant accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently 
in dealing with items which are considered material in relation 
to the Company’s financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. 
They are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative
financial instruments which are stated at fair value, and in
accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and law.
During the year the Company adopted Urgent Issues Task Force
(UITF) Abstract 41 ‘Scope of FRS 20 share-based payments’. The
adoption of this abstract has no effect on reported profit but has
resulted in an increase to net assets of £1.5m.
Taxation
Deferred tax assets or liabilities arise from timing differences
between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial
statements and their recognition in the tax computation that 
have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except 
as otherwise required by Financial Reporting Standard 19 
‘Deferred tax’. Liabilities are calculated on a non-discounted 
full provision basis. Assets are calculated on the same basis, 
but are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that 
they will be recovered.
Fixed asset investments
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary
undertakings and Joint Ventures are stated at cost, less provision
for any impairment.
Leasing
The Company enters into finance lease arrangements on behalf 
of subsidiary companies. As permitted by Statement of Standard
Accounting Practice 21 ‘Accounting for leases and hire purchase
contracts’, the assets relating to the finance leases are included 
in the financial statements of the subsidiaries concerned. The
capital element of outstanding finance leases is included within
borrowing. The finance charge element of rentals is charged to 
the profit and loss account at a constant periodic rate of charge
on the outstanding obligations.
Own shares
Consideration paid for shares in the Company held by the
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust are deducted 
from the profit and loss account reserve. Where such shares
subsequently vest in the employees under the terms of the
Company’s share option schemes or are sold, any consideration
received is included in the profit and loss account reserve.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the
employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial
statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries
equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge
recognised in its consolidated financial statements with the
corresponding credit being recognised directly in other reserves.
Amounts recharged to the subsidiary are recognised as a reduction
in the cost of investment in subsidiary. If the amount recharged
exceeds the increase in the cost of investment the excess is
recognised as a dividend to the extent that it reflects post
acquisition profits of the subsidiary.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
sterling and recorded using the exchange rate prevailing at the
date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the
balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are
included in the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities are cash 
at bank and in hand and borrowing. Cash at bank and in 
hand is carried in the balance sheet at amortised cost. Borrowing
is recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs
and subsequently at amortised cost. In addition, the Company
enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against small and
infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures. The forward
contracts are measured initially at amortised cost, with changes in
fair value during the year recognised in the profit and loss account.
Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance 
sheet date.
Share-based payments
Members of the Company’s senior management team are entitled
to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), the
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Leadership Equity Award
Plan (LEAP). In addition, UK employees are able to participate in
the Sharesave scheme.
The fair value of the ESOS, LEAP and Sharesave schemes at the
date of grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The fair value of the LTIP scheme is estimated using a bespoke
model that factors in the probabilities of achieving Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) performance conditions. For all schemes
the fair value determined at grant date is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the period in which any performance conditions are
fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees
become fully entitled to the award (vesting date).
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts 
to guarantee the indebtedness of subsidiary companies, the
Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and
accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats 
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time 
as it becomes probable that the Company will be required 
to make a payment under the guarantee.
Retirement benefit obligations
Pension costs are recognised in the financial statements in
accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 ‘Retirement benefits’.
Employees of the Company participate in the Carillion ‘Staff’ and
‘B’ schemes which provide pensions on a defined benefit basis. 
The assets and liabilities of these schemes relating to the Company
cannot be readily ascertained on a reasonable and consistent 
basis as the schemes are operated for the benefit of the Carillion
Group as a whole. Consequently, the Company accounts for these
schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes. Details of
the Group’s pension schemes are disclosed in note 32 of the
consolidated financial statements.
Cash flow statement
A cash flow statement has not been presented as permitted by
FRS 1 (revised) ‘Cash flow statements’.
Section 05 – Financial statements 2. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account 
for the year. Carillion plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2007 of £17.6m (2006: £31.8m).
Fees paid to KPMG Audit plc and its associates for services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual accounts of Carillion
plc because the Company’s consolidated accounts are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
A final dividend, declared in the previous year, of 5.9p per share (2006: 5.2p) was paid during the year, amounting to £16.6m (2006:
£14.5m). An interim dividend of 3.5p per share (2006: 3.1p) was paid during the year, amounting to £9.8m (2006: £8.7m). A final
dividend of 7.5p (2006: 5.9p) per share, amounting to £29.6m (2006: £16.6m), was approved by the Board on 5 March 2008 and will 
be paid on 20 June 2008 to shareholders on the register on 25 April 2008. The amount expected to be paid in respect of the 2007 
final dividend of £29.6m, includes the dividend payable on 112.9m new Carillion shares issued following the acquisition of Alfred
McAlpine plc on 12 February 2008.

As the Staff and ‘B’ defined benefit schemes are run for the Carillion Group as a whole, the Company is unable to identify its share 
of the schemes’ assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. Hence, as permitted by FRS 17, the schemes are accounted 
for by the Company separately as if the schemes were defined contribution schemes. Details of the Group’s pension schemes are disclosed
in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
12. Share-based payments
The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to purchase shares
in the Company. Details of the Group’s share option programme are disclosed in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements and

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Q: What do you regard as the Company’s most significant
achievements of 2003?
A: Overall, Anglo’s operations did well to produce a very solid set 
of results in the face of difficult currency movements. Strategically, 
I would suggest securing final approval for the acquisition of a
controlling stake in Kumba as the most significant achievement.
This has been a long term objective. Iron ore will strengthen the
balance of our portfolio and our position has been achieved at 
a reasonable cost to shareholders.
In the non-financial arena I would identify both the provision of anti-
retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff and the introduction of the
Socio-Economic Assessment Toolbox (SEAT). As far as I am aware,
SEAT is a unique initiative which will enable our operations to become
more professional and strategic in their interactions with communities.
Q: But clearly there are things with which you are not satisfied.
Where will the board be looking for the most significant improvement
in performances in 2004?
A: We have made remarkable strides in improving the Group’s 
overall safety performance over the last five years. Nonetheless,
the board remains determined to see further reductions in fatalities.
My colleagues and I visited New Denmark colliery in South Africa
in October and there we saw what can be achieved in embedding 
a safety culture through strong and focused leadership. Ben Magara,
the colliery manager, has produced substantial safety advances
coupled with performance improvements in almost all areas. Time
and again we see that teamwork, a real sense of shared objectives
amongst the workforce, and the operating disciplines needed to
deliver safe performance, lead to overall improvement of
performance. Our challenge is to ensure that the lessons of
operations like New Denmark are learned more widely.
Q: During 2003 there has been a renewed focus on corporate
governance. How does Anglo measure against the Higgs Report?
A: Markets work most efficiently where there is confidence. Clearly,
events over the last two years on both sides of the Atlantic provide
examples of how poor governance, or unhealthy dominance of strategy
by an individual or clique, have resulted in shareholders losing a lot 
of money. Society is entitled to see how such outcomes can best be
prevented. In general I think a workable structure has emerged.
Anglo American has a strong team of non-executive directors 
and we have restructured our board committees to meet the Higgs
recommendations. I am also delighted that the board has been
strengthened by the appointment of Dr Maria Silvia Bastos Marques.
She brings very pertinent experience of Latin America and of the
metals sector and is also the first woman to be elected to the Anglo
American plc board.
Q: What is the new Bonus Share Plan that is being proposed?
A: The BSP will strengthen the linkage of rewards to performance.
The new plan will require executive directors to invest a greater
proportion of their remuneration in shares up front, thereby better
aligning their interests with those of shareholders. Awards under
the BSP will be made annually and will consist of three elements: 
a cash element, a Bonus Share element and an Enhancement Share
element. These bonus awards will not be pensionable. A resolution
seeking approval for the BSP and authorising the directors to
implement it in the UK and other countries where we operate will 
be proposed at the AGM. A letter from the chairman of the
Remuneration Committee explaining the terms of the BSP is being
sent to all shareholders.
Q: Anglo has expanded its interests in Latin America. How do you
see prospects in that continent?
A: Over the last two years we have seen work start on expansions
at our Cerrejón coal operation in Colombia (of which Anglo owns a
third), Collahuasi in Chile (a world class copper operation, of which
Anglo owns 44%), our phosphates operation in Brazil (Copebrás), 
the commissioning of Loma de Níquel in Venezuela and, above all,
the acquisition of the Disputada (now known as Minera Sur Andes)
assets in Chile.
I visited almost all of our operations in Latin America during 2003.
The continent is facing some political instability. Nonetheless, Chile
continues to show the maturity of its democracy and institutions
and I have been impressed by President ‘Lula’ da Silva’s emphasis in
Brazil on macro-economic stability and on welcoming foreign direct
investment – a point which he particularly emphasised when he
opened Copebrás’ expansion project.
Q: Does Anglo have a disproportionate exposure to southern Africa?
What about continuing investor concern?
A: We remain committed to South Africa and believe that this year’s
celebrations of the transition to democracy will highlight the real
achievements of the past decade. Of course there are problems in the
region – not least the continuing turmoil in Zimbabwe and HIV/AIDS.
But South Africa itself has strong institutions and a vibrant civil
society. After the strongly negative investor reaction to the leaking of
an early draft of the Mining Empowerment Charter in 2002, the final
requirements which have emerged are financeable for fair value. It is
in the interests of South Africa’s long term stability that there should
be a rebalancing of ownership in the economy. We have been pioneers
in black economic empowerment deals and I am also pleased with the
substantial growth, R3.5 billion in 2003, in procurement from black
owned businesses. Our Zimele small business development unit is
invested in 30 growing companies, providing over 2,000 direct jobs. 
I should note too in southern Africa the consistent courage and 
skill of our managers in Zimbabwe and also the inauguration during
2003 of our Skorpion zinc mine. This will account for some 4% of
Namibia’s GDP at full production.
Q: But the Extractive Industries Review, in which you participated,
has produced a negative assessment of the impact of the mining
sector. How do you respond?
A: I was disappointed by Dr Salim’s report. It is very much a personal
appreciation, but I think it suffers from having taken very little input
from governments and relied excessively on the more radical and
absolutist end of the NGO movement. It recommends that the 
World Bank should remain involved in the sector. But it then adds 
so many caveats that its recommendations would reduce the Bank’s
involvement and, thereby, diminish the investment going to some 
of the poorest countries – for which the responsible exploitation of
resources is their best route out of poverty. I do not take lightly the
examples of how resource projects have fed corruption or conflict.
But, properly understood, these are examples of a ‘poor governance’
curse rather than a ‘resource’ curse. Anglo American has been
prominent in supporting the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative – which aims to tackle the misuse of revenues generated 
by the sector. The mining industry, as a long term investor, 
has an interest in good governance. We want to see the positive
development experiences of Chile, Botswana, South Africa and Oman
– or indeed, historically, Canada and Australia – shared more widely.
Q: Finally, how do you rate Anglo’s performance on sustainable
development?
A: We are making good progress. I note that one of the biggest
corporate socially responsible investment houses recently described
us as being a challenger for sector leadership in relation to corporate
social responsibility. We are doing leading-edge work in relation to
HIV/AIDS, local business development and community engagement. 
I have seen very thoughtful initiatives under way in areas like
assessing our economic and developmental impacts, climate change
and biodiversity. Of course, there are still improvements to be made
in some areas – such as target setting and in embedding best practice
more widely – but Anglo is moving strongly in the right direction. in Slovakia was also commissioned successfully, increasing the
Group’s paper production by some 100,000 tonnes. Both of these
projects should contribute to earnings in 2004.
Our strong track record in terms of acquisitions speaks for itself. 
The EBITDA cash flow returns on our key acquisitions of Minera Sur
Andes, Cerrejón, Shell Coal, Syktyvkar and Tarmac range between 
16% and 23%. The acquisition of Minera Sur Andes late in 2002 
has proved extremely attractive for the Group. Not only were the
projected synergies exceeded but the operations were earnings-
accretive in their first year after acquisition at an average copper
price of 81 US cents/lb. Additional reserves totalling 368 million
tonnes have also been identified during the year, thereby extending
the life of this large, low cost producer at a time when few large,
new copper mines are coming into production.
Since our London listing in 1999, we have achieved significant
volume growth: 17% for platinum, 40% for diamonds, 67% 
for copper, 57% for nickel, 197% for zinc, 40% for coal, 152% 
for aggregates, 166% for uncoated woodfree paper, 158% 
for packaging papers and 346% for industrial sacks. In terms 
of geographic exposure, we have made significant progress 
in transforming Anglo American’s asset base, with 30% of 
our assets today in Europe, 40% in South Africa, 16% in the
Americas and the balance spread around the globe.
Improving the efficiency of our asset base
We seek continuously to improve the operating efficiency of our
existing assets. Our focus on driving returns has produced significant
results from Group-wide cost cutting programmes. We have
consistently exceeded our targets and over the last two years have
achieved total costs savings and efficiency improvements of just
over $600 million. Management is very aware of the value that can
be created by optimising existing operations and is incentivised to
achieve this.
Innovation
Improving the culture for innovation and entrepreneurialism remains 
a key driver of growth. This includes a thoroughgoing review 
of employee communication and knowledge sharing, enhanced by
a strong central technical and research function for our specialist
mining technologies. Comprehensive programmes of innovation
activity are now under way in various business units, including
Base Metals, Paper and Packaging, and Industrial Minerals. These
programmes seek to empower individuals to put forward ideas and
facilitate their translation into practical business improvements.
GROWING OUR BUSINESS
Finance
Significant progress was made during the year in diversifying the
Group’s debt capability away from pure bank credit by the placement
of euro and sterling denominated bonds. Simultaneously, the debt-
maturity profile was extended materially. We will continue to explore
opportunities to improve further the depth and flexibility of our
financing capability.
Diamonds
The earnings contribution from our 45% associate De Beers
increased by 19% to $386 million, and cash dividends received
increased by 124% to $238 million.
De Beers has successfully implemented its Supplier of Choice
business model. Having obtained approval from the European
Commission in January 2003 for its Supplier of Choice customer
strategy, the process of reconfiguring its relationship with sightholders
commenced. The strategy of stimulating interest in diamonds as a
luxury-goods category appears to be working well, with a number of
sightholders and their downstream trade partners financing advertising
03 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Chief executive’s statement
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
he year 2003 was notable for a high degree of political and
economic uncertainty. The first half of the year was impacted
by the war in Iraq and political tension in the Middle East, 
as well as the significant decline of the US dollar against other 
world currencies. This weakness in the dollar had a significant impact 
on the Group’s results and, in particular, on the translation of the
Group’s costs in South Africa and Australia. The second half of the
year saw some recovery in demand for commodities and significant
rises in the dollar prices for many of the Group’s products, including
platinum, gold, coal and base metals.
The Group benefited again from its wide spread of product and
geographic diversity which together offer a natural hedge against
economic conditions in any particular sector. For the first time since
our listing in 1999, the biggest contributor to headline earnings
was the Group’s interest in De Beers, which reported record results
from buoyant demand and rising prices in the diamond sector.
Although turnover increased by 22% to $25 billion, the currency
impacts referred to above affected operating profits (including the
translation of non-cash items such as goodwill amortisation and
depreciation). However, it is pleasing that the Group was able 
to report another year of strong cash flow (EBITDA), virtually
unchanged at $4,785 million. Headline earnings declined 4% 
to $1,694 million and earnings per share fell similarly by 5 cents
to 120 cents per share.
The Group continued to grow on a steady basis and during the year
benefited from the acquisition in late 2002 of the Minera Sur Andes
(formerly Disputada) copper operations in Chile, which materially
exceeded the acquisition forecast parameters, and the acquisition 
of 66.6% of South Africa’s largest iron ore producer, Kumba.
Against a background of rising commodity prices and an improving
outlook for the Group’s products, the board has decided to increase
the final dividend by 3 cents to 39 cents per share, resulting in a
total dividend of 54 cents per share for 2003, up 6%.
STRATEGY
Over the past five years we have achieved a significant restructuring
of Anglo American. What was a highly complex group has been
transformed into a world class entity with an exceptional portfolio of
high quality assets and a balanced geographic exposure. During this
period we have grown our businesses significantly through $12 billion 
of acquisitions and projects and have made disposals of $7 billion 
of non-core assets, thereby creating a focused business to deliver
improved returns to our shareholders. A major milestone was the
unwinding of the De Beers cross-holding in 2001, which unlocked
significant value. Since 1999, when we listed on the London Stock
Exchange, shareholder value has increased by $20 billion. 
Anglo American’s strategy is to achieve steady growth for its
shareholders across the cycle by investing in attractive acquisitions
as well as brownfield and greenfield projects that add value to
natural resources. Our policy of adding value and pursuing growth
covers the following key areas:
Acquisitions and organic growth
We continue to pursue both acquisition and organic-led growth 
across our business units. Anglo American has one of the strongest
pipelines of growth projects in the mining and natural resource
industry, spanning all of our key products, with around $6 billion 
of approved project capital expenditure over the next five years.
We successfully commissioned a number of projects during 2003,
including the $454 million Skorpion zinc project in Namibia which
is currently operating at 75% of design capacity. The timing of this
project appears opportune with zinc prices and demand starting to
recover from recent record lows. The Ruzomberok paper mill project

CONTINUED
Base Metals
A major turnaround has been achieved in Base Metals.
The integration of Minera Sur Andes, which had its first full year 
of contribution in 2003, has provided critical mass to our copper
operations in Chile, and annual cost savings and synergies achieved
so far amount to $17 million. Anglo American is now among the
world’s top five producers of the metal, with an attributable
production of more than 700,000 tonnes a year. In September, the
Skorpion mine and refinery opened in Namibia. This is set to become
one of the world’s lowest cost zinc producers as it ramps up to full
production of 150,000 tonnes per annum. Exploration effort within
Base Metals will continue to focus on copper, with lower emphasis
on nickel and zinc, in pursuit of organic growth.
Industrial Minerals
Anglo Industrial Minerals continued to deliver a strong performance,
through a broad spread of businesses, mainly in the UK and
continental Europe. The year’s highlights included acquisitions in the
UK, France, Spain, Germany and the Czech Republic. Tarmac is now
the largest aggregates producer in the Czech Republic, and is well
placed to benefit from the country’s forthcoming entry into the EU.
In the UK, the $173 million cement plant at Buxton is undergoing
final commissioning trials and is expected to be in full production
in the second quarter of 2004. In Brazil, the new phosphate fertilizer
plant at Goiás was completed during the year, $19 million under its
budgeted cost of $147 million, and is operating at full capacity. In
China, Tarmac is developing a quarry 140 kilometres from Shanghai.
The quarry is the nearest known reserve of top quality asphalting
aggregates to China’s booming commercial capital.
Paper and Packaging
Anglo Paper and Packaging continued to develop and expand its
European and South African asset base. Mondi Packaging saw
significant transaction-led growth through the acquisition announced
in December last year of the Austrian Bauernfeind Group, a
corrugated paper and packaging business with extensive European
operations. Frantschach has entered the North American industrial
sack market with the acquisition of the Copamex sack business in
Mexico (subject to competition approval). In South Africa, the
Richards Bay pulp mill expansion is on track for commissioning its
first phase by the end of the first quarter in 2004, with completion
scheduled for just over a year later. The Russian mill, Neusiedler
Syktyvkar, is performing well and in line with the acquisition forecast.
Ferrous Metals & Industries
Anglo American has for some time sought entry into the iron ore
industry. A major development was the approval in September by
South Africa’s Competition Tribunal for the Company to acquire
shares in Kumba. In October, Anglo American’s shareholding 
in Kumba increased to just over 35% and as a consequence the
company extended a mandatory cash offer to Kumba’s shareholders,
resulting in Anglo American’s stake increasing to 66.6%. Kumba has
exciting expansion potential in iron ore through a number of projects
in South Africa and Australia. Having secured control of Kumba,
attention is now focused on meeting the black economic
empowerment (BEE) requirements in South Africa and growing 
the company. 
In line with the strategy of disposing of non-core assets, the
remaining shareholding in Li & Fung was sold for $269 million. 
The majority of our remaining stake in FirstRand was sold 
for $176 million, with the small residual amount disposed of 
in January 2004.
programmes, and diamond jewellery sales appearing to successfully
compete with, if not outperform, other luxury-goods categories.
Maintenance of this long term strategy is expected to result in a
sustainable increase in rough diamond demand.
De Beers continues to drive a continuous improvement programme
aimed at optimising all aspects of the business from production
efficiencies through to marketing, and is focused on optimising
availability of rough diamond supply from its own mines in
anticipation of further increased demand in 2004.
Platinum
Anglo Platinum’s long term objective is to grow the market for
platinum group metals and in tandem to expand output to meet this
demand. In December 2003, the company completed a detailed
review of its expansion projects in light of the stronger than
anticipated rand and weaker dollar. As a result, Anglo Platinum has
decided to slow down the development of certain of its projects but
will continue to utilise its outstanding ore reserves in growing
production to 2.9 million refined platinum ounces by 2006. In light of
its funding requirements, on 16 February 2004 Anglo Platinum
announced a R4 billion ($570 million) convertible preference share
offer. Anglo American will be subscribing for its pro rata share of the
issue and continues to believe in the fundamental long term attraction
of the platinum business.
Gold
In November, the Ghanaian government gave its backing for
AngloGold’s bid to bring about a merger with Ashanti Goldfields. 
The merger, which is expected to be completed in the first half of
2004, will create one of the world’s largest gold mining companies 
in terms of reserves and gold production. Ashanti Goldfields has six
operations spread across the African continent, including the long 
life Obuasi mine, where $1 billion is estimated to be spent over its
remaining life, including $570 million on the Obuasi Deeps project.
In order to address the challenges of margin squeeze as a function 
of reducing ore grades at some of its mines, declining global reserves
and the weak dollar, AngloGold continues its focus on operational
excellence, initiatives to increase reserves and downstream efforts 
to invigorate demand.
Coal
In the thermal coal market, Anglo Coal intends to maximise and 
grow its exports from South Africa, South America and Australia.
The export metallurgical coal capability will be further enhanced by
pursuing opportunities in Australia as well as in China and Russia.
Major expansionary capital in 2004 will include the Kriel South,
Greenside and Kleinkopje expansions in South Africa. In Australia, 
a feasibility study is under way regarding the development of 
the remainder of the Dawson complex, which incorporates Moura
and Theodore, while work continues on several other projects. In
Colombia, Cerrejón is expanding its operations to an annual output 
of 28 million tonnes of coal by 2007 . Although first-half production in
Australia will be affected by a longwall disruption at Moranbah,
Anglo Coal will benefit from the recent strong price rises for both
thermal and coking coal. 05 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Chief executive’s statement

SAFETY AND HEALTH
Further progress has been made in improving the safety and health
environment for employees, with Anglo American’s lost time injury
frequency rate (LTIFR) reflecting a 58% improvement over three years,
including a 26% improvement in 2003. I am, however, disappointed
by our failure to significantly reduce fatalities compared with 2002.
We continue to stress the paramount importance of safety throughout
our operations with single-minded determination.
Good progress has been made in rolling out anti-retroviral therapy to
employees with AIDS. Over 1,000 employees were receiving
treatment as of the end of 2003 and the preliminary results are very
encouraging. Anglo American has established an ambitious partnership
with the NGO loveLife; the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria;
the Nelson Mandela Foundation; and the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation to
help primary health care clinics build capacity to deliver improved
HIV/AIDS prevention and care services. This public-private partnership
is the first step in the process of building an AIDS treatment
infrastructure in the communities associated with our operations.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Specific programmes to support the implementation of Good
Citizenship: Our Business Principles were introduced during
the year, with a particular focus on community issues, employee
communication and enhancing our whistle-blowing facilities. Three
year rolling Community Engagement Plans are being produced by
significant operations, to improve interaction between the Company
and the communities in which it operates. These will increasingly be
enriched by our new Socio-Economic Assessment Toolbox (SEAT).
The SEAT process will support our local managers in engaging with
local stakeholders; improving management of any adverse impacts;
and working to maximise the local benefits of their presence in areas
like local business development and training. A noteworthy event
during the year was Anglo American’s inclusion in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index for the first time.
BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
The legislative framework governing the transformation of the
South African mining industry is continuing to emerge. We expect
promulgation of the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development
Act later this year, together with the regulations governing its
application. The process of conversion from old order to new order
mineral rights will then begin. The South African government has
confirmed that, regarding the Royalties Bill, royalties will only become
payable in 2009 when the conversion process is complete. 
In terms of black economic empowerment (BEE), the Group continues
to make steady progress, having now recorded over $2 billion in major
transactions and over $1.5 billion in procurement and small business
promotion spend. The Group is making good progress towards
complying with the Mining Charter BEE targets.
COMMODITIES – TIME FOR A TURNAROUND?
The past 20 years have been a difficult time in the commodities
business. Steady price rises for 40 years since the end of 
World War II – notably on the back of the rise of Japan and
reconstruction in Germany, followed by the emergence of South
Korea and later Brazil – came to an end, and were even reversed,
from the early 1980s onwards. In part this was due to the end 
of the post-war reconstruction phase, combined with an oversupply
of a number of major metals. This resulted in certain commodities,
such as copper and zinc, declining to real price levels last seen in 
the 1930s.
Encouragingly, there are signs that the historical real decline in metal
prices has started to reverse. Whether this represents the start of 
a new ‘long term cycle’ is a question that will not be answered for a
few years. At present, the cycle is not obviously different from any
other strong upturn over the past 20 years, though much of the 
new optimism is based on China’s current industrial revolution, which
in 2003 alone saw industrial production growth of 17%. China has
become the world’s biggest consumer of iron ore, copper and various
other commodities. For three years running, China has also been the
primary market for platinum jewellery, with compound annual growth
rates over that period of 35%. Diamond jewellery demand is also
growing strongly. Moreover, China’s embrace of the free market is
now being tracked, albeit at lower rates of growth, by India. Between
them, the two countries look set to provide sustained demand 
for a number of commodities for years to come. The effect of this,
combined with fewer discoveries and a more disciplined industry,
is set to provide a positive backdrop to metals markets going forward.
OUTLOOK
The positive outlook for a number of our commodities provides
an encouraging platform for the year ahead. Improved economic
growth in the USA and Japan, combined with the strong industrial
performance of China, is encouraging. After two decades of generally
flat or declining real prices for metals, despite a background 
of steadily increasing demand, the backdrop for commodities is now
more positive than it has been for a number of years. Although 
the potential for a further weakening of the dollar remains a cause
for concern, this is likely to be offset by rising dollar prices for our
key commodities. 
The Group offers a unique mix of geographic and product diversity
which insulates it from the volatility associated with single-product
cycles. Our gold, platinum, diamond, coal, base and ferrous metals
businesses are benefiting from recent price rises and should continue
to enjoy steady growth. In addition, paper and packaging and
industrial minerals are generating strong cash flows. The Group will
also benefit from a number of new projects and recent acquisitions. 
On the basis of prevailing commodity prices and exchange rates, 
the Group should achieve good growth in 2004.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
RESULTS SUMMARY 
Headline earnings per share were $1.20, a reduction of 4% from the
prior year. Strong performances by many of the Group’s businesses
were offset by the significant impact on the Group results of the
stronger South African rand, which appreciated some 28% against
the US dollar compared with the prior year average rate. Despite the
weakening of the dollar, headline earnings reached $1,694 million
resulting from an outstanding performance by De Beers and strong
contributions from Base Metals, Industrial Minerals and Paper 
and Packaging. Lower earnings were recorded by Anglo Platinum,
AngloGold, the Coal business and Ferrous Metals & Industries, due 
in the main to the impact of the firming of the rand against the dollar.
The robust underlying performance reflects the Group’s geographic
and product diversity, and the successful integration of acquisitions
and projects.

Profit for the year was $1,592 million compared with $1,563 million
in the prior year. The increased profit in the current year is principally
due to significant profits on the sale of the Group’s interests in Li &
Fung and FirstRand Limited, reduced minority interests and a lower
effective tax rate. These more than compensated for the net impact
of currency price movements, an increase in exceptional impairment
charges and an increased net interest charge.

NET IMPACT OF CURRENCY MOVEMENTS
The Group’s results are influenced by a variety of currencies due to
the geographic diversity of its operations. The South African rand 
in particular strengthened considerably against the US dollar during
the year with an average exchange rate of 7.55 compared with
10.48 in 2002. The euro and the Australian dollar also appreciated
against the US dollar, with the average rate for the euro moving 
from 1.06 to 0.88 and for the Australian dollar from 1.84 to 1.53.
Currency movements adversely impacted headline earnings by 
$578 million. This was partially offset by the positive impact, 
$400 million, of increased commodity prices.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Operating exceptional charges amounted to $286 million. These
included impairments or write-downs of $208 million to the carrying
value of Hudson Bay in Base Metals, $20 million against the
Boyongan project by Exploration and $43 million to AngloGold 
mining assets, principally Savuka. 
An exceptional finance charge of $13 million related to the Group’s
share of De Beers’ costs on the early redemption of debt, being
facility fees not yet amortised.
Non-operating exceptional gains amounted to $386 million. 
These included $163 million for the profit on sale of the Group’s
remaining holding in Li & Fung Limited, $117 million for the profit 
on the sale of shares in FirstRand Limited, $51 million for the profit
on the sale of the Group’s stake in Avgold Limited and $42 million
for sale of shares in East Africa Gold Mines and Randgold Resources.
INTEREST
The net interest charge increased from $179 million in the prior year
to $319 million in 2003. The increase reflects the increase in net
debt from $5,578 million at the beginning of 2003 to $8,633 million
as at 31 December 2003.
TAXATION 
The effective rate of taxation before exceptional items was 29%.
This was a reduction from the effective rate of 33% in 2002, due
to the impact of a number of one off deferred tax benefits arising
from tax rate reductions in a number of countries, benefits from
losses not previously recognised and the change in the mix of
earnings contributed by the Group’s businesses.
BALANCE SHEET
Total shareholders’ funds were $20,394 million compared with
$16,261 million as at 31 December 2002. The increase was 
primarily due to retained earnings and the appreciation of the 
rand and other local currencies against the dollar.
Net debt was $8,633 million, an increase of $3,055 million from
2002. This increase was principally due to debt incurred to fund
acquisitions during the period. Net debt at 31 December 2003
comprised $10,759 million of debt, offset by $2,126 million of 
cash and current asset investments. Net debt to total capital as 
at 31 December 2003 was 26.6%, compared with 23.1% in 2002.

Anglo Platinum’s operating profit fell by 46% to $433 million, due
primarily to the weak dollar. The effect of the firmer rand was partially
offset by a higher average dollar basket price of metals sold and
greater sales volumes. Operating costs rose as a result of increased
production volumes from ramp-up mining and smelting operations.
Markets
The average realised dollar basket price of metals sold slightly
exceeded that for 2002, with the benefit of improved platinum and
nickel prices largely offset by lower palladium and rhodium prices.
For 2003, the average realised price for platinum of $696/oz was
$152 higher than for 2002, while nickel was $4.07/lb compared 
with $3.03 the previous year. The realised prices of platinum’s sister
metals palladium and rhodium were significantly lower, at $198/oz
for palladium (2002: $329) and $527/oz in the case of rhodium
(2002: $831).
Operating performance
Total platinum received at the smelters, including platinum 
purchased from joint venture partners, increased by 8.0%, and was
equivalent to refined platinum production of 2.36 million ounces 
at standard processing recoveries. Some 53,000 of these ounces
were permanently absorbed into the production pipeline because 
of higher volumes and the new Polokwane smelter. Refined platinum
output amounted to 2.31 million ounces, slightly ahead of the 
target announced in July 2003.
The temporary increase in pipeline stock levels reported at the
interim results stage had been successfully processed by the end 
of 2003, resulting in a significant increase in production and sales
volumes in the second half of the year. 
During 2003, the Anglo Platinum strategy review was conducted 
in the context of the strong rand, which has a significant impact on
operating margins, cash generation and funding requirements of new
projects. The review confirmed that current and future demand for
platinum remains robust. However, in view of the current strength 
of the rand, the rate of implementation of the expansion projects 
has been slowed down. Production of refined platinum by the end 
of 2006 is now planned to amount to 2.9 million ounces, which
represents a compound annual production growth rate of 8% from
2003 to 2006. The effect of the slowdown on the expected ongoing
platinum supply deficit is likely to be lessened by an increase in
palladium usage in autocatalysts and slower growth in demand of
platinum jewellery. Notwithstanding the slowing of the expansion
programme, Anglo Platinum’s long term strategy to grow markets 
for platinum group metals, expand production to meet the increased
demand and optimise operations remains in place.
In 2003, significant progress was made with the project programme.
The Polokwane smelter, designed to process concentrate from
Eastern Limb operations, was successfully commissioned in March,
as was the slag-cleaning furnace at Rustenburg. The Anglo Platinum
Converting Process (ACP) plant near Rustenburg was brought on
stream and is ramping up to full production. Phase 1 of the Western 08 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial review

Limb Tailings Project is being commissioned ahead of schedule.
Agreement was reached with Aquarius Platinum to jointly mine
contiguous properties in the Kroondal area with effect from
November 2003 and the Bafokeng-Rasimone, Rustenburg UG2 and
Modikwa projects have continued to increase production levels.
Outlook
Refined platinum production is planned to increase to 2.45 million
ounces in 2004. The platinum price is expected to remain firm during
2004, supported by the ongoing supply deficit, while the palladium
price will be determined by Russian supply patterns, notwithstanding
firm demand. Should metal prices and the rand remain at the levels
achieved so far in 2004, operating profit for 2004 is likely to be
higher than for 2003.

Operating profit was down by 30% to $326 million, with headline
earnings 19% lower at $167 million. Total cash costs increased 
from $161 to $229/oz, mainly owing to the weakening of the US
dollar against local currencies in those countries in which AngloGold
operates as well as inflation and lower ore grades.
Markets
The gold market was again buoyant for much of 2003, driven
overwhelmingly by higher levels of investment and speculator
interest in the metal. The gold price finished on its high for the 
year of $417/oz, almost $100 higher than the low earlier in the 
year. The continued strength in the gold price has been closely
correlated with the weakening of the dollar against the euro.
Operating performance 
Gold production dropped by 5% to 5.6 million ounces mainly as 
a result of the sale of Jerritt Canyon in North America as well as
lower grades at Morila in Mali. A combination of stronger currencies
against the dollar, inflation and lower ore grades had a significant
negative impact on costs, margins and earnings. However, these
effects were partially offset by a 20% increase in the realised 
dollar gold price.
In December, AngloGold announced that it had entered into a support
agreement with the Government of Ghana in its role as holder of
16.9% of the share capital of Ashanti Goldfields and that it had agreed
the terms of a stability agreement with the government concerning
certain fiscal and regulatory undertakings in the government’s role as
regulator of Ashanti. These agreements were definitive steps in the
conclusion of the merger between the two companies. AngloGold
currently has a number of major capital projects in South Africa –
Mponeng Deepening, Moab Khotsong, TauTona expansion, TauTona
carbon leader below 120 level and the TauTona Ventersdorp Contact
Reef (VCR) pillar. Together, these projects will yield some 12 million
ounces of gold production over their lives. Future capital projects in
South Africa include Moab Phase 2, Mponeng VCR below 120 level
and Vaal River Surface, which together could add some 7.5 million
ounces of gold production over their lives. Potential growth projects
outside of South Africa include the Cuiabá expansion in Brazil and the
Sunrise Dam underground project and Boddington mine in Australia,
which together would add a further 7 million ounces of gold
production over their lives. The completion of the AngloGold-Ashanti
merger would open up the possibility of the Obuasi Deeps project,
extending the life of that operation by some 20 years.
AngloGold’s forward-pricing, or hedging, programme has been an
important part of the company’s management of revenue and, in turn,
an important part of its management of returns to shareholders and
of capital expenditure programmes. In the circumstances of improved
dollar spot prices of gold, AngloGold has reduced its forward-pricing
commitments substantially over the past two years, and is likely to
continue to reduce hedge levels in the future.
Outlook
Production in 2004 is expected to decrease to some 5.4 million
ounces, following the sale of Jerritt Canyon in North America and 
the closure of Union Reefs in Australia. Lower grades at Morila in
Mali will also contribute to this lower output. However, following
the expected completion of the Ashanti deal in April, production
is expected to increase to some 6.6 million ounces. Assuming 
an exchange rate of R7.00 to the dollar, AngloGold is expecting 
total unit cash costs to rise to $238/oz and capital expenditure 
to increase to $589 million. 
Many of the economic factors which are negative for the US currency
have been, conversely, incentives for investors to buy gold. It is
expected that these factors will remain in play in the year ahead, and
there is good reason to expect gold price strength to be maintained.

Markets
Overall, 2003 was a good year for the diamond industry, with further
encouraging growth in retail sales of diamond jewellery. In spite of
war in Iraq and the SARS virus impacting negatively on the global
economy and consumer confidence, diamond jewellery sales during
the first half of the year were marginally positive compared with
the first six months of 2002. However, strong growth in sales was
reported in the third and fourth quarters as the world economy and
consumer confidence rebounded. Preliminary indications are that
global retail sales of diamond jewellery for the year as a whole were
about 5% higher than the previous year in local currency and,
because of the weakness of the dollar, about 6% higher in dollars.
The USA, which accounts for more than 50% of world diamond
jewellery sales, was particularly strong, as were India, China and 
the UK. Encouragingly, Japan also recorded growth for the first time 
in a number of years. These results should ensure that any excess
pipeline stocks held by the trade would have been cleared by the
2003 year end and, hopefully, should help to reduce debt levels 
in the cutting centres which have been at historically high levels. 09 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial review
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
Operating performance
The strong demand for rough diamonds from the cutting centres in 
the first half of the year continued through into the second half and
full year sales by The Diamond Trading Company (DTC), the marketing
arm of De Beers, were $5.52 billion, 7% higher than in 2002. 
During the year, DTC raised its rough diamond prices on three
occasions and, by the year end, its prices were, on average, about
10% higher than at the beginning of the year. Increased sales at
higher prices and lower financing costs more than compensated 
for the negative impact on De Beers’ 2003 results of the significant
appreciation of the rand against the dollar in 2003. Diamond stocks
were reduced further by nearly $700 million during the year and, 
for the second year running, operating cash flow of $1.6 billion was
generated. This enabled De Beers to reduce net interest-bearing 
debt from $1,716 million to $906 million and to reduce net gearing 
to 15% (2002: 28%).
The combined total production of De Beers and its partners,
Debswana and Namdeb, totalled 43.9 million carats (2002:
40.2 million carats). The Combined Treatment Plant in Kimberley,
South Africa, designed to extend the life of the Kimberley 
operations, was fully commissioned during the year.
Outlook
There is optimism that 2004 will be another good year for the
diamond industry. Macro-economic indicators are positive for the
global economy and there is growing evidence that the transformation
of the diamond industry, stimulated by De Beers’ Supplier of Choice
strategy, is producing the desired results. Greater investment by 
the trade in marketing and branding is driving demand for diamond
jewellery and helping diamonds to gain a larger share of the luxury
goods sector.
Responding to the current strength of the diamond market and the
positive outlook for 2004, the DTC had a strong first sight at which
it raised its rough diamond prices by a further 3%.
Debswana Diamond Company’s lease of the Jwaneng mine falls
due for renewal in July 2004, and discussions have begun with the
Government of Botswana.

Operating profit was $333 million, 22% down on the previous 
year’s $427 million, while headline earnings declined by 13%
from $266 million to $232 million. Production increased by 8%
to 87 million tonnes. In spite of this increase and excellent cost
containment, a fall in average prices compared with the previous
year and the appreciation of the rand and the Australian dollar 
served to significantly depress operating profit for the year.
Markets
The year was characterised by demand growth in most sectors,
dramatically increased price volatility and directional uncertainty. 
Factors that contributed to coal market volatility included exchange
rate fluctuations, freight and logistics cost increases, power-market
price volatility, and gas and oil price increases. Also significant
were Chinese demand growth for all commodities and the limitation
on coal exports from that country, increased global thermal and
metallurgical coal demand, nuclear industry issues in Japan and
Europe, as well as constraints affecting supply and logistics,
principally in South Africa and Australia. Significantly, the business
environment now includes numerous participants that are neither
producers nor consumers, who are not driven by physical coal supply
and demand considerations, but who exercise considerable influence
through their interest in coal price related derivative instruments.
South African thermal coal prices, as measured by published indices,
dropped by 15% during the first four months before increasing 72%
by year end. Coking coal prices also rose significantly during the year
following 2003 contract settlements. The benefits of price increases
in all sectors will be felt in 2004.
Operating performance
Operating profit for South African sourced coal fell by 46% to
$133 million. Headline earnings declined by 41% to $79 million,
mainly as a result of the rand’s 28% appreciation. This was partially
offset by rigorous cost control.
Production and sales increased significantly to 52 million tonnes
despite several production sections being closed to reduce costs.
Production efficiencies contributed to saleable production at export
collieries being 4% above the previous year. Growth in electricity
production by Eskom, the principal electricity supplier in South Africa,
when combined with low stocks, resulted in sales tonnes to Eskom
increasing by 9%. 
Major expansionary capital projects, including the Kriel South project
and the Greenside and Kleinkopje expansions, are progressing to plan. 
Operating profit for the Australian operations remained the same 
at $130 million, mainly owing to improved production tonnages at
export mines, partly compensated by the Australian dollar’s 17%
firming against the US dollar compared with the prior year average
rate. Favourable exchange rate hedges taken out during the year
reduced the adverse effect of the stronger Australian dollar on the
operating results. Headline earnings declined by 4% to $94 million. 
Attributable saleable coal production rose by 4.4% to 26.1 million
tonnes. Dartbrook and Moranbah achieved record production for
longwall mines during the first six months. However, production
slowed during the second half owing to longwall moves and certain
technical problems. Drayton production was steady, while both
Moura and German Creek exceeded previous performances. 
A number of the Queensland mines suffered production setbacks
during the second half following sporadic industrial action, but 
these issues were resolved by year end. 
Total attributable sales declined by 6% to 26.4 million tonnes. 10 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial review
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
Domestic sales were reduced by some 2.5 million tonnes, mainly 
as a result of new generating capacity being added to the network
and the commissioning of competitor mines. Export sales were
further limited by port constraints at Newcastle and Gladstone. 
Australian thermal prices were marginally below 2002 prices,
although coking coal prices held firm throughout the year. 
Theodore commenced production in September and a feasibility 
study is under way regarding the balance of the Dawson complex,
incorporating both Moura and Theodore. Work also commenced on
the pre-feasibility studies for Lake Lindsay, adjacent to the German
Creek complex, and continues on the development of Grasstree
and Kayuga projects. Grasstree remains on schedule for start-up of
production during 2006. Small volumes of coal are being produced 
at Kayuga during initial development and full production should be
reached in 2004.
A significant fall of ground in January 2004 at Moranbah North 
will reduce production by some 10% compared with 2003 levels. 
The effect on earnings will be felt in the first half of 2004. 
Operating profit at the South American operations rose by 40% to
$70 million on the back of increases in volume and reductions in unit
costs. These gains were counteracted in part by reductions in prices
during the first six months. Operations were affected by heavy
rainfall during the last quarter. In Colombia, synergies achieved as 
a result of merging the two operations, Cerrejón Zona Norte and
Carbones del Cerrejón SA, continue to exceed expectations. Cerrejón
has now embarked on the expansion of the operation from the
current 22 million to 28 million tonnes per annum. Carbones del
Guasare in Venezuela was negatively affected by the national strike
at the beginning of the year and subsequently by problems in 
the administration of the exchange controls imposed at that time. 
Outlook
Export coal prices have been rising in recent months and the upward
trend is supported on the forward curves. Average coal prices in
2004 are expected to be significantly better than those in 2003. 
The rand/dollar rate remains volatile and difficult to predict, while
in Australia, exchange rate pressure is expected to continue.

Headline earnings were $206 million compared with $69 million 
in 2002. Operating profit before exceptional items amounted to
$286 million (2002: $133 million), but exceptional charges increased
with the decision to write down the carrying value of Hudson Bay
to the amount of the investment in the recently completed 777
project. As a result, operating profit after exceptionals amounted 
to $78 million, against $82 million in 2002. 
Markets
The average copper price increased from 70.6 US cents/lb in 
2002 to 80.7 US cents/lb in 2003. Average nickel prices increased 
from 307 US cents/lb to 437 US cents/lb, with prices rising steeply
in the second half. Average zinc prices remained roughly flat at 
37.6 US cents/lb (2002: 35.3 US cents/lb). Commodity price rises
were offset by the weakness of the US dollar against the local
currencies of many of the business unit’s operations, in particular 
the rand, Canadian dollar and euro.
Operating performance
During 2003, further progress was made in restructuring and
upgrading the Base Metals asset portfolio. The integration of
Minera Sur Andes (formerly Disputada) into Anglo Chile has been
successfully completed and synergies and cost savings amounting
to $17 million per annum were achieved by year end. Base Metals’
interests in Bindura Nickel and Anaconda Nickel were disposed of
during the year, while the third party debt of Lisheen was acquired 
at a rate of 50 US cents in the dollar and the remaining equity 
was purchased for $1.8 million. Lisheen is now a 100% owned, 
debt free, subsidiary.
The copper operations generated an operating profit before
exceptional charges of $269 million (2002: $110 million). Minera 
Sur Andes made a first full year contribution of $128 million.
Attributable production of copper amounted to 708,800 tonnes,
compared with 497,700 tonnes in 2002, with Minera Sur Andes
contributing 278,300 tonnes. Production at Los Bronces (207,800
tonnes) was slightly below forecast due to a lack of flexibility in the
open pit. Both El Soldado (70,500 tonnes) and the Chagres smelter
(160,100 tonnes) exceeded forecast. Mantoverde had a record 
year, producing 60,200 tonnes of cathode, while at Mantos Blancos
production declined by 10% to 86,900 tonnes as a result of a tear 
in the dump leach pad and rescheduling of sulphide ore production.
At Collahuasi, cathode production rose 5% to a new record, but
overall attributable production fell from 190,800 to 173,700 tonnes
owing to the anticipated decline in Ujina ore grades ahead of the
relocation of mining to Rosario.
Cash operating costs remained broadly unchanged owing to a
combination of good cost control and favourable treatment and
refining charges. As part of the Minera Sur Andes integration, the
combined headcount at Anglo Chile operations was reduced by 
10% year on year, resulting in an 18% productivity improvement. 
Cash costs at Los Bronces, El Soldado and Chagres were all lower
than forecast at the time of the acquisition of Minera Sur Andes. 
At Collahuasi the effect of higher acid prices and consumption, 
lower grades and higher freight costs was largely offset by lower
treatment and refining costs. 
The $654 million Rosario Project at Collahuasi, which will increase
sulphide mill throughput from 60,000 to 110,000 tonnes of ore 
per day, remains on budget and on schedule to enter production 
in mid-2004. 
The nickel, niobium and mineral sands division generated an operating
profit of $106 million (2002: $94 million). Attributable production 
of nickel totalled 24,900 tonnes (2002: 25,600 tonnes). Codemin
increased production by 7%, primarily due to the cessation of power
rationing in 2002. Loma de Níquel successfully ramped up to design
capacity, with output for the year rising to 17,200 tonnes, despite 
the challenging political and economic environment in Venezuela. 11 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial review
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
Cash costs at Codemin rose by 13% in 2003 owing to the
replacement of the existing favourable electricity supply contract
with a new long term contract on market terms. At Loma de Níquel,
costs were negatively affected by the strong bolivar but this was
offset by increased production volume.
At Catalão, market conditions remained soft and production and 
sales were maintained at 2002 levels. Costs were well controlled,
but weaker prices resulted in a 14% reduction in operating profits
to $20 million.
At Namakwa, slag prices remained under pressure, whilst other
product prices held up reasonably well. An initial period of poor
furnace output and low Minerals Separation Plant (MSP) efficiencies
in the first six months was followed by an electrical fire at the MSP
in October that halted production at the plant. Production of zircon
and rutile products re-commenced in December but will not reach 
full capacity until permanent repairs are completed in mid-2004. 
As a result, zircon and rutile production were down 17% and 22%,
respectively. These production problems, combined with the
strengthening of the rand, resulted in operating profits reducing 
to $3 million from $38 million. 
The $67 million Codemin Expansion project, which involves the
treatment of higher-grade Barro Alto ore through the existing
Codemin facilities, was approved in November 2003. The project 
is scheduled for commissioning and ramp-up in early 2005 and 
will result in an increase in nickel production to over 10,000 tonnes
per year and a significant reduction in unit costs.
All zinc operations faced a combination of depressed prices 
and a material appreciation of local currencies against the dollar. 
In consequence, the zinc division made an operating loss of
$62 million (before exceptional charges of $208 million) in
comparison with a 2002 operating loss of $51 million (before
exceptional charges of $76 million). 
Lisheen was accounted for on a 100% basis for the first time, while
Skorpion entered production during the year. As a result, attributable
zinc production rose from 211,500 tonnes to 360,500 tonnes.
Lisheen operated above design capacity and achieved record zinc
output of 169,300 tonnes on the back of improved recoveries. At
Hudson Bay, zinc production rose 9% to a record 117,900 tonnes,
while copper production was virtually unchanged. A 10% reduction
in the workforce was completed during the fourth quarter. At Black
Mountain, zinc and lead production reduced by 6% and 12%, to
25,900 tonnes and 39,600 tonnes, respectively, due to lower grades
in the Broken Hill mine prior to the transition to the Deeps orebody.
The $454 million Skorpion mine, which entered production in May
and produced 47,400 tonnes during the year, is close to completion.
Operating costs were capitalised throughout the year and the mine
remains within budget and on target to achieve design throughput 
by the end of 2004.
Cash costs at Hudson Bay and Black Mountain rose by 7% and 
2%, respectively, whilst those at Lisheen remained flat. All three
operations were severely impacted by currency appreciation 
relative to the dollar, but Lisheen managed to offset this through
cost-saving initiatives and volume increases. The Hudson Bay 
costs included a one off charge in respect of the downsizing of 
the workforce. At Hudson Bay, the $276 million 777 project was
completed ahead of schedule and within budget, allowing the 
closure of the older and more costly Callinan shaft at the end of
2003. The $110 million Black Mountain Deeps project remains 
on budget and is scheduled to deliver first ore in late 2004.
Outlook
The weight of evidence from business and consumer surveys, leading
indicators and, increasingly, macro-economic data, suggests robust
global growth in 2004, with the USA and Asia expected to provide
most impetus, while the EU continues to lag. However, Chinese
demand will have to remain very firm, and OECD demand improve
markedly, in order to sustain prices at the levels reached in late
2003 and early 2004. It is possible that the inflow of fund money
that has driven base metals prices higher in anticipation of the global
economic recovery may partially reverse, leading to volatility and
some retracement of prices from current levels. Nevertheless, the
outlook for base metals is more encouraging than at any time in the
past five years.

Markets
In the UK, markets were disappointing. The private sector was
subdued and the government’s infrastructure programme lagged
behind its plan. Market conditions generally were challenging but
were more than offset by the benefits of Tarmac’s ongoing business
improvement and cost reduction programme. The core aggregates
businesses all improved their profitability, although some of the
downstream operations could not fully pass on cost increases in 
the competitive environment. 
In continental Europe, operating profit climbed by 56%. This
performance reflected continuing strong market conditions in Spain,
particularly in Madrid, and a full year contribution from the Mavike
business acquired in 2002. France suffered weak market conditions,
while the businesses in eastern Europe moved forward satisfactorily,
reflecting productivity improvements in businesses acquired in 
prior years.
The operating profit of the Middle Eastern operations increased
strongly owing to a buoyant market, while the Far East business also
had a better year with higher margins. Copebrás had an excellent
year. Operating profit increased by 46% arising from continued
strong demand for phosphate based fertilizers in Brazil and higher
prices. Raw material prices increased, however, and demand
for sodium tripolyphosphate was adversely affected by weakness 
in the Brazilian economy. The new plant at Goiás was completed
in February 2003, $19 million under the budget of $147 million
and is now operating at full capacity. 12 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial review
FINANCIAL REVIEW

Operating performance
The Tarmac group was the principal contributor to the increase 
in operating profit, achieving an operating profit of $290 million, 
a rise of 14%. This was due to the improved performance of the
business, the full year benefit of acquisitions made in 2002 and 
the strength of European currencies against the dollar. Copebrás 
also contributed to the increase, the new plant at Goiás allowing 
it to benefit more fully from the buoyant Brazilian market conditions
for phosphate fertilizers.
During the year, Tarmac made ten acquisitions for a total
consideration of $100 million. In the UK, these included Baxter
Asphalt, an independent producer of asphalt in Lancashire, and 
Huw Howatson, a road-surfacing contractor in North Wales. In
France, Tarmac’s aggregates business was strengthened by the
acquisition of Jalicot in the Auvergne region and in Spain the
acquisition of La Chanta quarry near Madrid has given Steetley Iberia 
a valuable source of aggregates at a time when reserves in the area 
are declining. Tarmac Central Europe has recently completed the
acquisition of Bilfinger Berger Baustoffe, an aggregates producer 
in the Czech Republic and Germany. As a result, Tarmac is 
now the largest aggregates producer in the Czech Republic and 
is well placed to benefit from the country’s forthcoming entry 
into the EU.
Tarmac continued to develop in a manner calculated to better serve
customer needs and gain exposure to growing markets. In the UK,
the cement business at Buxton had a satisfactory year. The new
plant is scheduled to commence operation in the second quarter
of 2004. The total project cost is expected to be below the budget 
of $173 million. Three dry silo mortar plants were constructed,
underpinning Tarmac’s leadership position in the mortar market by
offering dry silo in addition to traditional factory-mix mortar. The new
decorative paving plant in Yorkshire has commenced operation and
will enhance Tarmac’s ability to supply this strong growth market.
In China, Tarmac is developing a quarry 140 km from Shanghai. 
The quarry is the closest reserve to the city of top quality asphalting
aggregates. Tarmac has for some time operated in the asphalt 
market in Shanghai, China’s commercial capital and a city of
extraordinary growth and this quarry will be the first major test 
of whether it can develop its business significantly to benefit from
China’s undoubted growth prospects.
Outlook
Market conditions in the UK at the start of 2004 are extremely
competitive. Tarmac’s outlook will be underpinned by continuing 
cost reductions and productivity improvements. The challenge will 
be to improve margins in a highly competitive market while at least
maintaining market share. Initiatives to improve customer service
form an important part of this strategy. In addition, value-adding
acquisitions around the core product areas will continue to be sought.
In continental Europe, difficult trading conditions are expected to
continue in Germany. However, in Poland and the Czech Republic,
the prospect of EU entry is expected to lead to an improvement 
in demand. In Spain, while the Madrid operations may see weaker
demand from the residential sector, public sector investment is
expected to continue. In addition, the business is expected to benefit
from the shortage of aggregates in the Madrid area. In contrast,
France may see some further weakening.
The prospects for further growth in the fertilizer market in Brazil
remain encouraging. The new plant at Goiás, which is in the
country’s interior and away from the threat of imports, gives
Copebrás a strong position in this market.

Headline earnings for 2003 were $368 million, a 2% decrease on
2002. The decrease in headline earnings reflected the re-gearing of
Mondi South Africa’s balance sheet. Operating profit of $656 million
was marginally higher, the positive impact of a full year’s earnings
contribution from acquisitions having been offset by weaker global
trading conditions. 
Operating performance
For Mondi Europe, 2003 was a year of consolidation. Operating 
profit increased by 9% to $471 million, in spite of weaker market
conditions in both the packaging and office communications sectors.
The contribution of full year earnings from businesses acquired in
2002, combined with incremental cost savings from process
efficiencies and integration synergies and additional production
capacity, contributed to the improved results. Reported profits 
also enjoyed a conversion benefit into dollars due to the strength 
of the euro.
In Slovakia, the $233 million expansion at the Ruzomberok pulp and
paper mill, covering the rebuild of PM18 and the modernisation of
the pulp mill, proceeded according to schedule, with paper production
commencing in October. Total annual output will be increased 
by 100,000 tonnes of paper in 2004 and 105,000 tonnes of pulp
by 2005.
The Russian pulp and paper group Syktyvkar and the La Rochette
corrugated packaging plants in France and the UK have been fully
integrated with the rest of the group and each made a positive 
full year’s contribution to the results in 2003.
Despite weak market conditions for most of the year, the packaging
business reported improved earnings in 2003. Further cost savings,
business and product rationalisations and the benefit of the currency
gains supported improved results. Strong volume growth was
achieved early in the year. However, weak economic conditions 
led to some idling of capacity in the latter half of the year.
In the uncoated woodfree papers sector, weak consumer demand
dominated the market with stronger pulp prices squeezing margins.
Further cost savings and efficiency gains helped to partially
compensate for market conditions.  13 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial review
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
In December, the group announced two further strategic acquisitions.
Mondi Packaging Europe acquired 100% of the Bauernfeind corrugated
paper and packaging business, including a combination of waste-based
corrugated paper and converting assets in Germany, Belgium, Austria,
Poland, Italy, Switzerland and China, thereby achieving a further step
towards the strategy of attaining critical mass in European markets.
Frantschach acquired, subject to competition approval, the sack
business of Mexican paper and packaging group Copamex, the largest
industrial sack producer in Mexico and the seventh largest sack
producer worldwide, providing the opportunity to expand the group’s
presence in the North American market. As these acquisitions were
not fully completed in 2003, they were not included in the 2003
results, though they are expected to be earnings-enhancing with
effect from early 2004.
In South Africa, operating profits reduced by 14% to $185 million.
This represented a very satisfactory achievement under difficult
external trading conditions. 
The weaker dollar and stronger rand resulted in increasing pressure
on domestic prices during the year and lower export margins.
However, improved operating efficiencies and higher outputs, as well
as marketing and service initiatives to sustain market share and grow
volumes, compensated for much of the negative impact of prices. 
All production units for woodchips, pulp and paper performed well
during the year, with higher operating efficiencies contributing to an
improved financial performance. Sales of corrugated packaging and
office papers held up well, despite tough trading conditions. 
Construction of the Richards Bay mill modernisation and expansion 
is progressing well, with the first phase of commissioning due for
March 2004 and completion in April 2005. Approval was received
to proceed with the conversion and upgrade of the PM1 machine
at the Merebank mill, with the plan to produce 250,000 tonnes 
per year of uncoated woodfree papers from late 2005. 
In the first significant South African paper and packaging industry
empowerment transaction, Mondi South Africa agreed to dispose
of 42% of its integrated pine forestry and newsprint business to
MCI Resources, in a transaction which values the entire business 
at $170 million. A further 8% share in this business has been
earmarked for broader-based empowerment. In two additional
smaller empowerment transactions, new partners have acquired
meaningful interests in Mondi’s hardwood sawmilling and mining
timber businesses.
Outlook
Looking forward, the Mondi group will continue to focus on 
operating efficiencies, capitalising on recent expansions and
extracting synergistic benefits from the integration of recent
acquisitions. General economic conditions are expected to remain
weak, with the dollar’s current low levels, and a buoyant euro,
creating difficult trading conditions with margins flat at best.

Headline earnings for Ferrous Metals & Industries were $107 million,
a 15% decrease on 2002. Operating profit was $56 million lower 
at $208 million. The decrease was largely due to a sharp reduction 
in earnings from Tongaat-Hulett in a reporting period that was
characterised by a strong South African rand. 
Operating performance
In December 2003, the business realised its strategic objective of
securing a meaningful interest in the iron ore sector by acquiring
control of Kumba, the world’s fifth largest iron ore producer. To date,
Anglo American has invested $1.05 billion in acquiring 66.6% of the
company. Kumba has a high quality iron ore portfolio with attractive
growth prospects in South Africa and Australia. Anglo American is
working with Kumba to take advantage of the opportunity presented
by bullish markets for iron ore to expand Kumba’s own production. 
In 2003, Kumba produced 30 million tonnes of iron ore, of which
21 million tonnes were exported, and contributed $33 million to
Ferrous Metals & Industries’ operating profit. 
Owing to the firmer local currency and high interest rates, South
African steel distributors embarked on a stock-reduction campaign
early in 2003. As a result, local despatches were dramatically down
on 2002’s record levels.
Scaw’s operating profit was $70 million, an increase of $19 million,
and included a $21 million full year contribution from the Moly-Cop
forged grinding media business. The stronger rand adversely 
affected export revenues and during the second six months margins
were eroded, as a result of significantly higher raw material costs,
particularly steel scrap. All capital projects were successfully
commissioned towards the end of the year, both on time and within
budget. These comprised a new high-chromium grinding media
production plant, new wire-drawing equipment and a large 
steel-scrap shredder for total capital expenditure of $34 million.
Scaw continues to generate robust cash flows.  14 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial review
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
Highveld’s operating profit decreased significantly by $27 million to
$11 million. Earnings would have been almost at a break-even level
but for the release of $8 million of post-retirement medical aid and
other provisions. Dollar export prices in 2003 improved but were 
more than offset by the negative impacts of the firmer rand as well 
as by a poor operating performance. Demand for vanadium was 
well supported during the year. Nevertheless, for most of the 
period, dollar prices for ferro-vanadium drifted in a range that was
unprofitable at the exchange rate and prevailing rand costs.
Ferrous Metals & Industries’ 40% share of Samancor’s operating
profit was $41 million, $7 million lower than in 2002. The chrome
division’s operating profit improved against the previous year. 
This was mainly due to higher selling prices and volumes following
increased demand from the stainless steel industry and the depletion
of the ferrochrome stock overhang that existed during 2002. 
The benchmark ferrochrome price rose from 34 US cents/lb to 
50 US cents/lb during the period under review. The benefit of higher
export prices was eroded, however, by the robustness of the rand,
whilst higher winter electricity tariffs and maintenance charges
further impacted earnings. The manganese division’s operating profit
decreased as a result of the effect of the firmer rand and Australian
dollar, despite increased ore sales volumes and higher alloy sales
prices. Ore sales benefited from increased Chinese demand. Alloy
sales prices increased by 10% following shortages in the market.
Boart Longyear’s operating profit was $33 million against $31 million
in 2002. Increased worldwide mineral exploration activity benefited
drilling services in the Americas and Asia/Pacific Rim region, as well
as the Coring Tools & Equipment business. Profitability declined 
in Europe because of the generally weak economy, combined with
restructuring costs. The buoyant rand adversely affected the 
South African operations. 
Tongaat-Hulett’s operating profit fell to $10 million from $96 million
in 2002. The sugar division’s profitability declined in the wake of lower
world sugar prices and reduced production in South Africa following
low rainfall. The aluminium division achieved a 40% increase in export
volumes of rolled products in spite of a subdued international market.
Profitability was, however, severely impacted by the rand’s strength 
as well as low international prices. The starch and glucose division 
was impacted by substantially higher maize input costs coupled with
significant product pricing pressures from its customers.
In the United States, Terra generated an attributable operating profit
of $14 million against an operating loss of $3 million in 2002. The
improvement arose from stronger second half earnings from Terra’s
nitrogen fertilizer products. Prices increased by approximately 50%
owing to reduced global inventories as well as higher shipping costs
on imported products. These price increases were partially offset 
by higher US natural gas costs. Headline earnings were boosted 
by an attributable $12 million tax benefit arising primarily from the
favourable settlement of prior year tax assessments. 
In line with the strategy of selling non-core assets, the remaining
shareholding in Li & Fung was sold for $269 million, resulting in 
an exceptional gain of $163 million. This has been an outstanding
investment for Anglo American. The Group’s original $5 million
investment for a 15.7% effective interest in Li & Fung has been 
sold over the past three years for a total cash consideration 
of $604 million.
In November 2003, Anglo American Farms sold the Boschendal wine
estate to a consortium of investors, including a 30% black economic
empowerment stake, for $48 million.
Outlook
The outlook for 2004 is a cautiously optimistic one, with the
possibility of higher ferrous metal prices. Scaw and Highveld will
benefit from an improved domestic market resulting from higher
commodity prices, low interest rates and a number of large capital
projects currently under consideration. Boart Longyear should
continue to benefit from an increase in worldwide mineral exploration
activity as a result of stronger metal prices. Tongaat-Hulett’s
profitability should be restored on the back of increasing aluminium
volumes and more stable maize procurement costs. Terra’s prospects
have improved with the recent strengthening of its nitrogen fertilizer
product prices. 
Ferrous Metals & Industries continues to focus on reorganising
its portfolio to improve shareholder returns.
EXPLORATION
In 2003, total Group cash expenditure on exploration was
$105 million, including $50 million spent by Base Metals, $11 million
by Anglo Platinum and $36 million by AngloGold.
Base Metals’ exploration efforts focused on brownfields exploration
around operations and high quality greenfield targets.
Drilling adjacent to the Chilean copper operations intersected
several potential new resources. Copper was also targeted in Brazil,
Mexico, Peru, Philippines and Sweden. A nickel sulphide programme
in northern Canada had early success, with nickel-copper-platinum
group elements drill intersections at West Raglan in northern
Quebec. Zinc exploration continued in India and Australia and around
the Black Mountain, Hudson Bay, Lisheen and Skorpion operations.
Anglo Platinum’s exploration effort in South Africa was directly linked
to its commitment to increase production. Internationally, Anglo
Platinum’s partners have progressed several programmes in Canada
and Russia.
AngloGold’s exploration was focused around operations in Argentina,
Australia, Brazil, Tanzania, Mali, Namibia, South Africa and the USA.
In addition, exploration was pursued in highly prospective areas in
Canada and Peru.
TREASURY MANAGEMENT AND HEDGING POLICY
The principal financial risks arising from the Group’s activities are
commodity price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, counterparty
risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s principal treasury policies are set by the board. 
The Group treasury acts as a service centre and operates within
clearly defined guidelines approved by the board. Anglo American 
uses a number of derivative instruments to hedge these financial 
risk exposures. The Anglo American accounting department provides
an independent control function to monitor and report on treasury
activities, which are also subject to regular review by internal and
external audit. 
The treasury of the Group’s associate, De Beers, is independently
managed as are those of the non wholly-owned subsidiaries such
as AngloGold, Anglo Platinum and Frantschach. 15 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial review
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
Commodity risk
Anglo American is exposed to movements in the price of precious
metals, base metals and other commodity products. Strategic hedging
of the price risk is undertaken from time to time and derivatives are
used to optimise the value of Anglo American’s production of these
commodities. Gold hedging is independently managed by AngloGold.
Currency risk
The Group publishes its financial statements in US dollars and 
a substantial proportion of the Group’s sales are denominated in
dollars. As a result, a large component of the Group’s net debt is
denominated in dollars. However, the Group conducts business in
many currencies and, as a result, it is subject to currency risks owing
to exchange rate movements which will affect the Group’s costs and
the translation of the profits of subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates whose functional currency is not the US dollar. 
Anglo American retains a significant proportion of its assets within
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates located in countries,
principally South Africa, where the local currency is treated 
as the functional currency and is used for reporting purposes. 
In the consolidated financial statements the exchange differences
arising on the translation of net assets of these non-dollar
denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates less any
offsetting exchange differences on foreign currency financing of
these assets, are dealt with in reserves in accordance with SSAP 20
‘Foreign currency translation’. Accordingly, the currency translation
differences of $3,282 million recorded in note 25 have been reported
through the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and
losses on page 45 and appear as an increase in shareholders’ funds.
These differences do not affect the consolidated profit and loss
account or the consolidated cash flow statement.
The currency translation differences which have arisen are mainly
attributable to the appreciation of the South African rand against
the US dollar since 1 January 2003, although the appreciation 
of the Australian dollar, euro and sterling against the dollar have 
also contributed.
The non-dollar denominated businesses actually derive the majority
of their revenues in dollars, whilst the majority of their costs
continue to be incurred in their local currency. To this extent, the
currency appreciation does not impact on the real underlying value 
of the non-dollar denominated assets within these businesses.
Furthermore, the cash generating ability of these assets is not
affected by the currency adjustments described herein.
If the rand and other currencies appreciate or depreciate against the
dollar in future reporting periods, currency translation differences 
will continue to appear as an increase or a reduction in shareholders’
funds, respectively. However, to the extent that the non-dollar
denominated assets continue to derive their revenues in dollars,
these potential exchange differences are not expected to impact 
the profitability of the Group or to affect the ability of the Company
to pay future dividends.

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, in particular to changes
in dollar, rand, sterling and euro interest rates. Corporate policy is 
to maintain a high proportion of floating rate debt, although strategic
hedging using fixed rate debt may be undertaken from time to time 
if considered appropriate. At 31 December 2003, the Group had 
fixed rate debt of $2,455 million, representing 28.4% of net debt
(2002: 29.3%). The policy is to invest cash at floating rates 
of interest and cash reserves are maintained in relatively short term
investments in order to maintain liquidity whilst achieving a
satisfactory return for shareholders.
Counterparty risk
Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk
on the amounts due from counterparties. The Group controls and
monitors the distribution of these exposures against approved limits
to minimise the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by a
counterparty. The limits involved relate to minimum credit ratings,
exposure limits and shareholders’ equity. The possibility of material
loss arising in the event of non-performance by a counterparty is
considered unlikely.
Liquidity risk and financing
The Group is assigned short term ratings of P-2 and A-2, and 
long term ratings of A3 (stable outlook) and A- (negative outlook)
from Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s respectively. 
The following financing activities were undertaken during 2003:
–In May 2003, Anglo American Capital, a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Anglo American plc, issued a —1,000 million five year bond
(guaranteed by Anglo American plc). The inaugural Eurobond was
issued under a $2,000 million Euro Medium Term Note programme
established in March 2003.
– In September 2003, under the same programme, Anglo American
Capital issued a £300 million seven year bond (guaranteed by
Anglo American plc).
– Anglo American Capital has also issued a number of bonds
(guaranteed by Anglo American plc) as a result of reverse
enquiries under the programme.
The issues were used to refinance bank debt and were all swapped
to floating rate US dollars. 16 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial review
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
In addition to its capital market activities, Anglo American borrows
using short term variable rate instruments such as commercial paper, 
bills and money market lines, as well as using committed medium 
and short term bank facilities. Anglo American maintains committed
facilities as back up to its $1.3 billion commercial paper programme.
The $2.25 billion revolving credit facility has a $1,125 million 364
day tranche expiring November 2004 and a $1,125 million five year
tranche expiring November 2006. A further $950 million facility
expires February 2006. 
Non wholly-owned subsidiaries in general will arrange and maintain
their own financing and funding requirements. In most cases the
financing will be non-recourse to Anglo American. In addition, certain
projects are financed by means of limited recourse project finance, 
if appropriate. 
It is believed that the Group’s net cash flow from operations, its
holdings of cash and cash equivalents and access to credit facilities 
will be sufficient to cover the likely short and long term cash
requirements of the Group. At the end of 2003, net debt was
$8,633 million, being gross debt of $10,759 million offset by
$2,126 million of cash and current asset investments. At 31 December
2003, the Group had available undrawn, committed borrowing facilities
totalling $5,021 million. The maturity profile for the Group’s available
undrawn, committed borrowing facilities is as follows:

OTHER RISK FACTORS
The risk factors set out below are further uncertainties that the
Group considers could cause the Group’s actual results to differ
materially from expected and historical results.
Economic and political risks
The Group is geographically diverse and encounters different legal and
regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions. Businesses may be
affected by any political, economic or regulatory developments in any
of the countries in which it operates, including risks such as restrictions
on the export of currency or expropriation of assets. The Group has 
no control over changes in local inflation rates or market interest rates.
Acquisitions
The Group has undertaken a number of acquisitions in the past. With
these, as with any such future transaction, there is the risk that any
benefits or synergies identified at acquisition may not be achieved.
Rigorous guidelines are applied to the evaluation and execution of 
all acquisitions, which require approval of the Investment Committee.
Health, Safety and Environment
The Group is subject to numerous health, safety and environmental
laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Any changes in laws, regulations or community expectations can
result in increased compliance and remediation costs. The severity 
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is a significant 
threat to economic growth and development. Providing access to
treatment in developing countries has become a humanitarian as 
well as an economic and social imperative. In August 2002, the
Group announced that it would provide anti-retroviral therapy (ART)
to employees with HIV/AIDS.
Natural risks
The Group’s operations can be exposed to natural risks such as flood,
weather or difficult geological conditions. Appropriate insurance can
provide protection from some, but not all, of the costs that may arise
from unforeseen events.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group financial statements are prepared in accordance with UK
GAAP. The Group’s accounting policies are described on pages 46 
to 48 of the financial statements. The application of certain of 
these policies requires assumptions or judgements by management.
Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using 
these assumptions and judgements. Management believes that 
the following are the critical policies where the assumptions 
and judgements made could have a significant impact on the
consolidated financial statements.
Pensions and post-retirement benefits
The expected costs of providing post-retirement benefits under
defined benefit arrangements are charged against profits to spread
the expected costs on a straight-line basis over the service lives of
the employees entitled to those benefits. Assumptions in respect of
the expected costs are set after consultation with qualified actuaries.
Whilst management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, 
a change in the assumptions used would impact the earnings 
of the Group.
Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
Provision is made, based on net present values, for restoration,
rehabilitation or environmental costs as soon as the obligation 
arises. Costs incurred at the start of each project are capitalised and
charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the project
through depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount
on the provision. Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage 
are provided at net present value and charged against profits 
as extraction progresses. Management uses its judgement and
experience to provide for and amortise these estimated costs. 17 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial review
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
Mining reserves
The Group’s mining properties are depreciated over the life of the
mine using the unit of production method based on proven and
probable reserves. When determining reserves, assumptions
that were valid at the time of estimation may change when new
information becomes available. Any changes could affect
depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
Exceptional items
Operating exceptional items are those that management considers, 
by virtue of their size or incidence, should be disclosed separately 
to ensure that headline earnings reflect the underlying performance
of the business. The determination as to which items should 
be disclosed separately does require a degree of judgement.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
The Council of the European Union announced in June 2002 that
listed companies in Europe would adopt International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) for accounting periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2005. The adoption of IFRS will be first reflected 
in the Group’s financial statements for the half year ending 
30 June 2005 and the year ending 31 December 2005.
In accordance with the Committee of European Securities Regulators
(CESR) Guideline, we set out below how we are managing the
convergence to IFRS and give a qualitative assessment of the impact
of IFRS on financial reporting.
The Group has established a global project team to manage the
convergence to IFRS. The scope of this project necessarily includes: 
– An initial assessment of the impact from the conversion 
to IFRS on the Group’s reported financial results;
–A continued assessment of the impact from proposed future
developments to international accounting standards; 
– Identification of required changes to the Group’s existing
accounting systems and procedures;
–Targeted training and education of all appropriate employees 
within our businesses; and
– The timely communication to internal and external stakeholders, 
of areas subject to significant change.
The accounting standards to be applied in the Group’s first full IFRS
financial statements may differ from those IFRS currently in effect.
As such, our assessment of those areas of our financial statements
that are likely to be impacted may change as a result of these new
accounting developments. Some of the principal policy and disclosure
changes required by all listed companies reporting under IFRS are set
out below.
Business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill
The more significant policy changes resulting from the transition 
to IFRS include:
– Replacement of goodwill amortisation with an annual 
impairment test;
–Treatment of goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisition of foreign operations, as assets and liabilities of 
the acquiree, to be retranslated on consolidation in accordance
with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 21 (revised);
–A broader definition of ‘intangible assets’ to be recognised
at acquisition;
– Reclassification of minority interests from liabilities to equity. 
Financial instruments
The adoption of IAS 32 and 39 (revised) will require all derivatives 
to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value. Subsequent
changes in fair values are either taken to equity, if the criteria for
hedge accounting are met, or to the income statement. Previously,
derivatives qualifying as hedges in accordance with UK GAAP have
been held off balance sheet and the fair value disclosed within a 
note to the financial statements. Any derivatives embedded within
the terms of contractual commitments that are not considered 
closely related to the underlying host contract will also be separately
identified and fair valued.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is to be recognised at acquisition as part of the fair
value exercise and will be provided on some balances previously
excluded from provision under UK rules such as revaluations and 
fair value adjustments. 
Employee benefit schemes: Post-retirement and share 
option remuneration
IAS 19 requires companies to recognise the full deficit (or surplus) 
of defined benefit pension schemes on the balance sheet, but
permits a choice whereby companies can choose to either defer
actuarial gains or losses within a defined range (the corridor
approach) or, as expected in any revised IAS, can recognise all
actuarial gains or losses directly through equity.
Under IFRS, options granted by the Group to employees, for example
under Employee Share Option Schemes and Save As You Earn
Schemes, are to be fair valued at grant date using an option pricing
model and charged through the income statement over the vesting
period of the options.
Presentation and disclosure of financial information
The transition to an international accounting framework will give 
rise to an increase in certain disclosures to the financial statements.
There will also be some presentational changes. Non-operating
exceptional items previously disclosed below operating profit under
UK GAAP will, under IFRS, be recorded within operating activities.
Additionally, the existing international accounting framework 
has no direct equivalent of the UK GAAP performance statement
‘statement of total recognised gains and losses’. Financial statements
will disclose a detailed reconciliation of reserve movements for the
current year, with comparatives. 18 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Directors’ report
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The directors have pleasure in submitting the statutory financial
statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2003.

contained in this Annual Report. These include information on all the
individual business sectors of the Group, its joint ventures and its
associates, their performance and current and future developments. 
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW 
Anglo American, with its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates,
is a global leader in the mining and natural resource sectors. It has

diamonds, coal, base metals, industrial minerals, paper and packaging
and ferrous metals as well as financial and technical strength.
The Group’s business is a going concern as interpreted by the
Guidance on Going Concern and Financial Reporting for directors 
of listed companies registered in the United Kingdom, published in
November 1994. The net book value of the Group’s tangible fixed
assets is $24,379 million.
DIVIDENDS
An interim dividend of 15 US cents per ordinary share was paid on
15 September 2003. The directors recommend a final dividend of 
39 US cents per ordinary share. This will make a total for the year
to 31 December 2003 of 54 US cents per ordinary share. Subject
to the approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting to be
held on Wednesday, 21 April 2004, the final dividend will be payable
on Thursday, 29 April 2004 to shareholders registered in the books
of the Company at the close of business on Friday, 12 March 2004.
On 26 August 1999, Greenwood Nominees Limited, as nominee 
for Butterfield Trust (Guernsey) Limited, the trustee for the Anglo
American employee share schemes, waived its right to all dividends
(except for 1 pence), payable by the Company. The amount waived
during the year, in respect of the interim dividend, was $8,510,693.
AUTHORISED SHARE CAPITAL
During the year there was no change to the authorised share capital
of the Company of $1,000,000,000 divided into 2,000,000 ordinary
shares of $0.50 each and £50,000 preference shares of £1 each.
ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL
During the year a total of 7,133,375 ordinary shares were allotted 
in respect of employee share schemes. The undermentioned shares

of $0.50 each. There was no change during the year to the issued
preference share capital of the Company of 50,000 5% cumulative
preference shares of £1 each. As at 24 February 2004, the 
issued ordinary share capital of the company was 1,482,674,513
ordinary shares.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
The ‘Report to Society 2003’ will be available from the Company 
in April. This report focuses on the safety, health and environmental
performance of the Company’s managed operations, their
performance with regard to the Company’s ‘Good Citizenship’
principles and the operational dimensions of their social programmes.
PA YMENT OF SUPPLIERS
Anglo American plc is a holding company and, as such, had no 
trade creditors at the year end.
Businesses across the Group are responsible for agreeing the terms
and conditions, including payment terms, under which business
transactions with their suppliers are conducted. These terms reflect
local and industry norms. The Group values its suppliers and recognises
the benefits to be derived from maintaining good relationships with
them. Anglo American acknowledges the importance of paying
invoices, especially those of small businesses, promptly.
POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS 
As disclosed in note 38 to the financial statements, following the
announcement on 10 December 2003 of the acquisition of the
corrugated paper and packaging business of Roman Bauernfeind
Holding AG, the directors allotted 5,309,286 ordinary shares of 
$0.50 each on 12 February 2004 in consideration of the acquisition.
The shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and application
has been made to list them on the Johannesburg, Swiss, Namibia 
and Botswana stock exchanges. The shares rank pari passu with 
the other ordinary shares in issue.
On 9 February 2004, an agreement was entered into to sell the
Group’s 25% interest in the Nkomati Nickel joint venture to Anglovaal
Mining Limited for a cash consideration of R260 million ($37 million).
VALUE OF LAND
Land is mainly carried in the financial statements at cost. 
It is not practicable to estimate the market value of land and mineral
rights, since these depend on product prices over the next 20 years
or longer, which will vary with market conditions.
EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER POLICIES
The Anglo American Group, which operates throughout the 
world, is managed along decentralised lines. Each key operating
business is empowered to manage within the context of its own
industry, and the different legislative and social demands of the
diverse countries in which those businesses operate, subject to 
the standards embodied in Anglo American’s Good Citizenship: 
Our Business Principles.
Within all Anglo American’s businesses, the safe and effective
performance of all employees, and the maintenance of positive
employee relationships are of fundamental importance. Managers 
of Anglo American’s businesses are charged with ensuring that 
the following key principles are upheld:
– adherence to national legal standards on employment and
workplace rights at all times;
– adoption of fair labour practices;
– prohibition of child labour;
–prohibition of inhumane treatment of employees and any form 
of forced labour, physical punishment or other abuse;
– continual promotion of safe and healthy working practices;
– promotion of workplace equality and elimination of all forms 
of unfair discrimination;
– provision of opportunities for employees to enhance their 
work-related skills and capabilities;
– recognition of the right of our employees to freedom of
association; and
– adoption of fair and appropriate procedures for determining 
terms and conditions of employment.
Copies of the Good Citizenship: Our Business Principles booklet
which sets out standards of conduct on a range of ethical, human
rights and social policy issues are available from the registered
office of the Company and may be accessed on the Company’s
website – www.angloamerican.co.uk
During 2003, numerous employee communication and education
workshops took place. The aim, which included areas as diverse 
as ‘Talent Management’, ‘Sustainable Development’ and ‘Group
Strategy’, was to provide employees with information on matters 
of concern to them, to regularly consult employees for views on
matters affecting them and to make employees aware of financial
and economic factors affecting the performance of the Company.
In addition, presentations by operating divisions took place and the
results of a survey of employee communication were presented.
The Company regularly publishes Optima and AngloWorld which
contain items of news, current affairs and information relevant 
to Group employees. A news clipping service is published on the
Company’s intranet, keeping employees up to date with developments
in those business sectors in which the Group is active.
DONATIONS
During the year Anglo American and its subsidiaries made donations
for charitable purposes totalling $38.3 million. Of that amount $1.8
million was donated in the United Kingdom, consisting of payments
in respect of community development initiatives – 26%; educational
and youth charities – 24%; international development – 16%; health
and HIV – 9%; arts, culture and heritage – 9% and other charities for
the benefit of the community – 16%. A review of charitable
donations and the contribution by Anglo American companies to local
communities is contained in the Annual Review.
Although it is the policy of Anglo American plc not to give 
party political donations, a policy shared by many multi-national
corporations, the Anglo American plc board has decided that 
it should make an exception at this juncture in South Africa’s
democratic transition.
Following debate during 2003, the board concluded in principle that
its major South African operating company, Anglo Operations Limited
(AOL), could set aside a sum of R6 million for donations to political
parties contesting the 2004 South African general election.
It further asked a sub-committee of the board headed by Sir Mark
Moody-Stuart to consider an appropriate allocation of funds. 20 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Directors’ report
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CONTINUED
The sub-committee recommended that the African National 
Congress as the ruling party enjoying the majority electoral support 
in the country should receive R3 million of the donation; the
Democratic Alliance, as the official opposition and second largest 
party, R1.5 million; the next three largest parties – the Inkatha Freedom
Party, the New National Party and the United Democratic Movement –
R480,000, R240,000 and R120,000 respectively; and R60,000 each
to the other smaller parties with representation in the South African
Parliament. These donations were made in February 2004.
The Anglo American Platinum board has decided to contribute
R1 million to the total of R6 million proposed by AOL.
The Anglo American plc board has reaffirmed the policy of not
making donations to, or incurring expenses for the benefit of, 
any UK political party or any other EU political organisation, as
defined in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.
In December 2003, AngloGold announced its policy on party
political donations. The policy is open to public scrutiny
(www.anglogold.com) and provides that AngloGold shall distribute
the equivalent of up to 10% of the amount transferred to the
AngloGold Fund, its main vehicle for social investment.
In February 2004, the board of Tongaat-Hulett decided to make a
donation of R500,000 in support of the democratic process in South
Africa. The total grant will be divided between the six parties
represented in Parliament in proportion to the number of seats which
they hold.
AUDITORS
On 1 August 2003, Deloitte & Touche, the Company’s auditors,
transferred their business to Deloitte & Touche LLP, a limited liability
partnership incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnerships 
Act 2000. The Company’s consent has been given to treating 
the appointment of Deloitte & Touche as extending to Deloitte & 
Touche LLP with effect from 1 August 2003 under the provisions 
of section 26(5) of the Companies Act 1989.
A resolution to reappoint the auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, will
be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting in accordance
with Section 384 of the Companies Act 1985.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The annual general meeting will be held at 11:00 am on Wednesday,
21 April 2004 at The Conference Centre, Church House, Dean’s
Yard, London SW1P 3NZ. The notice convening the meeting is set
out in the separate booklet enclosed with this report. In addition
to the ordinary business of the meeting (which includes a resolution
to approve the directors’ remuneration report), as special business,
shareholder consent will be sought:
(a) to approve a new Bonus Share Plan for executive directors and
senior employees, details of which are set out in the separate
booklet and referred to in the Remuneration Report on pages 
27 and 28 of the Annual Report; and 
(b) to renew the directors’ existing authorities to:
(i) allot relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal amount
of $246,500,000 (equivalent to 493 million ordinary shares
of $0.50 each). This authority, which the directors have 
no present intention of exercising (other than in relation to
employee share schemes and for the allotment of ordinary
shares to certain non-executive directors by subscription 
of their after-tax directors’ fees) represented 33.3% of the
ordinary issued share capital at 24 February 2004; 
(ii) allot equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal
amount of $31,750,000 (equivalent to 63.5 million ordinary
shares of $0.50 each), being 4.3 % of the ordinary issued share
capital in issue at 24 February 2004; and
(iii) make market purchases of up to a maximum of 148 million
ordinary shares of $0.50 each of the Company at a price not less
than $0.50 and not exceeding 105% of the average middle
market closing price of such shares on the London Stock
Exchange on the five dealing days prior to the date of
repurchase. The directors have no present intention of exercising
this authority and would only do so if they considered it were in
the best interests of shareholders generally and if the purchase
could be expected to result in an increase in earnings per share.
In exercising this authority, the directors may treat the shares
that have been bought back as either cancelled or held in
treasury (or a combination of both), and to the extent that any
such shares are held in treasury, earnings per share will only be
increased or transferred until such time as the shares are re-sold
out of treasury. Treating the bought-back shares as treasury
shares gives the Company the ability to sell or transfer them
quickly and cost-effectively and provides the Company with
additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.
Authorisation is also sought for the Company to use any shares
repurchased and held in treasury for the purposes of its
employee share schemes. If any such shares are used, the
Company will, so long as required under the guidelines of the
Association of British Insurers Investment Committee, count them
towards the limits in the schemes as if they were newly issued
shares. The total number of options to acquire shares
outstanding at 24 February 2004 was 53,889,646 (excluding
ordinary shares which could be issued on conversion of the
3.375% convertible bonds due April 2007), which represents
3.6% of the issued ordinary share capital at that date. If the
Company were to buy back the maximum number of shares
permitted pursuant to this resolution, then the total number 
of options to subscribe for shares outstanding would represent
4% of the reduced issued share capital.
A poll will be held at the annual general meeting on each of the
resolutions set before the meeting.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Anglo American Group is committed to the highest standards 
of business integrity, ethical values and professionalism in all 
its activities. As an essential part of this commitment, the board
supports the highest standards of corporate governance and 
the directors are accountable to the shareholders for doing so. 
The key principles underpinning the governance of the Group are
set out in this statement. 
An effective system of control aimed at managing business risks
is an integral component of the Group’s governance practices, 
details of which are provided in the internal control section below.
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2003 the Company
has been in compliance with the Principles of Good Governance
and Code of Best Practice of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued by the Financial Services Authority in June 1998.
Since its issue in July 2003 the Company has also complied with the
provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Details of the
application of the principles of Section 1 of the Combined Code and
of the previous code are set out below.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The board of directors is responsible to the shareholders for setting
the direction of Anglo American through the establishment of
strategic objectives and key policies. The board meets on a regular
basis, at least six times a year. The board considers issues of
strategic direction, major acquisitions and disposals and approves
major capital expenditure and other matters having a material effect
on Anglo American. Presentations are made to the board by business
management on the activities of operations and both executive and
non-executive directors undertake regular visits to operations and
projects. During 2003 directors visited the Kematen paper mill in
Austria, the Skorpion zinc project in Namibia and the New Denmark
colliery in South Africa.
The composition of the board, with a strong independent element,
ensures that no one individual has unfettered powers of decision 
and authority. The board comprises four executive and eleven 
non-executive directors, eight of whom are independent according 
to the definition contained in the Higgs Report published in January
2003. The independent directors are Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, 
D J Challen, F T M Phaswana, Prof K A L M Van Miert, Dr C E Fay, 
G Lindahl, R J Margetts and Dr M S B Marques (appointed
9 December 2003). The other non-executive directors are
RM Godsell, N F Oppenheimer and Sir David Scholey. The terms 
and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors are
available for inspection upon request during normal business 
hours and at the annual general meeting (AGM) and are referred 
to in the Remuneration Report set out on page 31.
With effect from the 2003 AGM, R J Margetts was appointed 
as the senior independent non-executive director in place of 
Sir David Scholey.
The chairman is responsible for leading the board and for its
effectiveness. He sets the agenda for meetings of the board in
collaboration with the chief executive. The chairman, with the
assistance of the company secretary, ensures that the directors
receive timely, accurate and clear information before board meetings
and updates of issues arising between meetings. The chief executive,
together with the other members of the Executive Committee, 
is responsible for the overall day-to-day management of the Company.
With effect from April 2004, voting at the AGM will be conducted on
a poll rather than by a show of hands. The voting and results of the
poll will be announced to the press and on the Company’s website.
In the year to 31 December 2003 the board met seven times, the
Audit Committee three times, the Remuneration Committee five
times and the Nomination Committee three times. The attendance 
at these meetings was as follows:

Anglo American’s directors have a wide range of expertise as well as
significant experience in financial, commercial and mining activities.
As recommended by the Combined Code, all directors have full
access to internal and external auditors, and are encouraged to stay
fully abreast of the Group’s business through site visits and meetings
with senior management. Training and briefings are available to all
directors on appointment and subsequently, as necessary, taking 
into account existing qualifications and experience.
In 2003, a formal evaluation of the performance of the board and
its committees was carried out, which confirmed that the directors’
contributions remain valid. The results of the evaluation were
discussed at a meeting of the board held in October. The evaluation
process included a review chaired by the senior independent
non-executive director (without the chairman present) of the
performance of the chairman. Areas identified for further discussion
during this process are being monitored on an ongoing basis.
All directors have access to management, including the company
secretary, and to such information as is needed to carry out their duties
and responsibilities fully and effectively. Furthermore, all directors are
entitled to seek independent professional advice concerning the affairs
of Anglo American at its expense. All directors are subject to election
by shareholders at the first opportunity following their appointment.
In addition, directors will retire by rotation and stand for re-election
by shareholders at least once every three years in accordance with
Anglo American’s articles of association. 22 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Corporate governance

During the year the Nomination Committee managed the process 
of the selection and appointment of a new non-executive director,
Dr M S B Marques, who was appointed to the board on 9 December
2003. External consultants were engaged in this process. 
A full biography of Dr Marques is contained in the Annual Review.
In accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code, the
Nomination Committee has adopted the terms of reference
promulgated by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and
Administrators. This document is available upon request and 
is published on the Company’s website.
The Nomination Committee presently comprises: F T M Phaswana
(chairman), R J Margetts, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, N F Oppenheimer,
Sir David Scholey and Prof K A L M Van Miert. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
Role and responsibilities
The primary role of the Audit Committee is to ensure the integrity
of financial reporting and the audit process, and that a sound risk
management and internal control system is maintained. In pursuing
these objectives the Audit Committee oversees relations with 
the external auditors and reviews the effectiveness of the internal
audit function.
In fulfilling its responsibility of monitoring the integrity of 
financial reports to shareholders, the Audit Committee has 
reviewed accounting principles, policies and practices adopted 
in the preparation of public financial information and has examined
documentation relating to the Annual Report, Annual Review, 
Interim Report, preliminary announcements and related public reports. 
The clarity of disclosures included in the financial statements was
reviewed by the Audit Committee, as was the basis for significant
estimates and judgements. In assessing the accounting treatment 
of major transactions open to different approaches, the Committee
considered written reports by management and the external auditors.
The chief financial officers of all operations have provided
confirmation, on a six-monthly basis, that financial and accounting
control frameworks operate satisfactorily. The Audit Committee
considered summaries of the significant risk and control issues
arising from these reports. The Audit Committee also received
regular internal and external audit reports on the results of audits.
Further information on risk management processes is provided in 
the internal control disclosure statement on page 24.
The Audit Committee has satisfied itself that the United Kingdom
professional and regulatory requirements for audit partner rotation
and employment of former employees of the external auditors have
been complied with.
For the purpose of reviewing the actual fees for audit and non-audit
work for the Group during 2003, the Audit Committee considered
information pertaining to non-audit work and has concluded that the
nature and extent of non-audit fees do not present a threat to the
external auditors’ independence. 23 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Corporate governance
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
CONTINUED
After reviewing a report presented by the external auditors on all
relationships between the external auditors and Anglo American that
may reasonably have a bearing on the external auditors’ independence
and the audit engagement partner and staff’s objectivity, and the
related safeguards and procedures, the Audit Committee has
concluded that the external auditors’ independence was not impaired.
The Audit Committee approved the external auditors’ terms 
of engagement, scope of work, the process for the 2003 interim
review, audit and the applicable levels of materiality. Based on
written reports submitted, the Audit Committee reviewed, with the
external auditors, the findings of their work and confirmed that 
all significant matters have been satisfactorily resolved. 
The Audit Committee’s assessment of the external auditors’
performance and independence underpins its recommendation to the
board to propose to shareholders the re-appointment of Deloitte &
Touche LLP as auditors until the conclusion of the AGM in 2005.
Each internal audit function reports directly to an audit committee at
business or listed company level and is accountable for maintaining
Group auditing standards, including risk reporting. Internal audit
functions’ mandates and annual audit coverage plans were approved
by the relevant audit committees, which have considered reports on
the results of internal audit work. A summary of audit results and
risk management information was presented, at regular intervals
throughout the year, to the Anglo American Audit Committee. Also
tabled were reports submitted by the Group’s head of internal audit
on internal audit functions’ performance against Group standards. 
Composition of the Audit Committee 
The Committee comprises solely independent non-executive
directors. The dates of appointment and names of those who were
members during the year and who currently remain members are:
D J Challen (chairman) 9 September 2002
appointed chairman 24 April 2003
R J Margetts 19 March 1999
Dr C E Fay 4 June 2001
F T M Phaswana 2 September 2002
Prof K A L M Van Miert 10 May 2002
The board, in consultation with the Audit Committee chairman,
makes appointments to the Audit Committee. 
As required by the Audit Committee’s terms of reference, the
Committee met three times during 2003 to coincide with key dates
within the financial reporting and auditing cycle. The majority of
members were present at these meetings, which in respect of two
meetings were followed by discussions, independent of management,
with the external audit partners and the head of internal audit.
Details of remuneration paid to members of the Audit Committee,
including the additional fee paid to the chairman of the Audit
Committee, are set out on page 33.
Policy on external auditors’ independence
Anglo American’s policy on auditors’ independence, which came into
effect on 1 January 2003, is consistent with the recommendations 
of the Co-ordinating Group on Audit and Accounting Issues (United
Kingdom), published on 29 January 2003.
A key factor that may impair auditors’ independence is a lack of
control over non-audit services provided by the external auditors.
In essence, the external auditors’ independence is deemed to be
impaired if the auditors provide a service which:
– results in auditing of own work by the auditors;
– results in the auditors acting as a manager or employee
of the Group;
– puts the auditors in the role of advocate for the Group; or
– creates a mutuality of interest between the auditors and
the Group.
Anglo American has elected to address this issue through two
primary measures, namely disclosure of the extent and nature of
non-audit services and the prohibition of selected services.
Disclosure entails reporting non-audit services to all meetings of the
Group’s audit committees and inclusion, as from next year, of
prescribed detail in the Annual Reports of listed entities. The policy’s
definition of prohibited non-audit services corresponds with the
European Commission’s recommendations on auditors’ independence.
Other safeguards encapsulated in the policy include:
– the external auditors are required to adhere to a rotation policy
based on best practice and professional standards in the United
Kingdom. The standard period for rotation of the audit engagement
partner is five years and for any key audit principal seven years.
– any partner designated as a key audit principal of Anglo American
will not be employed by Anglo American in a key management
position unless a period of at least two years has elapsed since 
the conclusion of the last relevant audit.
– the Audit Committee ensures that the scope of the auditors’ work
is sufficient and that the auditors are fairly remunerated.
– the Audit Committee has primary responsibility for making
recommendations to the board on the appointment, reappointment
and removal of the external auditors.
– the Audit Committee has the authority to engage independent
counsel and other advisors as they determine necessary in order 
to resolve issues on auditor independence.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The directors’ remuneration report, setting out Anglo American’s
policy on executive directors’ remuneration, benefits, share options,
long term incentive plan and pension entitlements, is set out on
pages 25 to 39 of this Annual Report. A resolution to approve the
remuneration report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company maintains an active dialogue with its key financial
audiences, including institutional shareholders, sell-side analysts and
relationship banks. The Investor and Corporate Affairs department
manages the ongoing dialogue with these audiences and regular
presentations take place at the time of interim and final results
as well as during the rest of the year. An active programme with
potential shareholders is also maintained. Any concerns raised
by a shareholder in relation to the Company and its affairs are
communicated to the board as a whole. The board is briefed on
a regular basis by the Investor and Corporate Affairs department
and analyst reports are circulated to the directors.
During the year there have been regular presentations and meetings
with institutional investors in the UK, South Africa, Europe and 
the USA to communicate the strategy and performance of Anglo
American. Executive directors as well as key corporate officers host
such presentations and meetings. The chairman is also available 
to shareholders to discuss any matter they wish to raise. The
Company’s website (www.angloamerican.co.uk) provides the latest
and historical financial and other information on Anglo American. 24 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Corporate governance
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
CONTINUED
Shareholders will have the opportunity at the forthcoming AGM,
notice of which is contained in the booklet enclosed herewith, 
to put questions to the board, including the chairmen of the various
committees. Facilities have been put in place to enable shareholders
to receive company communications electronically rather than by mail
and to cast their AGM votes by telephone or by electronic means.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
The board is required to present a balanced and understandable
assessment of Anglo American’s financial position and prospects.
Such assessment is provided in the chairman’s and chief executive’s
statements set out on pages 2 to 5 and the financial review set out
on pages 6 to 17 of this Annual Report.The respective responsibilities
of the directors and external auditors are set out on pages 40 and
41. As referred to in the directors’ report on page 18, the directors
have expressed their view that Anglo American’s business is a 
going concern.
INTERNAL CONTROL DISCLOSURE 
The Executive Committee, as mandated by the board, has
established a Group-wide system of internal control to manage
significant Group risks. This system supports the board in discharging
its responsibility for ensuring that the wide range of risks, associated
with the Group’s diverse international operations, is effectively
managed in support of the creation and preservation of shareholder
wealth. The board’s policy on risk management encompasses all
significant business risks to the Group, including financial, operational
and compliance risk, which could undermine the achievement of
business objectives. This system of risk management is designed 
so that the different businesses are able to tailor and adapt their 
risk management processes to suit their specific circumstances. 
This flexible approach has the commitment of the Group’s senior
management. There is clear accountability for risk management,
which is a key performance area of line managers throughout the
Group. The requisite risk and control capability is assured through
board challenge and appropriate management selection and skills
development. Managers are supported in giving effect to their risk
responsibilities through policies and guidelines on risk and control
management. Continuous monitoring of risk and control processes,
across 13 significant Group-wide risk areas and other business-
specific risk areas, provides the basis for regular and exception
reporting to business management and boards, the Executive
Committee and the board. 
The risk assessment and reporting criteria are designed to provide 
the board with a consistent, Group-wide perspective of the key risks.
The reports to the board, which are submitted at least every six
months, include an assessment of the likelihood and impact of risks
materialising, as well as risk mitigation initiatives and their
effectiveness. 
The system of internal control, which is embedded in all key
operations, provides reasonable rather than absolute assurance that
the Group’s business objectives will be achieved within the risk
tolerance levels defined by the board. Regular management reporting,
which provides a balanced assessment of key risks and controls, 
is an important component of board assurance. In addition, certain
board committees focus on specific risks such as safety of people
and capital investment and provide assurance to the board on those
matters. The chief financial officers provide confirmation, on a six
monthly basis, that financial and accounting control frameworks have
operated satisfactorily. The board also receives assurance from the
Audit Committee, which derives its information, in part, from regular
internal and external audit reports on risk and internal control
throughout the Group. The Group’s internal audit functions have 
a formal collaboration process in place with the external auditors 
to ensure efficient coverage of internal controls and to eliminate
duplication of effort. The Anglo American internal audit function 
is responsible for providing independent assurance to the Executive
Committee and the board on the effectiveness of the risk
management process throughout the Group.
Anglo American seeks to have a sound system of internal control,
based on the Group’s policies and guidelines, in all material
associates and joint ventures. Where this is not possible, the
directors who are represented on these organisations’ boards seek
assurance that significant risks are being managed. 
In terms of a policy on whistleblowing approved by the Executive
Committee, Anglo American has commenced implementation of
a whistleblowing programme throughout its managed operations.
The programme provides the communication means to enable our
employees, suppliers, business partners and other stakeholders to
raise concerns about conduct contrary to our values and to make a
contribution in those areas of our business activities where ethical
behaviour is particularly important. Conduct which is contrary to
our values includes:
– actions that may result in danger to the health and/or safety
of people or damage to the environment;
– unethical practice in accounting, internal accounting controls,
financial reporting and auditing matters;
–criminal offences, including money laundering, fraud, bribery
and corruption;
– failure to comply with any legal obligation;
– miscarriage of justice;
– any conduct contrary to the ethical principles embraced in our 
Good Citizenship Business Principles or any similar policy; 
– any other legal or ethical concern; and
– concealment of any of the above.
This programme makes available a selection of telephonic, email, web-
based and surface mail communication channels to any person in the
world who has information about unethical practice in Anglo American
plc and its subsidiaries. The communication facilities are managed and
operated by an independent company to enable employees, service
providers and suppliers to raise any concerns in confidence.
In conducting its annual review of the effectiveness of risk
management, the board considers the key findings from the ongoing
monitoring and reporting processes, management assertions and
independent assurance reports. The board also takes account of
material changes and trends in the risk profile and considers whether
the control system, including reporting, adequately supports the
board in achieving its risk management objectives. 
During the course of the year the board considered the Group’s
responsiveness to changes within its business environment. The
board is satisfied that there is an ongoing process, which has been
operational during the year, and up to the date of approval of the
Annual Report, for identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the Group in accordance with the Turnbull
guidelines. This includes social, environmental and ethical risks as
highlighted in the Disclosure Guidelines on Socially Responsible
Investment issued by the Association of British Insurers. A detailed
report on social, environmental and ethical issues will be included 
in the Anglo American plc Report to Society 2003. 25 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Remuneration report

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Role of the Remuneration Committee and terms of reference
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible for considering and making recommendations to the board on:
– the Company’s general policy on executive and senior management remuneration;
– the specific remuneration packages for executive directors of the Company, including basic salary, performance-based short 
and long term incentives, pensions, and other benefits; and
– the operation of the Company’s share incentive schemes.

The Committee met five times during 2003.
Membership of the Committee 
The Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors during the year ended 31 December 2003: 
–R J Margetts (chairman);
–D J Challen;
– Dr C E Fay; and
–F T M Phaswana.
The Company’s chairman and the chief executive attend the Committee meetings by invitation and assist the Committee in its considerations,
except when issues relating to their own compensation are discussed. No directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration. In 2003 
the Committee was advised by R J King and C B Corrin (Group Human Resources), the Company’s Finance function and the following
external advisors:
– Ernst & Young LLP – appointed by the Committee as independent advisors to the Committee to carry out a review of the Company’s 
long term incentive schemes;
– Monks Partnership (a subsidiary of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP) – appointed by the Company, with the agreement of the Committee, 
to provide market remuneration information throughout the year;
–PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP – appointed by the Company, with the agreement of the Committee, to provide specialist valuation services.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited (Mercer) is engaged by the Committee to review the Committee’s processes on an annual basis
in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes that the Company and the Committee have followed 
are in line with the stated policy as set out below, and that the Committee has operated within its Terms of Reference. A summary of the
letter from Mercer containing the conclusions of their review of the Committee’s executive remuneration processes for 2003 can be found 
on page 39, whilst the full letter can be found on the Company’s website.
In 2003 the advisors to the Committee provided other services to the Company in the UK on the following basis:

Certain overseas operations within the Group are provided with audit and non-audit related services from Ernst & Young’s,
PricewaterhouseCoopers’ and Mercer’s worldwide member firms. The Company’s auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have not provided 
advice to the Committee; however, in their capacity as group auditors, they do undertake an audit of all remuneration elements. 26 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Remuneration report
REMUNERATION REPORT

REMUNERATION POLICY
Principles of executive remuneration
Anglo American’s remuneration policy is formulated to attract and retain high calibre executives and motivate them to develop and implement
the Company’s business strategy in order to optimise long term shareholder value creation. It is the intention that this policy should conform
to best practice standards and that it will apply for 2004 and subsequent years, subject to ongoing review as appropriate. The policy is
framed around the following key principles:
– total rewards will be set at levels that are sufficiently competitive to enable the recruitment and retention of high calibre executives;
– total incentive-based rewards will be earned through the achievement of demanding performance conditions consistent with 
shareholder interests;
– incentive plans, performance measures and targets will be structured to operate soundly throughout the business cycle; 
– the design of long term incentives will be prudent and will not expose shareholders to unreasonable financial risk;
– in considering market positioning of reward elements, account will be taken of the performance of the Company and of the individual
executive director; and
– reward practice will conform to best practice standards as far as reasonably practicable. 
Representatives of the Company’s principal investors are consulted on changes to remuneration policy.
Elements of executive director remuneration
Each executive director’s total remuneration consists of salary, annual bonus, long term incentives and benefits. An appropriate balance is
maintained between fixed and performance-related remuneration and between elements linked to short term financial performance and those
linked to longer term shareholder value creation. 
Assuming on-target performance, the Committee’s policy is that around 50% (around 60% for the chief executive) or more of total executive
director remuneration is performance-related. In 2003, on average, 57%
(1)
of executive directors’ actual remuneration was performance-
related (see illustrative chart below). 
During 2003 the Committee reviewed the effectiveness and overall balance of the Company’s incentive plans. The Committee found that the
significant impact of both foreign exchange rates and commodity price cycles on the Company’s share price resulted in share option payouts
that were influenced more by the phasing of the business cycle than by the management performance of option plan participants. This meant
that the Company’s Executive Share Option Scheme was, from time to time, not always acting as an effective incentive. In addition, the
Committee was concerned that some features of the existing arrangements were not aligned with institutional shareholders’ guidelines on
executive remuneration.
As a result of this review, and subject to shareholder approval, the Committee will amend the remuneration arrangements for executive
directors and certain other executives from 2004 onwards. The new proposals involve reshaping the annual bonus plan to create better
linkage between short and long term performance and discontinuing future grants under the Company’s Executive Share Option Scheme
(ESOS), other than for use in recruitment or other exceptional circumstances. The Committee believes that the proposed amendments to the
remuneration arrangements will better enable the Company to retain key talent, ensure the competitiveness of the remuneration packages
offered to executives and more clearly underpin the Company’s existing performance culture by creating a better linkage between shareholder
value creation and executive reward realisation. The level of share-based remuneration within the reward mix will ensure that executive
directors and other levels of management have an enhanced level of exposure to the Company’s share performance.

Basic salary
The basic salary of the executive directors is reviewed annually and is targeted at the median of companies of comparable size, market
sector, business complexity and international scope. Company performance, individual performance and changes in responsibilities are also
taken into consideration in setting salary levels each year. The Company’s policy with regard to basic salaries for executive directors remains
unchanged by the Committee’s remuneration review.
Annual bonus plan
Subject to shareholder approval, in 2004 (in respect of the 2003 bonus award) all executive directors will be eligible to participate in a new
annual bonus plan, the Bonus Share Plan (BSP), which will replace the Deferred Bonus Plan and the ESOS. The use of this plan will strengthen
the linkage of rewards to performance; the new plan will also require executive directors to invest a greater proportion of their remuneration
in shares, thereby more closely aligning their interests with those of shareholders, and will encourage management at all levels to build up 
a personal stake in the Company. Awards under the BSP will be made annually and will consist of three elements: a performance-related cash
element, a Bonus Share element and an Enhancement Share element. These bonus awards will not be pensionable. In summary, the BSP will
operate as follows:
– The value of the bonus will be calculated by reference to achievement against annual performance targets. The performance measures for the
BSP will include measures of corporate (and, where applicable, business unit) performance as well as the achievement of specific individual
objectives. The corporate element is based on stretching Earnings Per Share (EPS) targets. EPS is calculated in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard (FRS) 14, using the headline earnings measure, the definition of which can be found in note 12 of the financial statements.
The Committee will review measures annually to ensure they remain appropriate, given the economic context and performance expectations
for the Company and its operating businesses, and are sufficiently stretching. It is the Committee’s usual policy to base 70% of each annual
bonus award on the corporate or business measure and the remaining 30% on key personal performance measures. The level of bonuses
payable will be reduced if certain overall safety improvement targets are not met. Bonus potentials will be set on an individual basis.
– In the case of the directors and top tier of management, half of the bonus will be paid in cash. In 2004, it is the intention of the Committee
that the cash element will not exceed 75% of basic salary for the chief executive and 60% of basic salary for the other executive
directors. The other half of the bonus will take the form of a conditional award of Bonus Shares equal in value to the cash element, which
will be made at the same time as the annual cash bonus. These Bonus Shares will only vest if the participant remains in employment with
the Group until the end of a three year holding period. 
– An additional performance related incentive will be provided in the form of an award of conditional Enhancement Shares at the same time 
as the award of Bonus Shares. The maximum potential at face value of the Enhancement Shares is 75% of the face value of the Bonus
Shares. Awards of Enhancement Shares will vest after three years only to the extent that a challenging performance condition, based 
on earnings per share growth against the UK Retail Price Index (RPI), is met, as shown below:
Real EPS (calculated in accordance with FRS 14) was selected as the most appropriate performance measure for this plan because it is 
a fundamental financial performance indicator, both internally and externally, and links directly to Anglo American’s long term objectives
of maintaining and improving earnings. At the end of each performance period, the level of performance achieved and the proportion 
of awards vesting will be published in the subsequent remuneration report.

REMUNERATION REPORT

In 2004, only executive directors and top management (circa 50 individuals) will participate in the BSP. In 2005, it is intended that
participation in the BSP will be extended to other tiers of management globally (circa 1,300 individuals), who will thereafter cease to receive
grants under the ESOS.
The performance conditions attaching to awards under the plan may be amended by the Committee only to the extent that they are a fairer
measure of performance, consistent with the original performance conditions and no less demanding.
Share option schemes
Subject to shareholder approval of the BSP, it is the current intention that no further share option grants will be made to executive directors
under the ESOS, other than for specific recruitment purposes and in other exceptional circumstances.
Executive directors will remain eligible to participate in the Company’s Save As You Earn (SAYE) and Share Incentive Plan (SIP) schemes.
As these schemes are open to all UK employees, performance conditions do not apply.
Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
Grant levels
Under the Committee’s proposed new executive incentive arrangements, conditional LTIP awards will continue to be made annually to
executive directors. Following the review of the Company’s incentive plans and in light of the replacement of the Deferred Bonus Plan and the
ESOS, primarily with the BSP, it is proposed that awards under the LTIP are increased to provide market competitive total remuneration levels
with appropriate gearing to long term performance. Subject to shareholder approval of the BSP, awards under the LTIP will be increased to
160% from 120% of basic salary for the chief executive and to 130% from 100% of basic salary for the other executive directors. These
awards are discretionary and are considered on a case-by-case basis. In exceptional circumstances and in order to accommodate changing
market conditions, awards may be made to each executive director of up to a maximum of two times’ basic salary per annum.
As in previous years, vesting of LTIP awards is subject to the achievement of stretching performance measures, relating to Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) and to an operating measure, currently Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), over a fixed three year period. For awards made 
in 2004 and thereafter, half of each award made to a director will be subject to a Group TSR measure while the other half of each award will 
be subject to a Group ROCE measure. There will be no retesting of performance. These performance measures are selected on the basis that
they clearly foster the creation of shareholder value. At the end of each performance period, the level of ROCE performance achieved and 
the level of award earned will be verified by the Company’s auditors and published in the subsequent remuneration report.
Although there is currently no expectation of any change, the Committee may amend the performance conditions applying to any award,
provided that the amended conditions are no less demanding, are a fairer measure of performance or provide a more effective incentive 
to the participant and that circumstances merit such a change.
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executive directors by rewarding superior shareholder and financial performance 
and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in the Company.
Detailed structure of the LTIP
In previous years, executive directors with direct divisional responsibility were measured partially on divisional ROCE as well as Group 
ROCE. However, for awards made in 2004 and thereafter, the Committee has decided that the ROCE target applicable to all directors will 
be a Group one alone, which will remove an area of unnecessary complexity from the LTIP arrangements. 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
The Committee considers comparative TSR to be a suitable long term performance measure for the Company’s LTIP awards, as it aligns
executives with shareholders. Executives benefit only if shareholders have enjoyed returns on their investment which are superior to those
that could have been obtained in other comparable companies. 
The vesting of that part of the LTIP award contingent upon TSR performance varies according to the Company’s TSR over the performance
period, relative to a weighted basket of international natural resource companies (the Index). The Index comprises three categories: the first
consists of a minimum of five international diversified mining companies, the second a minimum of five international paper and packaging
companies and the third a minimum of four international industrial minerals companies. Each category is weighted to reflect Anglo American’s
business mix. The Committee may amend the list of comparator companies in the Index, and the relative weightings, if circumstances make
this necessary (for example, as a result of takeovers or mergers of comparator companies in the Index). In calculating TSR, it is assumed that
all dividends are reinvested. 29 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Remuneration report

A graph showing the Company’s TSR performance against the weighted average of the Index as shown above for the period from 24 May
1999, when the Company was first listed, to 31 December 2003 can be found on page 32; for the purposes of drawing this graph Companhia
Vale do Rio Doce and Xstrata plc were excluded as they were not listed at the beginning of the period depicted by the graph.
Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)
Group ROCE is the second performance measure for LTIP grants. The board considers this to be among the most important factors which 
drive sustainable improvements in shareholder value in a natural resources business, as well as one of the most important measures of
differentiation in performance in this sector.
The proportion of shares vesting based on Group ROCE will vary according to the degree of improvement in the Group’s average annualised
ROCE over the performance period.
The Committee sets minimum targets for improvement in returns on both capital employed for the financial year preceding the start of the
performance period (Existing Capital Employed) and on the additional capital employed during the performance period (Incremental Capital
Employed). The maximum ROCE targets are based on stretching levels of return on the Existing Capital Employed. 
The targets for each element of the 2003 LTIP are shown below. These are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign
exchange rate effects, capital in progress and for relevant changes in the composition of the Group.

Pensions
Pension and life insurance benefits for executive directors reflect practice in the countries in which they perform their principal duties. 
Pension arrangements are tailored to take account of historic obligations and, insofar as agreed by the Committee, the personal circumstances
of each executive. Details of individual pension arrangements are set out on pages 36 and 37.
Other benefits
Executive directors are entitled to the provision of either a car allowance or a fully expensed car, medical insurance, death and disability
insurance, social club membership (in accordance with local market practice), limited personal taxation advice and reimbursement of
reasonable business expenses. Directors based in South Africa are eligible to receive housing loan subsidies at a preferential interest rate 
in accordance with local market practice. The provision of these benefits is considered to be market competitive in the appropriate locality 
for executive director positions.
Executive shareholding targets
Within five years of their appointment, executive directors are expected to acquire a holding of shares with a value of two times’ basic salary
in the case of the chief executive and one times’ basic salary in the case of other executive directors. 
External appointments
Executive directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices without the approval of the board; if approved, they may retain
the fees payable from one such appointment.
Policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration
Non-executive directors’ remuneration is approved by the board as a whole on the recommendation of the chairman and executive directors.
The Company’s policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration is based on the following key principles:
– Remuneration should be: 
– sufficient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent; 
– consistent with recognised best practice standards for non-executive directors’ remuneration;
– in the form of cash fees, payable quarterly, but with the flexibility to forgo all or part of such fees, to subscribe for shares in the
Company if the non-executive director so wishes (after deduction of applicable income tax and social security contributions); and 
– set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the board and its committees. 
– Non-executive directors may not participate in the Company’s annual bonus plan, share option schemes, long term incentive plan 
or pension arrangements.
The board reviews non-executive directors’ fees periodically to ensure they remain market competitive. Additional fees are paid to the 
chairmen of board committees and to the senior independent director. Where non-executive directors have executive board roles within
subsidiaries of the Company, then they may also receive additional remuneration on account of these increased responsibilities. With the 
exception of R M Godsell, who is remunerated by AngloGold in his capacity as its chief executive, none of the non-executive directors 
has any such role.
Chairman’s fees
The chairman’s fees are approved by the board (in the absence of the chairman) on the recommendation of the Committee and chief executive,
who take external advice on market comparators. 31 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Remuneration report

Directors’ service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that the period of notice for executive directors will not exceed 12 months. 
In order properly to reflect their spread of responsibilities, all the executive directors, with the exception of A W Lea, who is employed 
by Anglo American International (BVI) Limited, have contracts with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited and with Anglo Operations
Limited. The salaries under these contracts are payable in sterling and/or South African rand as appropriate. The employment contracts 
of all executive directors are terminable at 12 months’ notice by either party. 
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three years from their date of appointment,
subject to reappointment at the annual general meeting. In addition to his letter of appointment with the Company, R M Godsell has a service
contract with AngloGold Limited, an independently managed subsidiary of the Company, in his capacity as its chief executive. Under this
contract, his employment may be terminated by either party giving to the other 12 months’ notice.

At each annual general meeting (AGM) all those directors who have been in office for three years or more since their election or last 
re-election shall retire from office. Details of those retiring by rotation this year are contained in the Notice of AGM. In addition, a director
may at any AGM retire from office and stand for re-election.
(2)
There is no fixed notice period; however, the Company may in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of the Companies Act 1985,
by Ordinary Resolution of which special notice has been given, remove any director from office.
The contracts of executive directors contain a provision that sets out the compensation payable in lieu of notice if the Company terminates 
the contract (other than for cause) or if the executive director resigns in circumstances where there has been a material adverse change in role,
responsibilities or remuneration. Compensation is based on the value of 12 months’ basic salary, target annual bonus for 12 months and the
annual value of benefits. The Company may choose whether to continue to provide other benefits during the notice period or to pay an amount
equal to the gross value of these benefits over the period. Although the Committee notes that this policy is not in complete compliance with
the very latest ABI guidelines, it enables the Company to remain market competitive. Should market practice move away from the inclusion 
of liquidated damages in service contracts, the Committee will review this policy in 2004 for new appointments to the board.
Vesting of share options on termination of an executive director’s contract is dependent upon the reasons the contract is terminated.
Performance conditions fall away in the event of redundancy. However, if the executive resigns voluntarily, then all options lapse unless 
the Committee determines otherwise. In the case of LTIP interests, if a director resigns voluntarily, then his interests lapse. If he is made
redundant, vesting at the end of the performance period is based on the normal performance criteria and then pro rated for the proportion 
of the performance period for which the director served. In the case of the proposed Bonus Share Plan, no share awards would vest 
should a director resign before the end of the three year vesting period, unless the Committee determines otherwise. If a director is made
redundant, his/her share awards would vest pro rata for the proportion of the vesting period for which he/she served. 32 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Remuneration report

Historic comparative TSR performance graphs
The graphs below represent the comparative TSR performance of the Company from 24 May 1999 to 31 December 2003. In drawing these
graphs it has been assumed that all dividends paid have been reinvested.
The first graph shows the Company’s performance against the performance of the FTSE 100 Index, chosen as being a broad equity market 
index consisting of companies of comparable size and complexity to Anglo American. This graph has been produced in accordance with the
requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The second graph shows the Company’s performance against the weighted comparator group used to measure company performance for 
the purposes of the vesting of LTIP interests granted in 2001. This graph gives an indication of how Anglo American is performing against
the targets in place for LTIP interests already granted, although the specifics of the comparator companies for each year’s interests may 
vary to reflect changes such as mergers and acquisitions amongst the Company’s competitors or changes to the Company’s business mix.
The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is calculated in accordance with the LTIP rules. In particular, TSR is calculated in US dollars,
and the TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the six month period up to and including
that date.

REMUNERATION REPORT

(3)
Options were granted having UK Inland Revenue approval (Approved Options) and without such approval (Unapproved Options). 
The exercise of the options is subject to Anglo American’s EPS (calculated in accordance with FRS 14, based on the Company’s headline
earnings measure) increasing by at least 6% above the UK Retail Price Index over a three year period. The EPS growth requirement takes
account of the cyclical nature of the natural resources business. If the performance condition is not met at the end of the first three year
period, then performance is retested each year over the ten year life of the option on a rolling three year basis. Options are normally
exercisable, subject to satisfaction of the performance condition, between three and ten years from the date of grant.
(4)
The options awarded in March 2003 in respect of the Executive Share Option Scheme were granted at an exercise price of £9.28, which
reflected the price ruling at the date of grant. These share options are exercisable between 5 March 2006 and 4 March 2013. In the light
of management’s very successful performance in 2002, and mindful of the need to keep long term incentives competitive in the context 
of the share price performance in 2002, the Committee decided, within the rules of the Executive Share Option Scheme approved by
the Shareholders, to make a larger than normal, one-off, grant to the directors in 2003. Certain of the directors have also been granted
additional options in order to meet the national insurance contribution liability payable on the exercise of their options. The directors do 
not derive any benefit from this arrangement, which acts as a hedge against the future uncapped national insurance contributions liability,
which the Company would otherwise have had to bear and hence these additional options have not been included in the table.
(5)
Beneficial holdings include SAYE options held by A J Trahar, A W Lea and W A Nairn of 3,792, 3,480 and 1,029 options respectively, 
with option prices of £4.85, £4.85 and £9.28 respectively. There are no performance conditions attached to these options.

The LTIP award made in 2003 is conditional on two performance conditions: the first based on the Company’s TSR relative to a weighted
group of international natural resource companies, and the second based on an underlying operating measure which focuses on raising
Anglo American’s/Anglo Platinum’s ROCE in the medium term. As shown on page 29, if the Company’s TSR is equal to or greater than 
the weighted average TSR of the top performing company in each category, the proportion of the TSR element vesting would be 150%; 
in this event, therefore, the LTIP awards shown above would be 1.25 times greater upon vesting. Further details on the structure of the
LTIP, the required level of performance for the 2003 award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 28
and 29. The market price of the shares at the date of award was £9.30.
(2)
Certain of the executive directors have also been granted additional unconditional shares in order to meet the national insurance
contribution liability on both the TSR and operating measure elements of awards under the LTIP. The executive directors do not benefit
from such an arrangement, which operates as a hedge against the future uncapped national insurance contributions liability, which the
Company would otherwise have had to bear, and hence these shares have not been included in this table.
(3)
The performance period applicable to each award is three years. The performance period relating to the first LTIP ended on 31 December 2003.
No LTIP interests vested during 2003.
4 Deferred bonus plan
In order to encourage directors to build up a significant personal stake in the Company, under the Deferred Bonus Plan executive directors
were required to defer 50% of their annual bonus and could, at the discretion of the Committee on a year-by-year basis, defer all of their
bonus (net of tax) to acquire shares in the Company. If these shares are held for three years, they will be matched by the Company on
a one-for-one basis, conditional upon the executive director’s continued employment.
The directors hold interests in deferred bonus matching shares as follows:

A J Trahar, A W Lea and W A Nairn each purchased 147 shares under the SIP scheme during the year in addition to the 58 shares held by each
of them at the beginning of the year. If these shares are held for three years, they will be matched by the Company on a one-for-one basis,
conditional upon the director’s continued employment. Participants in the SIP scheme are entitled to receive dividends from these matching
shares upon vesting. No SIP matching shares have vested during 2003.
5 Pensions
Directors’ pension arrangements
Each executive director, other than A W Lea, is a member of the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme, which is 
a defined contribution pension scheme.
A J Trahar participates in the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo American
International (IOM) Limited; normal contributions are made on his behalf at the rate of 35% of basic salary payable under this contract. 
He also participates in the Anglo American Corporation Pension Fund, whereby he accrues benefits at the rate of 2.2% of pensionable salary
(as defined in the rules of that scheme) for each year of pensionable service, in terms of his South African contract. This scheme provides
spouse’s benefits of two-thirds of the member’s pension on the death of a member. It does not have provision for guaranteed pension
increases.
A W Lea participates in the Anglo American plc Approved Pension Scheme (formerly known as the Minorco Executive Directors’ Fund). This
scheme is also a defined contribution pension scheme. Prior to the formation of the Company in May 1999, A W Lea was entitled to employer
contributions at a rate of 35% of basic salary under his contract with Anglo American International (BVI) Limited, a commitment which
continues to be honoured. A W Lea is entitled to deferred benefits in the Anglo American Corporation Pension Fund in respect of previous
South African service.
B E Davison participates in the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo American
International (IOM) Limited; normal contributions are made on his behalf at the rate of 25% of basic salary. He also participates in the Anglo
American Corporation Retirement Fund, whereby contributions are made at the rate of 15% of basic salary (plus car allowance), under his
South African contract. He elected to join this scheme when it was established in September 1998 and transferred his accrued benefits from
the Anglo American Corporation Pension Fund, of which he was previously a member.
W A Nairn participates in the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo American
International (IOM) Limited; normal contributions are made on his behalf at the rate of 25% of basic salary. He is also entitled to contributions
at the rate of 14% of basic salary (plus car allowance) to an independent personal retirement plan located in South Africa, under his South
African contract. 
No pension costs were incurred in respect of the non-executive directors, with the exception of R M Godsell, who continued to be a member
of the AngloGold Pension Fund (a defined benefit pension scheme) in his capacity as chief executive of that company.

In view of Messrs Trahar, Davison and Nairn having no provision for past service in respect of their sterling denominated pension fund, 
their employing company has contractually agreed that supplementary pension contributions should be made to the Anglo American plc
International Approved Pension Scheme in return for these executives having given up their right to part of their future basic salary. 
These supplementary contributions, of £81,000 (2002: £75,000), £43,000 (2002: £40,000) and £38,000 (2002: £35,000)

Defined benefit pension schemes 
A J Trahar and A W Lea are eligible for membership of the Anglo American Corporation Pension Fund (the Fund) in respect of their 
South African remuneration (or, in the case of A W Lea, his past service in South Africa). The Fund is a funded final salary occupational

The transfer value, less any personal contributions, of the increase in additional benefits earned during 2003 amounted for A W Lea 
and R M Godsell to £37,000 and £679,000 respectively. In respect of A J Trahar, this transfer value was reduced by £87,000 due 
to the reduction in the value of the rand portion of his salary.

In his capacity as chief executive of AngloGold, R M Godsell is entitled to membership of the AngloGold Pension Fund.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director; instead, they represent potential
liabilities of the pension schemes.
Excess retirement benefits
No person who served as a director of the Company during or before 2003 has been paid or received retirement benefits in excess of the
retirement benefits to which he was entitled on the date on which benefits first became payable (or 31 March 1997, whichever is later).

No consideration was paid to or became receivable by third parties for making available the services of any person: as a director of 
the Company, or whilst a director of the Company, as a director of any of the Company’s subsidiary undertakings, or as a director of any other
undertaking of which he was (whilst a director of the Company) a director by virtue of the Company’s nomination, or otherwise in

INDEPENDENT REMUNERATION REPORT REVIEW
This letter reports on the results of the review carried out by Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited of the processes followed by the
Anglo American plc Remuneration Committee (the Committee) that support the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2003. Mercer
undertook the review at the request of the Chairman of the Committee in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration
processes followed are appropriate and that the Committee has complied with the policies set out in the Remuneration Report.
In order to reach our opinion, we reviewed the Committee’s Terms of Reference and the minutes of its meetings held during the year as
well as material presented to the Committee for its review. We also interviewed the Chairman and Secretary of the Committee. Our review 
was not intended to audit the compensation data set forth in the Remuneration Report or to evaluate the merits of Anglo American plc’s
remuneration programme.
Based on our review, Mercer is of the opinion that the process followed by the Committee during 2003 was fully consistent with its Terms 
of Reference and that the decisions taken by the Committee were in line with the principles set out in the Remuneration Report. It continues
to be our view that the Committee takes a suitably robust approach to its work. We would note in particular the changes to long term
incentive arrangements which have been proposed in response to dialogue held with institutional investors.
The Committee has implemented changes as a result of our 2002 review. The members of the Committee have received training and are
regularly updated on executive compensation and corporate governance matters.
Further detail regarding the Mercer review is included in a letter of this date addressed to the Committee Chairman, which we understand 
will be made available on the Company’s website.

13 February 2004 40 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Statement of directors’ responsibilities
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year which give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group 
as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
– state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed; and
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for the system of internal control,
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities. 41 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Anglo American plc
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ANGLO AMERICAN PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Anglo American plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2003 which comprise the
consolidated profit and loss account, the consolidated balance sheet,
the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement 
of total recognised gains and losses, the Company balance sheet 
and the related notes 1 to 38. These financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have 
also audited the information specified by the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 to be audited which is set out in sections
1 to 6 of the remuneration report. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS 
AND AUDITORS
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the
Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards. They are also responsible for the
preparation of the other information contained in the annual report
including the directors’ remuneration report. Our responsibility 
is to audit the financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited in accordance
with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements 
and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having
been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, 
if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have 
not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions with the Company and other 
members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and we report if it does not. We are not required
to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control 
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained 
in the annual report for the above year including the unaudited part
of the directors’ remuneration report and consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the circumstances of the Company and the Group, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described
as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
– the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2003
and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended; and 
– the financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

The financial statements have been prepared according to the historical cost convention and in accordance with accounting standards
applicable in the United Kingdom.
The accounting policies applied in preparing the financial statements are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Group’s 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002. 
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements comprise a consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries and incorporate the
results of its share of joint ventures and associates on a gross equity and equity basis respectively. The financial statements also include 
the Group’s share of the results of joint arrangements that are not entities as set out below.
Revenue recognition
Turnover amounts are measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting trade discounts, volume rebates,
value added tax and other sales taxes. Turnover from metal mining activities is based on the contained metal sold. Revenues from the sale 
of by-products are credited against the cost of production of the main products. 
Acquisitions and goodwill arising thereon
Where an investment in a subsidiary, joint venture or an associate is made, any difference between the purchase price and the fair value 
of the attributable net assets is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill is amortised over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included within intangible fixed assets. Goodwill relating to joint ventures and associates is included
within the carrying value of the joint venture or associate. The unamortised balance is reviewed on a regular basis and, if an impairment 
in value has occurred, it is written off in the period in which the circumstances are identified.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long term interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other
partner under a contractual arrangement. The Group’s share of the results of joint ventures is accounted for using the gross equity method 
of accounting.
Associates
The equity method of accounting is used for investments over which the Group exercises significant influence and normally owns between
20% and 50% of the voting equity.
Results of associates are equity accounted from their most recent audited financial statements or unaudited interim statements. Any losses 
of associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements. 
The carrying values of investments in associates represent the cost of each investment including unamortised goodwill, the share of 
post-acquisition retained earnings and any other movements in reserves. The carrying value of associates is reviewed on a regular basis 
and if an impairment in value has occurred, it is written off in the period in which those circumstances are identified.
Joint arrangements
The Group has contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not create an entity carrying on a trade 
of its own. The Group includes its share of the assets, liabilities, income, expenditure and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured 
in accordance with the terms of each arrangement, which is usually pro rata to the Group’s interest in the joint arrangement.
Investments
Investments, other than investments in joint ventures and associates, are included at cost less provision for any impairment in value. 47 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial statements

Tangible fixed assets
Mining properties and leases include the cost of acquiring and developing mining properties, mineral rights and investments in and loans 
to companies holding mineral rights. Mining properties are depreciated using the unit of production method based on proven and probable
reserves. Depreciation is charged on new mining ventures from the date when the mining property is capable of commercial production. 
When there is little likelihood of a mineral right being exploited, or the value of the exploitable mineral right has diminished below cost, 
a write-down is charged against profits. Stripping costs incurred during the production phase to remove additional overburden or waste 
ore are deferred and charged to operating costs on the basis of the average life of mine.
Interest on borrowings relating to the financing of major capital projects under construction is charged during the construction phase as part 
of the cost of the project. Where funds have been borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual
borrowing costs incurred. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of the Group’s general borrowings, the amount capitalised 
is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to general borrowings of the Group during the period.
Land and properties in the course of construction are not depreciated. Buildings, plant and equipment are depreciated at varying rates, on 
the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives normally vary up to 20 years for items of plant and equipment
and up to a maximum of 50 years for buildings.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful lives of the assets.
Impairments
The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be
recoverable. Any provision for impairment is charged against profit in the year concerned. In addition, first year impairment reviews are
conducted for acquired goodwill. Impairment is determined by reference to the higher of net realisable value and value in use, which is
measured by reference to discounted future cash flows. The discount rate applied is based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of 
capital, with appropriate adjustment made for local conditions.
Research and exploration expenditure
Research and exploration expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred. When a decision is taken that a mining property
becomes viable for commercial production, all further pre-production expenditure is capitalised. Capitalisation of pre-production expenditure
ceases when the mining property is capable of commercial production.
Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The production cost of stocks includes an appropriate
proportion of depreciation and production overheads. Cost is determined on the following bases:
–raw materials and consumables are valued at cost on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis;
– metal, coal and coke stocks are valued at average cost; and
– finished products are valued at raw material cost, labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses.
Current asset investments
Current asset investments consist mainly of bank term deposits and fixed and floating rate debt securities. Debt securities that are intended 
to be held to maturity are recorded on the amortised cost basis. Debt securities that are not intended to be held to maturity are recorded 
at the lower of cost and market value. 
Retirement benefits
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for its employees. For defined contribution schemes the 
amount charged to the profit and loss account is the contributions paid during the year. 
The expected costs of providing post-retirement benefits under defined benefit arrangements are charged against profits to spread the
expected costs on a straight-line basis over the service lives of employees entitled to those benefits. Costs are assessed in accordance 
with the advice of qualified actuaries using the projected unit method. Experience adjustments and prior service costs resulting from plan
amendments are amortised over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant current employees. The difference between 
pension cost and funding is treated as a provision or prepayment.
The Group continues to account for post-retirement benefits under the transitional arrangements for FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’. 48 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial statements

Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development
or ongoing production of a mine or quarry. Such costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to its
net present value, are provided for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These
costs are charged against profits over the life of the operation, through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on 
the provision. Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at 
their net present values and charged against profits as extraction progresses.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right
to pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Leases 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Finance lease obligations are recorded at the inception of the lease as the present value of the minimum lease payments, derived by
discounting at the interest rate implicit in the lease. The interest element of the rental is charged against profit.
Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions by Group companies are booked in local currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction, or 
at the forward rate if hedged by a forward contract. The profit and loss account of foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as 
well as the cash flow statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at weighted average rates of exchange, other than material exceptional
items which are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at 
the balance sheet date, or at the forward rate if hedged by a forward contract.
Exchange differences on the translation of the net assets of subsidiaries less offsetting exchange differences on foreign currency loans
financing these assets, are recorded as a movement in reserves and in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange gains or losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the
transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at year end exchange rates, are recorded in the profit and loss account.
Hedging transactions
In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters into forward, option and swap
contracts. Gains and losses on these contracts are recognised in the period to which the gains and losses of the underlying transactions
relate. Net income or expense associated with interest rate swap agreements is recognised on the accrual basis over the life of the swap
agreements as a component of interest. Where commodity option contracts hedge anticipated future production or purchases, the Group
amortises the option premiums paid over the life of the option and recognises any realised gains and losses on exercise in the period in 
which the hedged production is sold or commodity purchases are made.
Employee share awards
The estimated cost of awards made by the Group is charged to profit over the performance period, as appropriate. Where shares are held by
an employee benefit trust the carrying value of these shares is included within other fixed asset investments, less amounts charged to profit
relating to those shares. The estimated cost of awards is the market value of shares awarded or the intrinsic value of the awards (being the
difference between the exercise price of the award and the market price at the date of grant) adjusted to reflect performance conditions
where applicable. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption given in Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 ‘Employee share schemes’
in respect of Save As You Earn schemes.
Reporting currency
As permitted by UK company law, the Group reports in US dollars, the currency in which most of its business is conducted. 49 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial statements

c) Factors that may affect future tax charges 
The Group anticipates that its effective rate will move above the statutory rate of 30% as the Group operates in certain countries where 
tax rates are higher than the UK rate, including South Africa (effective rate of 37.8% assuming distribution of profits).
Details of the deferred tax provision are given in note 23. In addition to the amounts provided in deferred tax, unrecognised assets exist 
in respect of taxable losses. No asset has been recognised in respect of these losses as it is not regarded as more likely than not that there
will be suitable taxable profits against which to offset these losses. Any utilisation of these losses in the future may lead to a reduction 
in effective tax rates.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of accumulated reserves of overseas subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures as no dividends
have been declared. Overseas earnings have not been remitted to the UK in such a way as to incur a UK tax charge. 57 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial statements

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The average number of shares in issue excludes the shares held by the employee
benefit trust.
(3)
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption 
of conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. 
(4)
Basic and diluted earnings per share are also shown based on headline earnings, which the directors believe to be a useful additional
measure of the Group’s performance. Headline earnings per share is calculated in accordance with the definition issued by the Institute 
of Investment Management and Research (now Society of Investment Professionals), in Statement of Investment Practice No. 1,

Anglo American. The bonds were issued at par and bear a coupon of 3
3
⁄8 per cent per annum, payable semi-annually. The conversion price is
£16.13 which represents a premium of 35% over the closing price of the shares in London at the date of offer. The bonds can be converted
by the holder at any time between 28 May 2002 and up to 14 business days prior to 17 April 2007. The total number of ordinary shares 
of 50 US cents each which could be issued on conversion is 47,589,607. The bonds can be redeemed by Anglo American at their principal
amount at any time after 9 May 2005, if the share price is at least 130% of the conversion price for 20 dealing days within a 30 day dealing
period. The bonds can also be redeemed by Anglo American at their principal amount once conversion rights have been exercised in respect
of 85% of the principal amount of the bonds. If not converted or previously redeemed the bonds will be redeemed at par on 17 April 2007.
The market value of the convertible debt at 31 December 2003 was $1,261 million (2002: $1,088 million).
In May 2003, Anglo American Capital, a fully owned subsidiary of Anglo American, issued a euro 1 billion five year 3.625% bond (guaranteed
by Anglo American plc). The inaugural Eurobond was issued under a $2 billion Euro Medium Term Note programme (EMTN) established in March
2003. In September 2003, under the same programme, Anglo American Capital issued a £300 million seven year 5.125% bond (guaranteed 
by Anglo American plc). Anglo American Capital has also issued a number of bonds (guaranteed by Anglo American plc) as a result of reverse
enquiries under the programme. The issues were used to refinance bank debt and were all swapped to floating rate US dollars.

22 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Treasury and risk management
A discussion of the objectives, policies and strategies of Group Treasury and Risk Management is given in the financial review on pages
14 to 16.
Summary of the use of derivative instruments by the Group
The Group utilises derivative and equity instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates
and commodity prices. The use of derivative instruments can give rise to credit and market risk. The Group controls credit risk by entering 
into derivative contracts only with counterparties who are rated A1/P1, A or better by external rating agencies, or who have received specific
internal corporate credit approval. The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported
on to senior management. Market risk is the possibility that future changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity
prices may make a derivative instrument more or less valuable. Since the Group utilises derivative instruments for risk management, market
risk relating to derivative instruments will principally be offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions
being hedged.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and option contracts to limit the effects of movements in exchange rates 
on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The Group also uses these instruments to hedge future transactions and cash flows. 
As at 31 December 2003 the net amount of unrecognised hedging gains on all foreign exchange risk-related instruments, which had been
deferred to a period in respect of which an exposure has been hedged, was $79 million (2002: losses $25 million). Any ultimate gain or 
loss resulting from these contracts will be recognised when the instruments expire.
Interest rate risk
The Group uses interest rate swap and option contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of its existing 
debt and short term investments. The effect of these derivatives is reflected, as appropriate, in interest expense or interest income. 
As at 31 December 2003 the net amount of unrecognised hedging losses on all interest rate risk related instruments, which had been
deferred to a period in respect of which an exposure has been hedged, was $30 million (2002: gains $4 million).
Commodity price risk
The Group uses forward, spot deferred and option contracts to hedge the price risk of certain commodities that it produces, including gold 
and copper, and in respect of heating oil purchases. Gains or losses resulting from these activities are recognised concurrently with gains 
and losses associated with underlying transactions. The majority of the deferred gains or losses are unrecognised and the ultimate amount 
of gains or losses to be realised will depend on commodity price movements until the end of the hedged contracts concerned.
The net forward position of AngloGold was 8.6 million ounces priced forward at 31 December 2003, covering periods up to December 2013,
with a marked to market value of negative $664 million at 31 December 2003. The value was based on a gold price of $416/oz, exchange
rates of $/ZAR6.64 and $/AU$1.33 and the prevailing market interest rates and volatilities at the time. As at 28 January 2004, the marked 
to market value of the hedge book was a negative $578 million, based on a gold price of $409/oz, exchange rates of $/ZAR7.04 and
$/AU$1.29 and the prevailing market interest rates and volatilities at the time. Other companies undertake gold hedging which is not material
to the Group. 
Concentration of credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of current asset investments, debtors and derivative financial instruments. Given the
geographical and business diversity of the Group’s debtors, the concentration of credit risk is limited. In respect of current asset investments
and derivative financial instruments, procedures and policies are in place to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. 
The maximum credit risk exposure is limited to fair value (see note 22(b)).
Numerical disclosures
The disclosures present information regarding the Group as a whole and therefore exclude any intra group loan balances. The disclosure of
financial assets and financial liabilities which follows (other than the currency disclosures in note 22(e)) excludes debtors and other current
liabilities, as permitted under FRS 13, ‘Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures’ . 64 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial statements

The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities:
Long term investments – fair value represents the market value of quoted investments and directors’ valuation of other investments;
Current asset investments – fair value is based on market prices for quoted short term investments. For non-quoted investments fair 
value is based on market prices of similar investments;
Convertible debt – fair value is based on the quoted market value of the convertible bonds;
Short and long term debt – fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices for similar issues, where applicable, otherwise
carrying value is used as an approximation to fair value; and
Derivative instruments – fair value is determined by reference to market prices where available, otherwise pricing or valuation models 
are applied to current market information to estimate their value. 67 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial statements

The main functional currencies of the Group include the US dollar, South African rand, sterling, euro, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. 
The following analysis of net monetary assets and liabilities shows the Group’s currency exposures after the effects of forward contracts and
other derivatives used to manage currency exposure. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that
are not denominated in the operating (or functional) currency of the operating unit involved and represent the transactional (or non-structural)
exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account, other than certain non-functional
currency borrowings which are treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.

Kumba
On 7 February 2003 the Group implemented its option to acquire a further 10.5% of Kumba Resources Limited (Kumba) through Stimela
Mining Limited for $112 million. This increased the Group’s total holding in Kumba to 20.1% and the Group accounted for Kumba as an
associate from this date.
The Group further increased its stake to 35.3%, resulting in a mandatory purchase offer to Kumba’s shareholders on 31 October 2003.
Acceptances of this offer raised the Group’s total shareholding to 66.6% at a cost of $539 million with effect from 5 December 2003.
Accordingly, the Group has accounted for Kumba as a subsidiary from this date.
The acquisition of Kumba as a subsidiary has been accounted for in accordance with the Companies Act. A provisional fair value table 
of Kumba’s assets and liabilities for this transaction is set out below. 
The preliminary fair value exercise has indicated that the fair value adjustments shown below would not have been materially different 
on any of the dates of acquisition during 2003, and accordingly separate fair value tables are not presented.
Profit after tax of Kumba for the period from 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2003 was R240 million, as reported in their interim accounts 
to 31 December 2003. Kumba’s profit after tax as reported in its statutory accounts for the year ended 30 June 2003 was R718 million.
The assets and liabilities as at 5 December 2003 and the total consideration paid are set out in the following table:

Lisheen
Due to the financial relationship between the Group and Ivernia West (‘Ivernia’), the Group has participated fully in the earnings 
of Lisheen throughout the year.
On 17 February 2003, the Group acquired the $146 million debt owed by Lisheen to a consortium of banks. As part of this agreement, 
the banks forgave 50% of this debt.
On 26 September 2003, the Group completed the acquisition of the remaining 40.6% of the issued share capital of Lisheen from Ivernia.
Consideration comprised $1.8 million in cash and the forgiveness of an outstanding debtor balance of $36 million owed by Ivernia to the Group. 
In order to give a true and fair view, the piecemeal approach to calculating goodwill has been adopted for this transaction in accordance 
with FRS 2 ‘Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings’ . This represents a departure from the statutory method, under which goodwill would 
be calculated as the difference between cost and fair value on the date that Lisheen became a subsidiary. Adopting the statutory method
would not give a true and fair view because it would result in the Group’s share of historical losses and impairment write downs, during 
the time Lisheen was a joint venture, being recharacterised as goodwill. The effect of this departure is to decrease retained profits and
purchased goodwill arising on acquisition by $326 million (as set out below).
The profit after tax of Lisheen for the year ended 31 December 2003 was $4 million.

In December 2003, the Group announced two further strategic acquisitions, subject to competition approval. Mondi Packaging Europe agreed
to acquire 100% of the Bauernfeind corrugated paper and packaging business. This included a combination of waste-based corrugated paper 
and converting assets in Germany, Belgium, Austria, Poland, Italy, Switzerland and China. The agreement values Bauernfeind at —345 million
($420 million). Frantschach has agreed to acquire the sack business of Mexican paper and packaging group Copamex, the largest industrial
sack producer in Mexico and the seventh largest sack producer worldwide, for a consideration of $52 million. Completion of this acquisition 
is anticipated in the first quarter of 2004. At 31 December 2003, these acquisitions were subject to certain conditions and were not included
in the 2003 financial statements.
Minera Sur Andes (formerly Disputada)
The fair value of the net assets of Minera Sur Andes, which was acquired on 13 November 2002, has been reassessed during the current
year to reflect additional information which has become available concerning the conditions that existed on the date of acquisition.

– Revaluation of the future decommissioning and restoration provisions.
The profit after tax of Minera Sur Andes for the year ended 31 December 2003 was $109 million (2002: $26 million).
Additional consideration is potentially payable by the Group if the copper price reaches certain agreed average thresholds in any of the three
and a half years following the acquisition. No additional consideration has been paid to date. The total maximum payment is capped at 
$120 million. 78 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial statements

The deferred consideration received in 2002 was in respect of the disposal of interests in Shaft Sinkers (Pty) Limited in 2001.
The Group ceased to consolidate its 33.1% effective interest in Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) with effect from 5 February 2002, when 
it ceased to control the assets or management of that undertaking. Following the cessation of consolidation of KCM and the agreement 
to restructure KCM as announced in August 2002, the Group retained no equity interest in KCM as at 31 December 2002.

AngloGold North America has $45 million of reclamation bonds with various federal and governmental agencies, to cover potential
environmental obligations. These obligations are guaranteed by AngloGold Limited.
There are a number of legal or potential claims against the Group, the outcome of which cannot at present be foreseen. Provision is 
made for all liabilities which are expected to materialise.
In addition to the amounts relating to Group companies above, under Chilean law payment of customs duties associated with capital 
assets can be deferred for up to seven years. As at 31 December 2003, Collahuasi has potential deferred customs duties of $11 million

33 RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans for the majority of its employees. It also operates post-retirement
medical arrangements in southern Africa and North America. The policy for accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits is included
in note 1.
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds. The charge in respect of these plans
is calculated on the basis of contributions payable by the Group in the financial year. 
The post-retirement medical arrangements provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants. Eligibility for cover is
dependent upon certain criteria. The majority of these plans are unfunded. 
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded. The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in
independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice throughout the world. The unfunded pension
plans are principally in Europe and South America.
The retirement benefit charge for the year is as follows:
US$ million 2003 2002
Defined contribution pension plans 131 99
Defined benefit pension plans 108 55
Post-retirement medical plans 54 17
Defined contribution plans
The pension cost represents the actual contributions payable by the Group to the various plans. At 31 December 2003, there were no material
outstanding/prepaid contributions, and so no prepayment or accrual has been disclosed in the balance sheet in relation to these plans. 
Defined benefit plans
The above defined benefit pension plan cost consists of a regular cost of $63 million (2002: $47 million) and a variation cost of $45 million
(2002: $8 million). The Group adopts a straight-line method of amortising unrecognised amounts over the future working lifetimes of active
employees.
Post-retirement medical plans
The accumulated benefit obligation and the annual cost of accrual of benefits are assessed by independent qualified actuaries using the
projected unit method. The accumulated benefit obligation calculated as at 31 December 2003 was $527 million (2002: $392 million). 
The provision recorded on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2003 amounted to $465 million (2002: $363 million). 80 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial statements

33 RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued
Defined benefit pension plans
Qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every three years using the projected unit method. The actuaries have updated the valuations 
to 31 December 2003. The actuary to the majority of the South African pension plans is an employee of the Group and is supported by
external advisers. The actuaries to the other plans are independent of the Group. 
At 31 December 2003 the estimated market value of the assets of the funded pension plans was $2,831 million (2002: $2,109 million). 
The market value of assets was used to determine the funding level of the plans. The market value of the assets of the funded plans was
sufficient to cover 90% (2002: 89%) of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in future earnings
and pensions. In particular, the funding levels of the UK funded pension plans have fallen in the past year as a result of an increase in the
inflation assumption, although this has been offset by increasing asset values. Companies within the Group are paying contributions as
required in accordance with local actuarial advice. 
As the majority of the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members, it is expected that contributions will increase as the
members age. The benefit obligations in respect of the unfunded plans at 31 December 2003 were $154 million (2002: $125 million).
To the extent that there is a difference between pension costs and contributions paid, a prepayment or provision arises. The accumulated
difference provided in the balance sheet at 31 December 2003 gives rise to a prepayment of $170 million (2002: $168 million) and 
a provision of $216 million (2002: $180 million).
Actuarial assumptions
The principal assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and pension costs under SSAP 24 are 
detailed below (shown as weighted averages):

FRS 17 background
In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ replacing SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’ .
The full implementation of FRS 17 has been deferred, though certain disclosures are required in the transition period for periods ending 
on or after 22 June 2001. These further disclosures are included below. 
Under SSAP 24, the projected unit method was one of the acceptable valuation methods. Under FRS 17, it is the only acceptable method 
of valuation. The pension plans have been valued historically using the projected unit method and so there is no change to the method 
of valuation of the defined benefit plans. 
FRS 17 balance sheet disclosure
Under FRS 17, the assumption for the average discount rate for plan liabilities is based on AA corporate bonds of a suitable duration and
currency. The discount rate and other actuarial assumptions are generally the same as for SSAP 24 and are given above. The market value 
of the assets in the plans and the long term expected rate of return on the pension plans as at 31 December 2003, 31 December 2002 
and 31 December 2001 are detailed below.

The surplus restriction in 2001 arises where pension surpluses are not expected to give rise to future contribution reductions or refunds
because of the extent of the surplus or because of local restrictions over the use of the surplus. 
The Group is continuing to review the impact of legislation passed in 2001 in South Africa on the useable surpluses in its South African 
plans. Further clarification and guidance has been published on this during 2003. The actuaries to the Group plans have not yet finalised their
calculations in respect of the apportionment of the surplus from the plans. The liabilities shown above in respect of South Africa have been
increased where applicable based on the actuaries’ current estimates of complying with this new legislation at the relevant date.
The net pension liability comprises $17 million in respect of plans in surplus (2002: $6 million; 2001: $62 million) and $354 million in respect
of plans in deficit (2002: $273 million; 2001: $122 million).

The above table does not include a restatement of the charges for pension and post-retirement medical plans in the current year profit and
loss account that would arise from the adoption of FRS 17. 
Potential volatility of FRS 17
The method for calculating the net pension asset under FRS 17 is likely to lead to volatility in the amount to be included in the balance sheet.
Pension plan liabilities are measured by reference to long term AA bond yields that can move substantially and rapidly according to market
conditions. The plans’ assets, which principally comprise equities, are also subject to large market swings. 
34 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
With effect from 1 June 2001, the cross-holding between Anglo American and De Beers was eliminated and Anglo American now accounts 
for its 45% interest in DB Investments (DBI), the new holding company of De Beers Société Anonyme. As a result of De Beers’ partial interest
in Debswana Diamond Company (Proprietary) Limited (one of the shareholders in DBI), the Group accounts for an additional 3.65% of DBI’s
post tax equity earnings. Furthermore, the Group accounts for the dividends attributable to 10% non-cumulative preference shares with a
redemption value of $701 million in DBI as part of operating profit, on the basis that the preference shares are part of the Group’s investment
in the diamond business.
The Company and its subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of business, enter into various sales, purchase and service transactions with joint
ventures, associates and others in which the Group has a material interest. These transactions are under terms that are no less favourable
than those arranged with third parties. These transactions, in total, are not considered to be significant.
Amounts owing to the Group by joint ventures are disclosed in note 18. Dividends received from joint ventures and associates during the
year totalled $426 million (2002: $258 million), as disclosed in the consolidated cash flow statement on page 45. 84 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Financial statements

Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
During 2003 improved Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource classifications were carried out at all operations. As a result some material was transferred from 
Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources which explains the major change in both the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource figures between 2002 and 2003 for
Merensky Reef, UG2 and the Platreef. As a consequence of the same exercise, some Mineral Resources previously classified as Indicated were transferred 
to Inferred.

Where the Group’s share is more than 50%, 100% of the Coal Reserves and Coal Resources are reported.
(3)
Coal Reserves are quoted on a run of mine (ROM) reserve tonnage basis, which represents the tonnes delivered to the plant, and on a Saleable reserve
tonnage basis, which represents the product tonnes produced.
(4)
Coal Resources are quoted on a mineable in situ (MTIS) tonnage basis in addition to the ROM reserves.
(5)
Yield percentage represents the ratio of Saleable tonnes to ROM tonnes and is quoted on an in situ to in situ basis or on an air dry to air dry basis.
(6)
The coal quality is quoted as a weighted average of the heat content of all saleable coal products. The coal quality for the Coal Resources are reported 
on an in situ basis.
Coal quality parameters for the Coal Reserves for Trade collieries meet the contractual specifications for coking coal, metallurgical coal, steam coal and 
domestic coal.

Other Coal Resources refers to project areas not included in the Trade collieries or Power generation collieries.
The Coal Reserve tonnages reflect a gain of 199.8 million saleable tonnes (on a reportable basis) and corresponding proportional decrease in Other Coal
Resources due to the conversion of the Kriel South Coal Resources to Coal Reserves in South Africa (103.4 million saleable tonnes) and the conversion 
of the Theodore North Coal Resources to Coal Reserves in Australia (96.4 million saleable tonnes). In addition, 86.6 million saleable tonnes were depleted
during 2003 by mining operations.

1999, 2000 and 2001 restated for the adoption of FRS 19.
(2)
Operating profit for 2000 has been restated for the reclassification of the loss of $167 million arising on the anticipated disposal of Terra
Industries Inc. The disposal did not proceed and the loss has therefore been reclassified into operating exceptional items as an impairment.
(3)
2000 and 1999 restated to reflect the three-for-one bonus issue in May 2001.
(4)
EBITDA is operating profit before exceptional items plus depreciation and amortisation of subsidiaries and share of joint ventures and
associates.
(5)
EBITDA interest cover is EBITDA divided by net interest expense, excluding other net financial income (2003: $72 million) and exceptional
financing charges (2003: $13 million). EBITDA interest cover for 2002 is annualised to account for acquisitions during the year. The actual
EBITDA interest cover for 2002 was 25.5 times. For 2000 and 1999, EBITDA interest cover is not applicable as the Group was a net
interest recipient after adjusting for other net financial income.
(6)
Total capital is the sum of shareholders’ funds, net debt and minority interests.
(7)
Return on capital employed is calculated as total operating profit before impairments for the year divided by the average total capital less
other investments and adjusted for impairments. 111 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2003 Summary by business segment

& INDUSTRIES
Ownership
100%
Anglo American holds a significant interest
in Kumba, one of the top five producers of iron ore.
Most of Ferrous Metals & Industries’ operations 
are in South Africa, Australia and South America.
Iron ore is the basic raw material used in the
production of steel. Chrome, manganese and
vanadium all impart special properties in the
steelmaking process.
AngloGold produces approximately 6 million
ounces of gold a year. It has a global presence,
with 19 operations in eight countries, and plays a 
vigorous role in the downstream marketing of gold.
De Beers accounts for about 45% by value of global
rough diamond production. Through The Diamond
Trading Company, it is the world’s largest supplier
and marketer of gem diamonds. 
Anglo Coal is one of the world’s largest private sector
coal producers and exporters, producing thermal 
and metallurgical coals. It has mining operations in
South Africa, Australia, Colombia and Venezuela. 
Anglo Industrial Minerals is the no.1 UK producer
of aggregates and asphalt and a significant producer
of ready-mixed concrete. Its interests are principally
in the UK, continental Europe and Brazil.
Platinum is mainly used in jewellery and as 
a component in autocatalysts. It is also used
in the chemical, electrical, medical, glass and
petroleum industries. 
Gold is used primarily for fabrication and bullion
investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of uses,
most obviously in jewellery but also in electronics,
dentistry, medals and official coins. 
About 40% of all electricity generated in the world 
is powered by coal. Coal is a key raw material for
70% of the world’s steel industry and an important
fuel for other industries such as the cement sector.
Tarmac is involved in the production of crushed 
rock, sand and gravel, asphalt, concrete and mortar,
concrete products, lime and cement. Copebrás is a
Brazilian producer of phosphate fertilizers.
Anglo Ferrous intends to expand Kumba through further
development of its iron ore interests.
In 2003, its centenary year, Tarmac made ten acquisitions totalling
$100 million in the UK and continental Europe. The new phosphate
plant in Brazil was completed in February 2003 and was officially
opened in April 2003 by the Brazilian president ‘Lula’ da Silva.
Anglo American acquired a majority stake in Kumba, which has
world class iron ore assets in South Africa and Australia.
Anglo Platinum plans to grow market demand for PGMs, expand supply
into that growth and optimise value in current operations. Principally
through Johnson Matthey plc, Anglo Platinum has made significant
investments in research and development into new uses for PGMs.
AngloGold plans to secure the world’s best reserves and 
to grow the company into the global gold equity of choice. 
It is a leading exponent in expanding the market for gold.
De Beers continues to drive demand for diamonds through its
advertising and marketing focus on expanding diamonds’ share
of the luxury-goods sector.
Anglo Coal plans to maintain and grow a balanced and profitable 
mix of metallurgical and thermal coal assets, supplying international
markets in the Mediterranean-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific basins as 
well as appropriate local customers.
Anglo Base’s strategy is to find, acquire, develop and operate
long life, low cost assets. It aims to increase capital and operating
efficiency through continuous improvement and innovation in 
order to earn superior returns throughout the metal price cycle.
Tarmac’s strategy is to generate superior returns by growing the
margins in its business. This will be achieved through increased 
focus on customer service, further cost control and productivity
improvements.
The focus is on converted paper and packaging products for
industrial and consumer markets based upon highly efficient
integrated forestry, waste paper recycling and pulp manufacture.
Anglo Platinum has slowed down its expansion programme mainly due
to the strong rand/dollar exchange rate’s impact on cash generated 
from operations and project returns. Its long term strategy to expand
production to meet the growing market for PGMs remains in place.
In August 2003, AngloGold announced a proposed merger with Ashanti
Goldfields, bringing together the financial and technical resources
of AngloGold with the reserve base and growth potential of Ashanti 
to create a combination strategically placed for sustained value growth. 
The Supplier of Choice initiative was launched in July 2003 and 
aims to stimulate consumer demand for diamond jewellery at 
retail level by addressing the issues that have historically inhibited
growth in the diamond business.
In May 2003, Anglo American reached agreement with Sasol to
develop the Kriel South coal reserves in South Africa. The coalfield
is expected to yield an estimated 200 million tonnes of thermal coal
for supply to Sasol Synfuels over 20 years.
The wholly owned Skorpion zinc mine and refinery in southern
Namibia was officially opened in September 2003. The mine will
produce 150,000 tonnes per year of special high grade zinc and 
will be one of the lowest cost zinc mines in the world.
Mondi acquired Bauernfeind’s corrugated paper and packaging business
and Copamex’s industrial sack business (the latter subject to competition
approval). Ruzomberok’s PM18 machine was commissioned. The Richards
Bay expansion/modernisation and upgrade at Merebank were announced. 
Anglo Platinum is the world leader in platinum 
group metals (PGMs) and the world’s largest 
primary producer of platinum, accounting for 
about 40% of world production.

OF GOOD HOPE
ANGLO AMERICAN COVERS THE WORLD 03 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 Across six continents
nglo American’s operations span
the globe, with products ranging 
from aluminium to zircon. Operating
in 64 countries, through eight product-based
business units, Anglo American together with
it’s subsidiaries and associates is a world
leader in platinum group metals, gold,
diamonds and coal and has growing interests
in base metals, iron ore, ferrous metals,
industrial minerals, and paper and packaging. 
Since the formation of Anglo American plc
five years ago, there has been a steady
diversification of its geographic mix. In 
the UK and continental Europe, substantial
investments have been made in the Industrial
Minerals and Paper and Packaging sectors.
In South America, the acquisition of the
Disputada (now known as Minera Sur Andes)
copper operations in Chile in late 2002 has
propelled the Group to copper’s top five.
Industrial Minerals has increased its investment
in Brazil with the opening last year of a
$128 million fertilizer plant at Copebrás, and 
a major expansion is under way by Anglo and
its partners at the Cerrejón coal operations 
in Colombia. Anglo American now has a
significant presence in Australia’s coal industry
and is a leading exporter of coal from three
continents. In Asia, China is today the major
market for platinum jewellery, while business
units such as Industrial Minerals, Paper and
Packaging and Ferrous Metals & Industries
plan to strengthen their presence in the
country. In Africa, Anglo Platinum is engaged
in a major expansion in South Africa to lift
output. AngloGold is planning to merge with
Ghanaian-based Ashanti Goldfields, which has
six operations  across the continent, which
would make AngloGold world leader in terms
of production and reserves. In Namibia, Anglo
Base Metals recently brought on stream a
$454 million low cost zinc mine and refinery.
Anglo American’s product mix is different in
many ways from that of its peers – and is
changing all the time. In 2003, the Company
took a big stride to enter the iron ore
industry, a long term goal of Anglo American.
With the acquisition of a significant stake in
Kumba, Anglo can now look forward to being
a partner in unlocking the iron ore potential
of the Northern Cape in South Africa and
at Hope Downs in Western Australia.
Anglo’s expansion has been accompanied by
the development of strong local partnerships
and the empowering of local management.
Experience has shown that these are the
people who are best able to anticipate, and
not merely respond to, changing conditions in
the local environment.

ANGLO AMERICAN
COVERS THE WORLD
PROFILE
JORGE BETZHOLD, 
CHILE
When he left the Universidad de
Chile in late 1981 armed with a
Geology degree, Jorge Betzhold
deliberately targeted Anglo
American in his sights “because
big, international companies
were likely to provide greater
opportunities for my
professional development” .
This certainly has turned out
to be the case for Jorge, who
has progressed from being an
exploration geologist to his
present position as vice president
– mineral resources for Anglo
Base Metals South America and
a member of the Management
Committee of Anglo Chile. 
Jorge has been involved 
in projects and operations 
in 12 countries altogether in
South America and Africa. 
This work experience has been
complemented by studies in
Geostatistics to MSc level 
at the School of Mines of Paris
and he has been through the
Management Development
Programme at Stellenbosch
University in South Africa.
Now back in his native Chile,
Jorge is looking forward to
playing his part in growing
Anglo Base Metals: “We are
now a major player in copper
and, personally, I would like to
see us become bigger in nickel
and niobium, too, with good
mineral deposits managed
with a culture of operating
excellence, accountability,
transparency, continuous
improvement and innovation.”
With world class assets in Chile,
the Group is now the fifth largest
copper producer in the world. 
The synergies targeted from the
cluster of five operations in Chile
after the acquisition of Disputada
have already begun to be
realised. While continuing to look
for growth through exploration
and development of greenfield
projects, and remaining open
to opportunities for further
acquisitions, the immediate focus
is on unlocking further value at
existing operations and moving
forward on a number of exciting
brownfield projects already
identified at Los Bronces,
El Soldado and Chagres.
At Collahuasi, in which the 
Group has a 44% share, the
$654 million Rosario project to
expand concentrator throughput
from 60,000 to 110,000 tonnes
per day and transfer mining
activity from the Ujina open
pit to Rosario to offset falling 
ore grades will be completed 
in the second quarter of 2004.
With this, Anglo is well placed
to benefit from the upturn in
the copper price as the global
economy recovers.
MOVING UP TO COPPER’S
PREMIER DIVISION
Anglo Base Metals continues 
to reposition its business 
by focusing on fewer, larger,
lower cost, world class assets.
Consistent with this strategy,
Anglo acquired the Disputada
copper interests in Chile in late
2002. The assets comprised the
Los Bronces open pit mine and
concentrator plant, El Soldado’s
open pit and underground
operations and processing plant,
and the Chagres smelter, which
converts Los Bronces and 
El Soldado flotation concentrates
into anode copper.
Los Bronces was the major
element of the $1.3 billion
acquisition. It produces around
208,000 tonnes of copper a 
year (180,000 tonnes of copper
concentrate and 28,000 tonnes
as cathodes). It has enormous
reserves and resources, 
which have increased since 
the acquisition, and exciting
growth potential.
In a consolidating copper industry,
opportunities to acquire operating
assets with brownfield expansion
capability on the scale of 
Los Bronces are becoming rarer.
The acquisition of Disputada
(now known as Minera Sur Andes)
at a low point in the price cycle,
and with a resultant lower 
entry cost, is creating significant
value for the Group as the 
copper price rises.

TARMAC TAKES THE
HIGH ROAD
Tarmac has played a major part in
the construction of the UK’s first
toll motorway, the Birmingham
Northern Relief Road. The road
has been designed to relieve 
one of Britain’s worst motoring
headaches: negotiating the M6
around the north of Birmingham. 
Tarmac has supplied and laid
all surfacing materials – over
500,000 tonnes of asphalt – for
two sections of the motorway. 
Drivers on the new M6 toll road
may never know that beneath
their tyres lie deceptions,
romance, handsome heroes and
heroines in distress! Defective
copies of Mills & Boon novels are
processed before finding their
way into Tarmac’s Masterpave
mixture. Using paper fibre
improves bitumen absorption,
resulting in a stronger, longer
lasting surface. 
Another unusual component
of the M6 toll road has been
the new equipment designed
to construct a water channel
between carriageways. Work
needed to be swift so that
installation of the street lighting
and central reservations could
immediately follow. The new
machinery enabled the job to
be done in around a third of
the time it would have taken 
with traditional equipment.
The motorway opened in
December 2003, ahead of
schedule.

Birmingham Northern Relief Road,

Syktyvkar in northern Russia.
SYKTYVKAR –
ONE OF RUSSIA’S BEST
Neusiedler Syktyvkar’s mill is
based near the city of Syktyvkar
in the Komi Republic. The mill
opened in the Brezhnev era 
in 1969 and began to earn a
reputation as one of the best-
managed domestic companies 
in its industry, which was to 
lead to further investment by
the Soviet authorities. 
A substantial capital investment
programme has continued 
under Neusiedler, focusing 
on modernising and increasing
capacity in such relatively 
high margin areas as office
communication papers 
(360,000 tonnes per annum 
of mainly A3 and A4 
papers), kraft liner board
(190,000 tonnes) and 
newsprint (180,000 tonnes). 
Syktyvkar is now Russia’s no. 2
in office paper and exports about
half its range. Its top liner board
used in corrugated packaging
enjoys a 55% market share, 
its kraft liner has a 20% share, 
while it holds about 12% of the
domestic market for newsprint.
Top left: Syktyvkar was rated as
one of Russia’s best companies 
in 2003.
DE BEERS CREATES
A GLITTERING 
CONSUMER BRAND
The name De Beers has been
synonymous with diamonds for
more than a century but it is 
only recently that a customer 
has been able to buy jewellery
from an outlet bearing this 
name. With the formation of the 
De Beers-Louis Vuitton Möet
Hennessy (LVMH) joint venture 
in 2001, a retail business 
under the management of 
LVMH was born. 
The first De Beers LV store
opened in London’s West End
in December 2002. This was
followed in September 2003 
by the establishment of 
De Beers LV outlets in three
major stores in Japan’s capital,
Tokyo. De Beers LV plans to open
the doors of its flagship store, 
on New York’s 5th Avenue,
in the second half of this year. 
Bottom left: One of De Beers LV’s

PROFILE
GALINA SAUTKINA, 
RUSSIA
Galina Sautkina, 29, grew up
in Syktyvkar, 1,200 kilometres
north east of Moscow. After
graduating from Syktyvkar
University, she completed a two
year course in Economics at the
University of Maine in the USA.
Galina started her career at the
mill in 1997 as an assistant 
to the directors and now heads
the International Reporting and
Controlling Department. 
The performance targets set by
Neusiedler have seen increased
responsibilities for Galina,
whose department’s reports 
are routinely requested by the
board. Galina says, “This
appreciation of what my strong
team does and the dynamic
spirit of the company makes
Syktyvkar a great place to 
work and gives me a lot of
confidence in the future.” CHINA ’S CENTURY
ANGLO AMERICAN’S SALES OF PLATINUM

CURRENTL Y VALUED AT AROUND $1 BILLION
06 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 China’s century 07 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 China’s century
hina, by almost any measure,
continues to show a clean set of
heels to the rest of the world’s major
economies. Real GDP growth in 2003 was
9.1% and according to latest consensus
forecasts is likely to slow only moderately 
to 8.3% in 2004 and 7.7% in 2005. In 2003,
its industrial production growth leapt 17%,
while the western world merely stuttered
along at 1.5%.
This nation of 1.3 billion people attracted
$53 billion in foreign direct investment in 2003.
It also increased automobile production by a
third to 4.5 million vehicles. Intel, the world’s 
biggest computer chip maker, expects 
China to surpass the United States as the 
top consumer of PCs by 2010.
Anglo American is a key supplier of products
to help satisfy China’s seemingly inexhaustible
appetite for commodities. Platinum group
metals (PGMs) are the Group’s major export
to the country and are used mainly in jewellery
manufacture and autocatalysts. In the case 
of platinum itself, Anglo Platinum supplies
nearly 40% of world total supply of just over
6 million ounces – and, despite Chinese
platinum jewellery demand dropping by 13%
in 2003, this sector accounted for around
1.2 million ounces, still the world leader, 
after overtaking Japan in 2000. 
Elsewhere in the jewellery sector, Chinese
market share of gold and diamonds is set
to increase as the country’s middle class
continues to grow and the government
relaxes its regulatory grip on the market.
Anglo American is well positioned to supply
other commodities, such as base metals and
packaging, to the Asian giant. In copper, for
example, Anglo has now attained the critical
mass to take advantage of a situation which,
in two to three years’ time, is likely to see
25% of world copper production making its
way to China. In addition, Tarmac is developing
a quarry to supply asphalting materials to
Shanghai’s burgeoning construction industry,
and Anglo’s wholly owned mining and drilling-
services supplier Boart Longyear already has
a plant in the country.
Anglo is also looking to become a major supplier
of iron ore to an economy that has doubled steel
output in the past five years and to which, in
2003, exports of iron ore outstripped shipments
to Japan for the first time.

INNOVATION IS ONE OF ANGLO AMERICAN’S
MOST PRECIOUS NATURAL RESOURCES 09 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 New products and new ideas
ne of Anglo American’s strengths is its
exceptional technical knowledge base,
with leading-edge expertise across
eight product-based business units spanning
more than 60 countries and underpinned, 
at the centre, by formidable in-house
technological capacity. This resource has been
further leveraged through enduring business
partnerships and joint ventures, a deliberate
policy of fostering the empowerment of local
managements, and through moving people
across both divisions and geographies.
The mining and natural resource industry is an
extraordinarily competitive one and to extract
full value from all Anglo’s businesses there
has to be an improvement in knowledge
sharing. Over the past few years all business
units have responded to this challenge,
moving away from the traditional ‘top-down’
management approach and encouraging every
employee to come forward with their own
ideas to help manage tasks more effectively.
Sharing information between operations,
business units and the centre – ‘breaking
down the silos’ – has been instrumental in
finding new ways to do things better.
Following on a Group-wide knowledge
sharing seminar in May 2003, a Knowledge
Sharing Forum was established with
representatives from the business units 
and the corporate offices. The dissemination
of information across the Group will be
further enhanced when the Enterprise
Information Portal, an IT platform that 
will link the entire Group, is rolled out later
this year. Also at the Group level, the
Technical Director’s Office is driving the
Energy Efficiency Project, which aims 
to co-ordinate input from all parts of the 
Group with the aim of developing technical
solutions to increase efficiency and,
therefore, competitiveness.
At the business unit level, noteworthy
initiatives include: Mondi’s Strategic
Innovation Programme. This web-based
programme aims to foster a culture of
innovation, gain competitive advantage and
develop ideas into concrete business cases
that can be taken forward to the investment
stage. Tarmac has held the first of what 
will be regular innovation workshops and
dedicated teams are in place to progress a
number of ideas coming out of this. Anglo
Base Metals is giving tangible recognition 
to the value of innovation by presenting an
annual Innovation Award, now in its third 
year, which aims to promote creativity,
initiative and improvement throughout 
its operations.

WA YS OF WORKING
PAST, PRESENT 
AND FUTURE
De Beers, through its sales and
marketing arm The Diamond
Trading Company (DTC), is
constantly seeking new ways
to grow consumer demand for
diamonds. In 2000, DTC
announced its Supplier of Choice
strategy, designed to encourage
efficient and value-adding
distribution of diamonds.
One example of this success story
is Japan. Diamonds had typically
come to be perceived as outward
symbols of wealth and status,
which, in the face of economic
recession, had become less
relevant, or justifiable. 
DTC, therefore, launched a new
campaign, called Trilogy, to
demonstrate that diamonds can
also reflect a woman’s radiance 
or ‘Kagayaki’. Trilogy jewellery,
containing three diamonds,
celebrates past, present and
future in one stunning piece. 
Six DTC clients were objectively
selected to participate in the
programme, together with their
retailer partners. The programme
became an overnight success.
Within a few weeks of the
launch, sales of Trilogy products
had reached over $50 million and
are now estimated at over half a
billion dollars.
Consumer and trade confidence is
returning to the Japanese diamond
market. For the first time in over 
a decade, sales outperformed
GDP, growing by 6% last year. 
At least part of this growth is
attributable to the success of 
the Supplier of Choice philosophy
which has been embraced by so
many within the trade and which
has helped turn Japan into a
growth market for the future.

Company’s recently launched

As a global provider of packaging
solutions, Frantschach is a
leading player in several
European markets. The company
acquired flexible-packaging plants
in Austria, Poland and Hungary 
in 2000, putting Frantschach 
in a strong position with regard
to stand-up pouches and flexible
packaging solutions based on
film paper and laminates. These
have been supplemented by
the acquisitions of Nord-West

time in preparation and tidying.
The meal tastes better 
as the steam cooking process
ensures that the taste of all 
the ingredients and seasoning
is sealed in and thus better
preserved than in conventional
boiling or roasting.
NeoCrisp packaging makes it
possible to prepare fast-food
products such as spring rolls and
pizzas in the microwave without
compromising on crispness.

In its quest to develop break-
through innovation and
substantial profit improvements,
Mondi has implemented its
Strategic Innovation Programme
(SIP) to source profitable growth
opportunities and drive them
through to execution.
The backbone of the SIP is the
Innovation Zone, a web-based
system that allows Mondi’s
employees from different
countries and operations to share
ideas about cost savings and
new market opportunities. Ideas
will be evaluated based on their
market potential and strategic 
fit within Mondi.
“The SIP provides each stakeholder
with the opportunity to shape
Mondi’s future. The smallest idea
could be the spark that leads to
the creation of significant value
and even tiny cost savings could
have a big impact if leveraged
across Mondi,” says chairman
and CEO David Hathorn.
At Lisheen Mine, Ireland,
management has initiated a
scheme called Rewarding
Innovative Ideas. Employees 
are able to make suggestions 
on ways to improve safety,
productivity, health, cost,
environment and morale. Each
suggestion will be considered 
by a review team and, if
implemented, the employee 
will receive a financial reward.
One idea that is now in 
practical use is the installation 
of green fluorescent globes
above the eyewash/safety
showers. The green light makes
the units stand out from other
equipment and is easily identified

chemicals in his/her eyes.

Safety remains a key focus of

Review we described our
leadership training, active
dissemination of information 
and guidance on safety risk
management, the setting of clear
high standards and encouraging
safer workplace behaviour.

a long way to go.
Sadly, in 2003 there were 
44 deaths in our managed
operations. This represents three
fewer fatalities than in 2002 
and a 10% reduction in the fatal

We have reduced our lost time

a further 26%, in line with our

injuries is encouraging, in that 
we have achieved a 58%

three years.  GLOBAL COMMUNITY SPEND
In 2003, Anglo American and
its subsidiaries contributed some
$38.3 million (1.5% of pre-tax
profit) to charitable causes and
to community social investment.
This marked an increase from
$28.8 million in 2002. The
increase was attributable in
part to exchange rate factors,
especially the strength of the
South African rand.
The Anglo American Chairman’s
Fund was voted top in 2003 as
the foremost corporate social
investment vehicle in a survey 
of South African businesses 
and NGOs. At a UK corporate
level, the Company gave priority
to projects designed to support
capacity building and sustainable
livelihoods in developing countries,
including through Sightsavers
International, CARE, BookAid,
Engineers Without Borders and
Bees for Development. Anglo
American also supported a major
exhibition of British archaeology
at the British Museum, the Kew
Gardens Millennium Seedbank
project and the refurbishment
project at St Martin in the Fields.

WORKING TOGETHER 
TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS
Lindsay Knight, a consultant to
UNAIDS, is writing a best-practice
case study on access to treatment
in the workplace. In the study she
says the following:
“Anglo American was among the
first companies in southern Africa
to recognise that the HIV/AIDS
epidemic could pose a major
threat to its operations. By the
late 1980s, the company had
established a formal HIV/AIDS
workplace policy and programme.
In August 2002, Anglo’s board
decided that anti-retroviral therapy
(ART) would be provided free to
any of the Company’s 130,000
employees that would benefit
from the drugs.
Anglo’s move is recognised as a
major step in fighting the epidemic
and as setting an example to the
whole business sector. By the
end of 2003, just over 1,000 of
Anglo American’s HIV positive
employees were receiving ART. 
Anglo is providing a rigorously
managed programme through
AngloGold’s wholly owned
subsidiary, Aurum Health
Research. Patient-reported
adherence to drugs is 90% –
higher than in many inner-city
programmes in the USA.
Patients’ health is undoubtedly
improving; across the whole
programme, 94% of patients 
on ART remain in productive 
full-time employment. 
Anglo American is also
contributing to the national 
fight against the epidemic. Its
collaborators in this initiative
include the Global Fund to fight
AIDS, TB and Malaria; and the
South African government, which
has finally agreed to provide 
ART to all who need it. 
Such partnerships between the
private and public sectors are now
seen to be essential in overcoming
the impact of the world’s worst
epidemic to date.”

A WIDE-
ANGLED VIEW
SIR MARK MOODY-STUART JOINED THE ANGLO
AMERICAN PLC BOARD IN JUL Y 2002 AND TOOK 
OVER THE CHAIRMANSHIP IN DECEMBER 2002. 
HERE HE RESPONDS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT
HIS FIRST YEAR’S TENURE. 15 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 Chairman’s statement
Q: What do you regard as the Company’s
most significant achievements of 2003?
A: Overall, Anglo’s operations did well to
produce a very solid set of results in the face
of difficult currency movements. Strategically,
I would suggest securing final approval for 
the acquisition of a controlling stake in Kumba
as the most significant achievement. This
has been a long term objective. Iron ore 
will strengthen the balance of our portfolio
and our position has been achieved at a
reasonable cost to shareholders.
In the non-financial arena I would identify 
both the provision of anti-retroviral therapy
to HIV positive staff and the introduction 
of the Socio-Economic Assessment Toolbox
(SEAT). As far as I am aware, SEAT is a unique
initiative which will enable our operations
to become more professional and strategic
in their interactions with communities.
Q: But clearly there are things with which
you are not satisfied. Where will the
board be looking for the most significant
improvement in performances in 2004?
A: We have made remarkable strides
in improving the Group’s overall safety
performance over the last five years.
Nonetheless, the board remains determined
to see further reductions in fatalities. My
colleagues and I visited New Denmark colliery
in South Africa in October and there we saw
what can be achieved in embedding a safety
culture through strong and focused leadership.
Ben Magara, the colliery manager, has
produced substantial safety advances coupled
with performance improvements in almost all
areas. Time and again we see that teamwork,
a real sense of shared objectives amongst 
the workforce, and the operating disciplines
needed to deliver safe performance, lead 
to overall improvement of performance.
Our challenge is to ensure that the lessons 
of operations like New Denmark are learned
more widely.
Q: During 2003 there has been a renewed
focus on corporate governance. How does
Anglo measure against the Higgs Report?
A: Markets work most efficiently where
there is confidence. Clearly, events over the
last two years on both sides of the Atlantic
provide examples of how poor governance,
or unhealthy dominance of strategy by
an individual or clique, have resulted in
shareholders losing a lot of money. Society
is entitled to see how such outcomes
can best be prevented. In general I think
a workable structure has emerged.
Anglo American has a strong team of non-
executive directors and we have restructured
our board committees to meet the Higgs
recommendations. I am also delighted that 
the board has been strengthened by the
appointment of Dr Maria Silvia Bastos Marques.
She brings very pertinent experience of 
Latin America and of the metals sector and
is also the first woman to be elected to the
Anglo American plc board.
Q: What is the new Bonus Share Plan 
that is being proposed?
A: The BSP will strengthen the linkage of
rewards to performance. The new plan will
require executive directors to invest a greater
proportion of their remuneration in shares up
front, thereby better aligning their interests
with those of shareholders. Awards under
the BSP will be made annually and will 
consist of three elements: a cash element, 
a Bonus Share element and an Enhancement
Share element. These bonus awards will 
not be pensionable. A resolution seeking
approval for the BSP and authorising the
directors to implement it in the UK and other
countries where we operate will be proposed
at the AGM. A letter from the chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee explaining
the terms of the BSP is being sent to 
all shareholders.
Q: Anglo has expanded its interests in 
Latin America. How do you see prospects 
in that continent?
A: Over the last two years we have seen 
work start on expansions at our Cerrejón coal
operation in Colombia (of which Anglo owns a
third), Collahuasi in Chile (a world class copper
operation, of which Anglo owns 44%), our
phosphates operation in Brazil (Copebrás), 
the commissioning of Loma de Níquel in
Venezuela and, above all, the acquisition 
of the Disputada (now known as Minera Sur
Andes) assets in Chile.
I visited almost all of our operations in
Latin America during 2003. The continent is
facing some political instability. Nonetheless,
Chile continues to show the maturity of its
democracy and institutions and I have been
impressed by President ‘Lula’ da Silva’s
emphasis in Brazil on macro-economic
stability and on welcoming foreign direct
investment – a point which he particularly
emphasised when he opened Copebrás’
expansion project.
Q: Does Anglo have a disproportionate
exposure to southern Africa? What about
continuing investor concern?
A: We remain committed to South Africa 
and believe that this year’s celebrations 
of the transition to democracy will highlight
the real achievements of the past decade. 
Of course there are problems in the region –
not least the continuing turmoil in Zimbabwe
and HIV/AIDS. But South Africa itself has
strong institutions and a vibrant civil society.
After the strongly negative investor reaction
to the leaking of an early draft of the Mining
Empowerment Charter in 2002, the final
requirements which have emerged are
financeable for fair value. It is in the interests
of South Africa’s long term stability that there
should be a rebalancing of ownership in the
economy. We have been pioneers in black
economic empowerment deals and I am
also pleased with the substantial growth,
R3.5 billion in 2003, in procurement from
black owned businesses. Our Zimele small
business development unit is invested 
in 30 growing companies, providing over
2,000 direct jobs. 
I should note too in southern Africa the
consistent courage and skill of our managers 
in Zimbabwe and also the inauguration during
2003 of our Skorpion zinc mine. This will
account for some 4% of Namibia’s GDP 
at full production.
Q: But the Extractive Industries Review, 
in which you participated, has produced 
a negative assessment of the impact of 
the mining sector. How do you respond?
A: I was disappointed by Dr Salim’s report.
It is very much a personal appreciation, but 
I think it suffers from having taken very
little input from governments and relied
excessively on the more radical and absolutist
end of the NGO movement. It recommends
that the World Bank should remain involved
in the sector. But it then adds so many
caveats that its recommendations would
reduce the Bank’s involvement and, thereby,
diminish the investment going to some of the
poorest countries – for which the responsible
exploitation of resources is their best route
out of poverty. I do not take lightly the
examples of how resource projects have 
fed corruption or conflict. But, properly
understood, these are examples of a ‘poor
governance’ curse rather than a ‘resource’
curse. Anglo American has been prominent 
in supporting the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative – which aims to tackle
the misuse of revenues generated by the
sector. The mining industry, as a long term
investor, has an interest in good governance.
We want to see the positive development
experiences of Chile, Botswana, South Africa
and Oman – or indeed, historically, Canada
and Australia – shared more widely.
Q: Finally, how do you rate Anglo’s
performance on sustainable development?
A: We are making good progress. I note
that one of the biggest corporate socially
responsible investment houses recently
described us as being a challenger for sector
leadership in relation to corporate social
responsibility. We are doing leading-edge
work in relation to HIV/AIDS, local business
development and community engagement. 
I have seen very thoughtful initiatives under
way in areas like assessing our economic 
and developmental impacts, climate change
and biodiversity. Of course, there are still
improvements to be made in some areas –
such as target setting and in embedding
best practice more widely – but Anglo
is moving strongly in the right direction. 16 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 Chief executive’s statement
GETTING THE BEST
OUT OF THIS BUSINESS
TONY TRAHAR, CHIEF EXECUTIVE 17 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 Chief executive’s statement
he year 2003 was notable for a high
degree of political and economic
uncertainty. The first half of the year
was impacted by the war in Iraq and political
tension in the Middle East, as well as the
significant decline of the US dollar against
other world currencies. This weakness in 
the dollar had a significant impact on the
Group’s results and, in particular, on the
translation of the Group’s costs in South
Africa and Australia. The second half of the
year saw some recovery in demand for
commodities and significant rises in the dollar
prices for many of the Group’s products,
including platinum, gold, coal and base metals.
The Group benefited again from its wide
spread of product and geographic diversity
which together offer a natural hedge against
economic conditions in any particular sector.
For the first time since our listing in 1999,
the biggest contributor to headline earnings
was the Group’s interest in De Beers, which
reported record results from buoyant demand
and rising prices in the diamond sector.
Although turnover increased by 22% to
$25 billion, the currency impacts referred 
to above affected operating profits (including
the translation of non-cash items such as
goodwill amortisation and depreciation).
However, it is pleasing that the Group was
able to report another year of strong cash
flow (EBITDA), virtually unchanged at
$4,785 million. Headline earnings declined 4%
to $1,694 million and earnings per share fell
similarly by 5 cents to 120 cents per share.
The Group continued to grow on a steady
basis and during the year benefited from the
acquisition in late 2002 of the Minera Sur
Andes (formerly Disputada) copper operations
in Chile, which materially exceeded the
acquisition forecast parameters, and the
acquisition of 66.6% of South Africa’s largest
iron ore producer, Kumba.
Against a background of rising commodity
prices and an improving outlook for the
Group’s products, the board has decided 
to increase the final dividend by 3 cents 
to 39 cents per share, resulting in a total
dividend of 54 cents per share for 2003, 
up 6%.
STRATEGY
Over the past five years we have achieved 
a significant restructuring of Anglo American.
What was a highly complex group has been
transformed into a world class entity with 
an exceptional portfolio of high quality 
assets and a balanced geographic exposure. 
During this period we have grown our
businesses significantly through $12 billion 
of acquisitions and projects and have made
disposals of $7 billion of non-core assets,
thereby creating a focused business to 
deliver improved returns to our shareholders. 
A major milestone was the unwinding of 
the De Beers cross-holding in 2001, which
unlocked significant value. Since 1999, when
we listed on the London Stock Exchange,
shareholder value has increased by $20 billion. 
Anglo American’s strategy is to achieve
steady growth for its shareholders across the
cycle by investing in attractive acquisitions as
well as brownfield and greenfield projects that
add value to natural resources. Our policy of
adding value and pursuing growth covers the
following key areas:
Acquisitions and organic growth
We continue to pursue both acquisition and
organic-led growth across our business units.
Anglo American has one of the strongest
pipelines of growth projects in the mining
and natural resource industry, spanning all 
of our key products, with around $6 billion 
of approved project capital expenditure 
over the next five years. We successfully
commissioned a number of projects during
2003, including the $454 million Skorpion
zinc project in Namibia which is currently
operating at 75% of design capacity. The
timing of this project appears opportune with
zinc prices and demand starting to recover
from recent record lows. The Ruzomberok
paper mill project in Slovakia was also
commissioned successfully, increasing 
the Group’s paper production by some
100,000 tonnes. Both of these projects
should contribute to earnings in 2004.
Our strong track record in terms of
acquisitions speaks for itself. The EBITDA
cash flow returns on our key acquisitions 
of Minera Sur Andes, Cerrejón, Shell Coal,
Syktyvkar and Tarmac range between 
16% and 23%. The acquisition of Minera 
Sur Andes late in 2002 has proved 
extremely attractive for the Group. Not only
were the projected synergies exceeded 
but the operations were earnings-accretive 
in their first year after acquisition at an
average copper price of 81 US cents/lb.
Additional reserves totalling 368 million
tonnes have also been identified during 
the year, thereby extending the life of this
large, low cost producer at a time when 
few large, new copper mines are coming

Improving the efficiency of our asset base
We seek continuously to improve the operating
efficiency of our existing assets. Our focus
on driving returns has produced significant
results from Group-wide cost cutting
programmes. We have consistently exceeded
our targets and over the last two years have
achieved total cost savings and efficiency
improvements of just over $600 million.
Management is very aware of the value 
that can be created by optimising existing
operations and is incentivised to achieve this.
Innovation
Improving the culture for innovation and
entrepreneurialism remains a key driver of
growth. This includes a thoroughgoing review
of employee communication and knowledge
sharing, enhanced by a strong central
technical and research function for our
specialist mining technologies. Comprehensive
programmes of innovation activity are now
under way in various business units, including
Base Metals, Paper and Packaging, and
Industrial Minerals. These programmes seek
to empower individuals to put forward ideas
and facilitate their translation into practical
business improvements.
GROWING OUR BUSINESS
Finance
Significant progress was made during the 
year in diversifying the Group’s debt capability
away from pure bank credit by the placement
of euro and sterling denominated bonds.
Simultaneously, the debt-maturity profile 
was extended materially. We will continue to
explore opportunities to improve further the
depth and flexibility of our financing capability.
Diamonds
The earnings contribution from our 45%
associate De Beers increased by 19% to
$386 million, and cash dividends received
increased by 124% to $238 million.
De Beers has successfully implemented its
Supplier of Choice business model. Having
obtained approval from the European
Commission in January 2003 for its Supplier
of Choice customer strategy, the process of
reconfiguring its relationship with sightholders
commenced. The strategy of stimulating
interest in diamonds as a luxury-goods
category appears to be working well, with a
number of sightholders and their downstream
trade partners financing advertising
programmes, and diamond jewellery sales
appearing to successfully compete with, 
if not outperform, other luxury-goods
categories. Maintenance of this long term
strategy is expected to result in a sustainable
increase in rough diamond demand.
De Beers continues to drive a continuous
improvement programme aimed at
optimising all aspects of the business
from production efficiencies through to
marketing, and is focused on optimising
availability of rough diamond supply 
from its own mines in anticipation of
further increased demand in 2004.
Platinum
Anglo Platinum’s long term objective is to
grow the market for platinum group metals
and in tandem to expand output to meet this
demand. In December 2003, the company
completed a detailed review of its expansion
projects in light of the stronger than
anticipated rand and weaker dollar. As a result,
Anglo Platinum has decided to slow down the
development of certain of its projects but will
continue to utilise its outstanding ore reserves
in growing production to 2.9 million refined
platinum ounces by 2006. In light of its
funding requirements, on 16 February 2004
Anglo Platinum announced a R4 billion
($570 million) convertible preference share
offer. Anglo American will be subscribing for
its pro rata share of the issue and continues
to believe in the fundamental long term
attraction of the platinum business.
Gold
In November, the Ghanaian government gave
its backing for AngloGold’s bid to bring about 
a merger with Ashanti Goldfields. The merger,
which is expected to be completed in the first
half of 2004, will create one of the world’s
largest gold mining companies in terms 
of reserves and gold production. Ashanti
Goldfields has six operations spread across
the African continent, including the long life
Obuasi mine, where $1 billion is estimated 
to be spent over its remaining life, including
$570 million on the Obuasi Deeps project.
In order to address the challenges of margin
squeeze as a function of reducing ore 
grades at some of its mines, declining global
reserves and the weak dollar, AngloGold
continues its focus on operational excellence,
initiatives to increase reserves and
downstream efforts to invigorate demand.
Coal
In the thermal coal market, Anglo Coal
intends to maximise and grow its exports
from South Africa, South America and
Australia. The export metallurgical coal
capability will be further enhanced by
pursuing opportunities in Australia as well 
as in China and Russia.
Major expansionary capital in 2004 will
include the Kriel South, Greenside and
Kleinkopje expansions in South Africa. In
Australia, a feasibility study is under way
regarding the development of the remainder
of the Dawson complex, which incorporates
Moura and Theodore, while work continues
on several other projects. In Colombia,
Cerrejón is expanding its operations to an
annual output of 28 million tonnes of coal 
by 2007 . Although first-half production in
Australia will be affected by a longwall
disruption at Moranbah, Anglo Coal will
benefit from the recent strong price rises for
both thermal and coking coal.

Anglo American has for some time sought
entry into the iron ore industry. A major
development was the approval in September
by South Africa’s Competition Tribunal for 
the Company to acquire shares in Kumba. 
In October, Anglo American’s shareholding 
in Kumba increased to just over 35% and 
as a consequence the company extended 
a mandatory cash offer to Kumba’s
shareholders, resulting in Anglo American’s
stake increasing to 66.6%. Kumba has
exciting expansion potential in iron ore
through a number of projects in South Africa
and Australia. Having secured control of
Kumba, attention is now focused on meeting
the black economic empowerment (BEE)
requirements in South Africa and growing
the company. 
In line with the strategy of disposing of 
non-core assets, the remaining shareholding
in Li & Fung was sold for $269 million. 
The majority of our remaining stake in
FirstRand was sold for $176 million, with the
small residual amount disposed of in January
2004.
SAFETY AND HEALTH
Further progress has been made in improving
the safety and health environment for
employees, with Anglo American’s lost time
injury frequency rate (LTIFR) reflecting a 58%
improvement over three years, including a
26% improvement in 2003. I am, however,
disappointed by our failure to significantly
reduce fatalities compared with 2002. We
continue to stress the paramount importance
of safety throughout our operations with
single-minded determination.
Good progress has been made in rolling out
anti-retroviral therapy to employees with
AIDS. Over 1,000 employees were receiving
treatment as of the end of 2003 and the
preliminary results are very encouraging.
Anglo American has established an ambitious
partnership with the NGO loveLife; the Global
Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria; the Nelson
Mandela Foundation; and the Henry J. Kaiser
Foundation to help primary health care clinics
build capacity to deliver improved HIV/AIDS
prevention and care services. This public-
private partnership is the first step in the
process of building an AIDS treatment
infrastructure in the communities associated
with our operations.
19 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 Chief executive’s statement
WE HAVE ACHIEVED
SIGNIFICANT TOPLINE
VOLUME GROWTH
Base Metals
A major turnaround has been achieved 
in Base Metals. The integration of Minera 
Sur Andes, which had its first full year 
of contribution in 2003, has provided critical
mass to our copper operations in Chile, and
annual cost savings and synergies achieved
so far amount to $17 million. Anglo American
is now among the world’s top five producers 
of the metal, with an attributable production
of more than 700,000 tonnes a year. In
September, the Skorpion mine and refinery
opened in Namibia. This is set to become one
of the world’s lowest cost zinc producers 
as it ramps up to full production of 150,000
tonnes per annum. Exploration effort within
Base Metals will continue to focus on copper,
with lower emphasis on nickel and zinc, in
pursuit of organic growth.
Industrial Minerals
Anglo Industrial Minerals continued to deliver
a strong performance, through a broad 
spread of businesses, mainly in the UK and
continental Europe. The year’s highlights
included acquisitions in the UK, France, Spain,
Germany and the Czech Republic. Tarmac is
now the largest aggregates producer in the
Czech Republic, and is well placed to benefit
from the country’s forthcoming entry into the
EU. In the UK, the $173 million cement plant
at Buxton is undergoing final commissioning
trials and is expected to be in full production
in the second quarter of 2004. In Brazil, the
new phosphate fertilizer plant at Goiás was
completed during the year, $19 million under
its budgeted cost of $147 million, and is
operating at full capacity. In China, Tarmac 
is developing a quarry 140 kilometres from
Shanghai. The quarry is the nearest known
reserve of top quality asphalting aggregates
to China’s booming commercial capital.
Paper and Packaging
Anglo Paper and Packaging continued 
to develop and expand its European and
South African asset base. Mondi Packaging
saw significant transaction-led growth
through the acquisition announced in
December last year of the Austrian
Bauernfeind Group, a corrugated paper 
and packaging business with extensive
European operations. Frantschach has entered
the North American industrial sack market
with the acquisition of the Copamex sack
business in Mexico (subject to competition
approval). In South Africa, the Richards Bay
pulp mill expansion is on track for
commissioning its first phase by the end
of the first quarter in 2004, with completion
scheduled for just over a year later. The
Russian mill, Neusiedler Syktyvkar, is
performing well and in line with the
acquisition forecast.

THE POSITIVE 
OUTLOOK FOR 
A NUMBER OF 
OUR COMMODITIES
PROVIDES AN
ENCOURAGING
PLATFORM FOR
THE YEAR AHEAD 21 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 Chief executive’s statement
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Specific programmes to support the
implementation of Good Citizenship: 
Our Business Principles were introduced
during the year, with a particular focus on
community issues, employee communication
and enhancing our whistle-blowing facilities.
Three year rolling Community Engagement
Plans are being produced by significant
operations, to improve interaction between
the Company and the communities in which 
it operates. These will increasingly be
enriched by our new Socio-Economic
Assessment Toolbox (SEAT). The SEAT
process will support our local managers in
engaging with local stakeholders; improving
management of any adverse impacts; and
working to maximise the local benefits of
their presence in areas like local business
development and training. A noteworthy
event during the year was Anglo American’s
inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index for the first time.
BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
The legislative framework governing the
transformation of the South African mining
industry is continuing to emerge. We expect
promulgation of the Minerals and Petroleum
Resources Development Act later this year,
together with the regulations governing its
application. The process of conversion from
old order to new order mineral rights will then
begin. The South African government has
confirmed that, regarding the Royalties Bill,
royalties will only become payable in 2009
when the conversion process is complete. 
In terms of black economic empowerment
(BEE), the Group continues to make steady
progress, having now recorded over $2 billion
in major transactions and over $1.5 billion
in procurement and small business promotion
spend. The Group is making good progress
towards complying with the Mining Charter
BEE targets.
COMMODITIES – 
TIME FOR A TURNAROUND?
The past 20 years have been a difficult 
time in the commodities business. Steady
price rises for 40 years since the end of 
World War II – notably on the back of the 
rise of Japan and reconstruction in Germany,
followed by the emergence of South Korea
and later Brazil – came to an end, and were
even reversed, from the early 1980s
onwards. In part this was due to the end of
the post-war reconstruction phase, combined
with an oversupply of a number of major
metals. This resulted in certain commodities,
such as copper and zinc, declining to real
price levels last seen in the 1930s.
Encouragingly, there are signs that the
historical real decline in metal prices has
started to reverse. Whether this represents
the start of a new ‘long term cycle’ is a
question that will not be answered for a few
years. At present, the cycle is not obviously
different from any other strong upturn
over the past 20 years, though much of the 
new optimism is based on China’s current
industrial revolution, which in 2003 alone
saw industrial production growth of 17%.
China has become the world’s biggest
consumer of iron ore, copper and various
other commodities. For three years running,
China has also been the primary market for
platinum jewellery, with compound annual
growth rates over that period of 35%.
Diamond jewellery demand is also growing
strongly. Moreover, China’s embrace of the
free market is now being tracked, albeit 
at lower rates of growth, by India. Between
them, the two countries look set to 
provide sustained demand for a number
of commodities for years to come. The 
effect of this, combined with fewer
discoveries and a more disciplined industry,
is set to provide a positive backdrop to 
metals markets going forward.
OUTLOOK
The positive outlook for a number of 
our commodities provides an encouraging
platform for the year ahead. Improved
economic growth in the USA and Japan,
combined with the strong industrial
performance of China, is encouraging. After
two decades of generally flat or declining 
real prices for metals, despite a background 
of steadily increasing demand, the backdrop
for commodities is now more positive than 
it has been for a number of years. Although 
the potential for a further weakening of the 
dollar remains a cause for concern, this is
likely to be offset by rising dollar prices for 
our key commodities. 
The Group offers a unique mix of geographic
and product diversity which insulates it 
from the volatility associated with single-
product cycles. Our gold, platinum, diamond,
coal, base and ferrous metals businesses 
are benefiting from recent price rises and
should continue to enjoy steady growth. 
In addition, paper and packaging and industrial
minerals are generating strong cash flows.
The Group will also benefit from a number 
of new projects and recent acquisitions. 
On the basis of prevailing commodity prices
and exchange rates, the Group should
achieve good growth in 2004.

THE CASH FLOW
RETURNS ON OUR 
KEY ACQUISITIONS
RANGE BETWEEN
16% AND 23% 22 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 Operations review
Anglo Platinum’s contribution to headline
earnings dipped sharply to 12% from 2002’s
20%, while operating profit was 46% lower
at $433 million. The adverse impact of 
the firmer South African rand was only partly
compensated by improved average dollar
prices for platinum group metals (PGMs) 
and higher sales. 
The average realised prices of PGMs and 
nickel in dollars were slightly higher in 2003.
Platinum and nickel moved upward, while
palladium and rhodium declined. Platinum, 
at $696/oz, gained $152, with nickel moving
upward from $3.03 to $4.07/lb. Platinum’s
sister metals, palladium and rhodium, were
both down, at $198/oz (2002: $329/oz) and
$527/oz (2002: $831/oz), respectively.
During 2003, the Polokwane smelter was
successfully commissioned, as were the new
slag-cleaning furnace and the Anglo Platinum
Converting Process plant near Rustenburg. 
Total platinum received at the smelters,
including platinum purchased from joint venture
partners, increased by 8%, while refined
production rose by 2.5% to 2.3 million ounces.
The robustness of the rand continues to have
a major impact on operating margins, cash
generation and the future funding of new
projects. In consequence, the expansion plan
to raise platinum output from around 2 million
ounces a year to 3.5 million by the end of
2006 has been slowed down, with a new
target of 2.9 million ounces. Notwithstanding
this, the company’s long term strategy to
grow markets for PGMs, to expand production
to meet that growing demand and to optimise
value in existing operations remains in place.
In 2004, Anglo Platinum plans to raise
platinum output to 2.45 million ounces. 
The platinum price is expected to remain firm,
supported by a continuing supply deficit. 
The palladium price, despite firming demand, is
largely dependent on Russian supply patterns.

PLATINUM GOLD DIAMONDS
In 2003, a combination of stronger currencies
in most of AngloGold’s operating regions, as
well as inflation and lower ore grades, had 
a significant negative impact on AngloGold’s
costs, margins and earnings. This was 
partly offset by a 20% increase in the dollar
gold price. Headline earnings fell by 19% 
to $167 million, while operating profit was 
30% lower at $326 million. Gold production
declined by 5% to 5.6 million ounces following
the sale of Jerritt Canyon in the USA and lower
ore grades at Morila in Mali. Total cash costs
increased from $161 to $229/oz. 
AngloGold has a number of major capital
projects in South Africa, which will yield some
12 million ounces of gold production over
their lives, while future capital projects could
add a further 7.5 million ounces. Potential
growth projects elsewhere include the Cuiabá
expansion in Brazil and the Sunrise Dam
underground project and Boddington mine in
Australia, which together could add a further
7 million ounces of gold production. The
completion of the AngloGold-Ashanti merger
would pave the way for the exploitation of
Obuasi Deeps in Ghana, extending Obuasi’s
life by some 20 years.
Production in 2004 is expected to decrease 
to some 5.4 million ounces, following the sale
of Jerritt Canyon, the closure of Union Reefs 
in Australia and lower grades at Morila.
However, following the expected completion
of the Ashanti deal during April, AngloGold 
is anticipating that production will increase 
to some 6.6 million ounces. Assuming 
an exchange rate of R7.00 to the dollar,
AngloGold is expecting total unit cash 
costs to rise to $238/oz and capital
expenditure to increase to $589 million. 
Many of the economic factors which are
negative for the US currency have been,
conversely, incentives for investors to buy
gold. It is expected that these factors
will remain in play in the year ahead, and 
there is good reason to expect gold price
strength to be maintained.
In 2003, Anglo American’s share of De Beers’
operating profit was $21 million higher 
at $562 million, while the contribution to 
Anglo American’s headline earnings was
$386 million. Increased sales at higher prices
and lower financing costs more than
compensated for the negative impact of the
significant appreciation of the rand against 
the dollar. Sales by The Diamond Trading
Company (DTC), the marketing arm of
De Beers, were 7% higher at $5.52 billion.
Diamond stocks were reduced further by nearly
$700 million during the year and, for the
second year running, operating cash flow 
of $1.6 billion was generated. This enabled
the group to reduce net interest-bearing 
debt from $1.72 billion to $906 million and 
to reduce net gearing to 15% (2002: 28%). 
Overall, 2003 was a good year for the
diamond industry, with further encouraging
growth in retail sales of diamond jewellery,
up 6% in dollar terms. There was strong
growth in sales in the second half as the
world economy and consumer confidence
rebounded. The USA, which accounts for over
50% of world diamond jewellery sales, was
particularly strong, as were India, China and
the UK. Encouragingly, Japan also recorded
growth for the first time in several years. 
The combined total production of De Beers
and its partners, Debswana and Namdeb,
totalled 43.9 million carats (2002: 40.2
million carats). The Combined Treatment 
Plant in Kimberley, South Africa, was fully
commissioned during the year.
De Beers had a strong first sight in 2004,
with rough diamond prices up by 3%.
Macro-economic indicators are positive for
2004 and there is growing evidence that 
the transformation of the diamond industry,
stimulated by De Beers’ Supplier of Choice
strategy, is helping to produce the desired
results. Greater investment by the trade in
marketing and branding is driving demand for
diamond jewellery and helping diamonds to
gain a larger share of the luxury-goods sector.

COAL BASE METALS INDUSTRIAL MINERALS
Anglo Coal’s operating profit was 22% down
at $333 million, mainly as a result of the
appreciation of the rand and Australian dollar,
while headline earnings declined by 13% to
$232 million. Production increased by 8% to
87 million tonnes. 
Operating profit for South African-sourced coal
fell by 46% to $133 million. The effects of the
rand’s 28% appreciation were partially offset
by production and sales increases, as well as
by rigorous cost control. Major expansionary
capital projects, including the Kriel South
project and the Greenside and Kleinkopje
expansions, are progressing to plan.
The Australian operations maintained operating
profit at $130 million. Attributable saleable
coal production rose by 4% to 26.1 million
tonnes, while attributable sales were 6% lower
at 26.4 million tonnes. The longwall mines at
Dartbrook and Moranbah had a good first six
months, with record production, but technical
problems slowed production in the second half
of the year. Drayton production was steady,
while both Moura and German Creek exceeded
previous performances. Theodore commenced
production in September. Grasstree remains 
on schedule for start-up of production during
2006. Full production at Kayuga should be
reached in 2004. A fall of ground in January
2004 at Moranbah North will reduce
production by some 10% compared with 2003,
with effect on earnings in the first half of 2004.
Operating profit at the South American
operations rose by 40% to $70 million. In
Colombia, synergies achieved as a result of
merging Cerrejón Zona Norte and Carbones
del Cerrejón exceeded expectations. The
operation is now being expanded from
22 million to 28 million tonnes per annum 
by 2007 . Carbones del Guasare in Venezuela
was hit by the national strike at the beginning
of 2003 and subsequently by problems in 
the administration of the exchange controls
imposed at that time. 
In 2004, average coal prices are expected to
be significantly better than those in 2003.
Headline earnings grew strongly to
$206 million from $69 million in 2002.
Operating profit before exceptionals
increased from $133 million to $286 million. 
The average copper price increased from
70.6 US cents/lb to 80.7 US cents/lb,
nickel moved from 307 US cents/lb to
437 US cents/lb, while zinc prices remained
quite flat at 37.6 US cents/lb (2002: 
35.3 US cents/lb). Commodity price rises
were offset by dollar weakness against the
local currencies of many operations.
Attributable copper production rose from
497,700 tonnes to 708,800 tonnes, with
Minera Sur Andes (formerly Disputada)
contributing 278,300 tonnes. Collahuasi’s
$654 million Rosario Project is on budget and
on schedule to enter production in mid 2004. 
Attributable nickel output totalled 24,900
tonnes (2002: 25,600 tonnes). Codemin’s
production rose 7%, while Loma de Níquel
attained design capacity, with output rising 
to 17,200 tonnes. The $67 million Codemin II
project to treat Barro Alto ore is scheduled 
to enter production in early 2005. At Catalão,
production and sales were maintained.
Namakwa’s output of zircon and rutile
products declined following a fire in October.
Attributable zinc output rose from 211,500
tonnes to 360,500 tonnes. Hudson Bay’s zinc
output rose 9% to a record 117,900 tonnes.
Skorpion produced 47,400 tonnes and is 
on target to achieve design throughput by
end 2004. Lisheen achieved record output of
169,300 tonnes. At Hudson Bay, the $276
million 777 project was completed ahead of
schedule and within budget. Black Mountain’s
$110 million Deeps project is on budget and
scheduled to deliver first ore in late 2004.
Although Chinese demand will have to
remain very firm and OECD demand improve
markedly to sustain prices at their present
levels, nevertheless the outlook for base
metals is more encouraging than at any time
in the past five years.
Headline earnings were 17% higher at
$270 million, with Tarmac contributing
$256 million, a rise of 20%. Operating profit
also improved by 17% to $325 million.
During 2003, Tarmac made ten acquisitions,
thereby widening its asphalt and road
contracting interests in the UK, and bolstering
its aggregates businesses in France, Spain,
Germany and the Czech Republic. In China,
Tarmac is developing a quarry approximately
140 kilometres from Shanghai.
In the UK, three new dry silo mortar plants
were constructed, underpinning Tarmac’s
leadership position in the mortar market. 
The core aggregates businesses in the UK all
improved their profitability in a disappointing
market, while the cement business at Buxton
had a satisfactory year. Buxton’s new plant
should commence operation in the second
quarter of 2004. In continental Europe,
operating profit increased by 56%, reflecting
continuing strong market conditions in Spain
and a full year contribution from Mavike.
France suffered weak market conditions, 
while the businesses in eastern Europe moved
forward satisfactorily. 
The Middle Eastern operations strongly
increased operating profit owing to buoyant
market conditions, while the Far East business
also had an improved year.
Copebrás’ operating profit increased by
46% owing to continued strong demand for
fertilizers and higher prices. The new plant
at Goiás is already operating at full capacity.
In the UK the challenge will be to improve
margins in a highly competitive market while
at least maintaining market share. Difficult
trading conditions are expected to continue in
Germany. However, EU entry is expected to
lead to an improvement in demand in Poland
and the Czech Republic. In Spain, demand
should remain firm, but France may see some
further weakening. Brazilian fertilizer demand
is expected to remain strong.

Headline earnings were $368 million,
a 2% decrease on 2002, while operating
profit of $656 million was marginally higher. 
Operating profit at Mondi Europe increased 
by 9% to $471 million in spite of weaker
market conditions in both the packaging and
office communications sectors. In Slovakia, the
$233 million expansion at the Ruzomberok pulp
and paper mill proceeded according to schedule.
Annual output will increase by 100,000 tonnes
of paper in 2004 and 105,000 tonnes of pulp
by 2005. Neusiedler Syktyvkar in Russia 
and the La Rochette corrugated packaging 
plants in France and the UK have been 
fully integrated with the rest of the group.
In February 2004, the Bauernfeind corrugated
paper and packaging business was acquired,
thereby achieving a further step towards
attaining critical mass in European markets.
Frantschach also acquired (subject to
competition approval) the sack business 
of Mexican industrial packaging group
Copamex, providing the opportunity to
expand further into North America. 
In South Africa, in difficult trading conditions,
operating profits reduced by only 14% to
$185 million. The stronger rand resulted in
increasing pressure on domestic prices and
lower export margins. However, improved
operating efficiencies and higher outputs, 
as well as initiatives to sustain market share
and grow volumes, compensated for much 
of the negative impact of prices. The Richards
Bay mill modernisation and expansion is
progressing well, with completion due in 
April 2005. The upgrade of Merebank’s 
PM1 machine is proceeding, with the plan 
to produce 250,000 tonnes per year of
uncoated woodfree papers from late 2005. 
Mondi will continue to focus on operating
efficiencies, capitalising on recent expansions
and extracting synergy benefits from the
integration of acquisitions. General economic
conditions are expected to remain weak, with
the dollar’s current low levels and a buoyant
euro creating difficult trading conditions with
margins flat at best.

Headline earnings were $107 million, 
(2002: $126 million). Operating profit was 
$56 million lower at $208 million, mainly 
as a result of sharply reduced earnings from
Tongaat-Hulett in a year when many operations
were affected by the strengthening rand. 
In December, control was acquired of Kumba,
the world’s fifth largest iron ore producer,
with attractive growth prospects in South
Africa and Australia. In 2003, Kumba
contributed $33 million to operating profit. 
In 2003, Scaw’s operating profit rose by
$19 million to $70 million, which included
a $21 million full year contribution from 
Moly-Cop. 
Highveld’s operating profit was impacted 
by the appreciating rand and fell by
$27 million to $11 million. 
Samancor’s contribution to operating profit
reduced by $7 million to $41 million. 
Boart Longyear’s operating profit was
$2 million higher at $33 million. 
Tongaat-Hulett’s operating profit fell to
$10million from $96 million. This severe
downturn arose from a combination of factors
that included a firming rand, lower world
sugar and aluminium prices and substantially 
higher maize input costs. 
Terra turned an operating loss of $3 million into
an attributable operating profit of $14 million. 
The outlook for 2004 is cautiously optimistic,
with the possibility of higher ferrous metal
prices. Scaw and Highveld are likely to 
benefit from an improved domestic market.
Profitability should be restored to more 
normal levels at Tongaat-Hulett through
increasing aluminium volumes and more 
stable maize-procurement costs. Attention 
is now being focused on reorganising the
portfolio to improve shareholder returns.
Anglo American invests significant effort 
and funds to ensure continuous improvement
in the efficiency of current operations, and in
researching and developing new technologies,
to allow previously undeveloped orebodies 
to be exploited, or create new business
opportunities. These initiatives often involve
in-house specialist expertise collaborating with
external centres of excellence. An example 
is a recent Geoscience development of a solid-
state electronics-based electro-magnetic
receiver, which may have a significant impact
on the exploration of massive sulphides.
Anglo American Research Laboratories
have innovated hydrometallurgical recovery 
of copper from chalcopyrite ores, milling
techniques to reduce the cost and improve
the effectiveness of comminution, the
application of electro-dynamic separation for
fine materials, and utilising microwaves to
accelerate chemical reactions. The Anglo
Platinum Research Centre has made significant
progress utilising advanced instrumentation
and multi-variable control techniques with
robotic analysis to improve metal recoveries. 
Research work on applying paste-based
tailings disposal has received attention as 
a water-saving initiative. A pilot project
studying energy use across all businesses 
is under way to improve efficiencies 
and reduce energy consumption, and
consequently the impact of CO2 on the
environment.
In 2003, total Group cash expenditure on
exploration was $105 million – including
$50 million by Base Metals, $11 million by
Anglo Platinum and $36 million by AngloGold. 
Base Metals’ exploration efforts focused 
on brownfields exploration around operations
and high quality greenfield targets. Drilling
adjacent to the Chilean copper operations
intersected several potential new resources.
Copper was also targeted in Brazil, Mexico,
Peru, Philippines and Sweden. A nickel
sulphide programme in northern Canada 
had early success, with nickel-copper-
platinum group elements drill intersections 
at West Raglan in Quebec. Zinc exploration
continued in India and Australia and 
around Black Mountain (South Africa), 
Flin Flon (Canada), Lisheen (Ireland) and
Skorpion (Namibia) operations.
Anglo Platinum’s exploration effort in South
Africa was directly linked to its commitment
to increase production. Internationally, 
Anglo Platinum’s partners have progressed
several programmes in Canada and Russia.
AngloGold’s exploration was focused around
operations in Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Tanzania, Mali, Namibia, South Africa and the
USA. In addition, exploration was pursued in
highly prospective areas in Canada and Peru.

SUMMARY CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2003 the Company has been
in compliance with the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best
Practice of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the
Financial Services Authority in June 1998.
Since its issue in July 2003 the Company has also complied with the
provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The directors
are satisfied that there is an ongoing process of internal control 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced 
by the Group.
The directors, their responsibilities and the current membership 
of the principal committees of the board are set out on page 26. 
Since the last AGM, Dr M S B Marques has been appointed a 
non-executive director.
The board comprises four executive directors and eleven non-
executive directors, eight of whom are independent according to the
definition contained in the Higgs Report published in January 2003.
The independent directors are Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, D J Challen, 
F T M Phaswana, Professor K A L M Van Miert, Dr C E Fay, G Lindahl,
R J Margetts and Dr M S B Marques. The other non-executive

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ STATEMENT
TO THE MEMBERS OF ANGLO AMERICAN PLC
We have examined the summary financial statement which comprises
the summary directors’ report, summary corporate governance report,
consolidated profit and loss account, summary consolidated balance
sheet and summary remuneration report.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 251 of the Companies Act 1985. Our work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by

SUMMARY REMUNERATION REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2003
This is a summary of the full remuneration report contained in the Annual Report, copies of which may be obtained free of charge from 
the Company’s Registrar or may be viewed on, or downloaded from, Anglo American’s website, www.angloamerican.co.uk.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Anglo American has a Remuneration Committee (the Committee) consisting of non-executive directors, chaired by R J Margetts, which 
is responsible for considering and making recommendations to the Board on executive and senior management remuneration policy, specific
remuneration packages for executive directors and the operation of the Company’s share incentive schemes.
REMUNERATION POLICY
Each executive director’s total remuneration consists of salary, annual bonus, long term incentives and benefits. The basic salary of the
executive directors is reviewed annually and is targeted at the median of companies of comparable size, market sector, business complexity 
and international scope. Company performance, individual performance and changes in responsibilities are also taken into consideration 
in setting salary levels each year. An appropriate balance is maintained between fixed and performance-related remuneration, and between
elements linked to short term financial performance and those linked to longer term shareholder value creation. Assuming on-target
performance, the Committee’s policy is that around 50% (around 60% for the CEO) or more of total executive director remuneration
is performance-related. In 2003, on average, 57% of executive directors’ actual remuneration was performance-related.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Non-executive director remuneration is set at a level which is sufficient to attract and retain world class non-executive talent and is consistent
with recognised best practice standards for non-executive directors’ remuneration. Non-executive directors may not participate in the Company’s
annual bonus plan, share option schemes, long term incentive plan or pension arrangements. The board reviews non-executive directors’ fees
periodically to ensure they remain market competitive.
DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS
In order properly to reflect their spread of responsibilities, all the executive directors, with the exception of A W Lea, who is employed by 
Anglo American International (BVI) Limited, have contracts with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited and with Anglo Operations Limited.
The salaries under these contracts are payable in sterling and/or South African rand as appropriate. The employment contracts of all executive
directors are terminable at 12 months’ notice by either party. The contracts of executive directors contain a provision that sets out the
compensation payable in lieu of notice if the Company terminates the contract (other than for cause) or the director resigns in circumstances
where there has been a material adverse change in role, responsibilities or remuneration. Compensation is based on the value of 12 months’ basic
salary, target annual bonus for 12 months and the annual value of benefits. Although the Committee notes that this policy is not in complete
compliance with the very latest ABI guidelines, it enables the Company to remain market competitive. Should market practice move away from 
the inclusion of liquidated damages in service contracts, the Committee will review this policy in 2004 for new appointments to the board.
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with Anglo American for an initial period of three years from their date of appointment,
subject to re-election at the annual general meeting.
PENSIONS
The amounts paid into defined contribution pension schemes by Anglo American in respect of the directors who served during 2003 totalled
£479,000 (2002: £457,000), excluding supplementary voluntary pension contributions, which are described on page 34. Two of the executive
directors are members of defined benefit pension schemes.
NEW BONUS SHARE PLAN
During 2003, the Committee reviewed the effectiveness and overall balance of incentive plans and, subject to shareholder approval, will 
amend the remuneration arrangements for executive directors and certain other executives from 2004 onwards. The proposals involve reshaping 
the existing annual bonus plan to increase the linkage between short and long term performance, and discontinuing future grants under the
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), except in exceptional circumstances. The Committee believes that the proposed amendments will
better enable the Company to retain key talent, maintain market competitiveness and create a better linkage between shareholder value creation
and executive reward. Subject to shareholder approval, in 2004 (in respect of the 2003 bonus award) all executive directors will be eligible to
participate in a new annual bonus plan, the Bonus Share Plan (BSP), details of which can be found on page 27 of the full report. The BSP will
replace the Deferred Bonus Plan and the ESOS for executive directors. The new plan will require executives to invest a greater proportion 
of their remuneration in shares, thereby better aligning their interests with those of shareholders, and will encourage management at all levels 
to build up a personal stake in the Company.
The value of the annual bonus payable to executive directors will be calculated by reference to achievement against annual performance
targets. Bonus potentials will be set on an individual basis. For 2004, it is the intention of the Committee that the cash element will not exceed
75% of salary for the CEO and 60% of salary for other executive directors. The BSP will not be pensionable.
The performance measures for the BSP will include measures of corporate (and, where applicable, business unit) performance, as well as the
achievement of specific individual objectives. The corporate element is based on stretching Earnings Per Share (EPS) targets. The Committee 
will review measures annually to ensure they remain appropriate given the economic context and performance expectations for the Company
and its operating businesses, and are sufficiently stretching. It is the Committee’s usual policy to base 70% of each annual bonus award 
on the corporate or business unit measure, and the remaining 30% on key personal performance measures.
In the case of the directors and top tier of management, half of the bonus will be paid in cash, and half as a conditional award of Bonus 
Shares. To encourage retention, these shares will only vest if the participant remains in employment with the Group until the end of a three 
year holding period. 33 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 Summary remuneration report
SUMMARY REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED
An additional performance-related incentive will be provided in the form of an award of conditional Enhancement Shares at the same time as the
award of Bonus Shares. The maximum potential value of these shares is 75% of the face value of the Bonus Shares. It is the Committee’s
intention to make vesting of these shares conditional on the achievement of real EPS growth of between 9% and 15% over three years.
OTHER LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
As outlined above, subject to shareholder approval of the BSP, no further share option grants will be made to executive directors under the
ESOS, other than for specific recruitment purposes or in other exceptional circumstances. The Committee found that the significant impact 
of both foreign exchange rates and commodity price cycles on the Company’s share price resulted in share option payouts that were influenced
more by the phasing of the business cycle than by the management performance of option plan participants. This meant that the ESOS, from
time to time, was not always acting as an effective incentive. In 2004, only executive directors and top management (circa 50 individuals), will
participate in the BSP. In 2005, it is intended that participation will be extended to other tiers of management globally (circa 1,300 individuals),
who will thereafter cease to receive grants under the ESOS.
Under the Committee’s proposed new incentive arrangements, conditional long term incentive plan (LTIP) awards will continue to be made annually
to executive directors. These awards are discretionary, and are considered on a case-by-case basis. Following the review of the Company’s
incentive plans and in light of the replacement of the ESOS and Deferred Bonus Plan, primarily with the BSP, it is proposed that the value of
awards under the LTIP will be increased from 120% to 160% of basic salary for the CEO, and from 100% to 130% of basic salary for the other
executive directors.
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to the achievement of two stretching performance measures, relating to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
and to an operating measure, Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), over a fixed three year period. For awards made in 2004 and thereafter, 
half of each award made to an executive director will be subject to a Group TSR measure, and half will be subject to a Group ROCE measure.
The vesting of that part of the LTIP award contingent upon TSR performance varies according to the Company’s TSR over the performance
period, relative to a weighted basket of international natural resource companies (the Index). For awards made in 2003, the companies
constituting the Index were as follows and no material change is envisaged in 2004:
Mining Paper and Packaging Industrial Minerals
Category weighting 71% 17% 12%
Comparator companies BHP Billiton plc M-real Corporation Aggregate Industries plc
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce Sappi Limited CRH plc
Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc SCA Hanson plc
Kumba Resources Limited David S. Smith (Holdings) plc RMC Group plc
Noranda Inc Stora Enso Oyj
Rio Tinto plc UPM-Kymmene Group
Teck Cominco Limited
WMC Resources Limited
Xstrata plc
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executive directors by rewarding superior shareholder and financial performance 
and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in Anglo American. Within five years of their appointment, executive directors 
are expected to acquire a holding of shares with a value of two times’ basic salary in the case of the chief executive, and one times’ basic
salary in the case of other executive directors.

In view of A J Trahar, B E Davison and W A Nairn having no provision for past service in respect of their sterling-denominated pension fund,
their employing company has contractually agreed that supplementary pension contributions should be made to the Anglo American plc
International Approved Pension Scheme in return for these executives giving up their right to part of their future basic salary. The table above
shows these amounts, which are £81,000, £43,000 and £38,000 respectively.

Each director receives a car allowance or a fully expensed car and a limited amount of personal tax advice. All directors, with the exception
of W A Nairn, also receive medical insurance and death and disability insurance. A J Trahar, A W Lea and W A Nairn receive club membership;
in addition, A J Trahar receives a housing loan subsidy.
(3)
Subsequent to their retirement from the board, L Boyd, M W King and J Ogilvie Thompson have provided consultancy services to

The exercise of the options is subject to Anglo American’s EPS (calculated in accordance with FRS 14, based on the Company’s headline
earnings measure) increasing by at least 6% above the UK Retail Price Index over a three year period. The EPS growth requirement takes
account of the cyclical nature of the natural resources business.
(6)
Conditional awards of 240,639 have been made to executive directors under the LTIP during the year.
(7)
Conditional awards of 60,718 have been made under the Deferred Bonus Plan during the year. In addition, 15,344 awards vested to the

INDEPENDENT REMUNERATION REPORT REVIEW
This letter reports on the results of the review carried out by Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited of the processes followed by the 
Anglo American Remuneration Committee (the Committee) that support the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2003. Mercer undertook
the review at the request of the Chairman of the Committee in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes
followed are appropriate and that the Committee has complied with the policies set out in the Remuneration Report.
In order to reach our opinion, we reviewed the Committee’s Terms of Reference and the minutes of its meetings held during the year as well 
as material presented to the Committee for its review. We also interviewed the Chairman and Secretary of the Committee. Our review was not
intended to audit the compensation data set forth in the Remuneration Report or to evaluate the merits of Anglo American’s remuneration programme.
Based on our review, Mercer is of the opinion that the process followed by the Committee during 2003 was fully consistent with its Terms of
Reference and that the decisions taken by the Committee were in line with the principles set out in the Remuneration Report. It continues to be
our view that the Committee takes a suitably robust approach to its work. We would note in particular the changes to long term incentive
arrangements which have been proposed in response to dialogue held with institutional investors.
The Committee has implemented changes as a result of our 2002 review. The members of the Remuneration Committee have received training
and are regularly updated on executive compensation and corporate governance matters.
Further detail regarding the Mercer review is included in a letter of this date addressed to the Committee Chairman, which we understand 
will be made available on the Company’s website.

Operating profit for 2000 has been restated for the reclassification of the loss of $167 million arising on the anticipated disposal of Terra
Industries Inc. The disposal did not proceed and the loss has therefore been reclassified into operating exceptional items as an impairment.

EBITDA is operating profit before exceptional items plus depreciation and amortisation of subsidiaries and share of joint ventures and
associates.
(5)
EBITDA interest cover is EBITDA divided by net interest expense, excluding other net financial income (2003: $72 million) and exceptional
financing charges (2003: $13 million). EBITDA interest cover for 2002 is annualised to account for acquisitions during the year. The actual
EBITDA interest cover for 2002 was 25.5 times. For 2000 and 1999, EBITDA interest cover is not applicable as the Group was a net interest
recipient after adjusting for other net financial income.
(6)
Total capital is the sum of shareholders’ funds, net debt and minority interests.
(7)
Return on capital employed is calculated as total operating profit before impairments for the year divided by the average total capital less
other investments and adjusted for impairments. 36 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2003 Shareholder information

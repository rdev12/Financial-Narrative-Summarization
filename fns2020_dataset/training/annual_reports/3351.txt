Financial highlights
“  2009 was a very challenging year during which Charter acted quickly and resolutely 
to ensure both ESAB and Howden addressed the challenges of recession and 
dislocation in the financial markets, whilst continuing to invest in both businesses 
and to position them for future growth. 
 
We believe that the worst of the recession is behind us but the recovery is expected 
to be uneven across the many different regions in which Charter operates. ESAB is 
well positioned to benefit from any recovery in steel consumption and, whilst we 
expect Howden’ s results in 2010 to be a little softer than 2009, we expect growth 
to resume in 2011. 
 
Our decision to declare an increased dividend reflects Charter’ s robust performance 
in 2009, its strong balance sheet and the Board’ s confidence that both ESAB and 
Howden will make further progress in 2010.”

Chairman’s statement
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to be able to report that, despite 
the very challenging economic and financial 
conditions which prevailed during 2009, Charter 
traded profitably through the year and generated 
increased operating cash flow. This was largely 
due to the strength of its businesses and the 
speed with which they were able to respond to 
the change in trading conditions. Full details 
of Charter’ s results are presented on the 
following pages.
The Company announced on 19 February 2010 
that it had launched an investigation into possible 
irregular payments that may have been made in 
connection with an attempt to obtain business by 
an overseas Howden subsidiary in an emerging 
market. This came to light during an internal review 
of another matter that has been satisfactorily 
resolved. 
The Company has now completed its investigation 
into all matters of which it became aware. There is 
no clear evidence of any improper payments 
having been made although the relevant 
authorities have been notified where, on advice, 
this has been considered appropriate. We are 
absolutely committed to maintaining high ethical 
standards of business practice, and we expect the 
same from our employees, agents and others with 
whom we transact business. Steps are being 
taken to reinforce our existing compliance 
programmes to ensure these standards are 
maintained.
Board changes
During the year, there have been a number of 
Board changes.
We were delighted to welcome Manfred 
Wennemer who was appointed as a Non-
Executive Director with effect from 26 March 
2009. Until recently, he was Chief Executive of 
Continental AG, the international manufacturer of 
tyres and equipment for the automotive and 
transport industry.
James Bruce stood down as Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee at the Company’ s 
Annual General Meeting in April 2009. I am sure 
that Shareholders will join me and the rest of the 
Board in thanking James for his contribution and 
wishing him well for the future. Grey Denham has 
replaced him as the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.
There have also been some changes amongst 
the responsibilities of the Executive Directors. 
In order to more closely manage the restructuring 
of ESAB and its response to the economic 
downturn, Michael Foster took direct 
responsibility for ESAB in April 2009. James 
Deeley, previously Legal Director, became the 
Company’ s Commercial Director with effect 
from 26 March 2009, and in April also took on 
responsibility for ESAB’ s Standard Equipment, 
Automation and Cutting activities.
On 21 October 2009, Michael Hampson joined 
Charter as Company Secretary and General 
Counsel.
Dividend
In recognition of the Company’ s robust 
performance during 2009, its strong balance 
sheet and our confidence that both ESAB and 
Howden will make further progress in 2010, the 
Board has declared a second interim dividend of 
14.5 pence per share, increasing the total 
dividend in respect of 2009 to 21.5 pence. This 
compares with the total dividend of 21.0 pence 
per share which was paid in respect of 2008. 
It is anticipated that the dividend will be paid on 
7 May 2010 to holders of ordinary shares 
registered on 16 April 2010.
Going forwards, the Board will look to maintain 
and grow the dividend in a way which reflects the 
overall performance of the Company and the 
general economic and financial conditions in the 
principal markets in which the Company and its 
subsidiaries operate.
Concluding comments
The Board’ s review of the Company’ s strategy 
confirmed that Charter will continue to focus on the 
development of ESAB and Howden as a means of 
generating long-term value for shareholders. A key 
part of this will be to maintain Charter’ s financial 
strength, which will allow it to continue to invest in 
the growth of the businesses and, where the 
opportunity arises, to make acquisitions. 
The Board remains confident that the Company 
will make further progress in 2010 and that the 
long-term prospects of both businesses and the 
industries in which they operate remain strong.

Chairman 
23 March 2010
“ The total dividend has been 
increased to 21.5 pence 
per share.” 06      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive’s statement
In 2009, revenue was £1,659.2 million 
(2008: £1,887.0 million) and operating profit 
before exceptional items was £122.8 million 
(2008: £209.3 million). Adjusted earnings per 
share were 55.0 pence (2008: 99.2 pence). 
Cash flow from operations was £171.5 million 
(2008: £159.5 million), an increase of 7.5 per cent. 
Our determination to continue investing in our 
businesses was illustrated by capital expenditure 
of £60 million compared with depreciation of 
£26 million, and total expenditure on research and 
development of £17 million (2008: £13 million). 
The Board was extremely pleased with the manner 
in which the businesses responded to 2009, 
addressing unfolding events and circumstances 
with appropriate rapid responses and determination. 
It bodes well for the future of the Charter group of 
companies that the morale in the businesses 
remained high and that the staff were able to sustain 
the effort to effect long-term improvement in 
operations whilst simultaneously meeting severe 
short-term pressures.
In 2009, as the engineering and manufacturing 
sectors contracted at unprecedented rates in 
Western Europe and North America in particular, 
ESAB’ s revenue and operating profit decreased 
compared with 2008. In an uncertain economic 
climate, forward visibility was clouded but the overall 
result for the year was in line with the revised 
forecasts that were prepared during the second 
quarter of the year. 
During the year, Howden successfully executed the 
strong order book with which it started the year, 
booked new orders and continued to grow its 
aftermarket business. As a result, it achieved an 
operating profit which was broadly in line with the 
budget set by the Board at the start of the year.
The Board considers that the best measure of the 
extent to which Charter is generating shareholder 
value is adjusted earnings per share, which excludes 
exceptional and other items considered by the Board 
to be not directly related to underlying performance. 
Adjusted earnings per share in the year of 55.0 
pence were slightly ahead of the revised forecast 
prepared during the second quarter of the year, but 
behind the original budget. The Board is also 
focused on the cash generated from operations 
during the year which amounted to £171.5 million 
(2008: £159.5 million), an increase of 7.5 per cent.
“ Charter demonstrated resilience 
and flexibility as it responded to the 
difficult financial and trading conditions 
of 2009 in which both businesses 
demonstrated their ability to continue 
to generate profits and cash.”

We also believe that the results for 2009 should be 
seen within the context of the progress which 
Charter has made over the past five years. You will 
find set out on pages 10 and 11 charts which 
illustrate how some of our principal measures of 
business performance have moved over this period.
Charter’s  strategy
Charter recognises that both ESAB and Howden 
are market leaders in their respective industries with 
the potential for further development.
In the current economic environment, we will drive 
operational improvement and cost management, 
whilst investing in the technology and infrastructure 
which these businesses need to maintain their 
positions of leadership and to deliver increasing 
value to their customers as the recovery unfolds.
We believe that both businesses have been 
growing their shares of the principal markets in 
which they operate and have the capability to 
continue to do so through continued emphasis on 
customer service, technical competence and 
increasingly global footprints.
By maintaining a strong balance sheet, Charter will 
ensure that ESAB and Howden will have the 
financial resources which the businesses need in 
order to meet their goal of returning to the strong 
growth achieved before the onset of the recession 
towards the end of 2008.
Review  of  2009  2009 saw dramatic reductions in levels of industrial 
activity in many regions around the world, the 
impact of which was heightened by the continuing 
shortage of credit as the financial system struggled 
to recover. T owards the end of the year, there were 
signs that the worst is behind us, but various 
regions, including the USA and Western Europe, 
remained generally weak throughout the year and 
the timing and extent of widespread economic 
recovery remains uncertain. 
Within this economic environment, the impact on 
ESAB was more immediate and, whilst Howden 
was generally able to maintain levels of activity, it 
suffered from a falling order intake. 
ESAB
The severe economic downturn had a significant 
impact on the results for the year with revenue 
down by 18 per cent and operating profit before 
exceptional items down by 57 per cent, or by 
28 per cent and 65 per cent respectively at 
constant currencies. Despite this, ESAB remained 
profitable in every major region and generated 
significant cash flow. 
Volumes of welding consumables for the year as a 
whole were down by around one-quarter compared 
with 2008. After a sharp reversal in the fourth 
quarter of 2008, volumes were generally stable in 
the first quarter of 2009 but then slipped again in the 
second quarter. Volumes in the second half of the 
year did not show any sustained improvement.
Whilst average net selling prices of consumables 
trended downwards during the year, generally 
reflecting the pass through of lower steel costs, 
ESAB’ s pro-active product and brand management 
enabled it to maintain premium pricing for its 
products in many markets in which it operates and 
on average for the year as a whole prices remained 
slightly ahead of 2008.
Revenue in the standard equipment business was 
down by around 40 per cent for the year as a whole, 
and finished the year without there having been any 
real signs of recovery in the key European and North 
American markets, although various emerging 
markets did start to recover as the year progressed. 
Engineered automation had a generally stable year, 
reflecting the relatively large proportion of its sales 
which are made to the energy industry. In the first half 
of the year, the cutting business reported higher 
revenues than in 2008, but with lower margins, whilst 
markedly lower order intake led to much reduced 
levels of activity in the second half of the year and a 
consequent negative impact on the business’ s 
profitability. Low levels of activity are likely to continue 
in cutting for some time to come. 
We responded to the lower levels of demand by 
implementing restructuring measures to reduce 
capacity and to achieve lasting improvements in the 
operational efficiency of the business. These 
measures saved over £50 million of costs during the 
year, and resulted in exceptional charges in ESAB for 
the year of £24 million. Some £6 million of exceptional 
costs which we previously envisaged being incurred 
in 2009 have been carried over into 2010. 
ESAB’ s adjusted operating margin for the year was 
6.3 per cent. After a difficult second quarter, margin 
performance generally improved during the second 
half of the year, led by the consumables business, 
but was offset by the deterioration in the cutting 
business. The outcome for the year, whilst 
appreciably below the level achieved in 2008, 
was ahead of the trough margin of 5.7 per cent 
recorded in 2001, despite the much larger volume 
reductions seen in 2009.
“Despite the severe economic 
downturn, ESAB remained 
profitable in every major 
region and generated 
significant cash flow.” 08      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive’s statement
continued
During 2009, various senior management changes 
were implemented within ESAB. In order to more 
directly oversee ESAB’ s restructuring and response 
to the downturn, I took over executive 
responsibilities for ESAB in April at which time 
Jon T empleman stood down from his position as 
CEO of ESAB Global and left the business. Also at 
that time, James Deeley, Charter’ s Commercial 
Director, additionally took on the responsibility for 
ESAB’ s Standard Equipment, Automation and 
Cutting activities. We are taking additional steps to 
strengthen certain of ESAB’ s central functions to 
further improve its ability to respond to changes in its 
markets and to deliver customer focused solutions 
as well as levels of customer service. 
Howden
Against a difficult economic and financial backdrop, 
Howden delivered another strong set of results with 
almost unchanged revenue of £627.8 million 
(2008: £627.2 million) and operating profit 
before exceptional items of £70.5 million 
(2008: £73.1 million), a decrease of 4 per cent. 
The results were assisted by favourable exchange 
rate movements; at constant currencies, revenue 
and operating profit before exceptional items fell by 
13 per cent and 19 per cent respectively.
A particular feature of the results was the strong 
growth in the aftermarket business, where revenues 
increased by 17 per cent to £189 million, representing 
30 per cent of Howden’ s total revenues. 
The opening order book proved to be robust, with 
order cancellations during the year amounting to 
only £11 million. 
Order intake during the year of £514 million was 
down by 23 per cent compared with 2008. This 
primarily reflected weak order intake from the power 
sector in China, where electricity demand in the 
early part of the year was lower than in 2008, and in 
the USA, where weak economic and financial 
conditions combined with uncertainty over the new 
administration’ s policies on energy and 
environmental protection. 
Howden’ s order book gives it good visibility over 
future levels of activity and allows it to manage 
changes in levels of manned capacity. During 2009, 
restructuring measures, which are expected to lead 
to cost savings in 2010 of £8 million, led to an 
exceptional charge of £2 million. As a result of these 
measures, manned capacity has been brought into 
line with the levels of demand which the business 
expects to see during 2010. 
I am delighted that Howden’ s successes in recent 
years have been recognised by the business 
community. Howden was named by the British 
Chamber of Commerce as the UK Company of the 
Year 2009. 
Balance sheet and cash flow
As at 31 December 2009, shareholders’ funds were 
£550 million and Charter had net cash balances of 
£51 million. It remains our intention to maintain the 
Company’ s balance sheet strength. 
The prevailing economic and financial conditions 
increased focus on cash generation and control of 
working capital. During the year, cash inflow from 
operations was £171.5 million (2008: £159.5 million). 
During the year, Charter extended its financing 
facilities and presently has committed facilities of 
£170 million with maturity dates between 2011 and 
2013, which were undrawn at the end of the year.
2010  outlook
ESAB
ESAB has started the year with overall volumes of 
consumables generally in line with the volumes seen 
in the comparable period in 2009. There are some 
signs of modest improvements in volumes, but the 
performance between regions varies. Europe is 
generally patchy with no clear trends yet emerging; 
Southern Europe is weak and Western Europe 
remains flat but sales to Russia are recovering; 
Central Europe is benefiting from higher levels of 
activity in the automotive sector, but weakness in 
shipbuilding will continue which will impact sales to 
Germany, Poland and elsewhere. We are seeing an 
improving performance in South America, led by 
Brazil, and in India. We expect South-East Asia to 
trend positively, but performance between individual 
countries will vary. Oil and gas projects will drive the 
Middle East and we expect ESAB’ s sales into Africa 
will continue to grow. The economy in North 
America remains amongst the weaker performers, 
although ESAB’ s presence there is supported by 
strong positions in sectors which are proving to be 
more resilient, such as energy. 
In October 2009, The World Steel Association (‘WSA’) 
published a forecast for 2010 growth of 13.1 per cent 
in the consumption of steel for the world excluding 
China, which, if achieved, should lead to a similar 
increase in the demand for welding consumables. 
We have reinstated certain amounts of capacity in 
response to an improved outlook, but at present this 
is limited to specific geographies and products. 
Generally, we believe that ESAB’ s manned capacity is 
in line with current levels of demand, and ESAB has 
“Howden delivered another 
strong set of results with 
operating profit before 
exceptional items of 
£70.5 million.” Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    09
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
the flexibility to restore manned capacity quickly and 
cheaply as and when levels of demand warrant it. 
Selling prices of welding consumables are being 
maintained and, as demand for steel recovers, we 
expect to see some price escalation later in the year. 
On the equipment side, we see demand for 
standard equipment taking longer to recover, 
despite the more positive trends we are seeing in 
some developing markets. During the year, ESAB 
will introduce a new range of standard equipment. 
We see good prospects for engineered automation, 
with its significant exposure to the energy industry, 
despite some softening in order intake at the end of 
2009. We do not expect any discernable recovery in 
the cutting business to be seen before 2011. 
We will continue to take steps to ensure that ESAB 
emerges from the downturn as a stronger company.
We will maintain capital expenditure at levels well 
ahead of depreciation, but with the focus on 
improving customer service and business efficiency. 
Additions to capacity will be selective and in 
response to specific opportunities. We will also 
continue to invest in research and development. 
Overall, we believe that the restructuring measures 
already taken in response to the economic 
downturn will bring long-term benefits to the 
business and result in permanent cost savings of 
around £10 million, representing additional margin of 
about 1 per cent. 
During 2010, we envisage further restructuring 
measures, including in relation to the European 
supply chain and the cutting business where 
demand conditions remain depressed. T aking these 
into account and, as noted above, the charge of 
£6 million carried over from 2009, we expect the 
total exceptional charge in 2010 to be around 
£15 million.
Howden
After a very robust business performance in 2009, 
Howden’ s order book at 1 January 2010 stood at 
£441 million, of which £340 million is for delivery in 
2010 and the remaining £101 million thereafter. 
Allowing for some element of ‘book and bill’, we 
anticipate new equipment sales being slightly below 
the record levels seen in 2008 and 2009, and we 
have taken steps to reduce manned capacity in 
Howden accordingly. 
Growth in Howden’ s aftermarket activities, which we 
expect to continue in 2010, will partially offset lower 
sales of new equipment and, together with the 
flexibility of its business model, means that 
Howden’ s margin in 2010 should be only slightly 
lower than the level achieved in 2008 and 2009.
T owards the end of 2009, enquiry levels showed 
signs of picking up which we hope will be reflected 
in higher bookings in 2010 and lead to a resumption 
of growth in new equipment sales in 2011. 
Concluding  comments  2009 was a very challenging year during which 
Charter acted quickly and resolutely to ensure both 
ESAB and Howden addressed the challenges of 
recession and dislocation in the financial markets, 
whilst continuing to invest in both businesses and to 
position them for future recovery and growth.
We believe that the worst of the recession is behind 
us although we do not expect the recovery to be 
smooth or even across the many different regions in 
which Charter operates. We expect both ESAB and 
Howden to make further progress in 2010 and to 
perform well against the principal markets in which 
they operate. ESAB is well positioned to benefit 
from any recovery in steel consumption and, whilst 
we expect Howden’ s results in 2010 to be a little 
softer than 2009, we expect bookings to recover 
and growth to resume in 2011. 
Looking further ahead, we expect the long-term 
dynamics of rising energy demand and steel usage 
to prevail, and ESAB and Howden each have the 
market positions, people and assets required to 
continue to deliver superior value to Charter 
shareholders in the future.

How our principal measures of 
business performance have moved over 
the last five years
Chief Executive’s statement
continued
Adjusted  operating  profit
Description  of  measure
Adjusted operating profit measures the success 
we are having at increasing revenues net of 
increases in the cost of employees, goods and 
other services which we are incurring. We adjust 
operating profit to exclude the impact of unusual 
or non-recurring items, such as restructuring 
costs, which we believe is appropriate to give a 
truer picture of underlying performance. 
Performance
Adjusted operating profit grew consistently up to 
2009, when it fell as ESAB suffered deteriorating 
trading conditions and despite restructuring 
measures which saved over £50 million during 
the year, whilst Howden’ s profit fell only slightly.
Operating  margin
Description  of  measure
Operating margin measures the rate at which 
revenue changed relative to the rate at which 
operating profit (before exceptional items) changed. 
Whilst the operating margin may move for a variety 
of reasons, such as changes in geographic or 
product mix, the actual operating margin achieved 
against the expected level is one of our principal 
measures of underlying performance.
Performance
Charter’ s operating margin improved until 2008, 
when the onset of the economic recession in the 
second half of the year led to the margin for the 
year as a whole easing. In 2009, the operating 
margin fell further reflecting the downturn in 
ESAB’ s business, whilst Howden’ s operating 
margin remained in excess of 11 per cent. 
Howden  order  book
Description  of  measure
Howden’ s order book gives good visibility of new 
equipment sales and also gross margin for the 
following 12 to 18 months. Movements in the 
order book can be used as a leading indicator 
of Howden’ s performance relative to the market, 
and also to manage changes in capacity levels.
Performance
Howden’ s order book consistently grew until 
2009 when, despite the severe economic 
conditions prevailing, Howden continued to book 
orders but at levels slightly below its sales, leading 
to a modest fall in the order book during the year. 
Cash  flow  from  operations
Description  of  measure
We monitor cash flow from operations, but in 
doing so, we set targets which recognise that, 
as businesses grow, they tend to absorb cash 
into working capital. Our measure of cash flow 
from operations takes into account certain 
non-recurring items including expenditure on 
restructuring. 
 
Performance
Throughout the period, Charter has successfully 
increased the amount of cash generated from 
its operations. Cash flow from operations 
continued to improve in 2009, despite the fall in 
revenue and profit, as there was an increased 
focus on the control of working capital in 
particular in ESAB. 
Revenue
Description  of  measure
Revenue growth measures the success which 
we are having at increasing the volume of 
products sold and changes in the prices at which 
we are able to sell them. Revenue growth helps 
us to determine whether we are gaining or losing 
market share by region, product or end-user 
segment. 
Performance
Charter achieved strong revenue growth in both 
businesses until 2009. In 2009, ESAB’ s revenue 
fell, as the economic recession led to lower 
sales of consumables and equipment. Howden 
maintained its revenue in 2009, reflecting the 
strength of its opening order book, further growth 
in aftermarket revenues and favourable exchange 
rate movements.

Adjusted  earnings  per  share
Description  of  measure
Adjusted earnings per share shows the 
net profit generated for shareholders in an 
accounting period, after taking into account 
financing and tax. The measure is defined so as 
to exclude exceptional charges or income and 
other items considered by the Board to be not 
directly related to the underlying performance of 
our businesses.
Performance
Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled 
between 2005 and 2008. In 2009, adjusted 
earnings per share fell but still remained well 
above the figure achieved in 2005.
Equity  shareholders’  funds
Description  of  measure
Equity shareholders’ funds reflect the value of net 
assets available to shareholders. It is a measure 
of the strength of Charter’ s balance sheet 
and reflects the value of Charter’ s current and 
non-current assets and liabilities, including its net 
cash/(debt) position. 
Performance
Charter’ s balance sheet has strengthened 
considerably over the period, with equity 
shareholders’ funds increasing more than 
four-fold. During this time, the Company has 
moved from a position of modest net debt 
to net cash, despite a period of high capital 
expenditure, acquisitions financed out of cash 
flow and the resumption of dividend payments.
Capital  expenditure
Description  of  measure
The absolute level of capital expenditure and 
its relationship to the depreciation charge are 
indications of the extent to which Charter 
is investing in the productive capacity of its 
businesses, which might include increasing 
the absolute capacity of the businesses or 
measures to improve operating efficiency or 
customer service. 
Performance
Throughout the period, Charter’ s capital 
expenditure has been significantly in excess 
of depreciation as it has increased its global 
manufacturing capacity. Capital expenditure has 
been higher in ESAB than in Howden, reflecting 
in part their respective business models and 
relative sizes.
Lost  time  injury  frequency  rate
Description  of  measure
We recognise that financial performance is not 
a sufficient measure on its own. We operate in 
heavy engineering environments where there is 
considerable inherent risk and the safety of our 
employees is a key priority. We use a variety of 
measures, including Lost Time Injury Frequency 
Rate (‘LTIFR’), to assess the effectiveness of our 
health and safety performance.
Performance
LTIFR fell by around one-half during the period 
from 2007 to 2009 in which data has been 
systematically collected and verified, underlining 
Charter’ s commitment to employee welfare. 
Further information on our health and safety 
performance are set out in the Corporate 
responsibility report on pages 36 to 41.

Description  of  measure
Charter recognises that its technology is an 
important factor in maintaining the leadership 
of its products in the competitive markets in 
which it operates. Research and development 
expenditure is written off as incurred, except that 
certain development expenditure is capitalised as 
required by IAS 38.
Performance
Research and development expenditure has 
increased over the period including in 2009. 
The majority of this expenditure has been in 
ESAB. Howden engineers bespoke solutions 
for particular customers’ air and gas handling 
requirements but this expenditure is generally not 
classified as ‘research and development’.

ESAB  strategy
ESAB’ s strategic objective is to generate significant growth in 
revenue and profit over the next five years through building upon 
its position as the world’ s leading company in welding 
consumables and its strong global positions in welding and 
cutting equipment. In pursuit of this objective, ESAB will 
undertake the following measures:
 ■ ESAB will enhance its market leadership by leveraging its 
broad product range in all its markets globally as well as by 
further investment in brand recognition and customer service. 
ESAB is recognised as the welding authority and, in support of 
this, will continue to develop initiatives such as its worldwide 
network of process centres; 
 ■ ESAB will use its research and development facilities to 
develop highly customer-focused products to enhance its 
leading position in welding technology, in particular through 
the development of new welding materials and equipment 
such as the telescopic boom and robotic friction stir welding; 
 ■ ESAB will build upon its leading position in Europe and other 
developed markets to achieve growth at above market rates 
through continued customer focus, improved supply infrastructure 
and new products, particularly for the energy sector;
 ■ In relation to developing markets, ESAB is the market leader 
in South America and India, and will continue to grow in 
Russia where it is the leading international welding company. 
ESAB has a new strategy to build a meaningful presence in 
China, and will target other markets in Asia and elsewhere, 
such as Africa;
 ■ ESAB will target specifically those welding-intensive end-user 
segments, such as nuclear, pipelines, wind energy, off-shore 
and transport, which are seen as offering particular growth 
opportunities; and
 ■ ESAB will look to act as a consolidator in the global welding 
industry, using acquisitions to strengthen market positions, 
enter new markets and improve its technology base.
ESAB’ s physical manufacturing capacity is generally seen as 
being sufficient for its immediate requirements, but selective 
capacity increases may be required to meet specific product or 
geographic shortages. Investment will also be made in 
increasing manufacturing efficiencies and in measures to 
improve customer service.
About  ESAB
ESAB’s comprehensive range of welding consumables 
includes electrodes, cored and solid wires, and fluxes. 
ESAB’s welding and cutting equipment ranges from 
standard equipment to large bespoke plant used in 
industrial applications. 
In 2009, ESAB derived over 80 per cent of its sales from 
welding consumables and standard welding equipment. 
The energy sector, including oil and gas, nuclear and 
renewables, is the largest user of ESAB products and is 
estimated to account for around one-quarter of revenue.
ESAB’s sales are split broadly evenly between 
developed and emerging economies. ESAB is the clear 
market leader in Europe, South America and India. 
It is the largest international welding company in
Russia and is developing its position in Africa, China 
and elsewhere in Asia. 
ESAB’s manufacturing facilities are located 
predominantly in low cost locations, in particular in 
Central Europe, South America and Asia. Following a 
sharp reduction of demand in the fourth quarter of 2008, 
restructuring measures saved over £50 million of 
operating costs; however, towards the end of 2009, 
steps were taken to restore some manned capacity in 
anticipation of a recovery in demand in certain markets. 
During the downturn, ESAB has maintained its focus on 
customer service, as illustrated by it being named by 
Frost & Sullivan as ‘best global partner in welding and 
cutting systems for energy generation’.
 ■ Restructuring measures reduced headcount by 17 per cent 
and led to cost savings in excess of £50 million
 ■ Continued capital expenditure and investment in research 
and development expenditure 
 ■ Revenue for the year of £1,031.4 million (2008: 
£1,259.8 million) and operating profit before exceptional 
items of £64.5 million (2008: £148.6 million)
 ■ Operating margin of 6.3 per cent, with an improving 
performance in consumables offset by a progressive 
deterioration in cutting
 ■ The welding consumables and equipment businesses are 
well placed to recover during 2010 but further restructuring 
may be required in cutting.

Business and financial review – ESAB 
continued
Overview  of  performance
In a year of unprecedented declines in industrial 
production in virtually every economy, ESAB saw 
reductions in revenue and profit, but, due to a 
series of strong measures undertaken to reduce 
costs, remained profitable and cash generative. 
In 2009, ESAB generated revenue of £1,031.4 
million (2008: £1,259.8 million), a reduction of 
18.1 per cent. Of this reduction, 22.9 per cent 
came from the welding business (consumables 
and standard equipment) and 4.8 per cent from 
the cutting and automation businesses, whilst 
currency movements, in particular the weakening 
of sterling against the euro and the US dollar, 
added 9.6 per cent.
Operating profit before exceptional items was 
£64.5 million (2008: £148.6 million), a reduction 
of 56.6 per cent (64.9 per cent at constant 
currency). The operating margin for the year was 
6.3 per cent (2008: 11.8 per cent). 
Restructuring measures, which were 
progressively implemented from October 2008 
onwards, reduced headcount by some 1,600 
employees (equivalent to 17 per cent of ESAB’ s 
workforce at that time) and saved in excess of 
£50 million and led to a restructuring charge for 
the year of £24 million. T owards the end of the 
year, some headcount was selectively restored 
in response to the improving outlook in 
certain markets.
Volumes of welding consumables for the year as 
a whole were down by around one-quarter 
compared with 2008. After a sharp reversal in the 
fourth quarter of 2008, volumes were generally 
stable in the first quarter of 2009. There were 
further general declines in volume during the 
second quarter, but thereafter volumes generally 
stabilised. A number of customers in Europe 
and North America took longer than usual 
Christmas breaks which adversely impacted 
December volumes. 
Whilst average net selling prices of consumables 
trended downwards during the year, generally 
reflecting the pass through of lower steel costs, 
ESAB’ s pro-active product and brand 
management enabled it to maintain premium 
pricing for its products in many markets in which 
it operates and on average for the year as a 
whole prices remained slightly ahead of 2008.
The strength of demand from different end-user 
segments varied with energy remaining reasonably 
strong throughout the year, automotive being very 
weak in the first half of the year but showing some 
signs of recovery in the second half, and 
shipbuilding, especially in Europe, declining 
markedly in the second half of the year.
Volumes of standard equipment were generally 
weak throughout the year, with revenues down 
by about 40 per cent compared with 2008, in 
response to which manned capacity was cut by 
around one-half. However, towards the end of 
the year, there were some signs of recovery in 
South America, India and other emerging 
markets. The engineered automation business, 
which makes a significant proportion of its sales 
into the energy industry, maintained revenues 
and, despite a dip in its order book at the 
year-end, has a reasonable outlook. 
The cutting business had increased revenue in 
the first half of the year, albeit with lower margins, 
as a consequence of the order book with which it 
started the year. However, a significant 
deterioration in the market for cutting equipment 
led to sharply lower order intake and to a fall in 
revenue in the second half of the year which 
severely impacted profitability. With order intake 
remaining weak, the cutting business is likely to 
remain difficult throughout 2010 and further 
restructuring measures will be required. 
ESAB’ s overall margin performance, having been 
adequate in the first quarter, slipped during the 
second quarter as consumables volumes, 
especially in Europe, fell and there was some 
short-term weakness in pricing. In the second 
half of the year, margins recovered, led by the 
consumables business, but offset by the 
deterioration in the cutting business and, to a 
lesser extent, the extended Christmas 
shutdowns amongst customers in Europe and 
North America. 
By the end of the year, most regions in which 
ESAB operates appeared to have been through 
the bottom of the cycle, although the economies 
of some regions, such as Western and Southern 
Europe and the USA, continued to suffer varying 
degrees of weakness. Signs of recovery were 
patchy, with South America, India and Russia 
amongst the more positive regions. 
During 2009, ESAB’s revenues declined by 18.1 per cent. Of this, welding 
consumables and standard equipment led to a decline of 22.9 per cent 
and cutting and automation led to a decline of 4.8 per cent, offset by 
a positive contribution from exchange movements of 9.6 per cent. 
The decline in welding was primarily attributable to lower volumes of 
consumables which fell 24 per cent during the year . Price movements and 
mix in relation to welding consumables led to small positive variances.

Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
Despite the economic conditions, ESAB has 
continued to invest in its business. Capital 
expenditure amounted to £40 million, slightly 
below the level seen in 2008 but still well ahead 
of depreciation; significant expenditure during 
the year took place in relation to selective 
re‑equipping and additions to various factories, 
a new warehouse in the Middle East, land 
purchase and upgrades to IT systems. 
Research and development expenditure 
increased to £15.5 million (2008: £12.1 million), 
representing 1.5 per cent of revenue. 
ESAB  restructuring
In the face of the economic downturn and 
significant reductions in the demand for welding 
consumables and equipment which first took 
place in October 2008, ESAB took significant 
steps to restructure its business, in particular 
through reductions in manned capacity, factory 
closures and mothballing, improved procurement 
of materials and services, and reductions in 
overheads, whilst protecting the longer‑ term 
potential of the business. 
Following the downturn of demand which started 
in October 2008, some 1,600 employees 
(representing 17 per cent of ESAB’ s permanent 
workforce at that time) left the company. By the 
middle of the year, manned capacity had been 
reduced by around one‑ third in consumables 
and by around one‑ half in equipment to bring it 
into line with the levels of prevailing demand. 
As part of this process, three consumables 
factories (in Finland, Sweden and Italy) were 
closed during the year. Equipment from the 
closed factories is being re‑ installed in other 
ESAB factories, meaning that physical capacity 
will be little changed. T wo further factories (an 
equipment factory in China and a consumables 
factory in Italy) were mothballed.
However, by the end of the year, to reflect the 
improving outlook in certain markets, some 
manned capacity had been restored and steps 
had been taken to resume production at the 
mothballed Italian consumables factory. 
The opportunity is also being taken to restructure 
ESAB’ s equipment factory in the USA, with 
production being transferred to other ESAB 
factories where spare capacity can be utilised. 
Customer service and marketing facilities for the 
North American market are being retained locally.
Overall, the restructuring measures achieved cost 
savings of over £50 million in 2009. The extent to 
which these cost savings recur in 2010 will 
depend on how much manned capacity is 
restored during the year to meet higher levels of 
demand, but it is expected that the measures will 
lead to permanent margin enhancement of 
around 1 per cent. The restructuring measures 
resulted in an exceptional charge for the year of 
£24 million, together with a further £6 million of 
costs which have been carried over into 2010.
ESAB management will continue to monitor 
capacity levels against demand and make further 
capacity adjustments where necessary. Manned 
capacity can be restored quickly and at relatively 
low cost, for example through overtime, new 
shifts or the introduction of contract labour. 
On the basis that the worst of the recession has 
passed, further general reductions in capacity are 
not anticipated except in the cutting business 
which is expected to continue to face difficult 
trading conditions. 
During 2010, ESAB will take further steps to 
ensure that it emerges from the downturn as a 
stronger company, including a programme of 
capital expenditure and continued investment in 
research and development. ESAB will continue to 
restructure its European supply chain and to take 
other measures to improve business efficiency. 
Within the cutting business, certain additional 
restructuring is likely to be necessary as demand 
conditions are expected to remain depressed, 
and, as noted above, restructuring charges of 
£6 million have been carried over from 2009. 
T aking all these into account, it is expected that 
there will be a total exceptional charge in 2010 of 
around £15 million.
Industry  overview  Market size and end-user segments
In 2009, the global welding and cutting industry 
had total revenue estimated at US$13 billion, 
divided approximately equally between welding 
consumables and welding and cutting 
equipment. In addition, the total market for 
welding robots and associated automation 
products amounted to US$3 billion. 
The  Hybrid  Laser  Process
Advanced MIG/MAG welding solutions for use with high power lasers.
By increasing the arc welding power it is possible to utilise high power 
lasers in industrial manufacturing processes. The extra power facilitates 
higher welding speeds and increased weld penetration, opening up 
new potential such as the welding of thick steel structures.

Business and financial review – ESAB 
continued
The major global end-user segments are as 
follows: 
 ■ the energy sector, which includes the oil and 
gas industries and electricity generation (from 
conventional, nuclear and renewable sources) 
and transmission, is estimated to account for 
25.5 per cent of industry revenue; 
 ■ infrastructure construction, such as the building 
of light rail networks, sewerage systems and 
other public works, is estimated to account for 
18 per cent; 
 ■ the transport segment, which includes original 
equipment manufacturers of cars and 
commercial vehicles and related component 
suppliers, as well as ‘off road’ vehicles such 
as excavators, dumpers and agricultural 
equipment, and railway rolling stock 
(estimated to account for 14 per cent); and
 ■ shipyards, producing ships for commercial 
and naval customers (estimated to account for 
9 per cent). 
In addition, welding and cutting take place in 
many other industries where steel is used in the 
manufacture process; together these applications 
are estimated to account for 33.5 per cent of the 
industry’ s revenues. 
Demand
Demand for welding and cutting products is 
determined largely by the consumption of steel 
and, to a lesser but growing extent, of other 
metals, such as aluminium and advanced alloys. 
China is the largest producer and consumer 
of steel but accounts for only around 3 per cent 
of ESAB’ s revenues. Accordingly, ESAB 
management typically considers the demand 
environment for ESAB products by reviewing 
worldwide production and consumption of steel 
excluding China.
The most recent estimate by the World Steel 
Association (‘WSA’) is that, excluding China, 
worldwide consumption of steel in 2009 was 
577 mmt (2008: 764 mmt), a reduction of 
24 per cent which is unprecedented. All major 
regions suffered significant falls, with EU (27) and 
the USA down by 33 per cent and 39 per cent 
respectively. Apart from China, where consumption 
is estimated to have increased by 19 per cent to 
526 mmt (representing 48 per cent of worldwide 
steel consumption) and India, no major country 
recorded an increase in consumption. 
The WSA’ s most recent forecast (published in 
October 2009) is that steel consumption in 2010 
will recover but not by enough to offset the 
reductions experienced during 2009, with 
worldwide consumption (excluding China) 
expected to increase by 13.1 per cent. 
Consumption in EU (27) and the USA is expected 
to increase by 12 per cent and 19 per cent 
respectively compared to 2009. By contrast, the 
growth of steel consumption in China is forecast 
to slow to 5 per cent. 
ESAB expects that, as a general rule, any 
recovery in steel consumption would lead to a 
similar percentage increase in the demand for 
welding consumables. On the basis of the WSA 
forecasts, ESAB would also expect that demand 
for standard welding equipment would start to 
show generalised signs of recovery during 2010. 
The market for cutting equipment is seen as 
longer-cycle and is expected to remain weak 
beyond 2010. Demand for engineered 
automation equipment from the oil and gas, 
nuclear and renewables segments of the energy 
industry will reflect the long-term dynamics of 
rising energy demand. 
Competitive environment
Globally, ESAB is the leading supplier of welding 
consumables. It is the only worldwide, full service 
welding and cutting company and is also the 
clear industry leader outside North America 
where it ranks behind the two market leaders. 
ESAB operates in a competitive environment, 
consisting of a relatively small number of 
companies that operate on a multinational basis 
and a much larger number of smaller companies 
which operate in regional or product niches.
ESAB estimates that it has a 12 per cent share, 
by value, of the available global welding and 
cutting market. ESAB believes that, despite the 
turbulence seen in its Western European and 
North American markets in 2009, it at least 
maintained its global market share due to its 
continued efforts to enhance customer service, 
production facilities and product development, 
and as certain competitors were financially or 
operationally less well positioned to respond to 
the challenges presented by the economic and 
financial conditions prevailing during the year. 
Over the longer term, ESAB expects to maintain 
and progressively strengthen its global market 
share, despite the potential threat of low cost 
In 2009, the energy segment, including oil and gas, 
power and pipelines, was the largest end-user segment 
accounting for an estimated 25.5 per cent of industry 
revenues. Other major end-user segments were 
infrastructure construction (18 per cent), automotive 
and mobile machinery (14 per cent) and shipbuilding 
(9 per cent). All other users, including repair and 
maintenance, accounted for the remaining 33.5 per cent.

manufacturers looking to increase their shares of 
markets in which ESAB has an established 
position, due to a number of factors including:
 ■ its brand; 
 ■ its industry-leading technology; 
 ■ its extensive product portfolio in both 
consumables and equipment; 
 ■ the governmental and other certifications it 
possesses for many different specialist and 
demanding applications; 
 ■ its manufacturing facilities which are generally 
modern and located in low cost areas; 
 ■ its well-established and wide-ranging 
distribution network and supply chain; and 
 ■ the financial strength of Charter. 
ESAB aims to be a consolidator in the relatively 
fragmented worldwide welding industry and will 
look to make acquisitions which build its 
geographic strength, increase its presence in 
markets where it is currently under-represented 
or give access to new technologies, provided 
that the terms of the acquisition are expected to 
be value accretive for Charter shareholders. 
ESAB  supply  chain
Manufacturing locations
ESAB has manufacturing facilities in each of the 
regions in which it operates. With the principal 
exceptions of the USA and various specialist 
units in Western Europe, the facilities are 
generally located in low cost areas. 
ESAB’ s global capacity for the manufacture of 
welding consumables amounts to approximately 
700,000 tonnes annually, after taking into account 
the re-commissioning of equipment removed from 
factories which were closed during the year.
ESAB expects to continue to invest in its 
manufacturing facilities at a rate in excess of 
the annual depreciation charge. With existing 
physical capacity likely to be sufficient for the 
foreseeable future, the emphasis will be on 
improving operational efficiencies and 
customer service. 
Raw materials
The principal raw material used in the 
manufacture of welding consumables is steel 
and to a lesser extent, aluminium alloys, 
chemicals and minerals. Following rapid price 
escalations during 2008, steel prices generally 
eased throughout 2009.
In the case of welding equipment, automation 
and cutting, the most significant items purchased 
are electronic components, copper and 
aluminium alloys.
Human resources
A skilled and motivated management team and 
workforce are seen as key to ESAB achieving its 
strategic objectives. The great majority of 
personnel are employees, although periodic use 
is made of temporary or contract workers, 
particularly to cope with periods of higher 
demand. As noted elsewhere, restructuring 
measures have led to headcount reductions 
across the business. 
Intellectual property 
ESAB has accumulated large amounts of 
intellectual property which represents one of its 
principal competitive advantages and a major 
barrier to competitors seeking to enter its markets.
Intellectual property includes, in relation to 
welding consumables, the formulation of the 
electrode coatings or cored wire fillings required 
for different welding applications and the 
manufacturing process knowledge which ESAB 
has developed. 
ESAB is continuing to develop all aspects of its 
welding and cutting expertise through its 
research facilities in Sweden and elsewhere in the 
world which together employ some 250 people. 
ESAB’ s intellectual property also includes the 
certifications which it holds from governmental 
and private sector bodies around the world 
which are generally required for critical 
welding applications. 
ESAB’ s customers can access its accumulated 
welding knowledge through a network of 
process centres throughout the world staffed 
by ESAB welding engineers who can assist in 
developing the optimal welding solutions for 
individual customers.

Wind  towers
ESAB has been involved with the wind tower industry for many years, 
designing and developing solutions to meet the consistently increasing 
demand for higher quality and productivity. T oday 80 per cent of all 
towers in service worldwide have been manufactured using ESAB 
technology.
Throughout the world, ESAB has partnered with manufacturers of wind 
towers, foundation piles and transition pieces, for land based, offshore 
or arctic service. ESAB solutions range from the retrofitting of existing 
production facilities to turnkey equipment for greenfield installations.

Business and financial review – ESAB 
continued
Regional  overview  of  performance  ESAB’ s revenue by destination is summarised in 
the table above. Revenue is split broadly equally 
between the developed economies of Western 
and Northern Europe and North America and the 
developing economies of Central, Southern and 
Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. 
Revenue fell in all regions due to the impact of the 
global recession, although the full impact of these 
falls on ESAB’ s financial results was partly offset 
by exchange movements. 
Regional  markets  Europe
Europe remains ESAB’ s most important region, 
where it is the leading welding company. Europe 
as a region accounted for 41 per cent of ESAB’ s 
total revenue during the year. 
Following sharp reductions in volumes in the 
fourth quarter of 2008, the first quarter of the 
year saw generally stable trading conditions 
albeit at levels appreciably below those of the 
previous year. The second quarter saw further 
slippages in both the consumables and 
equipment businesses as industrial production 
in Europe continued to deteriorate, whilst 
ESAB’ s margins were also impacted by 
short-term price discounting. 
During the second half of the year, overall trading 
conditions generally stabilised. Summer 
shutdowns were less severe than had been 
feared, and there were some tentative signs of 
recovery, for example in the automotive industry 
and in Russia, although generally these were 
patchy and the benefit of these was offset by 
certain industries, particularly shipbuilding, 
declining markedly. Christmas shutdowns 
amongst end-users were generally longer 
than usual. 
In response to the lower levels of demand seen 
during the year, steps were taken to reduce costs 
including the closure of three consumables 
factories. A further factory was mothballed, 
although by the end of the year steps had been 
taken to return this factory to production. 
Reductions in workforce were made across 
the business. 
Margins in the second half of the year showed 
some recovery, despite further deteriorations in 
the cutting business.
North America 
ESAB recorded sales in North America of 
£218.6 million (2008: £238.6 million), a decrease 
of 8.4 per cent. 
The North American welding market moved into 
recession during 2008, ahead of Western 
Europe, and the further reductions in volumes of 
consumables and equipment seen during 2009 
were less pronounced than in other regions. 
During this time, ESAB has performed creditably 
and stayed profitable throughout the year, 
albeit at lower margins. ESAB’ s performance 
benefited from its strong market positions in the 
energy and naval shipbuilding sectors, and the 
measures which it took to reduce headcount 
and other costs. 
As part of the restructuring of its welding and 
cutting equipment business, ESAB’ s equipment 
factory in the USA is being significantly 
downsized with production of most equipment 
being transferred to ESAB factories in China, 
Europe and South America. Marketing, 
aftermarket and other customer-facing functions 
will be retained in the USA.

By the end of the year, there was little evidence 
that the economy or the welding market in the 
USA had commenced any meaningful recovery 
although ESAB believes that it is well placed to 
at least maintain its position in the market and it 
will also benefit from the launch of a new range 
of standard equipment which will take place 
during 2010. 
South America 
ESAB has a strong market presence in Brazil and 
Argentina which goes back for over 50 years. 
After a relatively quiet start to the year, trading 
performance improved in the second half of the 
year, reflecting a recovery in the export sectors 
of the Brazilian economy in particular. Whilst 
volumes have fallen during the worldwide 
recession, overall percentage reductions 
have been smaller than seen in Europe and 
North America. 
China
ESAB’ s sales to customers in China were 
£27.1 million (2008: £36.4 million), a decrease 
of 25.5 per cent. 
A new strategy has been formulated which will 
see ESAB progressively increase volumes and 
generate a margin consistent with those being 
earned elsewhere in ESAB. 
During the year, ESAB made progress towards 
its objective of increasing sales of welding 
consumables to domestic Chinese customers. 
Production is being increased at the 
consumables factory in Weihai with the energy 
and shipbuilding industries being targeted. Falling 
levels of demand in Europe and North America 
during the early part of the year meant that the 
amount of product exported by ESAB factories 
in China reduced considerably, although there 
were marked improvements later in the year. 
Equipment sales were low in the early months 
of the year, leading to the mothballing of the 
equipment factory at Zhangjiagang.
Rest of world
Asia-Pacific (excluding China)
During the year, ESAB experienced mixed 
trading conditions in the region, with a stronger 
performance in Indonesia, but less strong in 
Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines.
India
ESAB India, in which ESAB holds a 56 per cent 
shareholding, has seen reduced revenues as 
lower selling prices for its welding consumables 
more than offset modestly higher sales volumes. 
Margins were generally maintained. 
Middle East and Africa
There were mixed trading conditions in the 
Middle East during the year, reflecting continued 
investment in the energy industry but lower levels 
of activity in construction.
ESAB’ s sales in Africa, which has been targeted 
as an area where ESAB has previously been 
under-represented, increased markedly, albeit 
from a low level. Further progress is expected 
in 2010. 
Associated undertaking
ESAB owns 50 per cent of ESAB SeAH 
Corporation, situated in South Korea. ESAB’ s 
share of the post-tax profits of that company 
increased to £3.5 million (2008: £3.1 million).
ESAB  Aristo™  U8 2
The new ESAB Aristo™ U8 2 digital control pendant was designed to

Howden
Howden is a world-leading international 
applications engineer. It designs, manufactures, 
installs and maintains various types of air and gas 
handling equipment for use in the power, oil and 
gas, petrochemical and other industries.
20    Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
Howden  strategy
Howden’ s strategic objective is to generate significant growth in 
revenue and profit over the next five years though building upon 
its current world-leading position as an applications engineer 
which designs, manufactures, installs and maintains 
performance critical components for air and gas handling. 
In pursuit of this objective, Howden will pursue the following 
initiatives:
 ■ Howden will maintain and enhance its position in all those 
regions where there is expected to be significant new build of 
coal-fired generating capacity and emission control 
equipment; Howden already has strong market positions in 
Europe, China, North America and South Africa, and will look 
to build its presence in India, Russia and South America;
 ■ Howden will develop further its position in the oil and gas and 
petrochemicals industries, in particular through enhancing its 
position in the compressor industry which it will do through an 
increased range of products and exploitation of market niches;
 ■ Howden will look to enhance its presence in other industries 
where its technology and expertise can be used to advantage; 
these include bio-fuels and waste-water treatment;
 ■ Howden will continue to develop its aftermarket business, in 
particular in China, with the objective of consistently 
generating one-third of its annual revenue through aftermarket 
sales; and
 ■ Howden will consider growing the business through 
acquisitions that will strengthen its market position and 
improve its technology base.
T o achieve this uplift in revenue will require continued 
development of Howden’ s supply chain which will be achieved 
through increased plant utilisation, moderate amounts of 
targeted capital expenditure on plant expansion and IT , 
continued initiatives to ensure that Howden has access to 
sufficient trained engineers, and continued use of Lean 
techniques across all aspects of its business. A critical part of 
Howden’ s supply chain is its global network of sub-contractors 
which Howden will continue to monitor and develop.
About  Howden
Howden’s principal products are centrifugal and axial 
fans, air and gas rotary heat exchangers and 
compressors. Howden’s fans and heat exchangers are 
integral parts of the coal-fired boiler and emission control 
systems used by the power industry. Howden also 
makes significant sales to the oil and gas, petrochemical, 
mining, iron and steel and other process industries. 
Howden’s sales are split broadly equally between 
Europe, China and North America, and other emerging 
economies, including the rest of Asia-Pacific, the Middle 
East and South Africa. Howden is investing in its 
presence in South America which is seen as an 
important growth market.
In 2009, Howden derived 30 per cent of its revenues 
from its aftermarket business which benefits from the 
extensive installed base of Howden equipment.
Howden has developed a flexible business model 
with its own manufacturing concentrated on higher 
value-added or performance critical components, 
with the manufacture of other components 
outsourced to sub-contractors in low cost locations.
 ■ Howden’ s result for 2009 demonstrates the resilience of its order 
book and the flexibility of its operating model
 ■ Revenue of £627.8 million (2008: £627.2 million) and operating 
profit before exceptional items of £70.5 million (2008: £73.1 million) 
 ■ Operating margin remained in excess of 11 per cent.
 ■ Strong performances in respect of compressors and aftermarket 
revenues offset relative weakness in sales of fans to the power 
industry
 ■ Headcount reduction in anticipation of a slowdown in new 
equipment sales will result in cost savings of over £8 million in 2010 
 ■ Howden’ s year-end order book was £441 million 
(2008: £499 million), including £340 million for delivery in 2010. 
Enquiry levels are encouraging and suggest a pick-up in 
bookings in 2010.

Business and financial review – Howden 
continued
Overview  of  performance
Against a difficult economic and financial 
backdrop, Howden achieved another strong set 
of results in 2009 with almost unchanged 
revenue of £627.8 million (2008: £627.2 million), 
representing a decrease of 12.9 per cent at 
constant exchange rates. 
Operating profit before exceptional items was 
£70.5 million (2008: £73.1 million), a decrease of 
3.6 per cent (18.7 per cent decrease at constant 
exchange rates). The operating margin was 
11.2 per cent (2008: 11.7 per cent). 
The outstanding feature of the results was the 
growth in the aftermarket business, where 
revenues increased by 17 per cent to £189 million, 
representing 30 per cent of Howden’ s total 
revenues for the year. Revenue from new 
equipment sales fell by 6 per cent, with continued 
strength in the sales of Howden compressors 
partly offsetting weaker sales of fans to customers 
in the power, steel and cement industries. 
Order  book
The strength of Howden’ s order book at the start 
of the year meant that Howden’ s trading results 
in 2009 were comparatively unaffected by the 
difficult economic and financial conditions 
prevailing during the year. T otal order cancellations 
during the year were £11 million, out of an order 
book of £499 million on 1 January 2009.
As at 31 December 2009, the order book 
stood at £441 million (31 December 
2008: £499 million), a decrease of 11.7 per cent 
(22.0 per cent at constant exchange rates), 
spread broadly equally between Europe, China, 
North America and other emerging economies. 
The order book at 31 December 2009 included 
some £340 million for delivery in 2010 and 
£101 million for delivery in 2011 or beyond. 
Orders booked in the year were £513.6 million 
(2008: £659.0 million), a reduction of 23 per cent. 
There was a marked weakening in the ordering 
of power generation and emission control 
equipment by customers in China and the USA 
due to economic and financial conditions and, 
specifically in the USA, uncertainty over energy 
policy and emission control legislation. Orders 
from customers in the metals and cement 
industries continued to be weak, reflecting the 
impact of the global recession on the steel and 
construction sectors. Orders for compressors 
from customers in the oil and gas industry 
remained strong.
In recent months, new enquiries from the 
power industry in particular have shown some 
improvement and some longer-term prospects 
appear to be reaching the point at which orders 
should be placed. In addition, the placing of 
certain orders may have been deferred from late 
2009 into 2010 and financing constraints, which 
were a feature of certain markets during 2009, 
have also generally eased. On this basis, 
Howden management expects that order 
bookings in 2010 should increase compared 
with 2009. 
Restructuring
An important feature of Howden’ s growth in 
recent years has been the flexibility which it has 
built into its supply chains, including the extensive 
use of sub-contractors and relatively low levels of 
fixed cost. 
During 2009, Howden management took steps 
to adjust the manned capacity of its new 
equipment business. Certain potentially surplus 
capacity has been re-deployed, with engineering 
resource and expertise being transferred from 
new equipment businesses to focus on the 
aftermarket, certain work being retained in-house 
as opposed to being passed to sub-contractors, 
and workload being shared between factories. 
Overtime working and the use of external 
contractors has been reduced at Howden 
facilities, and short-time working was introduced 
at four factories, although full-time working was 
subsequently re-introduced at two of these units.
Howden  Cooling  Fan
Howden SX-Series low-noise 
cooling fans are used in a 
wide range of cooling and 
ventilation systems that must 
meet strict environmental 
noise levels.
During 2009, Howden’s revenues increased by 0.1 per cent. Of this, new 
build revenues (at constant currency) led to a decline of 14.2 per cent, 
offset by positive contributions from aftermarket revenues (at constant 
currency) of 1.3 per cent and exchange movements of 13.0 per cent. 
Within new equipment, strength in the sale of compressors offset lower 
sales of fans, particularly to the power industry.

Nevertheless, it was necessary during the year 
to take steps to terminate the employment of 
around 270 employees, representing about 
8 per cent of the workforce, at a cost of 
£2 million; these measures are expected to 
result in cost savings of over £8 million in 2010. 
Products  and  segmentation
Howden designs, manufactures, installs and 
maintains heavy-duty fans, heat exchangers and 
compressors. The fans and heat exchangers are 
used mainly in the generation of electricity by 
coal-fired power stations, both in combustion 
and the control of emissions. Other applications 
for heavy-duty fans are in the steel and cement 
industries. Howden ventilation fans are used in 
tunnels and mining applications.
Howden compressors are mainly used by the oil 
and gas and petrochemical industries; other 
applications are in refrigeration, the nuclear 
industry and the treatment of waste water. 
The great majority of Howden’ s products 
are bespoke to an individual customer’ s 
specifications. Order lead times are typically 9 to 
18 months, generally being shorter in China and 
longer in Europe and North America. Design 
work is carried out by Howden’ s engineers 
in its locations around the world. Amongst its 
achievements during the year, Howden 
developed an axial fan blade profile that delivers 
higher pressure and flow, together with a higher 
strength hub, which is seen as having particular 
advantages in the retrofit market.
Industry  overview
Demand – new equipment
Demand for new Howden equipment is strongly 
influenced by the construction of new coal-fired 
power stations, environmental legislation (which 
impacts demand for emission control equipment 
for coal-fired power stations and other heavy 
industrial plant) and the construction of new 
refineries, steel plant and cement factories. 
As with many capital goods industries, the 
aftermarket represents an important part of 
the total market.
Howden’ s order book at any time gives it 
reasonable visibility over new equipment revenue 
over the next 12 to 18 months, although in any 
financial year there is an element of ‘book and 
bill’, that is, orders which are booked and 
delivered in the same year. 
Over the longer term, Howden continues to 
believe that demand for its products from the 
power generation industry, its largest end-user 
segment, will provide a basis for its future growth. 
Overall, the demand for electricity is expected to 
continue to grow at a rate at least in line with 
global GDP , and coal is generally expected to 
maintain or increase the percentage of electricity 
generation for which it accounts. 
Demand for Howden products will arise from the 
construction of new generating plant and the 
replacement of life-expired generating plant. 
According to the International Energy Authority 
(‘IEA’), construction of new coal-fired generating 
plant will average 53 GW per annum for at least 
the next 20 years, of which more than half will be 
built in China, where Howden has a leading 
market position. It is estimated that around 
750 GW of coal-fired generating capacity, 
primarily in the developed world, is currently over 
30 years old and will progressively fall due for 
replacement over the next decade or so. 
As noted above, orders booked during 2009 
from customers in the power industry, especially 
in China and the USA, were below those booked 
in 2008. There is some evidence that, during 
2009, the placing of new orders for Howden 
equipment was delayed by the general economic 
conditions and the shortage of credit; this 
includes various power generation projects in 
China, where demand for power fell in the final 
quarter of 2008 and early 2009. However, power 
usage in China increased towards the end of the 
year leading to higher enquiry levels which should 
be reflected in order bookings during 2010. 
Fabrication  of  fan  casing
Flexible supply chains allow 
fabrication to be carried 
out in-house or at quality 
approved sub-contractors.
As at 31 December 2009, the order book stood at £441 million; of this 
amount, £340 million was for delivery in 2010. During 2009, each of 
Europe, North America and China experienced a fall in outstanding 
orders, and overall the order book declined by £58 million, with a 
‘book-to-bill’ ratio of 0.82. Orders with a combined value of 2 per cent 
of the opening order book were cancelled during the year.

Business and financial review – Howden 
continued
Howden also supplies equipment for use in 
processes which reduce atmospheric pollution 
generated by coal-fired power stations and 
industrial plant. Governments generally recognise 
the need to limit the environmental impact of 
generating plant, although uncertainty over the 
strategies to be followed and the nature and 
timing of legislation is somewhat slowing this 
market at present. In the EU, legislation on NOx 
reduction from large power plants to meet a 
2016 deadline is creating a market for Howden 
emission control products, whilst in the USA, 
continued uncertainty over legislation to replace 
the Clean Air Interstate Rules has led to a deferral 
in the placing of orders for such equipment.
Howden compressors are mainly sold into the oil 
and gas and petrochemicals industries, in 
particular for use in refineries and related 
applications, and also into other industries, 
including refrigeration and waste-water treatment. 
In recent years, notable sales have been made 
to customers in Europe, the Middle East and 
South America. Order bookings and sales 
are influenced by the amount of exploration 
and refinery construction in progress which 
themselves are influenced by the strength of 
demand for petroleum products and also the 
availability of finance.
Demand – aftermarket
The aftermarket is Howden’ s single biggest 
opportunity for growth. During 2009, the 
aftermarket accounted for 30 per cent of 
Howden’ s total revenues. With the opportunity to 
increase this further in future years, Howden has 
allocated increased resources internally to 
pursuing aftermarket opportunities globally. Each 
delivery of new equipment creates a potential 
aftermarket revenue stream over the operating life 
of the equipment which is typically 30 to 40 
years. Aftermarket services are provided by 
Howden to the equipment operator (usually an 
electricity utility in the case of the power industry), 
as opposed to one of the lead contractors in the 
construction process (usually the boiler maker in 
relation to fans supplied to the power industry) 
who is normally the customer for new equipment. 
Whilst there is no contractual obligation on the 
operator to employ Howden to provide 
aftermarket services on equipment which it 
originally supplied, Howden believes that it is able 
to optimise the long-term performance of any 
such equipment which it continues to service. 
Competitive environment
Howden’ s strong global positions in the 
specialised markets that it supplies, particularly 
in heavy-duty fans, are based on the 
cost-effectiveness of its product offering, 
its technology and customer service. 
Contracts are generally won after a 
competitive tendering process.
Howden’ s position in the compressor industry 
is built around strong positions in a number of 
specialised niches, including being one of the 
five leading worldwide suppliers of process 
gas screw compressors for use in the oil 
and gas industry. 
Howden’ s share of the aftermarket varies 
between regions. In some locations, such as the 
United Kingdom and Africa, where Howden 
supplied a high proportion of the original 
equipment, and Australia, where recent new build 
activity has been low, its share is relatively high. 
T otal orders booked during 2009 were £514 million, compared with 
£659 million in 2008. The principal part of this shortfall occurred in the 
first four months of the year which in 2008 were very busy, partly due to 
orders for axial fans from customers in North America. T owards the end 
of 2009, there was a pick-up in the level of enquiries which should be 
reflected in higher bookings in 2010.

Princess Royal visited

Howden  supply  chain
Manufacturing 
Howden’ s principal manufacturing facilities are 
located in Europe, China and North America. 
Other facilities exist principally to serve local 
markets, such as South Africa. During the year, 
Howden has constructed a new manufacturing 
facility in South America. 
Howden makes extensive use of a global 
network of sub-contractors to manufacture 
non-performance critical components. In 2009, 
the number of man-hours sub-contracted is 
estimated to have slightly exceeded in-house 
man-hours. 
Human resources
A key component in Howden’ s supply chain is 
the quality and quantity of its engineers who are 
predominantly located in Europe, China and 
North America. The Howden Academy, a 
partnership with Glasgow Caledonian University, 
has so far introduced 200 new engineers from 
Howden’ s businesses around the world to its 
range of products. 
Intellectual property
Howden’ s technology and brand are key parts of 
its competitive advantage. Using their extensive 
applications and product knowledge, Howden 
engineers undertake product development work 
focused on meeting the specific requirements of 
its customers. During 2009, particular effort has 
been applied to developing Howden’ s ranges of 
axial fans and compressors.

Howden  compressor  package
Howden designs, engineers, assembles and tests complete compressor 
packages in addition to building the compressors themselves. Throughout 
the world, Howden compressor packages are used in the oil and gas, 
petrochemical, energy and other sectors where absolute reliability is paramount. 
 
Each compressor package is custom designed for its environment and 
its duties, incorporating as much additional plant as appropriate. Howden 
ensures  that the complete installation meets all operational safety standards 
and matches the size and weight criteria and environmental guidelines of its 
site. By creating and testing an integrated system, Howden is able to apply 
high standards of reliability and efficiency to the whole package. 26    Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Business and financial review – Howden 
continued
Regional  overview  of  performance
Howden’ s revenue by destination is summarised 
in the table above. As in previous years, 
Howden has maintained a general balance 
between sales to customers in developed 
and emerging economies.
Regional  markets  Europe
Revenue in Europe was £171.1 million 
(2008: £165.3 million), an increase of 3.5 per 
cent, reflecting robust sales of Howden new 
equipment to customers in the power, oil and gas 
and other industrial sectors and also growth in 
revenues from aftermarket services. A particular 
feature of Howden’ s performance was continued 
high levels of order intake and sales at Howden 
BC Compressors in France which supplies new 
equipment to customers in Europe, the Middle 
East and South America. 
Howden continues to build a presence in the 
important Russian market with further orders 
being booked despite the difficult financial 
conditions in the Russian economy for much 
of the year.
North America
Sales to customers in North America were 
£149.0 million, a decrease of 17.9 per cent. 
This reflected the strong order book with which 
Howden started the year, primarily for emission 
control equipment, but orders placed for 
shipment during the year were relatively weak. 
The aftermarket business made further progress. 
During the year, order intake from customers in 
North America showed a marked reduction 
compared with 2008, reflecting uncertainty over 
environmental protection legislation, continued 
weakness in the US economy generally and 
financial constraints. This led to outstanding 
orders to customers in North America falling 
to £88 million as at 31 December 2009 
(2008: £122 million). 
China
Sales to customers in China amounted to 
£123.1 million (2008: £136.6 million), a reduction 
of 9.9 per cent. This primarily reflected reduced 
demand from the power industry as electricity 
usage contracted sharply towards the end of 
2008 and in the early part of 2009.
Order intake during the year was much reduced, 
although in the latter parts of the year, as the 
Chinese economy resumed growth, enquiry 
levels picked up and this is expected to be 
reflected in some recovery in bookings in 2010. 
The aftermarket in China is seen as offering 
significant opportunities for Howden, as 
equipment delivered during the last few years 
reaches the point where major servicing is 
required. During 2009, Howden’ s aftermarket 
revenues in China showed considerable growth, 
albeit from relatively modest levels, and the 
business remains on track to achieve its 
longer-term objectives. 
The compressor factory in Weihai has continued 
to develop, with increasing sales to the water 
treatment and petrochemical industries in China 
and elsewhere in the region.

South America 
Following the acquisition in 2008 of Aeolus 
Industrìa e Comercio, one of the region’ s leading 
designers and manufacturers of industrial fans, 
Howden has taken further steps to increase its 
presence in the South American market, 
including the construction of a new and much 
enhanced facility, due to be completed in 
mid-2010, which will enable an increased range 
of Howden products to be manufactured locally. 
Revenue for the year was £31.7 million 
(2008: £30.3 million), an increase of 4.6 per cent 
which also reflected the supply of new equipment 
to a major customer in the oil industry in Brazil. 
Rest of the world
Africa 
Howden Africa Holdings Limited, in which 
Howden has a holding of some 55 per cent, 
achieved increased revenue driven by new 
equipment sales to the power and the mining 
sectors in South Africa. Aftermarket revenues 
also increased as Eskom accelerated 
programmes ahead of the 2010 FIFA world cup.
Bookings during the year remained reasonably 
strong, reflecting the company’ s participation 
in the Eskom new build and refurbishment 
programmes and general strength in the 
mining sector. 
Middle East 
Howden’ s sales of compressors in the Middle-
East benefited from continued high levels of 
investment in the oil and gas and petrochemical 
sectors. In recognition of its long-term potential of 
the region, Howden has recently opened a sales 
office in Dubai.
Asia-Pacific
Howden’ s presence in India continues to 
strengthen with a current focus on the 
petrochemical and power industries. 
In Australia, Howden performed well with the 
industries served generally avoiding the global 
economic downturn. 
Assembly  of  axial  fan  hub
The Variax
®
 variable pitch axial fan is the proven, reliable and robust 
choice for a wide range of applications particularly in power generation 
where high volumes, high pressures and precise flow control are required.  
 
The principle of adjusting the pitch of the blades to govern aerodynamic 
performance is the proven route to optimum efficiency, enabling the fan 
performance to be accurately matched to its duties in real time, allowing 
the drive motor to run constantly at its recommended speed and power 
consumption. These critical components are assembled in-house at our 
technically sophisticated facilities in Belfast, UK and Weihai, China.  28      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Business and financial review – financial review
Trading  results  for  the  year
A detailed review of the trading results for the year is set out in the Chairman’ s statement, Chief Executive’ s statement and the business 
reviews of ESAB and Howden.
Exceptional  items
In order to help provide a better indication of the Group’ s underlying business performance, Charter presents items that are both material 
and non-recurring as exceptional items and excludes them from adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share.
The results for the year to 31 December 2009 include exceptional costs of £26.8 million, comprising restructuring costs of £26.3 million, 
of  which £24.3 million was incurred by ESAB and £2.0 million was incurred by Howden, and the loss on the disposal of a business of 
£0.5 million.
The restructuring costs relate to the measures being taken by ESAB and Howden to bring manned capacity into line with demand and, 
in the case of ESAB, to reduce distribution and administration costs. Restructuring costs comprise headcount reductions of £13.8 million, 
impairment of intangibles, property plant and equipment, inventory and receivables of £9.2 million and closure and other costs of 
£3.3 million.
On 13 May, ESAB completed the disposal of HD Engineering Limited, a manufacturer of drilling equipment, consumables and 
accessories, for a cash consideration of £1.7 million. The loss on disposal was £0.5 million, net of exchange gains transferred from 
reserves of £0.9 million.
Earnings  per  share
Basic earnings per share were 38.1 pence (2008: 90.1 pence). However, adjusted earnings per share are considered a better indication of 
the Group’ s underlying business performance.
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting basic earnings per share for items not relating to underlying business 
performance. Previously, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill, exceptional items and exchange gains and 
losses on retranslation of intercompany loans, including attributable tax and minority interests, were excluded from basic earnings in 
calculating adjusted earnings per share.
In 2009, acquisition costs and the non-cash net financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations have also been excluded as 
these amounts are not considered to relate to underlying business performance. The impact of excluding acquisition costs and the net 
financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations from adjusted earnings per share for 2008 is not significant and therefore 
2008 adjusted earnings per share have not been restated.
Adjusted earnings per share decreased by 44.6 per cent to 55.0 pence (2008: 99.2 pence) and were derived from basic earnings per 
share as set out below:

Net  financing  charge
The net financing charge, before taking into account the net finance charge attributable to retirement benefit obligations and the 
retranslation of intercompany loan balances, was £3.1 million (2008: £1.2 million) and comprised interest payable of £2.7 million 
(2008: £5.4 million), fair value loss on derivative financial instruments of £1.5 million (2008: £1.0 million), exchange losses on cash 
and borrowings of £1.1 million (2008: £nil), other charges of £2.0 million (2008: £nil) and the unwinding of discounts on provisions of 
£0.3 million (2008: £0.4 million), offset by interest and other financing credits of £4.5 million (2008: £5.6 million). Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    29

Tax charge 17.9 39.0
The tax charge of £17.9 million compares with tax paid in the year of £46.0 million. The tax charge is lower than the actual tax paid in the 
year primarily due to the recognition of additional deferred tax assets in the US and the settlement of a number of prior year tax liabilities.

The Group continues to benefit from profits being generated in relatively low-tax jurisdictions, such as China and Eastern Europe, together 
with the recognition and utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses. The adjusted effective tax rate is likely to remain at approximately 
the same level in the medium term.

cent respectively, compared with the prior year. However, this is only the translation impact of currency movements. It excludes the impact 
of currency movements on transactions when products are manufactured in one currency zone and sold in another. The transaction 
impact of currency movements is difficult to quantify but the overall impact on the 2009 results is not considered significant. 30      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

During the year, total equity shareholders’ funds decreased by £28.4 million to £549.9 million (2008: £578.3 million).
The principal components of this decrease were the profit for the year attributable to Charter shareholders of £63.5 million and net 
after-tax gains on cash flow and net investment hedges of £13.7 million, offset by net after-tax actuarial losses on retirement benefit 
obligations of £37.0 million, net translation exchange losses of £33.8 million and dividends paid of £35.0 million.
As at 31 December 2009, the total equity attributable to minority interests increased by £1.4 million to £41.4 million (2008: £40.0 million), 
reflecting profit attributable to minority interests of £11.3 million, offset by net translation losses of £3.0 million and dividends payable of 
£6.9 million. The significant minority interests are the 30 per cent interest in Howden Hua Engineering Co Limited, the 45 per cent interest 
in Howden Africa Holdings Limited and the 44 per cent interest in ESAB India Limited.
Working capital has reduced by £34.8 million to £262.5 million, a decrease of 11.7 per cent. Included within ‘Trade and other receivables’ 
are amounts receivable under construction contracts of £41.9 million (2008: £71.9 million). Included within ‘Trade and other payables’ are 
amounts payable within twelve months under construction contracts of £45.3 million (2008: £113.1 million). The net liability in respect of 
construction contracts has therefore reduced by £40.2 million in the year, mainly in Howden, reflecting a lower level of payments on 
account from customers due to lower order intake. Excluding construction contracts, working capital has reduced by 21.0 per cent.

Capital expenditure reflects the acquisition of an existing ESAB manufacturing plant in North America for £9.5 million, which was 
previously leased, together with the continued investment in new manufacturing facilities, new equipment and new computer systems in 
both businesses.
Cash  and  borrowings
As at 31 December 2009, cash balances were £75.6 million (2008: £95.7 million), of which the majority was held overseas for local 
working capital purposes or pending dividend payments. Of the cash held overseas, £3.2 million (2008: £4.1 million) is retained as cash 
collateral in connection with certain local trading practices or banking facilities. The credit status of institutions where cash is held is kept 
under review with credit limits being set and monitored accordingly.
As at 31 December 2009, gross borrowings were £24.7 million (2008: £43.9 million).
Going  concern
At 31 December 2009, in addition to net cash balances of £50.9 million, the Group had undrawn centrally held committed borrowing 
facilities of £170 million, which are due to expire (unless otherwise extended or renewed) between 2011 and 2013. All facilities are 
unsecured. Whilst these facilities have certain financial and other covenants, the financial strength of the Charter Group means that the 
covenants attaching to these facilities are not expected to prevent the full utilisation of the facilities if required.
In addition, various other members of the Charter Group have uncommitted and committed bank facilities in place, some of which are 
secured, to meet local funding requirements.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had £257.5 million of uncommitted bonding facilities, of which £113.8 million were provided by its 
principal bankers. Bonds and guarantees totalling £131.2 million had been issued under these facilities.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and its subsidiaries have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
both the consolidated financial statements for the Group and the financial statements of the Company.
In reaching this conclusion, the Directors have considered carefully the risks to the Group’ s trading performance and cash flows as a result 
of the current global economic and financial environment. The Directors have also had regard to the Group’ s operating plan and budget 
for 2010 and have considered the principal risks to which the Group is exposed, including those summarised on page 34.
The Directors monitor the expected outturn for the full year on an ongoing basis both in terms of profit and cash and appropriate 
mitigating action would be taken if it became apparent that there was a risk that the Group might miss its previous forecasts.
Contingent  liabilities
Details of contingent liabilities are set out in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Significant  accounting  policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the accounting policies set out in note 1. Applying accounting 
policies requires the use of certain judgements, assumptions and estimates. The following accounting policies have been identified as 
being the most significant and where there is most risk of a material adjustment to the carrying value of the Group’ s assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year:
 ■ goodwill impairment
 ■ construction contracts
 ■ deferred tax
 ■ warranty and legal liabilities
 ■ retirement benefits. 34      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Business and financial review – financial review 
continued
Principal  risks  and  uncertainties
Charter, both directly and through ESAB and Howden, is exposed to a wide variety of markets and geographies and seeks to manage 
the risks and uncertainties that arise from this. In certain instances, and where it is cost-effective to do so, exposures can be transferred to 
third parties, for example through insurance or through currency hedging.
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by Charter, and the ways in which they are being managed, are set out below.
Economic recession
Many regions in which Charter companies operate entered recession in the second half of 2008 and remained in recession during 2009; 
these regions include in particular Europe and North America, which together account for well over half of Charter’ s total revenue. The 
consumption of steel, which is a key macro-economic indicator of demand for ESAB products, saw unprecedented falls in 2009 across 
all major economic regions apart from China.
Whilst there are presently a number of leading economic indicators that suggest that the world economy is through its low point and 
starting to recover, it remains unclear how strong or sustained any recovery will be.
ESAB experienced a sharp reduction in the demand for its products in late 2008 and 2009. In response, it took significant steps to reduce 
output and manned capacity. Whilst it believes that these steps were appropriate in the light of prevailing levels of demand, there can be 
no certainty that additional steps will not be required and that additional exceptional costs will not be incurred.
In 2009, Howden’ s revenue was broadly in line with that achieved in 2008. However, during the year, order intake was down markedly 
and in response Howden implemented measures to reduce headcount in anticipation of lower sales of new equipment. These measures 
are considered to be appropriate in the light of expected levels of demand for its products, but any further fall in the level of order intake 
could require additional steps to be taken which are likely to involve additional exceptional charges. During 2009, Howden experienced 
only limited order cancellations and deferrals, but it is possible that the incidence of cancellations may increase in 2010; whilst Howden’ s 
position is protected by a number of measures, including customer deposits which Howden could use to offset any costs or losses 
incurred as a consequence of a cancellation, there could still be a detrimental impact on Howden’ s business should the incidence of 
cancellations increase.
Financing
During the final quarter of 2008, there was a significant reduction across most regions in the availability of banking facilities and other 
forms of financing, and availability remained generally weak throughout 2009. The direct impact on Charter was limited, as Charter had 
previously negotiated sufficient committed bank facilities for its requirements.
In the light of the prevailing financial conditions, Charter reviewed certain aspects of the ways in which it conducts its business, including 
the credit-worthiness of customers which was continuously monitored and, where necessary, changes were made to the way in which 
Charter companies conducted business with them.
If economic recession and weak conditions in financial markets remain, there may also be disruption to supplies of goods and services to 
Charter companies. Additional steps have been taken to monitor the financial condition and performance of suppliers and to mitigate any 
risk of failure by identifying alternative suppliers where possible.
The reduced availability of financing facilities may also have the effect of causing the power station, refinery or major construction projects 
with which Howden is involved to be delayed or cancelled. T o date, it is not believed that this has had a significant impact on Howden’ s 
business, but it may become a factor in the future if financial conditions remain volatile.
Actions of competitors
ESAB and Howden both operate in competitive markets and are exposed to market behaviour such as aggressive pricing by a 
competitor seeking to enter a new market, or to maintain or grow sales in a weakening market.
As set out in the Business review, both businesses have established strong market positions through measures such as technological 
leadership, strong brands and providing cost-effective solutions to their customers’ needs. Throughout the economic downturn, both 
ESAB and Howden have maintained capital expenditure at levels well in excess of depreciation and continued to invest in research and 
development, product innovation and customer service. These measures are considered the most effective means to prevent competitors 
from gaining market share at the expense of ESAB or Howden.
Competitor action may result initially in reductions in profit, although these are more likely to be specific to particular product areas or 
geographies. T o date, there has been no evidence of widespread price-cutting by competitors of either ESAB or Howden, although there 
remains the possibility that this might happen in the future, especially if market conditions do not improve.
Foreign exchange: transaction risk
Transaction risk arises from product being manufactured in one currency zone and sold in another.
In ESAB, manufacturing tends to be relatively close to the end-user, which naturally reduces currency exposures. The principal 
transactional exposures arising within ESAB do so on account of the manufacture of product in Central Europe and Sweden which is 
exported to the Eurozone and other parts of Europe and elsewhere. ESAB’ s general policy is not to hedge currency exposures unless 
they relate to a significant specific contract. In 2009, ESAB benefitted from transactional gains resulting from the depreciation of most 
Central European currencies against the euro and most other currencies, which partly offset the downward pressure on margins caused 
by lower volumes passing through the factories. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    35
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
In relation to Howden, exposure is principally in relation to the US dollar, the euro and the Chinese renminbi. Howden substantially covers 
forward its committed trading exposures.
Foreign exchange: translation risk
Translation risk arises from the profits and net assets of non-sterling businesses being translated into a sterling value which depends upon 
the exchange rate.
Charter’ s operations in the UK are limited and principally comprise Howden’ s manufacturing operations in Scotland and Northern Ireland 
and various managerial and administrative functions in London. Customers in the UK account for less than 5 per cent of Charter’ s 
revenue. The largest profit translation exposures are in relation to the US dollar and the euro. Generally, it is Charter’ s policy not to hedge 
profit translation exposures; this may give rise to unexpected fluctuations in Charter’ s reported profit.
The Company has significant investments in operations outside the UK; as a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect 
the consolidated balance sheet. In 2009, exchange translation losses reduced equity shareholders’ funds by £33.8 million. In certain 
circumstances, currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives may be used to hedge balance sheet 
exposures. Gains and losses arising on such hedges are recognised as required under IFRS in the consolidated statement of changes in 
equity until the items being hedged have impacted the income statement. During 2009, Charter paid £13.7 million in respect of the cash 
settlement of US dollar and euro net investment hedges.
Certain liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies. These include working capital items, which naturally offset corresponding working 
capital assets, and retirement benefit obligations. Charter does not have any meaningful amounts of debt denominated in foreign 
currencies. Movements in exchange rates can cause the sterling values of these liabilities to fluctuate.
Legal and regulatory
Charter companies have contracts and operations in many parts of the world. They are subject to the laws and regulations of many 
jurisdictions including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export controls, money-laundering, false accounting, anti-bribery 
and competition provisions. From time to time, Charter companies may be subject to regulatory investigations relating to its operations. 
Non-compliance with these laws, regulations and restrictions could expose them to fines, penalties, suspension or debarment, which 
could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of Charter.
Charter, ESAB and Howden are subject to litigation and other forms of legal actions in the ordinary course of their business; further details 
are contained in note 27.
Pension risk
There are various post-retirement benefit schemes in place within Charter, ESAB and Howden.
The assets held by the various schemes are invested by the trustees primarily in equities and bonds. During 2009, the values of equities 
have recovered a proportion of the falls suffered during 2008. The liabilities of each scheme are subject to movements in variables such as 
corporate bond yields, changes in life expectancy and forecasts of future rates of inflation. The net liability which appears on Charter’ s 
balance sheet relating to overseas schemes is also subject to movements in exchange rates; any depreciation of sterling against the 
US dollar and against European currencies in general could result in an increase in the net liability.
The level of cash contributions by the Company to the schemes is determined through periodic negotiations between the pension 
trustees and the Company, and also potentially by changes in legislation. T o date, increases in the level of cash contributions have been 
relatively modest, but uplifts may be larger in the future.
Raw material prices
Most products manufactured by ESAB and Howden contain steel or other metals whose prices are generally determined on world 
markets but subject to regional differences.
Prices can fluctuate significantly. After significant increases in the prices of various commodities, including steel, during the first three 
quarters of 2008, prices generally eased during the first half of 2009 and generally stabilised in the second half of the year. During this 
time, ESAB was able to protect itself against price fluctuations through forward purchase contracts and by increasing its stocks of raw 
materials. Historically, ESAB has generally been able to pass through the higher steel prices to its customers, although any future 
increases in raw material prices may lead to pressure on its margins.
Howden may also make use of forward purchase contracts to lock in margin. In times of raw material price inflation, it has the opportunity 
to include cost price accelerator clauses in its sale contracts.
Internal controls
Charter has an established system of internal controls covering its own activities and those of ESAB and Howden, which are considered 
essential for the effective management of such geographically diverse businesses. These controls have been and will be continuously 
developed to take into account changes in the trading environments which the businesses face, and include compliance and self-
certification programmes together with the ongoing reviews performed by the Charter internal audit function which reports its activities 
and findings to the Company’ s Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. The Audit Committee has been delegated formal responsibility for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal controls.
Any system of internal controls is to some extent vulnerable to deliberate malfeasance by employees or others associated with the 
Company and cannot provide absolute assurance. A failure of the Company’ s system of internal controls could have a material impact on 
its financial position and trading prospects. 36      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate responsibility report
Approach  and  governance
The Board considers social, environmental and 
ethical matters in the context of the overall 
business environment. Charter is committed to 
understanding and responsibly managing 
significant risks to the environment and the 
communities in which it has a presence and where 
it has operational control or significant influence. 
They are managed as part of the overall corporate 
governance and risk management framework. 
Our policies and management approach can be 
seen in the Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) section 
of our website, www.charter.ie. 
The operational heads of all Charter businesses 
have responsibility for implementing the policies 
and are accountable for CR performance. 
CR is being integrated within our overall risk 
management practices. The Head of Risk 
Management has an overall co-ordinating role 
in areas of CR to improve the sharing of best 
practice, collection of data and consistency 
of reporting.
The Board and the senior management receive 
a monthly performance report on environmental 
and health and safety (‘EHS’) performance. 
Formal reviews of major risks are undertaken by 
senior management (quarterly) and by the Board 
(every six months).
Environmental,  health  and  safety
Management approach
In 2009, a new EHS policy was formally adopted 
by the Board, signed by the Chief Executive and 
distributed to all businesses. Also new Charter 
travel guidelines were approved, covering health, 
safety and security.
The Board and the senior management receive 
a monthly summary of EHS performance 
worldwide, presenting lost time injury cases, 
results of the incident analysis and key corrective 
actions taken. It also reports the number of near 
misses, progress on key activities and plans for 
the next quarter, enabling issues most relevant 
to the business to be prioritised and resources 
to be focused. 
Resources and training
EHS management resources were strengthened 
further in 2009 with additional central resources 
and reinforcement of operational capabilities 
through additional recruits and skills training. 
The ESAB Director of EHS is now also 
responsible for Quality, which reflects our belief 
that these two areas complement each other as 
part of our corporate responsibility. Howden has 
appointed a full-time EHS professional for Africa 
and also for its Aeolus plant in Brazil.
An EHS conference was held in North America 
with representatives from all ESAB and Howden 
sites. A 3.5-day Howden EHS conference was 
run in Spain for all managers worldwide. 
The Howden Academy now runs two modules 
dedicated to EHS and global training schemes 
for all units are being planned for 2010. 
Approximately £0.7 million was spent by Howden 
on EHS improvement projects in 2009.
EHS management systems
Charter aims for all operating sites to implement 
certified EHS management systems and 
significant progress has been made in recent 
years. In 2008 ESAB became the first 
international company to be jointly certified to 
ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 for the entire 
organisation. In 2009 this was extended to 
include the Romar automation business, 
acquired in 2008, with factories in Singapore and 
China. An ESAB energy management system will 
be developed in 2010 and incorporated into the 
existing EHS management system.
Additionally, trained internal personnel audit 
ESAB sites annually to assess compliance with 
policies and to monitor progress with 
improvement action plans. 41 audits were 
completed in 2009, representing 87 per cent of 
all ESAB operating units (2008: 24 out of 43). 
Howden has continued to make progress in 
2009 with ISO 14001 certification, with five more 
manufacturing sites completing the process, and 
two more sites achieving OHSAS 18001 
certification. Certified sites are independently 
reviewed as part of the re-certification process. 
It is planned to complete certification to 
ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 at all 
manufacturing sites during 2010. Howden UK’ s 
Construction and Maintenance Division retained 
its British Safety Council 5-Star rating with an 
improved score and was, once again, awarded a 
Sword of Honour. Howden has also made 
progress with the roll-out of a web-based 
EHS management and reporting system.
ESAB Brazil has had a long association with the communities it serves. 
Programmes to support health, children, the disabled and local events have 
been a long-standing feature in the company calendar. These events are not 
just for the community outside the company; ESAB includes employees and 
their families. ESAB’s environment, health and safety material and publicity 
have a common theme: “good for you, good for your family, good for the 
company.” One such programme has been the Cidades da Solda (Welding 
Cities) Project, which is an initiative that trains youths in social risk situations as 
welders. Supported by ESAB, Cidades da Solda now has seven units and has 
successfully trained hundreds of welders. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    37

EHS regulatory issues
During 2009, there were no environmental 
releases reported. Howden’ s operation in Mexico 
City, Buffalo Forge SA, paid a fine of £1,700 
following an audit by PROFEPA in September 
2005. No other regulatory actions, fines or 
penalties were reported.
Pre-registration under REACH (EU Regulation 
on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation 
and Restriction of Chemicals) was completed by 
30 November 2008. Charter has been preparing 
to participate in Substance Information Exchange 
Forums (‘SIEFs’) as required. ESAB has been 
revising product warning labels and safety 
information sheets to prepare for REACH 
compliance.
Howden has retained consultants to help develop 
a programme to comply with the UK’ s new, legally 
binding, climate change and energy-saving 
scheme, the Carbon Reduction Commitment, 
where Charter will be a full participant.
Safety performance
Charter operates in heavy engineering 
environments where there is considerable 
inherent risk and we recognise the need to 
adopt best practice safety management across 
all our operations.
We are pleased to report that no fatalities 
occurred in 2009 (including on-site contractors). 
Nevertheless, we regret that during the year we 
recorded six amputations, all involving fingers, 
five to employees and one to a contractor. 
These incidents are considered unacceptable 
and we have placed the highest priority on 
investigating the root causes and implementing 
corrective action plans in each case.
In 2009, the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) was 1.17, around 24 per cent less than 
in 2008, and 50 per cent less than in 2007. 
The number of days away from work per 
200,000 hours worked was reduced by 26 per 
cent from 40 in 2008 to 29.5 in 2009. These 
numbers include acquisitions. The total number 
of hours worked in 2009 was 24.5 million 
compared to 26.1 million in 2008, a reduction of 
6 per cent.
In 2008 and 2009, the total numbers of near 
misses were recorded. Just under 3,400 such 
incidents were recorded in 2009, an increase of 
76 per cent from 2008. This reflects our effort to 
identify and correct hazardous situations before 
they can lead to a more serious injury. We 
continue to eliminate the root causes through use 
of hazard and risk assessment tools.
Correcting unsafe conditions before they result in 
injuries is also an important part of our approach. 
In the last quarter of 2008, ESAB started 
recording reports of unsafe conditions centrally, 
and during 2009 over 3,000 were logged. 
This has contributed to a progressive fall in both 
the number of injuries, and also the severity of 
these injuries.
Health
T o respond to the H1N1 flu virus, the business 
continuity plan was implemented, with Charter’ s 
crisis management team monitoring developments 
and issuing frequent communications. This 
ensured appropriate actions were taken at all 
businesses and continue to be taken.
Environmental performance
On the basis of UK government guidelines and 
the challenges of climate change and water 
scarcity, Charter has selected as environmental 
KPIs the reduction of direct and indirect energy 
usage, water consumption and waste transferred 
to landfill. This focus, which is integrated with the 
Lean Manufacturing initiative, is also expected to 
drive efficiency gains and cost savings.
Due to reporting deadlines, the latest annual 
environmental data available is for 2008. 
This relates to a year where production volumes 
in ESAB were at their highest ever levels. 
Data for 2009 is expected to be available in the 
second quarter when it will be added to the 
Company’ s website.
Between 2007 and 2008, ESAB’ s consumables 
production and revenue both increased by 
16.9 per cent; not surprisingly, all of ESAB’ s 
environmental KPIs also showed an increase. 
However, all KPIs reflect improvements in

eq). This reflects the increase in 
consumables production now in countries 
where a higher proportion of electricity is 
generated from fossil fuels, for example China 
and Poland. However, considering the increase 
in revenue, the business was more energy-
efficient in 2008, resulting in an 8.0 per cent fall 
in energy consumed and a 7.0 per cent fall in 
CO
2
eq emissions per £million of revenue 
generated.
In April 2009, ESAB set a 12-month target to 
reduce energy consumption at each site by 
10 per cent per tonne of consumables 
manufactured and by 5 per cent in its equipment 
factories and offices. A detailed blueprint for 
achieving best practice has been drawn up and 
communicated to factories. Each unit reports its 
energy usage monthly and also shares best 
practices with other sites. There are now 529 
live projects.
 ■ ESAB’ s waste to landfill increased by 8.8 per 
cent (from 8,694 tonnes to 9,460 tonnes) but, 
per £million of revenue, it fell by 6.9 per cent. 
This figure includes waste from a major project 
at the Monterrey site in Mexico that resulted 
in an additional 650 tonnes of waste to landfill 
in 2008. 
 ■ The consumption of water increased only 
insignificantly, from 1,248,292 cubic metres to 
1,252,575 cubic metres, and the total per 
£million of revenue fell by 14.2 per cent.
Data for Howden has been collected for 2007 
and 2008. 
 ■ Energy use increased by 12 per cent (from 
118,919 GJ to 133,075 GJ) whilst greenhouse 
gas emissions increased by 8.9 per cent (from 
17,660 TCO
2
eq to 19,233 TCO
2
eq). 
Considering the increase in revenue, Howden’ s 
energy efficiency improved, with a reduction of 
14.3 per cent in energy consumed per £million 
of revenue and a corresponding 16.6 per cent 
fall in CO
2
eq; 
 ■ Howden’ s waste to landfill increased by 
33.8 per cent (from 512 metric tonnes to 685 
tones), equivalent to a 3.0 per cent increase per 
£million of revenue. The main reason for this 
increase was a manufacturing process change 
that resulted in an unusually high level of scrap;
 ■ Water use increased by 1.4 per cent (from 
62,742 metric tonnes to 63,606 metric tonnes) 
but, per £million of revenue, it fell by 22.4 per 
cent. 
Howden has set a target for reducing the energy 
used by Howden’ s manufacturing sites by 5 per 
cent between March 2009 and March 2010. 
T o provide an improved measure of manufacturing 
efficiency this will be normalised using production 
hours rather than overall revenue. 
Quality  and  product  integrity  ESAB products are used in a wide variety 
of engineering structures across the world, 
requiring the highest levels of technology and 
manufacturing precision to provide assurance of 
weld integrity. In addition to our internal quality 
management, all of our products are tested 
routinely by external laboratories to provide the 
highest possible level of confidence.
ESAB is committed to objective disclosure on the 
quality and safety of our products, including real 
or perceived hazards relating to substances in 
the product, the product itself, or product use. 
Comprehensive safety data sheets have been 
compiled for every consumable product and are 
available online in 21 languages. They include 
advice on minimising impacts relating to product 
use and disposal.
The need for low-energy designs by our 
customers has led to the use of ever lighter 
materials, demanding more sophisticated 
welding techniques.
In 2009 ESAB’ s quality management team was 
strengthened with the appointment of a group 
quality director who will be implementing global 
standards to ensure that our products continue 
to meet the high specifications demanded by 
our markets.
Employment
Human resource (‘HR’) management
Charter, ESAB and Howden have a clear, 
three-year ‘roadmap’ for human resource 
development. The 2008-2011 plan is to take 
the ‘HR’ function away from traditional, reactive 
activities to one that delivers tangible 
business value.

Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
The Group’ s key 2009 goals for human resource 
management were managing and developing our 
existing talent worldwide, succession planning 
and more consistent and rigorous performance 
appraisal systems, including increased emphasis 
on CR objectives.
We have retained these priorities whilst, in the 
face of a major downturn, also prioritising a 
responsible redundancy programme. 
Our approach has involved a combination of 
short-term working options, clear redundancy 
selection frameworks, appropriate compensation 
packages, clear communications, engagement 
with unions and government officials and 
outplacement counselling. This approach not 
only respects those affected but maintains the 
respect and trust of our retained employees.
T o support our drive for more proactive HR 
management, our Group head of HR is also a 
Director of Charter Limited. We recruited a new 
head of HR for ESAB North America and 
strengthened HR capability supporting our global 
lines of business. The Howden global HR group, 
set up in 2008, has now identified 14 projects to 
be completed over five years, focusing on skills, 
development and retention. A new Howden HR 
information system was implemented in 2009, 
allowing the recording of employee details in 
seven languages in 17 countries and a similar 
system is to follow in ESAB. This aids legal 
compliance with equality laws, for example 
relating to ethnic origin in South Africa.
Employee numbers
Employee numbers at the end of 2009 were 
11,982 (2008: 13,364). As a consequence of a 
fall in demand, reductions in manned capacity 
were implemented throughout ESAB’ s 
businesses, and through the calendar year of 
2009 more than 1,200 jobs ceased taking 
ESAB’ s total reduction from autumn 2008 to 
December 2009 to 1,641. Howden has 
benefited to some degree from its backlog of 
orders, however, due to cost reduction 
requirements it was necessary to make 
approximately 270 people redundant in 2009.
Equal opportunities
Charter recognises and values diversity in the 
workforce and all recruitment, selection and 
promotion is on the basis of individual 
qualifications, skills, experience and merit. 
Our equal opportunities policy was 
re-communicated in ESAB in 2009.
No reports have been received of any breaches of 
anti-discrimination laws in all relevant jurisdictions 
concerning matters of gender, ethnic origin, age, 
religion, sexual orientation or disability.
Training and development
Recruitment, performance appraisal and reward 
processes have been enhanced across the 
Group. Through linking various processes 
together, such as the objectives planning process 
to that of budgeting and reporting, performance 
is being increasingly linked to reward. T alent 
management is linked to executive education, 
coaching and succession. This linkage of 
professional recruitment, performance 
management and reward directly supports the 
Company strategy of professional competence, 
excellence and customer focus. In order for 
ESAB to become the clients’ preferred partner 
and to be seen as ‘The Welding Authority’, the 
aim of the HR function is to enable better 
solutions for customers by means of superior 
people performance. Likewise Howden has used 
this HR philosophy to support its five-year 
strategic plan.
Charter businesses invest in employee skills and 
capabilities through a variety of programmes, 
including training and succession planning. 
The Charter Manual is being updated to clarify line 
managers’ responsibilities for managing their 
people and the Group continues to invest in 
developing skills across both ESAB and Howden, 
for example through the Lean Manufacturing 
programme. T wo ‘boot camps’ have been run in 
ESAB to train lean practitioners each of 10 days’ 
duration. During 2009, approximately 80 Howden 
managers from nine countries have participated in 
the Unipart Lean Leadership Training programme, 
with an additional 12 delegates from seven 
countries attending a ‘boot camp’. 
ESAB training
In 2009 ESAB made progress with its Leadership 
Development Programme. This programme 
involves 220 people worldwide who have been 
selected to join three talent groups: leadership 
talent, developing talent and technical talent. 
The programme has established an online 
community that can access a growing library of 
articles matching MBA standards and which can 
In August 2009 Howden Africa Holdings Limited, in partnership with electricity 
providers Eskom, awarded a grant of R100,000 to the Kwazamokuhle 
Secondary School at Hendrina in Mpumalanga to establish a science 
laboratory at the school. A Corporate Social Investment (‘CSI’) committee was 
also appointed and to date has presented more than R200,000 in financial 
assistance to causes located near Howden’s Booysens factory, South Africa. 
The principal long-term beneficiaries of Howden’s programme include 
Cotlands, St Mary’s Orphanage and Girls & Boys T own, the Viva English 
Project at Mount Pleasant School in Port Elizabeth and Nita T aljaard, Howden’s 
beneficiary at United Cerebral Palsy. 40      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

contribute via a collaborative software system. 
This programme is seen as critical to the 
Company’ s sustainable development by 
harnessing and developing its core talent.
The ESAB University was launched, focusing on 
a number of learning themes and workstreams. 
This was accompanied by the roll-out of a global 
e-learning capability, extending the previous 
year’ s pilot to North America. 750 individuals 
across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North 
America now use the SkillPort web system and 
more than 1,000 hours of training have already 
been delivered. Within ESAB University, a 
two-week residential leadership development 
programme was run with delegates from 
13 countries spanning the Americas, Europe, 
the Middle East, South East Asia and China. 
The faculty included Charter Executive Directors 
including the Chief Executive, who led a session 
on EHS.
2009 has also seen the delivery of an awareness 
programme on diversity and inclusion. This aims 
to create a more culturally aware cadre of 
managers and to guide executives around the 
world on how to be more successful in regional 
businesses. Executive Directors of Charter, 
Department Heads of Charter and senior ESAB 
managers received a briefing on equal 
opportunities and employment law.
Howden training
Howden held an HR conference in Spain in 
September 2009, focusing on training for global 
HR staff, including training on psychometric 
profiling. The conference also looked at 
developing plans to support the business in 
managing through an economic downturn.
Howden piloted a global management 
development programme in 2009, involving 
12 managers and covering a range of topics 
including recruitment, communications, 
performance management and leadership. 
Five more courses are planned for 2010, which 
will be extended to include EHS, and the goal is 
for all managers of people (385) to attend the 
programme over a three-year period. 
A core talent and succession management 
programme has also been continued in 2009. 
The programme, which dovetails performance 
appraisals into talent development and 
succession management, has achieved 100 per 
cent coverage of the 157 senior managers 
identified for participation.
The Howden Academy has continued in 2009; 
four cohorts have now been run, each lasting 
three weeks. Approximately 200 new engineers 
from 14 countries have attended the Howden 
Academy over the 1.5 years since starting in July 
2008, with more than 90 per cent of the 
engineers’ managers confirming an acceleration 
in productivity and effectiveness as a result of 
training received. The Howden Academy’ s 
success has been recognised by a number of 
awards, including the Glasgow Business Award 
for Excellence in Skills and Learning and the 
UK CBI Human Capital award for Education 
Skills and Leadership. In 2010 the Howden 
Academy will be made available to employees 
online, using e-learning modules. The course will 
also be developed further to include additional 
product ranges.
Media training has been provided for the Howden 
Board and Senior Executives and a coaching 
programme was delivered to develop those 
senior managers identified as potential leaders.
Employee communications
ESAB is continuously seeking to improve 
communications with its employees. During 
2009, ESAB continued with its in-house 
magazine ‘Let’ s T alk’, and the monthly Cascade. 
The Cascade communicates key messages 
through the management chain with local 
content added. The Cascade brief is posted on 
ESAB’ s intranet to ensure the fullest coverage. 
Key messages show frequent links to other 
business initiatives such as environment, health 
and safety performance, the Lean Programme, 
objective setting, performance management and 
organisation development. Increasingly, the 
intranet is used as a source of information and 
education, including portals for specialist 
knowledge and online learning.
Howden continues to produce the ‘T eam Brief’ 
every two months and a group newsletter every 
six months. Works councils and other 
consultative bodies continue to be used for 
two-way constructive dialogue and consultation 
on decisions affecting people at work. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    41
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
Sub-contractors and suppliers
ESAB and Howden’ s relationships with sub-
contractors and suppliers create potential risks in 
their supply chains associated with a range of CR 
issues linked, for example, to mineral extraction, 
manufacturing, employment, the environment 
and business ethics.
We aim to work with product suppliers that 
meet our own standards of safety, environmental 
and quality management. ESAB has a Code 
of Ethics for purchasing and has in place a 
self-assessment procedure through which about 
1,500 suppliers have been surveyed since 1997; 
non-conformances are addressed by the ESAB 
local business units. A list of banned and 
hazardous substances has also been circulated 
to suppliers and is monitored regularly.
From 2009, the self-assessment programme is 
being strengthened with the introduction of 
on-site environmental, health, safety and quality 
audits for finished goods suppliers. All new 
finished goods suppliers will be audited and 
we will also systematically cover the existing 
supply base.
Howden has implemented, group-wide, a formal 
vendor audit process, which includes ensuring 
the Charter Code of Conduct is followed.
Code  of  Conduct
Charter’ s Code of Conduct provides the 
framework for the behaviour expected of all 
employees in conducting themselves, whatever 
their role and wherever they are located. It is the 
responsibility of all Charter businesses and 
employees to ensure the Code and all supporting 
policies and procedures are complied with. 
As part of the Code of Conduct, Charter 
operates a whistleblowing policy which was 
re-issued in 2009. 20 events involving allegations 
of fraud, theft or other possible breaches of the 
Code of Conduct were investigated in 2009. 
13 resulted in dismissals, two led to resignations, 
four required no further action and one is still 
under investigation.
Communities
Many Charter businesses support local charities 
through fundraising or other forms of assistance. 
In addition, local voluntary initiatives and 
community investment serve to build stakeholder 
relations and enhance our reputation as an 
employer of choice and a good ‘corporate 
citizen’. Details of charitable donations are 
reported on page 46. 42      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

ordinary shares of the Company as well as details of their 
remuneration and service contracts can be found in the 
Remuneration report on pages 55 to 61.

Corporate  governance
A review of the Company’ s application of the principles and provisions 
of the 2008 Combined Code can be found on pages 49 to 52.
Directors’  indemnities
Each of the Directors has been granted an indemnity by the 
Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in respect of 
certain liabilities that may arise as a result of the Director acting as a 
Director or employee of the Company or an associated company. 
Under the terms of each indemnity, the relevant Director is 
indemnified against liability to third parties excluding the liability to 
pay criminal fines and regulatory penalties and certain other 
liabilities. In relation to any third-party claim, the Company may loan 
funds to a Director to allow him to fund his legal costs. Any such 
loan must be repaid by the Director if the Director is convicted of an 
offence, judgment is given against the Director or the Director’ s 
application for relief is refused by the court.
Financial  instruments
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the 
Company including interest rate, currency and credit risk are 
outlined in note 21 to the Company’ s consolidated financial 
statements.
Annual  General  Meeting
The Company’ s AGM will take place at 2.00 pm on 29 April 2010 
at 27 Northwood House, Northwood Park, Santry, Dublin 9, 
Ireland. The notice of AGM (the ‘Notice’) can be found in a 
separate circular to shareholders. The Notice sets out details of the 
resolutions that will be proposed at the AGM as well as explanatory 
notes giving the background and reasons for such resolutions.
In particular, the Notice contains a resolution proposing certain 
amendments to the Company’ s Articles of Association (‘the 
Articles’). The proposed amendments are intended to ensure that 
the Company retains a corporate governance framework 
equivalent to that of a UK incorporated listed company to the 
extent practicable. The proposed amendments reflect the final  46      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Directors’ report 
continued
phase implementation of the UK Companies Act 2006, the 
introduction of the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations 2009 in the 
UK effective on 3 August 2009 and certain miscellaneous updates.
The Notice also contains a resolution proposing an amendment to 
the Charter International plc Long-T erm Incentive Plan in respect of 
the maximum annual award which may be made to an employee 
of the Company.
Employees
The Company’ s policy is to encourage effective communication 
and consultation between employees and management. 
Subsidiaries develop their own consultation and communication 
procedures as part of their employment practices. Further details 
can be found in the corporate responsibility report on pages 36 to 
41 of the Business and financial review. The Company and its 
subsidiaries are equal opportunities employers and seek to attract, 
develop, deploy and reward prospective and present employees 
solely on the basis of merit, regardless of gender, race, colour, 
nationality, ethnic or racial origins, marital status, sexual orientation, 
age, religion or disability. In addition, the Company and its 
subsidiaries give full and fair consideration to applications for 
employment made by disabled people, having regard to their 
aptitudes and abilities. Should employees become disabled during 
employment, they would be considered for any necessary 
retraining and available work within their capabilities. For the 
purposes of training, career development and promotion, disabled 
employees are treated in the same way as other employees.
Creditor  payment  policy
The Group companies are responsible for establishing terms and 
conditions with their suppliers.
The creditor payment policy of the Company and its subsidiaries 
is to settle amounts due to creditors in accordance with agreed 
terms. The policy provides that local practice must be observed 
in the countries in which they operate and that standard payment 
terms in each country may also be varied by negotiation with 
individual suppliers. The Company had no trade creditors at the 
year end.
Charitable  and  political  contributions
During the year the Company and its subsidiaries donated 
£113,000 (2008: £121,000) to charities of which £9,000 
(2008: £13,000) was to charities in the United Kingdom. Within the 
United Kingdom, donations were made in the year to support 
charities working in medical research/support £6,000 (2008: 
£10,350) and community support £3,000 (2008: £2,650). There 
were no political donations made during the year (2008: £nil).
Research  and  development
The Company and its subsidiaries continue to place strong 
emphasis on research and development to meet the changing 
needs of the markets they serve. Research and development 
expenditure, which excludes engineering and production support 
costs, totalled £17.1 million (2008: £13.2 million) for the year of 
which £11.4 million (2008: £8.8 million) has been charged to the 
income statement for the year and £5.7 million (2008: £4.4 million) 
has been capitalised as intangible assets.
Share  capital  structure
Share capital
As at 23 March 2010, the Company had 166,955,167 fully 
paid ordinary shares of £0.02 each in issue which are listed on 
the London Stock Exchange. The Company has a single class 
of shares.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’ s shares are 
contained in the Articles of  Association, a copy of which can be 
obtained upon request to the Company Secretary. The Articles 
may only be changed by a special resolution passed at a general 
meeting of the Company. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to 
receive notice of, attend, speak and vote at any general meeting of 
the Company, except as described below.
Voting
On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present has one 
vote and on a poll every member who is present has one vote for 
every £0.02 in nominal amount of his shares. Where shares are 
held jointly, the vote of the shareholder who first appears on the 
register of members in respect of the share shall be conclusive. 
At any general meeting, a poll may be demanded by shareholders 
who are present and entitled to vote when (i) not less than five such 
shareholders make such a demand; (ii) any shareholders represent 
not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all shareholders 
having the right to vote at the meeting; or (iii) any shareholders 
represent not less than one-tenth of the total paid-up share capital. 
Holders of ordinary shares also have various rights to appoint a 
proxy or proxies (who need not be members of the Company) or, 
where appropriate, a corporate representative, to attend and vote 
on their behalf. Further details about the right to appoint a proxy or 
a corporate representative are set out in the Notice. The Directors 
may make calls on shareholders in respect of monies unpaid on 
their shares. If any call is not complied with, the Directors may 
serve a notice requiring payment with interest and expenses. 
Failure to comply with this may result in forfeiture of any share the 
subject of the notice. The Company has a lien on any share which 
is not fully paid.
Voting restrictions
No member shall, unless the Directors otherwise determine, be 
entitled to vote at a general meeting either personally or by proxy, 
or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation 
to meetings of the Company, if any call or other sum presently 
payable by him to the Company in respect of such shares remains 
unpaid. Further, a shareholder is not, unless the Directors otherwise 
determine, entitled to attend or vote at any general meeting if the 
shareholder has failed to comply with a notice under the Articles 
(an ‘Article 16 notice’) to investigate interests in the Company’ s 
shares within 14 days.
Dividends and other distributions
Subject to the provisions of Jersey Companies Law, the Company 
may by ordinary resolution declare dividends up to the amount 
recommended by the Directors. The Board may, if authorised by 
an ordinary resolution of the Company, offer any holder of shares 
(excluding treasury shares) the right to elect to receive a dividend in 
the form of fully-paid ordinary shares. Subject to the provisions of 
Jersey Companies Law, the Board may authorise the payment of 
dividends of such amount and on such dates as it thinks justified 
by the financial position of the Company.
If a shareholder who holds at least 0.25 per cent in nominal value of 
the ordinary shares is in default of an Article 16 notice, then the 
Directors may also withhold the payment of any dividend to and 
restrict the transfer of shares held by that shareholder.
Payments of dividends
The Company’ s Income Access Share Arrangements (‘IAS’) mean 
that shareholders are able to elect whether they receive their 
dividends from a company resident for tax purposes in the 
Republic of Ireland or, instead, under the IAS arrangements from a 
company resident for tax purposes in the UK. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    47
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
Where no election has been made to receive dividends under the 
IAS, dividends paid by the Company will be treated as having an 
Irish source and may, subject to the availability of exemptions, be 
paid subject to Irish Dividend Withholding T ax.
Where an election has been made to receive dividends under the 
IAS, dividends will instead be paid from a UK tax resident company 
(Charter Limited) and will be treated as having a UK source. 
Dividends paid under the IAS will not be subject to UK 
Withholding T ax.
Copies of the IAS election form are available on the Company’ s 
website at www.charter.ie.
For a general summary of some of the tax implications of receiving 
dividends with an Irish source from the Company, or dividends with 
a UK source under the IAS, please see the section on the 
Company’ s website at: www.charter.ie relating to the IAS.
Transfer restrictions
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer of any share which 
is not a fully paid-up share and refuse to register any transfer in 
favour of more than four persons jointly. The Directors may also 
refuse to recognise any instrument of transfer unless it is in respect 
of any one class of share, is lodged at such place as they may 
determine and, where appropriate, is accompanied by any relevant 
share certificates and such other evidence as they may reasonably 
require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer. 
The Directors may also suspend transfers where a shareholder 
has failed to comply with an Article 16 notice, in the manner 
noted above.
Certain restrictions on transfers of shares may from time to time be 
imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws) 
and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority 
whereby certain employees of the Company require the approval of 
the Company to deal in the Company’ s ordinary shares. The 
Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of 
securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities.
Securities carrying special rights
Without prejudice to any special rights which have been conferred 
on any shareholders, any share of the Company may be issued 
with such preferred, deferred or other special rights or subject to 
such restrictions as the Directors or the shareholders may 
determine. No shares have been issued that carry any special 
rights with regard to the control of the Company.
Variation of rights
Subject to the provisions of Jersey Companies Law and to any 
rights attached to existing shares (and except in the case where 
there is only one holder of the issued shares of a class of shares, 
in which case any and all of the rights attached to that class of 
shares may be varied only with the consent in writing of that 
holder), rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with 
the written consent of the holders of not less than two-thirds in 
nominal value of the issued shares of that class (calculated 
excluding any shares held as treasury shares), or with the sanction 
of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the 
holders of those shares. At every such separate general meeting 
(except an adjourned meeting) the quorum shall be two persons 
holding or representing by proxy not less than one-third in nominal 
value of the issued shares of the class (calculated excluding any 
shares held as treasury shares).
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Shareholders may, by special resolution, set out regulations or 
provisions by which the Directors must abide. The Directors shall 
be not less than two in number. The Company may by ordinary 
resolution vary the minimum and/or maximum number of Directors. 
A Director shall not be required to hold any shares in the Company. 
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution 
or by the Board. A Director appointed by the Board holds office 
only until the next following AGM of the Company and is then 
eligible for re-appointment. The Board or any committee authorised 
by the Board may from time to time appoint one or more Directors 
to hold any employment or executive office for such period and on 
such terms as they may determine and may also revoke or 
terminate any such appointment.
At every AGM of the Company, any Director who has been 
appointed by the Board since the last AGM, or who held office at 
the time of the two preceding AGMs and who did not retire at 
either of them, or who has held office with the Company, other 
than employment or executive office, for a continuous period of 
nine years or more at the date of the AGM, shall retire from office 
and may offer himself for re-appointment by the members. The 
Company may by ordinary resolution remove any Director before 
the expiration of his period of office. The office of a Director shall be 
vacated if: (i) he resigns or offers to resign and the Board resolves 
to accept such offer; (ii) his resignation is requested by all of the 
other Directors and all of the other Directors are not less than three 
in number; (iii) he is or has been suffering from mental or physical ill 
health and the Board resolves that his office be vacated; (iv) he is 
absent without the permission of the Board from meetings of the 
Board (whether or not an alternate director appointed by him 
attends) for six consecutive months and the Board resolves that his 
office is vacated; (v) he becomes bankrupt or compounds with his 
creditors generally; (vi) he is prohibited by law from being a Director; 
(vii) he ceases to be a Director by virtue of the provisions of Jersey 
Companies Law; or (viii) he is removed from office pursuant to the 
Company’ s Articles.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’ s Memorandum and Articles of 
Association, the Jersey Companies Law and any directions given 
by the Company by special resolution, the business of the 
Company will be managed by the Board who may exercise all the 
powers of the Company, whether relating to the management of 
the business of the Company or not. In particular, the Board may 
exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, to 
guarantee, to indemnify, to mortgage or charge any of its 
undertaking, property, assets (present and future) and uncalled 
capital and subject to the Jersey Companies Law to issue 
debentures and other securities and to give security for any debt, 
liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party.
Powers in relation to the Company issuing or buying back its 
own shares
At the AGM shareholders will be asked to grant a further authority 
to allot shares in the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for 
or convert any security into shares in the Company (i) up to a 
nominal amount of £1,113,034, and (ii) comprising equity securities 
(as defined in the Articles) up to a nominal amount of £2,226,068 
(after deducting from such limit any allotments or grants made 
under (i)) in connection with an offer by way of a rights issue (the 
‘allotment authority’), such allotment authority to apply until the end 
of next year’ s AGM (or, if earlier, until 30 June 2011).
A special resolution will also be proposed to renew the Directors’ 
power to make non-pre-emptive issues for cash in connection with 
rights issues and otherwise up to a nominal amount of £166,955.
No market purchases were made by the Company during the year 
ended 31 December 2009. 48      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

continued
A special resolution will also be proposed to renew the Directors’ 
authority to repurchase the Company’ s ordinary shares in the 
market. The authority will be limited to a maximum of 16,695,516 
ordinary shares and sets the minimum and maximum prices which 
may be paid.

Significant agreements
The Company acts as guarantor in respect of a £75 million 
Multi-Currency Revolving Facility Agreement dated 3 September 
2008 between HSBC Bank (‘HSBC’) and Charter Central Finance 
Limited, a subsidiary of the Company. This contains a change of 
control provision which, if triggered, could restrict further utilisations 
and/or require the repayment of all outstanding utilisations. In such 
circumstances HSBC may also call for cash collateral for 
outstanding utilisations under separate documentary credit 
facilities, totalling US$130 million provided to two subsidiaries 
of the Company.
Similar change of control provisions are contained in other credit 
facilities that Charter Central Finance Limited has entered into with 
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB, Bank of China (UK) Limited, 
Lloyds TSB Bank plc and Barclays Bank plc.
The Company’ s Long-T erm Incentive Plan contains provisions that 
allow outstanding awards to vest in certain circumstances upon a 
change of control of the Company. Conditional awards made 
pursuant to the Charter International plc Deferred Bonus Plan will 
automatically vest on a change of control of the Company. Further 
details concerning the above can be found in the Remuneration 
Report on pages 55 to 61.
Rights under the employee share schemes
Under the rules of the Charter International Long-T erm Incentive 
Plan and the Charter International Deferred Bonus Plan eligible 
employees are awarded shares in the Company. As at 23 March 
2010, Appleby Trust (Jersey) Limited as trustee of the Charter 
Employee Trust holds 0.044 per cent of the issued share capital of 
the Company on trust for the benefit of the Executive Directors, 
senior executives and managers of the Group. The voting rights in 
relation to these shares have been waived by the Trustee.
Corporate responsibility (‘CR’)
The Company’ s report on CR, including its approach to health 
and safety, social, environmental and other related environmental 
issues, can be found on pages 36 to 41 of the Business and 
financial review.
Statement of disclosure of information to Auditors
So far as the Directors each are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (that is, information needed by the Company’ s Auditors 
in connection with preparing their report) of which the Company’ s 
Auditors are unaware, and each Director has taken all reasonable 
steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make 
himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Company’ s Auditors are aware of that information.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
The Directors (whose names and functions are set out on 
pages 42 and 43) confirm that, to the best of their knowledge, 
the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the Group taken as a whole; and the Directors’ 
report includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the Group 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
Auditors to the Company and a further resolution to authorise 
the Board to fix the Auditors’ remuneration will be proposed at 
the AGM.

1 Compliance  with  the  Combined  Code
The Company monitors its compliance with the requirements of 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the ‘Combined 
Code’) most recently revised in June 2008 on a continuous basis.
This report, in addition to the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 
61 and the Audit Committee report on pages 53 and 54, describes 
how the Company has applied and complied with the principles, 
supporting principles and provisions contained in the Combined 
Code, and in accordance with the Combined Code’ s ‘comply or 
explain’ principle, further explains where the Company has not 
complied with the provisions of the Combined Code. The Board is of 
the opinion that in respect of the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 
December 2009 the Company has been in compliance with the 
provisions of the Combined Code with only one exception. The 
service contracts of Michael Foster and Robert Careless contain 
liquidated damages clauses, which are in contrast to requirement 
B.1.5 of the Combined Code for outgoing directors to mitigate their 
loss. The Board feels that these arrangements are not excessive and 
serve to balance the interests of shareholders with the need to 
ensure the retention of these individuals. The policy has been revised 
with regard to the service contracts of new Executive Directors and 
hence the service contract of James Deeley contains no such 
provision.
2 Directors
(a) The Board
The Board conducts itself in such a way as to provide leadership to 
the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective employees. 
It is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance 
and to the delivery of enhanced shareholder value in a manner 
consistent with sound business practices and proper standards of 
the Company’ s Corporate Responsibility Report (‘CR’). In providing 
such leadership, the Board focuses on integrity and personal 
responsibility with the overriding objective of creating shareholder 
value. The Board operates in accordance with a Management and 
Governance Framework (the ‘Framework’). This has been 
approved and adopted by the Board, and consolidates those 
policies which govern the management and governance of the 
Company and its subsidiaries. The Framework contains details of: 
(a) the specific powers that the Board has retained (b) the authority 
that has been delegated to the Board Committees and their terms 
of reference and (c) the role of the Board, the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive. The Framework is kept under regular review and 
modified as and when new situations, requirements or 
developments in best practice arise. The Board ensures that the 
membership of its committees is refreshed so that undue reliance 
is not placed on individual Directors. The Board meets regularly 
and there are seven scheduled meetings for 2010.
The Board hosts an annual strategy conference at which it 
considers and determines the strategic plans for the Company’ s 
businesses. Details of attendance at meetings of the Board and its 
Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees are shown in 
the following table. Agendas and supporting papers are distributed 
to Directors in advance of each meeting so that the meeting can 
benefit from informed debate. No individuals other than the 
Committee chairman and the members are entitled to be present 
at meetings of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration 
Committees, although others including the Executive Directors, the 
Charter HR Director, Head of Internal Audit, Head of T axation and 
the external Auditors may attend at the prior invitation of the 
relevant committee chairman.

The powers and authorities retained by the Board include:
 ■ the approval of annual and half year results, interim management 
statements and associated announcements;
 ■ the membership, authority and terms of reference of Board 
committees;
 ■ corporate strategy;
 ■ significant financing arrangements;
 ■ matters relating to share capital (including employee share 
schemes and share options);
 ■ contracts or expenditures in excess of certain monetary 
thresholds;
 ■ adoption of annual budgets; and
 ■ approval of appointments of Directors to the Board and the 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary.
Subject to these retained powers and authorities, the day-to-day 
management of the Company’ s subsidiaries resides with the 
boards of those subsidiaries. Any concerns that the Non- Executive 
Directors may have regarding either the administration of the 
Company and its subsidiaries, or any proposed actions, are 
recorded in the minutes of the Company where an alternative 
resolution cannot be found. The Company has provided its 
Directors with appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal 
proceedings and other claims against them.
(b) Board committees
(i) Standing Committee
Composition: Any two Directors of the Company.
Role: The Committee is responsible for taking necessary steps that 
are ancillary to and required in order to progress transactions that 
have been approved in principle by the Board and which relate to 
the Company, to review and make recommendations to the Board 
in respect of the Policies and Procedures Manual and determine 
the remuneration and other terms and conditions of appointment 
of the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. 50      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate governance 
continued
(ii) Nominations Committee
Composition: Lars Emilson (Chairman), Michael Foster, John Biles, 
Grey Denham, Andrew Osborne and Manfred Wennemer, who 
joined the Committee on his appointment to the Board on 
26 March 2009. The Hon. James Bruce retired from the 
Committee on 29 April 2009. All of the members of the 
Committee, excluding Michael Foster, are considered independent 
Non-Executive Directors pursuant to the Combined Code and 
accordingly a majority of the members are independent.
Role: The Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board concerning appointments to the Board, including 
evaluating the skills, knowledge and experience required and 
setting a job description for specific appointments. In fulfilling its 
role in respect of new appointments, the Committee generally 
seeks advice and assistance from external search consultants 
to identify, benchmark and select appropriate candidates. In July 
2008 the Committee appointed an executive search consultant 
to assist in sourcing a suitable candidate to recommend for 
appointment to the Board of Directors. Having met the 
Committee’ s search criteria and having undergone a series of 
interviews with the Chairman and the Directors of the Company, 
Manfred Wennemer was appointed a Non-Executive Director of 
the Company.
The Board of Charter International plc reviewed plans for orderly 
management succession in relation to both Board and senior 
management appointments at its annual strategy conference in 
September 2009. The Board believes that this provided the 
necessary reassurance that appropriate plans have been adopted 
to ensure that the correct balance of skills and experience are 
maintained on the Board and within the senior management of the 
Company and its subsidiaries.
(iii) Remuneration Committee
Composition: Grey Denham (Chairman), John Biles, Lars Emilson, 
Andrew Osborne and Manfred Wennemer, who joined the 
Committee on his appointment to the Board on 26 March 2009. 
The Hon. James Bruce retired as Chairman and as a member of 
the Committee on the 29 April 2009. The members of the 
Committee are considered independent Non-Executive Directors 
pursuant to the Combined Code.
Role and activities: An explanation of the role and activities of the 
Committee can be found in the remuneration report on pages 55 
to 61.
(iv) Disclosure Committee
Composition: The Committee comprises the three Executive 
Directors.
Role: The Committee is primarily responsible for the creation and 
maintenance of appropriate procedures, systems and controls to 
ensure compliance by the Company with its obligations under the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (‘DTR’) and the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority. In particular, it has responsibility for 
the determination, on a timely basis, of the disclosure treatment of 
material information and designing, implementing and evaluating 
disclosure controls and procedures that operate within the 
Company and its subsidiaries. The Committee also has 
responsibility for identifying inside information, for the purpose of 
maintaining the Company’ s insider lists as required by the DTR.
(v) Audit Committee
Details regarding the membership, role, responsibilities and work of 
the Committee during the year under review can be found in the 
Audit Committee report on page 53.
(c) Chairman and Chief Executive
Lars Emilson is Chairman and Michael Foster is Chief Executive of 
the Company. The Board believes that the two roles carry different 
responsibilities and has approved a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and Chief Executive which is reflected in 
the Framework. The Chairman has primary responsibility for 
leading the Board, for ensuring its effectiveness, and for ensuring 
that good communications are maintained with shareholders, while 
the Chief Executive has responsibility for running the Company’ s 
businesses. Lars Emilson has no significant commitments that 
require disclosure in relation to his Chairmanship. The Chairman 
periodically meets with the Non-Executive Directors without the 
other Executive Directors present as well as maintaining contact 
should they wish to raise any issues with him outside the formal 
setting of the Board meetings.
(d) Board balance and independence
The Board currently comprises nine Directors, three of whom are 
Executive and six of whom are Non-Executive. The Board believes 
that this structure provides the correct balance of skills and 
experience for the business and would allow for any changes to 
the Board’ s composition to be managed without undue disruption, 
whilst ensuring that the presence of six Non-Executive Directors 
prevents a concentration of power and influence in a small number 
of individuals. The Board has determined that, with the exception 
of John Neill who is no longer considered to be independent by 
virtue of his combined length of service on the Boards of the 
Company and Charter plc and his relationship with the Unipart 
Group of Companies, all of the Non-Executive Directors including 
the Chairman are regarded as independent. The Board does not 
consider that there exist any relationships or circumstances likely 
to affect the judgement of any Non-Executive Director. The Board 
greatly values the contribution and experience of John Neill and 
recommends his re-election at the forthcoming AGM as a 
Non-Executive Director. No Executive Director currently holds a 
non-executive directorship of a FTSE 100 company.
(e) Information and professional development
The Company Secretary, under the guidance of the Chairman, is 
responsible for ensuring good information flows within the Board 
and its committees. All Directors of the Company have access to 
the advice and services of the Company Secretary and may take 
independent professional advice on any matter relating to the 
Company at the Company’ s expense. In advance of Board and 
committee meetings, Directors and relevant committee members 
receive detailed papers on the matters to be considered, enabling 
them to request further clarification or additional information and to 
participate fully in discussions. The Company Secretary is 
responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, 
on all governance matters and best practice.
The Company has a comprehensive induction process for all 
Directors when they join the Board. This includes a detailed 
information pack, which combines publicly available information, 
such as the Annual Report and product information, with confidential 
briefing notes on the Company’ s financing arrangements, corporate 
structures, management accounts, advisers and other relevant 
information. In addition briefing meetings are organised with key 
members of the Board and senior management and visits are 
arranged to the Company’ s businesses.
(f) Performance evaluation
Evaluation of the Board and its principal committees is conducted 
by gathering feedback from the relevant Board members. This 
feedback is gathered from two sources: a) a confidential 
questionnaire eliciting both measurable data and free-format 
responses and b) individual interviews. The process is run by the 
Charter HR Director who collates the results and presents them to  Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    51
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
the Chairman and the Board. The individual interviews are between 
the Chairman and Board members who give their feedback on 
Board performance against a structured agenda. Board members 
also give more general comment on the performance of the Board 
and its committees. The Chairman is responsible for conducting 
the Chief Executive’ s performance review. The Non-Executive 
Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, are responsible 
for evaluating the performance of the Chairman. In doing so, they 
also take account of the views of the Executive Directors. The Chief 
Executive conducts individual evaluations of the Executive Directors 
as part of the Company’ s formal performance management 
process. Performance is assessed against written objectives.
The results of the 2009 questionnaire and the individual meetings 
were summarised in a paper submitted to the Board by the 
Charter HR Director on 3 December 2009. This considered the 
areas that the Directors identified for improvement and set out the 
way in which they will be addressed. In addition, careful attention 
was given to those areas that recorded different ratings since the 
similar exercise in 2008. The Board was unanimous in its 
agreement with the assessment that the Board, its committees 
and individuals continued to be effective and that there had been 
an overall improvement in effectiveness in 2009. The Board valued 
the continuity of approach and the total confidentiality of the 
questionnaire and agreed to repeat the process in 2010.
(g) Re-appointment
Under Article 93 of the Articles of Association of the Company, at 
every AGM any Director who has been appointed by the Board 
since the last AGM, or who held office at the time of the two 
preceding AGMs and who did not retire at either of them, or who 
has held office with the Company, other than employment or 
executive office, for a continuous period of nine years or more at 
the date of the meeting, shall retire from office and may offer 
himself for re-appointment by the members.
Given that the Company’ s first AGM was held in April last year, all 
the Directors accordingly came up for election. As a result, none of 
the Directors are required to stand for re-election at the forthcoming 
AGM, apart from John Neill who is subject to annual re-election by 
virtue of his length of service.
(h) Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Company has procedures in place to deal with Directors’ 
conflicts of interest and these procedures have operated effectively.
3 Accountability  and  Audit
(a) Financial reporting & Directors’ responsibilities
The following paragraphs set out the responsibilities of the 
Directors in relation to the consolidated financial statements for the 
Group and the financial statements for the Company. The reports 
of the external Auditors, shown on page 62, set out their 
responsibilities in relation to those financial statements.
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 (as amended) (the 
‘Jersey Companies Law’), the Directors are responsible for 
preparing financial statements for the Company in respect of each 
of its financial periods. The Company’ s financial statements are 
required to show a true and fair view of, or be presented fairly in all 
material respects, so as to show: (i) the profit or loss of the 
Company for the financial period covered by such financial 
statements; and (ii) the state of affairs of the Company at the end of 
such financial period. The Company’ s financial statements for each 
of its financial periods are required to be prepared in accordance 
with the generally accepted accounting principles adopted by the 
Company and to specify such generally accepted accounting 
principles. The Company’ s financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles 
(‘UK GAAP’).
Although the Company is not required to prepare consolidated 
financial statements for the Group under the Jersey Companies 
Law, it is required to prepare them under the Listing Rules of the 
London Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements for 
the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union.
In preparing both the consolidated financial statements for the 
Group and the financial statements for the Company, the Directors 
were required to:
(1)  select appropriate accounting policies and apply them 
consistently;
(2)  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
(3)  state whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures being disclosed and 
explained; and
(4)  prepare those financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless they consider them to be inappropriate.
The Directors are responsible under the Jersey Companies Law 
for ensuring that the Company keeps accounting records which 
are sufficient to show and explain its transactions and that are such 
as to disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial 
position of the Company and to enable the Directors to ensure 
that the Company’ s financial statements comply with the Jersey 
Companies Law. The Directors are required to have the Company’ s 
financial statements for each of the Company’ s financial periods 
audited, and for this purpose, to provide the Auditors with a right of 
access to the Company’ s records and to provide them with such 
information and explanations as they think necessary for the 
performance of their duties as auditors.
The Directors are also responsible for taking reasonable steps 
to safeguard the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and, 
in that context, to have proper regard to the establishment of 
appropriate systems of internal control with a view to the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are 
responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’ s website.
The requirements of Jersey Companies Law and UK legislation 
which govern the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from the requirements of applicable 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that they have taken the actions necessary 
to meet their responsibilities as set out in the paragraphs above.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and its subsidiaries have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing both the consolidated financial statements for 
the Group and the financial statements for the Company.
(b) Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the maintenance of a 
system of internal control. The Audit Committee has been formally 
delegated responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control. The processes to manage the key risks 
to the success of the Company and its businesses are reviewed 
and improved as necessary. There is an organisational structure 
with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority  52      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate governance 
continued
and there are also established policies and procedures for 
monitoring each business. While the operational control is largely 
decentralised and responsibility is delegated, the businesses are 
subject to the overall internal control framework. This, by its nature, 
can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. Detailed policies and procedures 
have been established by the Board dealing with numerous issues, 
including internal controls. Examples of internal control procedures 
are summarised on the following pages:
(i) Assessment of business risk
A system of risk identification, assessment and evaluation of 
controls is embedded within the Company’ s management 
processes. Strategic risks and opportunities arising from changes 
in the business environment are regularly reviewed by the senior 
management and formally discussed by the Board. Risks relating 
to key activities within the operating businesses and at the 
Company’ s head office are assessed on a continuous basis and 
reported to the Board as appropriate.
(ii) Control environment
Under the Framework described on page 49, the Board sets 
overall policy and approves the core policies and procedures to be 
adopted by all of its subsidiaries. A well-defined organisational 
structure with clear operating procedures and lines of responsibility 
and delegated authority has been established. There are 
procedures for appraisal, review and authorisation of matters 
of significance, including investments, capital expenditure, 
borrowings, guarantees, indemnities and material contracts.
(iii) Information and communication
The Company’ s operating procedures include a comprehensive 
system for reporting financial and non-financial information to the 
Board, including:
 ■ the preparation and review of annual budgets and monthly 
results and forecasts;
 ■ a review of the businesses at each Board meeting, focusing on 
any new risks arising (for example, those relating to proposed 
major investments and key changes in the markets); and
 ■ meetings between various Executive Directors and operational 
management.
(iv) Control procedures
Detailed operational procedures are developed for each key 
business activity that embody key controls. The implications of 
changes in law and regulations are taken into account within these 
procedures. Procedures are established to safeguard the assets of 
the Company and its subsidiaries and to ensure that all financial 
transactions are properly recorded. Accounting policies and 
practices are widely disseminated throughout the Company’ s 
subsidiaries and its affiliates.
Control processes are dynamic. Continuous improvements are 
made to adapt them to the changing risk profile of operations and 
whenever a weakness in the internal control system is identified 
appropriate remedial action is taken.
The Company is committed to the highest ethical standards. 
The Company has an established code of business conduct that 
requires that all of its businesses and employees act with integrity 
at all times and that there is strict compliance with applicable laws. 
Employees are provided with a whistleblowing hotline allowing 
them to raise concerns anonymously. These reports are monitored 
by the Audit Committee and are investigated as appropriate by the 
Charter Head of Internal Audit independently of management. 
Recently the Company completed investigations into possible 
irregular payments that might have been made by two overseas 
third party agents of two Howden subsidiaries to obtain business in 
an emerging market. Howden is in the process of reinforcing its 
existing ethics and compliance programme, to ensure these 
standards are maintained and this includes the use of third party 
agents. This work has been ongoing for the last year and is 
expected to take another 12 months to complete.
(v) Monitoring process
There are clear procedures for monitoring the system of internal 
controls. The significant components of these are:
 ■ the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of each 
operating company are required to review internal controls and to 
return a self-certified internal control questionnaire confirming the 
effectiveness of internal control systems;
 ■ each operating company deploys a variety of risk identification 
and assessment processes and develops mitigating actions. 
Major, high or medium risks are escalated and progress on 
action plans is reviewed at least quarterly as part of management 
meetings. The Board reviews every six months the major and 
high risks and monitors progress against action plans;
 ■ as part of its audit visits to operating companies, the internal 
audit function evaluates the effectiveness of internal controls. 
The Audit Committee reviews the findings of the internal audit 
process;
 ■ the Audit Committee has specific responsibility for reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal controls and monitors the process of 
assessing the internal controls on behalf of the Board; and
 ■ the Audit Committee reviews the process by which risks are 
identified and assessed by operating units, operational 
management and the Board.
The Board confirms it has carried out a review of the effectiveness 
of the system of internal controls described above for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2009 and up to the date of this Report in 
accordance with the guidance set out in Internal Control: Revised 
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code (the ‘Turnbull 
Guidance’). The review encompassed operational, financial and 
compliance controls as well as risk management.
The system used included the following key elements: (i) as part of 
their ongoing reviews of the business, the Executive Directors and 
Key Management reviewed the effectiveness of strategic, 
operational and compliance internal controls and risk management. 
This involved considering reports on key risk areas (concentrating 
on significant changes in the risk profile) and in the light of such 
reviews making appropriate amendments to policies and 
procedures to control risks; and (ii) the Board considered reports 
from the Audit Committee and the Executive Directors on these 
areas during the year and, at the time of approving the Annual 
Report, considered a summary of the assessments of the 
effectiveness of the controls on the key risks identified.
4  Relations  with  shareholders
The Company has a policy of maintaining an active dialogue 
with institutional shareholders through individual meetings. 
Communications with private shareholders are conducted through 
the Annual Report, Company announcements, presentations at 
the AGM and the Company’ s website which, includes descriptions 
of the Company’ s business operations. The Board receives regular 
updates on all meetings and communications with major 
shareholders and major shareholders are offered the opportunity 
to meet with the Non-Executive Directors from time to time. 
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that cannot be addressed 
through regular channels such as the Chairman, Chief Executive 
or Finance Director. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    53

Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
Composition
The Committee comprises John Biles (Chairman), Grey Denham, 
Andrew Osborne and Manfred Wennemer, who joined the 
Committee on his appointment to the Board on 26 March 2009. 
The Hon. James Bruce retired from the Committee on 29 April 
2009. The members of the Committee are considered 
independent Non-Executive Directors pursuant to the Combined 
Code. Their biographical details are set out on pages 42 to 43 and 
their remuneration on pages 55 to 61. The Company Secretary 
acts as secretary to the Committee. The Board, as part of the 
review of the effectiveness of the Board and its committees, has 
satisfied itself that both John Biles and Andrew Osborne have 
recent and relevant financial experience, as required by the 
Combined Code.
Role  of  the  Committee
The Committee is a sub-committee of the Board, to whom it 
reports its findings, and its primary role is to ensure the integrity of 
the financial reporting and audit processes, and the maintenance 
of a sound internal control and risk management system. 
In pursuing these objectives, the Committee:
 ■ monitors the integrity of the financial statements of the Company 
and any formal announcements relating to the Company’ s 
financial performance;
 ■ makes recommendations to the Board regarding the adoption of 
annual and half yearly financial reports and the approval of any 
other formal announcements relating to the Company’ s financial 
performance;
 ■ reviews the Company’ s internal financial controls and internal 
control and risk management systems;
 ■ monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Company’ s internal 
audit function;
 ■ makes recommendations to the Board regarding the external 
Auditors and their terms of appointment;
 ■ reviews and monitors the external Auditors’ independence and 
objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process;
 ■ is responsible for developing and implementing a policy on the 
engagement of the external Auditors to supply non-audit 
services; and
 ■ makes recommendations to the Board in relation to 
‘whistleblowing’ policies and procedures.
In the performance of its duties, the Committee has independent 
access to the internal audit function and to the external Auditors; 
and may obtain outside professional advice as necessary. Both the 
Head of Internal Audit and the external Auditors have direct access 
to the Chairman of the Committee outside formal Committee 
meetings. The Committee has written terms of reference that 
outline its authority and responsibilities and the terms of reference 
are available for download at www.charter.ie. These are considered 
annually by the Committee and any proposed changes are referred 
to the Board for approval.
Report  on  the  Committee’s  activities  in  2009
Meetings and attendance
The Committee met on four occasions in 2009. Meetings of the 
Committee are timed to coincide with the financial and reporting 
cycles of the Company. Committee members’ attendance at the 
meetings held during the year is set out in the table contained 
in the corporate governance report on pages 49 to 52. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, senior 
representatives of the external Auditors, the Head of Internal 
Audit and senior financial executives from head office and the 
operations attended meetings by invitation for appropriate 
business. In addition, the members of the Committee met 
separately with the external Auditors and the Head of Internal Audit 
to discuss matters without the Executive Directors being present. 
The Chairman of the Committee reports to the subsequent 
meeting of the Board on the key issues covered by the Committee 
and the Board also receives copies of the minutes of each 
meeting. During the year the Chairman of the Committee has had 
additional meetings with the Company’ s senior financial managers 
to review a range of financial matters, and has also met with the 
external and internal Auditors prior to Committee meetings.
Financial reporting
During 2009 the Committee reviewed a wide range of financial 
reporting and related matters, including the interim and annual 
financial statements prior to their submission to the Board and 
the assessment of ‘going concern’ and liquidity risk.
The Committee focused in particular on key accounting policies 
and practices adopted by the Company and its subsidiaries and 
significant areas of judgement that impacted reported results 
including litigation and taxation matters. In respect of the 2009 
year-end review, the Committee has taken into account the key 
questions posed by the Financial Reporting Council in their paper 
‘Challenges for Audit Committees arising from current economic 
conditions’ and satisfied itself that the Company has taken the 
appropriate actions and has adequate resources and systems in 
place to deal with current trading conditions.
External Auditors
The Committee annually performs a review of the effectiveness of 
the Company’ s external Auditors, and has recommended to the 
Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , who have been the 
Company’ s auditors for a number of years, be re-appointed as the 
external Auditors of the Company. The Committee remains 
satisfied as to the independence of the external Auditors following 
a review at its meeting on 3 December 2009 and has received 
written confirmation from the external Auditors to this effect. 
The external Auditors are required to rotate the Group audit partner 
every five years and other key audit partners every seven years. 
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’ s 
choice of external auditor. In accordance with its remit, the 
Committee reviewed and adopted the external Auditors’ plans for 
the audit of the Company’ s 2009 financial statements. In approving 
the terms of engagement for the audit, the Committee considered 
the proposed audit fee and associated expenses. 54      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Audit Committee report 
continued
The Committee is responsible for the development, implementation 
and monitoring of the Company’ s policies on external audit and the 
provision of some other appropriate services by the external 
Auditors. The Committee has reviewed those non-audit services 
provided by the external Auditors throughout the year in 
accordance with the Company’ s policy on the provision of other 
services by the external Auditors. This policy notes that such 
services are likely to fall within the following types:
 ■ financial statements and external reports;
 ■ acquisitions;
 ■ disposals;
 ■ taxation; and
 ■ other services.
It identifies three categories of non-audit services: permitted 
engagements that require no specific approval; permitted 
engagements requiring the approval of the Committee Chairman; 
and engagements that are not permitted. The total fees paid to the 
external Auditors were £3.8 million of which £3.2 million related to 
the statutory audits of the parent company, consolidated accounts, 
subsidiary undertakings and other assurance-related services. 
The non-audit fees of £0.6 million represent 16 per cent of the total 
fees paid to the external Auditor. Further details of the fees paid to 
the external Auditors of the Company can be found in note 4 to the 
financial statements on page 79. 
Internal audit and monitoring of internal control issues
The Committee has reviewed the results of the audits undertaken 
by the internal audit function and considered the adequacy of 
management’ s response to the matters raised, including the 
implementation of recommendations made by the function. It also 
reviewed and approved the internal audit plan for the coming year 
and the level of resources allocated to the internal audit function. 
During 2009 internal audit also started tracking the status of work 
done throughout the Group in response to external Auditors’ 
management letter recommendations. 
The review of the effectiveness of the internal audit function was 
based primarily on guidelines issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants in England and Wales. The Committee reviewed the 
reports from the internal audit function and the external Auditors on 
the Company’ s systems of internal control and reported to the 
Board on the results of these reviews. Further details of the 
Company’ s system of internal control and its policies and 
procedures can be found in the Corporate governance report on 
pages 49 to 52.
Whistleblowing
The Company’ s whistleblowing policy was monitored by the 
Committee at its meetings throughout the year. All issues raised 
through the Company’ s whistleblowing procedures during the year 
were considered and follow-up actions were taken as and when 
required. Most whistleblowing issues were subject to independent 
follow-up by internal audit, the exceptions mainly being human 
resources-related issues.

Remuneration report 
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
The Directors present the Remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2009. The report describes how the Company has 
applied the principles of the Combined Code with regard to 
remuneration. Sections 3(iv) to 3(viii) and ‘Remuneration earned in 
the financial year’ on pages 59 to 61 are subject to audit.
1 The  Remuneration  Committee
The Board has delegated authority to the Remuneration 
Committee (‘the Committee’) to determine the remuneration and 
other terms and conditions of the Executive Directors, the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary and to formulate the policy 
for their remuneration. The Committee is also responsible for 
reviewing the remuneration trends across the Company and its 
major businesses and for reviewing the remuneration of those 
individuals identified as key and senior management by the Board 
of the Company.
The Committee had access to the advice of the Chief Executive, the 
Company Secretary and the Charter HR Director (none of whom 
participated in any discussion directly relating to their own 
remuneration). In conducting its duties the Committee was also 
advised by Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants (‘HNBS’ part of 
Hewitt Associates), who provided independent advice regarding the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration on a range of issues throughout 
the year, including the changes for 2010 set out below and Watson 
Wyatt who were engaged to present an overview of remuneration 
trends and to facilitate a Committee discussion on remuneration 
policy. Neither HNBS nor Watson Wyatt provided any other services 
to the Company during the year; however, Hewitt Associates 
provided actuarial advice to the Company.
The members of the Committee are Grey Denham, John Biles, 
Andrew Osborne and Manfred Wennemer (all of whom are 
independent Non-Executive Directors) and Lars Emilson (the 
Chairman of the Company). The Hon. James Bruce retired from 
the Board and as the Committee’ s Chairman on 29 April 2009 and 
Grey Denham was appointed Chairman of the Committee on that 
date. Manfred Wennemer joined the Committee on his 
appointment to the Board on 26 March 2009. Details of the 
number of meetings held by the Committee in 2009, as well as 
attendance details, can be found in the table contained in the 
Corporate governance report on page 49.
During 2009 some of the key issues addressed by the Committee 
were as follows:
 ■ reviewing and updating the Company’ s policy on Executive 
Directors’ remuneration to ensure it remained appropriate;
 ■ reviewing the base salaries of the Executive Directors for 2010;
 ■ setting performance targets in line with the Company’ s strategy 
for the annual bonus plan for 2010 and determining the amounts 
potentially payable, including increasing the maximum for the 
Chief Executive;
 ■ reviewing the structure of the long-term incentive arrangements 
and proposing changes to them for 2010;
 ■ agreeing to the percentage of the long-term incentive awards 
that should vest; and
 ■ agreeing to the amounts payable in respect of the annual bonus 
scheme.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available upon 
request from the Company Secretary and are on the Company’ s 
website at www.charter.ie.
2 Remuneration  policy
The Company seeks to attract, motivate and retain exceptional 
executives who have experience of operating in geographically 
complex, international engineering and manufacturing companies; 
in order to achieve these aims the Committee keeps the 
remuneration packages of Executive Directors under regular 
review.
The policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors is designed 
to ensure that their total reward is competitive and linked both to 
individual and business performance. Risk is taken into account 
when setting the targets and when determining entitlements under 
variable reward schemes; this is done by ensuring that targets, 
whilst stretching, are realistic, attainable and for the long-term 
benefit of the Company and that they are achievable without taking 
inappropriate business risks.
The salaries paid to Executive Directors are dependent on the 
experience and capabilities of the individual and are determined 
after having regard to the salaries paid by similar complex or 
geographically diverse businesses.
Short-term incentives (i.e. annual bonuses) are seen as an essential 
part of total reward and incentivisation for Executive Directors. 
Annual bonus targets will include separate elements for 
performance against both financial criteria (ordinarily calculated at 
constant currency rates) and personal objectives. The targets set 
will aim to address the issues facing the business over the coming 
year. It is the Committee’ s view that the bonus plan design should 
remain flexible and, where appropriate, be adjusted to reflect 
economic conditions.
The Committee believes that bonuses should reward high 
performance and deliver higher reward on the achievement of 
significant performance above expectation. It retains a discretion to 
adjust the amount of bonus paid if it believes the amount payable 
to be inappropriate in the light of underlying financial performance 
or economic circumstances.
25 per cent of bonus payments will ordinarily be deferred for three 
years and delivered by way of shares with no vesting for Directors 
who leave voluntarily or for cause during that period.
It is the view of the Committee that there should be long-term 
incentive plans for Executive Directors whereby they are rewarded 
with interests in the Company’ s shares for sustained performance 
over a period of time. As such, long-term incentives will continue to 
form an important element of total executive remuneration and 
appropriate performance criteria such as total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) and/or earnings per share (‘EPS’) will be used. All structural 
changes to long-term incentive arrangements requiring shareholder 
approval will be consulted upon with leading shareholders and 
shareholder bodies prior to such consent being sought.
The Committee considers that a substantial portion of 
remuneration should be linked to performance. Following the 
changes proposed for 2010, around 50 per cent of the Chief 
Executive’ s target remuneration package will be fixed pay, with 
the balance split broadly equally between annual bonus and 
long-term incentives.
When setting remuneration levels for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee has regard to general pay and employment policies 
across the Company as a whole as well as the wider market, in 
order to ensure that a coherent policy applies. 56      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

3  Overview  of  remuneration
(a) 2009 Review
A detailed review of the remuneration packages of the Executive 
Directors was undertaken in 2009. The results highlighted that the 
total remuneration packages and certain elements of them were 
uncompetitive. Details of the changes to base salaries, a change to 
the bonus plan for the Chief Executive and proposed changes to 
the Long-T erm Incentive Plan resulting from this review are set out 
in the relevant sections below. When considering these changes 
the Committee took into account the need to bring the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration packages more closely into line with the 
market whilst recognising the need for pay constraint in the current 
economic climate.
(b) Executive Directors
(i) Base salary
The base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually 
and following exceptional one-off events where the individual 
responsibilities of the Executive Director change significantly. 
Salaries are benchmarked against those paid to directors in 
companies in comparable sectors which are of a similar size and 
international complexity.
The base salaries of the Executive Directors were reviewed with 
effect from 1 January 2010 and details of the increases awarded 
are set out on page 59.
(ii) Bonus
The maximum bonus potential of the Executive Directors in 2009 
was 100 per cent of salary.
Actual bonus payouts in respect of 2009 were dependent on the 
achievement of a number of corporate and individual targets as 
discussed below. In order to align the interests of Directors with 
those of the Company’ s shareholders, it is the Company’ s policy 
that bonuses are only payable for the achievement of stretching 
performance targets, the majority of which are linked to the 
Company’ s financial performance. For the year ended 
31 December 2009, these targets were as follows:
(1) 64 per cent of bonus: EPS performance relative to budget;
(2) 16 per cent of bonus: cash flow performance relative to 
budget; and
(3) 20 per cent of bonus: personal performance.
For target 1, 40 per cent of the maximum bonus was payable for 
meeting budget (rather than 50 per cent as had been the practice 
in previous years) and for target 2, 50 per cent of the maximum 
bonus was payable for meeting budget. The maximum bonus 
would only become payable for a performance that was 
substantially in excess of budget. The Committee has reserved the 
overriding discretion to review aggregate bonus levels payable to 
Executive Directors based on the above criteria to ensure that they 
are appropriate taking into account the underlying financial 
performance of the Company and other factors. The bonuses 
payable to Executive Directors are not pensionable.
Following a review of the Executive Directors’ performance and the 
financial performance of the Company during the year ended 
31 December 2009, the Committee determined that the threshold 
EPS target had not been achieved and accordingly no bonus was 
paid in respect of this element. The threshold cash flow target was 
achieved and accordingly, a bonus payment of 5.8 per cent of 
salary was made in respect of this element of the bonus. 
In recognition of individual performances in respect of objectives 
set to strengthen and rationalise the Company, bonus payments 
were made at 20 per cent of salary in respect of the personal 
performance element. Details of the bonuses paid to the Executive 
Directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 2009 are set 
out on page 59.
In respect of the year ending 31 December 2010, with one 
exception, bonuses payable to the Executive Directors will be 
measured against the same performance categories and on the 
same basis as those used in determining the 2009 bonus 
entitlements. The Committee believes that EPS and cash remain 
the Company’ s most important metrics for 2010, with the recovery 
in earnings the most important priority for the year. The only change 
is in respect of the EPS target whereby 50 per cent of the 
maximum bonus for that performance category will be payable for 
meeting budget. This will require a significant improvement over 
2009. The maximum bonus will only become payable for a 
performance that is substantially in excess of budget and the 
threshold above which a percentage of the bonus first becomes 
payable (zero is payable at threshold) has been set at an EPS level 
above that achieved by the Company in 2009.
For the year ending 31 December 2010, Michael Foster’ s 
maximum bonus potential will increase from 100 per cent of salary 
to 125 per cent of salary. The Committee considers that this 
increase is appropriate and brings his maximum potential bonus 
entitlement more closely into line with the market.
The Committee has agreed that performance under the EPS 
element of the bonus will be measured on a constant currency 
basis. The Committee believes that this approach is a better 
reflection of management’ s underlying performance since 
exchange rates are not within management’ s control.
(iii) Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
One-quarter of any bonus paid to Executive Directors will be paid 
in shares acquired in the market and compulsorily deferred for 
three years under the DBP . If Executive Directors leave voluntarily or 
for cause during this deferral period, their awards will normally 
lapse. These shares are held in trust prior to their release on vesting 
following the expiration of the three-year deferral period.
(iv) Long-term incentives
Michael Foster’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘MF Plan’)
As described in previous remuneration reports, Michael Foster was 
granted an option over the Company’ s ordinary shares pursuant to 
a one-off arrangement that was put in place specifically to facilitate 
and secure his appointment as Commercial Director in 2005. 
The option was granted pursuant to paragraph 9.4.2 of the 
Stock Exchange Listing Rules, and so did not require shareholder 
approval. No grants were made in respect of the year under review 
and there is no intention to make any grants under this plan in the 
future.
The options had an exercise price of 217.99 pence, and were 
subject to performance conditions based on the Company’ s EPS 
and total shareholder return performance over the three years from 
grant. 50 per cent of the option required average real earnings per 
share growth of 3 per cent per annum over a single three-year 
period whilst the remaining 50 per cent was dependent upon the 
Company’ s TSR performance ranking in the upper quartile of the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts). Both conditions 
were met in full, and so the option became exercisable on 
13 March 2008. In  accordance with the rules of the plan Mr Foster 
exercised his award on 9 March 2009.
Charter International plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘CI LTIP’)
The CI LTIP was approved by the shareholders of the Company on 
27 August 2008. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    57
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
Under the CI LTIP , Executive Directors and selected other 
members of key management are eligible to receive awards which 
vest at nil cost to the executive three years after grant, subject to 
the satisfaction of performance conditions.
Currently, an individual may not receive awards in any financial year 
over shares having a market value in excess of 100 per cent of 
salary, except in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or 
retention, where an individual may receive an award over shares 
worth up to 200 per cent of their annual salary.
It is proposed that the rules of the CI LTIP be amended to increase 
the maximum market value of shares over which awards may be 
made in any financial year from 100 per cent to 150 per cent of 
annual salary. A resolution to approve this amendment to the rules 
of the CI LTIP will be put to the shareholders of the Company at the 
AGM to be held on 29 April 2010; details of the resolution are set 
out in the shareholders’ circular and notice of meeting dated 
23 March 2010. The Committee considers that this will provide 
them with the necessary flexibility to award grants of LTIPs that 
are in line with market practice.
In 2010, awards are proposed to be made to the Executive 
Directors of 125 per cent of annual salary. If in future, the 
Committee contemplates making awards at above 125 per cent of 
salary, it is the intention to consult with major investors beforehand.
Vesting is currently based on the Company’ s TSR performance 
compared with the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding 
investment trusts) over a single three-year period beginning on the 
date of the grant of the award. No vesting occurs for a below-
median ranking. At median, 25 per cent of the shares vest and at 
upper quartile 100 per cent of the shares vest. Between median 
and upper quartile rankings, awards vest on a straight-line basis. 
In addition, awards only vest if the Committee is satisfied that there 
has been a significant improvement in the Company’ s underlying 
financial performance over the three-year performance period. 
Awards normally only vest on or after the third anniversary of the 
date of grant provided that the individual remains an employee of 
the Company and the performance conditions and any other 
objective conditions have been satisfied. HNBS performs the 
TSR calculations for the purposes of the LTIP .
The Committee proposes that future awards made under the 
CI LTIP be subject to a new performance condition pursuant to 
which 60 per cent of the award will be based on the Company’ s 
relative TSR performance over three financial years and 40 per cent 
on adjusted EPS growth over the same three years. In future years, 
the Committee will consider the mix between EPS and TSR in 
the light of the then circumstances, but will only alter the balance 
after consultation with the Company’ s major shareholders. 
The Committee recognises that relative TSR aligns management 
reward with returns to investors, but considers that the introduction 
of an EPS-related element will provide a good balance and a clear 
connection between management performance and rewards. 
However, irrespective of the TSR outcome, no awards will vest in 
relation to the TSR part of the award unless the Committee is 
satisfied with the underlying financial performance of the Company 
over the performance period. EPS will be defined for this purpose 
on an adjusted basis and will be measured consistently. The 
Committee has considered carefully the range of targets for the 
2010 award and proposes that the range should be RPI plus an 
average of 6 per cent p.a. to RPI plus an average of 12 per cent 
p.a., with 25 per cent vesting at RPI plus 6 per cent p.a., rising on a 
straight-line basis until full vesting is achieved at RPI plus 12 per 
cent p.a. The Committee considers that this is a demanding range. 
The Committee wishes to retain the flexibility to set new targets 
each year, depending on the circumstances, but any new range 
will be no less challenging in the circumstances than the original 
range was when it was set. A resolution to approve this new 
performance condition will be put to the shareholders of the 
Company at the AGM to be held on 29 April 2010; details of the 
resolution are set out in the shareholders’ circular and Notice of 
meeting dated 23 March 2010.
(v) Share ownership guidelines
The Executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain a 
holding of 100 per cent worth of salary in shares in the Company. 
This is expected to be built via the retention of at least 50 per cent 
of the net gain on vested awards under the Company’ s share 
incentive schemes until the guideline has been achieved.
(vi) Dilution
In the period to 31 December 2009 the Company has remained 
within the headroom limits set out in the ABI Guidelines ‘Executive 
Remuneration – Policies and Practices’, for the Company’ s existing 
share plans as set out below:
Total issued share capital at 31 December 2009 166,955,167
All schemes (10% in any rolling 10 -year period) 1,876,431
Remaining headroom 14,819,085
Discretionary schemes (5% in any rolling 10-year period) 1,876,431
Remaining headroom 6,471,327
The Committee has the flexibility to satisfy awards pursuant to the 
CI LTIP by either a market purchase or new issue of the Company’ s 
shares. T o date the Company has not bought shares to hedge the 
exposure to the Company’ s share price; however, the Committee 
keeps its hedging policy under review. Awards under the DBP will 
be satisfied by shares purchased in the market.
(vii) Pensions
All of the Executive Directors are members of the Charter HM 
Revenue & Customs-approved pension scheme. Mr Foster’ s 
accrual rate is one-thirtieth of base salary, and Messrs Careless 
and Deeley’ s accrual rates are one-forty-fifth of base salary, for 
each year of service as an Executive Director. They are all subject 
to a cap on pensionable earnings of £105,600 per annum and are 
entitled to receive, in lieu of pension over the cap, an allowance to 
the value of 25 per cent of the excess of base salary over the cap. 
These payments are included in their emoluments shown on 
page 59. Mr Deeley has elected that, from this amount, 9 per cent 
of his base salary in excess of the cap is paid to the Company’ s 
defined contribution stakeholder pension scheme. Details of 
pension entitlements can be found in the table on page 60.
(viii) Other benefits
Further benefits contained within the remuneration packages of the 
Executive Directors comprise tax-assessable benefits arising from 
employment and include car and petrol allowances, medical 
insurance for the Executive Directors and their immediate 
dependants and life assurance.
(ix) Service contracts
Details of the service contracts of those individuals who served as 
Executive Directors during the year are set out below. The normal 
retirement age of all the Executive Directors is 65.
The Executive Directors entered into new service agreements with 
Charter Central Services Limited (‘CCSL’) on 27 August 2008 
which became effective on 22 October 2008 (the ‘Service 
Agreements’ and each a ‘Service Agreement’). The Service 
Agreements are terminable in writing by CCSL upon 12 months’ 
prior written notice; by Messrs Careless and Deeley on six months’ 
prior written notice, and by Mr Foster on nine months’ prior written 
notice. If the Service Agreement of either Michael Foster or  58      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Remuneration report 
continued
Robert Careless is terminated by CCSL except with notice, on retirement or for cause, then CCSL shall pay as liquidated damages an 
amount equal to the value of each Executive Director’ s annual salary, including both pension allowance and the value of the Executive 
Director’ s lost pension benefits. In respect of the service contract of Mr Deeley, and for Directors appointed in the future, the Committee 
will look to apply the principles of mitigation following termination.
CCSL has agreed ‘tax equalisation’ arrangements with each Executive Director under which, if the amount of any remuneration paid by 
CCSL or any Associated Company to that Director is taxed in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, CCSL or the Director will 
make a balancing payment so that the amount received by the Director after tax in respect of that remuneration is the same as it would 
have been had he only been subject to United Kingdom tax in respect of it. Similar ‘tax equalisation’ arrangements have been put in place 
for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, with the exception of Manfred Wennemer, who is a German resident and was not 
previously on the board of the former Charter plc.
The Executive Directors entered into letters of appointment in respect of their duties as Directors of the Company which took effect on 
22 October 2008. Each appointment will be subject to termination by either party giving the other party not less than one month’ s notice 
in writing and will automatically cease if that Executive Director ceases to be an employee of CCSL.
(x) Total shareholder return (‘TSR’)
TSR calculations are carried out independently by HNBS by monitoring the percentage change in the Company’ s share price plus 
dividends reinvested over a period of time. The chart below shows the value by 31 December 2009, of £100 invested in Charter plc on 
31 December 2004 and re-invested in Charter International plc on 22 October 2008 as compared with £100 invested in the FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts) index on the same date. The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.

FTSE 250 (ex Investment Trusts)
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) is the most appropriate index against which the TSR of 
Charter should be measured because it is an index of similar-sized companies.
(c) Non-Executive Directors
The Board has delegated authority to the Standing Committee to determine the fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors and has 
delegated authority to the Remuneration Committee to determine the fees payable to the Chairman. Non-Executive Directors are not 
eligible to participate in any of the Company’ s bonus, pension or share incentive schemes. They do not have service contracts but their 
terms of engagement are regulated by letters of appointment that comply with the recommendations of the Combined Code, details of 
which are set out below:

The fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors during 2009 were £57,750 per annum, with the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees being paid an additional £6,000 and £4,000 per annum respectively. The additional fees payable to the chairmen of the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees reflect the increased duties attributable to fulfilling those roles. The policy is to review the fees payable to 
the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors on an annual basis. With effect from January 2010, it was agreed to increase the 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees by £2,500. The total fees payable to the Chairman of the Company remained unchanged.
Non-Executive appointment letters are available for inspection at the Company’ s registered office and will be made available at the AGM.

3 James Deeley received a £12,500 salary increase on becoming Commercial Director on 26 March 2009
4 Grey Denham was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 29 April 2009 and received additional fees from this date.
(1) During the period, the remuneration of the Executive Directors was split so that, in common with the Non-Executive Directors, they 
received fees from Charter International plc of £57,750 in respect of their duties as Directors of Charter International plc. At the same 
time the salaries received by them from CCSL in respect of their executive duties on behalf of the rest of the Charter Group were 
reduced by an equivalent amount so that in aggregate they received the same remuneration.
(2) With effect from 1 January 2010, the fees payable to all Directors in respect of their duties as Directors of Charter International were increased 
from £57,750 to £60,250 per annum, with the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees continuing to be paid an additional 
£6,000 and £4,000 respectively . The additional fees payable to the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees reflect the 
increased duties attributable to fulfilling these roles. The total fees payable to the Chairman of the Company remained unchanged.
(3) With effect from the annual review on 1 January 2010, the current base salary and fees of the Executive Directors are as follows:
Salary

£’000
Total
£’000
Michael Foster 470 60 530
Robert Careless 248 60 308
James Deeley 230 60 290
 The percentage increase in Michael Foster’ s salary was 2.5 per cent, which was below the forecast average increase for employees 
across the whole Group. Robert Careless received a 4.8 per cent increase to bring him more closely into alignment with the market. 
James Deeley received a 7 per cent increase to reflect the greater responsibility he had taken on during 2009. 60      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

services after becoming a Director.
2 The pension entitlement shown in the first row is the aggregate amount which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on service to the 
end of 2009 under the approved scheme.
3 The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
4 The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another pension 
provider on transferring the scheme’s liabilities in respect of the Director’s pension benefits. It does not represent sums payable to the individual 
Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
5 The transfer value of the increases in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits 
that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the change in its transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase 
or decrease in its transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting the transfer 
value at the beginning of the period, as well as additional value earned in the year.

1 The value of the awards under the LTIP shows the number of the awards held multiplied by the market price of the Company’s shares at 31 December 
2009. The assumption is that the maximum number of options/awards vested in accordance with the performance conditions described on page 57 . 
 It should be noted that the actual value may be less than the maximum, including zero if performance conditions are not met.
2 The number of shares granted on 09 March 2009 is the share equivalent of 100 per cent of the base salary based on the average of the 
mid-market closing values of the Company’s shares for the five dealing days ending on 6 March 2009, being 409.5 pence.
3 These awards under the DBP represent 25 per cent of the bonus payable to the Executive Directors, in respect of the year ended 31 December 
2008. The awards were calculated by reference to the average share price of the Company over the five dealing days ending on 6 March 2009, 
being 409.5 pence.
4 Awards represent the reinvestment of the final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2009 using a share price of 899 pence to calculate the 
number of shares subject to the award, which was the share price on the ex-dividend date of 30 April 2009.
5 On 9 March 2009 Michael Foster exercised his award under the MF Plan in full following satisfaction of the performance conditions. 109,319 shares 
were sold to meet the exercise price, tax and NI liabilities, the remaining 39,770 shares were retained by Michael Foster. The market price on the 
date of exercise was 387 .5 pence.
6 On 29 April 2009 Michael Foster and Robert Careless exercised their awards under the LTIP granted on the 24 March 2006. The assessment of the 
performance conditions produced a vesting of 42 per cent of the original award. Michael Foster sold 6,775 shares to meet the tax and NI liabilities 
and retained 12,703 shares. Robert Careless sold 4,961 shares to meet the tax and NI liabilities and retained 7 ,929 shares. The market price on the 
date of exercise was 525 pence.
7 The performance conditions for the LTIP were not met and the award lapsed.
8 During the year, the range of share prices was 315.5 pence to 770.0 pence, with the price on 31 December 2009 being 722.0 pence.
9 The performance conditions applying to any of the above awards are as described on page 57 .
10 The accrued cost of Directors’ LTIP awards outstanding at 31 December 2009, calculated in accordance with IFRS2 ‘share-based payment’ was 
£1.9 million (2008: £1.3 million).

Audit opinion – Group financial statements
Independent  Auditors’  report  to  the  members  of  Charter  International  plc
We have audited the accompanying Group financial statements of 
Charter International plc which comprise the consolidated balance 
sheet as of 31 December 2009 and the consolidated income 
statement, statement of comprehensive income and expense and 
cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. 
We have also audited the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration report that is described as having been audited, in 
accordance with the Listing Rules.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair 
presentation of these financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards and with the 
requirements of Jersey law. This responsibility includes: designing, 
implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the 
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 
selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making 
accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditors’ responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. Those Standards 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
The procedures selected depend on the Auditors’ judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making 
those risk assessments, the Auditors consider internal control 
relevant to the entity’ s preparation and fair presentation of the 
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’ s internal 
control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects 
the Company’ s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
Combined Code 2008 specified for our review by the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. 
We are not required to consider whether the Board’ s statements 
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the Group’ s corporate governance 
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ 
report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration report, 
the Chairman’ s statement, the Chief Executive’ s statement, the 
Business and financial review, the Corporate governance 
statement and all of the other information listed on the contents 
page. We consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any other information.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2009, and of 
the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for the year 
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’ s members as a body in accordance with 
Article 110 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2009
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements – consolidated Other  information
1  Basis  of  preparation  and  accounting  policies
(i)  Corporate  information
Charter International plc (‘the Company’), which is the ultimate parent company of the Charter Group, is incorporated and registered in 
Jersey under the Jersey Companies Law as a public company limited by shares. The Company is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland 
and its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange’ s market for listed securities (‘the London Stock Exchange’). The consolidated 
financial statements for the Group were approved by the Board on 23 March 2010.
(ii)  Accounting  policies
The consolidated financial statements for the Group have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out below in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) 
interpretations as endorsed by the European Union and implemented in the United Kingdom (‘UK’) and in compliance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Although Charter International plc is incorporated and registered in Jersey under the Jersey Companies 
Law, the consolidated financial statements include disclosures sufficient to comply with those parts of the UK Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value.
Acquisition accounting adjustments have been finalised in relation to the acquisition of Aeolus Industria e Comercio Ltda by Howden on 
22 August 2008. The comparative information for 2008 has been restated in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’. 
The impact of this restatement is to increase goodwill and deferred income tax liabilities by £2.6 million. The impact on the 2008 income 
statement is not significant. In addition, income tax receivable of £6.0 million as at 31 December 2008 that was previously netted off within 
‘Income tax liabilities’ has been included as ‘Current income tax receivables’ and the comparative information for 2008 has been restated 
accordingly.
In compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, the financial statements of 
Charter International plc are included within the Group Annual Report. These are presented in sterling as that is the functional currency of 
that company. The Company has elected to prepare its financial statements under UK accounting standards.
Use  of  adjusted  measures
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated after certain adjustments to basic earnings per share so as to help provide a better indication 
of the Group’ s underlying business performance. Previously, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill, 
exceptional items and exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans, including attributable tax and minority interests, 
were excluded in calculating adjusted earnings per share.
For 2009, acquisition costs and the non‑cash net financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations have also been excluded in 
calculating adjusted earnings per share as these amounts do not relate to underlying business performance. The impact of excluding 
acquisition costs and the net financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations from adjusted earnings per share for 2008 is not 
significant and therefore these amounts have not been restated.
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated, 
in respect of the Company, its subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
Critical  accounting  estimates  and  judgements
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS requires the Group to 
make estimates, judgements and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, estimates are evaluated using historical 
experience, consultation with experts and other methods that are considered reasonable in the particular circumstances to ensure 
compliance with IFRS. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the period in which 
the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Should circumstances change, such that different assumptions, estimates and 
judgements are considered to be more appropriate, this may give rise to material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
in the next financial year particularly in respect of the key estimates, judgements and assumptions outlined below.
Construction contracts
Revenue and profit on construction contracts are usually recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract calculated by 
reference to estimates of contract revenue and expected costs including provisions for warranty and product liability. At 31 December 2009, 
amounts receivable/payable under construction contracts were £41.9 million (2008: £71.9 million) and £45.5 million (2008: £115.7 million) 
respectively. Contract retentions held by customers at 31 December 2009 in respect of construction contracts amounted to £32.4 million 
(2008: £40.2 million). Warranty and product liability provisions at 31 December 2009 of £30.5 million (2008: £28.0 million) mainly relate to 
construction contracts.
Employee benefits
Provisions for defined benefit post‑employment obligations are calculated by independent actuaries. The principal actuarial assumptions 
and estimates used are based on independent actuarial advice and include the discount rate and estimates of life expectancy. Other key 
assumptions for defined benefit post‑employment obligations are based in part on market conditions at the balance sheet date. Further 
information is disclosed in note 20. At 31 December 2009, the net retirement benefit obligation was £162.2 million (2008: £139.3 million). 70      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

Goodwill impairment testing
Capitalised goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Should the carrying value of the goodwill exceed its recoverable amount an 
impairment loss is recognised. The recoverable amounts are calculated based on the estimated value in use of cash‑generating units. 
These calculations require estimates of cash flows, growth rates and discount rates based on the Group’ s weighted average cost of 
capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with particular cash‑generating units. Further information regarding these assumptions is set 
out in note 10. At 31 December 2009, the carrying amount of capitalised goodwill was £92.7 million (2008: £92.0 million as restated).
Provisions
Provision is made for liabilities that are uncertain in timing or amount of settlement. These include provisions for legal and environmental 
claims. Calculations of these provisions are based on cash flows relating to these costs estimated by management supported by the use 
of external consultants, discounted at an appropriate rate where the impact of discounting is material. At 31 December 2009, these 
provisions amounted to £30.6 million (2008: £35.5 million).
Tax estimates
The Group’ s tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in effect. The determination of appropriate provisions for current 
and deferred income taxation requires the Group to take into account anticipated decisions of tax authorities and estimate the Group’ s 
ability to utilise tax benefits through future earnings and tax planning. These estimates and assumptions may differ from future events. 
At 31 December 2009, net income tax liabilities provided were £23.4 million (2008: £26.1 million) and net deferred income tax assets 
recognised amounted to £58.8 million (2008: £34.6 million as restated).
Changes  to  accounting  policies
New standards and amendments to standards mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2009 adopted 
by the Group:
 ■ IAS 1 (revised) ‘Presentation of financial statements’. The revised standard requires owner changes in equity such as dividends and 
issue of share capital to be shown in a separate statement. Other items of income and expenditure are required to be included in a 
statement of comprehensive income comprising either a single statement or two statements; an income statement and a statement of 
comprehensive income. The Group has elected to follow the latter approach and present two statements.
 ■ IAS 23 (revised) ‘Borrowing costs’. Borrowing costs directly attributable to expenditure on a qualifying asset where expenditure in 
relation to that asset commenced after 1 January 2009 are included in the cost of that asset. There has been no impact on the Group’ s 
financial statements as a consequence of adopting the revised standard.
 ■ IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’. IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 ‘Segment reporting’. It requires a management approach under which segment 
information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. There 
have been no changes to the reportable segments presented following the adoption of IFRS 8.
 ■ IFRS 2 (amendment) ‘Share‑based payment’ (effective 1 January 2009) deals with vesting conditions and cancellations. It clarifies that 
vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. Other features of a share‑based payment are not vesting 
conditions. These features would need to be included in the grant date fair value for transactions with employees and others providing 
similar services; they would not impact the number of awards expected to vest or valuation thereof subsequent to grant date. 
All cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment. The Group has adopted 
IFRS 2 (amendment) from 1 January 2009. The amendment does not have a material impact on the Group’ s financial statements.
 ■ IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments – disclosures’ (amendment) – effective 1 January 2009. The amendment requires enhanced disclosures 
about fair value measurement and liquidity risk. In particular, the amendment requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of a 
fair value measurement hierarchy. The change in accounting policy only results in additional disclosures; there is no other impact.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, and that the Group will apply from 1 January 2010:
 ■ IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business combinations’. The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, 
with some significant changes. For example, all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition 
date, with contingent consideration measured at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently remeasured through the income 
statement. There is a choice on an acquisition‑by‑acquisition basis to measure the non‑controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair 
value or at the non‑controlling interest’ s proportionate share of the acquiree’ s net assets. All acquisition‑related costs are required to be 
expensed. The Group will apply IFRS 3 (revised) prospectively to transactions from 1 January 2010.
 ■ IFRS 5 (amendment) ‘Non‑current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’. The amendment is not expected to have a 
material impact on the Group’ s financial statements.
 ■ IFRIC 17 ‘Distribution of non‑cash assets to owners’. This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an 
entity distributes non‑cash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends. The Group will apply IFRIC 17 from 
1 January 2010. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’ s financial statements.
 ■ IAS 27 (revised) ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’. The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions with 
non‑controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or 
gains and losses. The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost. Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to 
fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Group will apply IAS 27 (revised) prospectively to transactions with 
non‑controlling interests from 1 January 2010. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    71
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements – consolidated Other  information
1  Basis  of  preparation  and  accounting  policies  (continued)
 ■ IAS 38 (amendment) ‘Intangible assets’. The amendment clarifies guidance in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in 
a business combination and it permits the grouping of intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has a similar useful economic life. 
The amendment will not result in a material impact on the Group’ s financial statements. The Group will apply IAS 38 (amendment) 
prospectively to transactions from 1 January 2010.
 ■ IAS 1 (amendment) ‘Presentation of financial statements’. The amendment provides clarification that the potential settlement of a liability 
by the issue of equity is not relevant to its classification as current or non‑current. The Group will apply IAS 1 (amendment) from 
1 January 2010. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’ s financial statements.
 ■ IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of assets from customers’. This clarifies the accounting for arrangements where an item of property, plant and 
equipment, which is provided by the customer, is used to provide an ongoing service. It is not expected to have a material impact on 
the Group’ s financial statements.
 ■ IFRS 2 (amendments) ‘Group cash‑settled and share‑based payment transactions’. The amendments expand on the guidance in 
IFRIC 11 to address the classification of group arrangements that were not covered by that interpretation. The new guidance is not 
expected to have a material impact on the Group’ s financial statements.
(iii)  Basis  of  consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity. A shareholding of 
more than one‑half of the voting rights will normally be the basis of such control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. They are de‑consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus 
the costs directly attributable to the acquisition. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’ s share of the 
identifiable net assets acquired, including all separately identifiable intangible assets, is goodwill which has been recorded as an intangible 
asset since 1 January 1998 (see (ix) (a) Goodwill below). Where additional shareholdings in associate entities are acquired any fair value 
adjustments related to the shareholdings prior to the increase in shareholding are taken directly to equity.
Associates and joint ventures are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, normally on the basis of a 
shareholding of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights. Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for 
by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Group’ s share of its associates’ and joint ventures’ post‑acquisition profits or losses, net of interest and tax, is recognised in the 
income statement and its share of post‑ acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. Accounting policies of associates 
and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Intercompany balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are 
eliminated to the extent of the Group’ s interest in the associates and joint ventures.
The Group has taken advantage of the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1 and has not restated business combinations that 
took place before 1 January 2004, being the date of transition to IFRS.
(iv)  Segmental  reporting
Segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal purposes by the Chief Operating Decision Maker. Revenue 
by geographic segment is allocated based on the country in which the customer is located. Non‑current assets and capital expenditure 
by geographic segment are allocated based on where the assets are located.
(v)  Foreign  currencies
Items included in the financial statements for each of the Group’ s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which that entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, 
the functional currency and presentation currency of Charter International plc.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of Group entities using the exchange rate at the date of 
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year‑end exchange 
rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement except where deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow 
hedges. The results and net assets of all Group companies that have non‑sterling functional currency are included in the consolidated 
financial statements as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date;
(b) income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant period; and
(c) all resulting exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity. 72      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2009
1  Basis   of  preparation  and  accounting  policies  (continued)
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to shareholders’ 
equity. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income statement 
as part of the gain or loss on sale.
(vi)  Financial  assets
The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. Management determines the 
classification of an asset at initial recognition and re‑evaluates its designation at each reporting date. Assets are classified as: loans and 
receivables; held‑ to‑ maturity investments; available‑ for‑ sale financial assets; or financial assets where changes in fair value are charged 
(or credited) to the income statement. Available‑ for‑ sale financial assets include non‑derivatives not classified in any of the other categories.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification. On initial recognition loans and receivables and 
held‑ to‑ maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Available‑ for‑ sale financial assets and 
financial assets where changes in fair value are charged (or credited) to the income statement are subsequently measured at fair value. 
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit and loss’ 
category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the 
fair value of non‑monetary securities classified as available for sale are recognised in equity. When securities classified as available for sale 
are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are included in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired or has been transferred, and the 
Company has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables comprise ‘Trade and other receivables’ and ‘Cash and cash equivalents’. They are 
classified as current if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
(vii)  Financial  instruments
Derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps, that are used as hedges in the 
financing and financial risk management of the Group are categorised as hedges. Derivative financial instruments categorised as hedges 
are initially measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each 
balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, 
the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets 
or liabilities (fair value hedge); (2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedge); or (3) hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations (net investment hedge).
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an 
effective hedge is recognised in shareholders’ equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement generally as part of 
financing. When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non‑financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously 
recognised in shareholders’ equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains 
or losses that are recognised in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash 
flows affect the income statement. For net investment hedges gains and losses accumulated in shareholders’ equity are included in the 
income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the 
income statement generally as part of financing.
(viii)  Property,  plant  and  equipment
The Group’ s policy is to carry property, plant and equipment at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses except 
that certain properties were revalued on transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004. These revaluations are treated as deemed cost as at 
1 January 2004 as allowed by IFRS 1.
Borrowing costs associated with expenditure on property, plant and equipment that first commenced after 1 January 2009 are capitalised 
(see (xvi) Borrowings below). Subsequent costs are included in the asset’ s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the 
income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight‑ line method spreading the difference between cost 
and residual value over the estimated useful life as follows:
Buildings 30‑ 50 years 
Plant, machinery and equipment 8‑1 4 years 
Vehicles 5 years 
IT equipment 3‑5 years
Asset lives and residual values are re‑assessed at least annually. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    73
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements – consolidated Other  information
1  Basis  of  preparation  and  accounting  policies  (continued)
An asset’ s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’ s carrying amount is greater than its 
recoverable amount (see (x) Impairment of assets below). 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income 
statement.
(ix)  Intangible  assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’ s share of the net identifiable assets of 
the subsidiary or associate acquired.
Goodwill, represented by the carrying value at 1 January 2004 under the Group’ s previous accounting policy together with additional 
amounts arising since that date, is no longer amortised and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is 
included in intangible assets in relation to subsidiaries and in investments in associates and joint ventures in relation to associates 
and joint ventures. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the classification and accounting treatment of business 
combinations has not been restated on transition to IFRS, as permitted by IFRS 1.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly to reserves. Goodwill arising in the period 1 January 1998 to 
31 December 2003 was capitalised as an intangible asset in relation to subsidiaries and amortised on a straight‑line basis over its 
estimated useful life, a period not exceeding 20 years or included as part of the carrying value of associates and joint ventures.
Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cash‑generating units (‘CGUs’) that 
are expected to benefit from the business combination.
(b) Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition criteria of 
IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the asset created, 
usually between 3 and 10 years.
(c) Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred and amortised on a straight‑ line basis over 
the estimated useful life of the licence, usually between 3 and 7 years.
Internal expenditure associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes is charged to income in the year in 
which it is incurred, except for such costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software 
products controlled by the Group that are likely to generate benefits exceeding costs beyond 1 year which are capitalised and 
amortised on a straight‑ line basis over the estimated useful life of the software product, usually less than 7 years.
(d) Intangibles arising on acquisitions
In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on acquisitions the Group identifies the fair values attributable to intangible 
assets. The intangible assets recognised include the value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property rights, customer 
contracts and relationships and proprietary technology rights and know‑how. All intangibles recognised on business combinations 
are amortised over the expected useful economic lives, usually between 3 and 10 years.
(x)  Impairment  of  assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and 
whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’ s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’ s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash‑generating units).
(xi)  Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first‑in first‑out (‘FIFO’) basis or the 
average cost basis. Cost includes expenditure which is incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to its present 
location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all disposal costs to be incurred.
(xii)  Assets  held  for  sale
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing 
use. This condition is met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable within 
one year from the date of classification.
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and cease to be 
depreciated from the date of classification. 74      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2009
1  Basis   of  preparation  and  accounting  policies  (continued)
(xiii)  Trade  receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement. Trade receivables are discounted 
when the time value of money is considered material. Amounts due after more than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified 
in the balance sheet as ‘non‑current’.
(xiv)  Cash,  cash  equivalents  and  bank  overdrafts
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with 
banks, other short‑term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are 
shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
(xv)  Trade  payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(xvi)  Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Where 
borrowings are used to hedge the Group’ s interest in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the foreign exchange gain or loss 
on the borrowings that are determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders’ equity. Gains and losses accumulated in 
shareholders’ equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to expenditure that first commenced after 1 January 2009 on a qualifying asset (one that takes a 
substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) is included in the cost of that asset. Capitalisation ceases when the qualifying asset 
is substantially complete. Borrowing costs in relation to inventories and construction contracts that are manufactured in large quantities on 
a repetitive basis are not capitalised.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the balance sheet date.
(xvii)  T axation
T axation is that chargeable on the profits for the period, together with deferred income taxation. T ax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, including actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit 
obligations (see (xviii) Employee benefits below) and share‑based payments (see (xix) Share‑based payments below), in which case it is 
recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’ s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred income taxation liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income taxation is not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the resulting 
temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or 
where the remittance would not give rise to incremental tax liabilities or is otherwise not taxable.
(xviii)  Employee  benefits
The Group accounts for pensions and similar post‑retirement benefits (principally healthcare) under IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’.
In respect of defined benefit pension plans, where the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is defined by 
the plan, the liability recorded in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined obligation at that date less the fair value of the plan 
assets, together with an adjustment for any unrecognised past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur directly in equity, in the statement of 
comprehensive income. T axation attributable to actuarial gains and losses is taken to equity.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees 
remaining in service for a specified period, in which case the past service costs are spread over that period.
For defined benefit schemes, the amount charged to operating profit in the income statement comprises the current service cost, past 
service cost and the impact of any settlements or curtailments. Interest on plan liabilities and the expected return on plan assets is 
included within financing in the income statement. For defined contribution plans, where the Group pays a fixed contribution into a 
separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions irrespective of whether or not the fund has 
sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to service in the current and prior periods, the contributions are recognised as 
an expense when they are due. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    75
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements – consolidated Other  information
1  Basis  of  preparation  and  accounting  policies  (continued)
For other defined benefit post‑employment obligations, principally post‑employment medical arrangements in the US, a similar accounting 
methodology to that for defined benefit pension plans is used. Where the actuarial valuation of a scheme demonstrates that the scheme 
is in surplus, the recognised asset is limited to the extent that the Group can benefit in future, for example by refunds or a reduction in 
contributions. Movements in the amount of any irrecoverable surplus are recognised directly in equity, in the statement of comprehensive 
income.
(xix)  Share‑based  payments
The Group operates both equity‑settled and cash‑settled share‑based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the income 
statement.
In the case of equity‑settled plans the fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted. 
This expense is spread over the vesting period of the instrument. The corresponding entry is credited to equity. T axation attributable to the 
excess of the fair value over the charge to the income statement is taken to equity. The liability for social security costs arising in relation to 
the awards is remeasured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant 
vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Cash‑settled plans are measured on a similar basis except that the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date, with 
changes recognised in the income statement. For cash‑settled plans the corresponding entry is included as a liability.
(xx)  Government  grants
Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the 
grant are met. Where they relate to specific assets they are amortised on a straight‑line basis over the same period as the asset is 
depreciated. Where they relate to revenue expenditure and/or non‑asset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the 
period in which the expenditure is incurred and criteria met.
(xxi)  Provisions  for  other  liabilities
Provisions for disposal and restructuring costs, warranty and product liability, and legal and environmental liability are recognised when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. If all these conditions are not met then no provision is 
recognised. Incurred but not reported (‘IBNR’) amounts are included in provisions. Provisions are not recognised for future operating 
losses. If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a 
pre‑tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability.
(xxii)  Share  capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Share issue costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’ s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid is deducted from 
Group equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
(xxiii)  Revenue  recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services and the value of work executed 
during the year in respect of construction contracts. Revenue, which is recorded net of value‑added tax, rebates and discounts, and after 
eliminating intra‑group sales, is recognised as follows:
(a) Sales of goods and services
The majority of the Group’ s revenues relate to the sale of goods and services which are recognised when a Group entity has fulfilled 
its contractual obligations to a customer and has obtained the right to receive consideration. In respect of the sale of goods this is 
usually on despatch but is dependent upon the contractual terms that have been agreed with a customer.
(b) Construction contracts
Revenue is recognised by a Group entity in accordance with the stage of completion of its contractual obligations to the customer. 
The stage of completion is usually based on the proportion of costs incurred compared to the total expected costs to complete the 
contract, where this also represents a right to receive consideration, and provided the outcome of the contract can be assessed with 
reasonable certainty.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period in which the loss first becomes foreseeable. Contract losses are determined to be 
the amount by which estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated 
by the contract. 76      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

1  Basis   of  preparation  and  accounting  policies  (continued)
(xxiv)  Leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight‑ line basis over the lease term. Leasing agreements which transfer to the 
Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright. The assets 
are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as an obligation under finance 
leases. The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest repayment elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the 
outstanding obligations and the interest element charged to income so as to give a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining 
balance outstanding at each accounting period. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and 
the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
(xxv)  Dividend  distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’ s shareholders are recognised in the accounts in the period when paid.
2  Segment   analysis
The Group is organised into two principal businesses: ESAB (welding, cutting and automation) and Howden (air and gas handling). 
For the purposes of IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’, ESAB is split into two segments: (i) welding; and (ii) cutting and automation. 
Inter‑segmental revenue is not significant. Amounts included under the heading ‘Other’ comprises central operations.
The following is an analysis of the revenue, results, assets and liabilities for the year analysed by segment.

Factors  affecting  the  tax  charge  for  the  year
The Company is tax‑ resident in Ireland. Prior to 22 October 2008 Charter plc, a UK tax‑resident company, was the ultimate parent 
company of the Charter Group. The tax assessed for the year is lower (2008: lower) than the standard rate of corporation tax for 
investment companies in the Republic of Ireland of 25 per cent (2008: UK 28.5 per cent). The differences are explained below:
2009  £m
2008  £m
Profit before tax 92.7 197.7
Profit multiplied by rate of corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland of 25 per cent (2008: UK 28.5 per cent) 23.2 56.3
Effects of:
Adjustment to tax in respect of prior year
(i)
(6.5) (19.8)
Benefit of lower foreign tax rates (1.2) (5.2)
Other taxes (primarily US state taxes) 1.6 2.4
Tax incentives (0.2) (0.3)
Non‑deductible expenses and tax ‑ effective items not in income statement (0.8) 8.9
Movement on deferred income tax assets not recognised 1.9 (5.8)
Difference between book profit and chargeable gains 0.2 (0.1)
Share of associates’ post ‑ tax profits not taxable (0.9) (0.9)
Non‑taxable exchange on retranslation of intercompany loan balances 0.6 3.5
Taxation charge 17.9 39.0
(i) The adjustment attributable to previous year’s tax principally reflects the net release of a provision following the final settlement of an uncertain 
tax position in respect of a previously ongoing tax audit. In 2008 the adjustment mainly relates to the recognition of the benefit of the future use of 
brought‑ forward tax losses that were not previously considered to be recoverable from future taxable profits.

9  Earnings   per  share
Basic headline earnings per share is calculated on an average of 166.8 million shares (2008: 166.7 million shares).
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 0.7 million 
(2008: 0.2 million) dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options 
granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’ s ordinary shares during the year 
and the potentially issuable shares under the Group’ s long‑term incentive plans.
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated after certain adjustments to basic earnings per share so as to help provide a better indication 
of the Group’ s underlying business performance. Previously, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill, 
exceptional items and exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans, including attributable tax and minority interests, 
were excluded in calculating adjusted earnings per share as set out in the table on the next page. 
For 2009, acquisition costs and the non‑cash net financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations have also been excluded in 
calculating adjusted earnings per share as these amounts do not relate to underlying business performance. The impact of excluding 
acquisition costs and the net financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations from adjusted earnings per share for 2008 is not 
significant and therefore these amounts have not been restated.
It should be noted that the term ‘adjusted’ is not defined under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit 
measures reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or be superior to, IFRS measures of profit. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    83

(i) Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cash‑generating units (‘CGUs’) 
that are expected to benefit from that business combination. The comparative information for 2008 has been restated following 
the finalisation of acquisition accounting adjustments as explained in note 1. The impact of this restatement is to increase goodwill 
on acquisition by £3.0 million and to decrease exchange adjustments by £0.4 million, resulting in an increase of £2.6 million at 
31 December 2008. The carrying amounts of goodwill have been allocated as follows:

(ii) The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value‑ in‑ use calculations. The key assumptions for the value‑ in‑ use 
calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales prices and direct costs during the period. Management 
estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. 
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and internal forecasts. Selling prices and direct costs are based on past 
experience and expectations of future changes in the market. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    85

(i) The impairment charge of £2.1 million (2008: £0.8 million) relates to exceptional restructuring costs (note 5) in the welding segment of £1.6 million 
(2008: £0.8 million) and £0.5 million in the cutting and automation segment (2008: £nil). Of this amount £0.3 million, (2008: £0.8 million), £1.5 million 
(2008: £nil) and £0.3 million (2008: £nil) has been charged to cost of sales, selling and distribution costs and administration expenses respectively.
(ii) The Group tests for impairment of property, plant and equipment when there are indications that such assets might be impaired. In view of the 
trading performance, start‑up costs and challenging economic environment in China, the Directors have conducted an impairment review in 
respect of the property, plant and equipment of ESAB China and, as a result, continue to believe that the fair value of these tangible assets is in 
excess of carrying value.
 When determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment, independent third party advice was obtained. Where no such evidence existed, 
a value‑ in‑ use calculation was performed. The key assumptions for the value‑ in‑ use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, 
expected sales values and direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and internal forecasts.
 The Group prepares cash flow forecasts from the most recent budgets approved by management for the next two years and extrapolates cash 
flows for the following years based on estimated growth rates. These rates do not exceed the average long‑term growth rate for the relevant 
markets.
 In respect of ESAB China, the forecast cash flows cover a period of ten years (being the remaining estimated useful life of the property, plant and 
equipment at 31 December 2009), have been based on growth rates of 10 per cent (2008: 8 per cent) per annum and have been discounted at a 
rate of 11 per cent (2008: 11 per cent) per annum. Selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes 
in the market.
(iii) Assets in the course of construction as at 31 December 2009 were £20.2 million (2008: £30.4 million). 88      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

(i) Disposal and restructuring costs include £7 .3 million (2008: £6.1 million) in respect of employee severance costs, of which £6.6 million 
(2008: £6.1 million) is in the welding, cutting and automation business and £0.7 million (2008: £nil) is in the air and gas handling business, 
and £0.6 million (2008: £nil) in respect of other closure costs in the welding, cutting and automation business. This is expected to result in cash 
expenditure in the next one to two years. The effect of discounting these provisions is not material.
(ii) Warranty and product liability provisions relate to continuing businesses and are expected to be utilised over a period of one to two years 
dependent on the warranty period provided but will also be replaced by comparable amounts as they are utilised. The effect of discounting these 
provisions is not material.
(iii) Provision has been made for the probable exposure arising from legal and environmental claims and disputes, both existing and threatened, 
in some cases arising from warranties given on disposal of businesses. Provisions have been made representing the best estimate of the outcome 
of the claims including costs before taking account of insurance recoveries. Where the outcome of a claim is uncertain the legal costs of defence 
have been provided for to the extent that they are reliably measurable. Where appropriate, insurance recoveries are recognised in ‘receivables’. 
At 31 December 2009, these receivables amounted to £7 .9 million (2008: £10.0 million). If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a pre‑tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Due to their nature, it is not possible to predict precisely when these 
provisions will be utilised, though most are expected to be utilised over the short to medium term with utilisation in the next year expected to be in 
the region of £12 million (2008: £13 million) before taking account of insurance recoveries.
(iv) Other provisions include various amounts which are not individually material. Due to their nature it is not possible to predict precisely when these 
provisions will be utilised but utilisation in the next year is expected to be in the region of £2 million (31 December 2008: £1 million to £2 million). Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    93

respect of taxable losses of £84.2 million (2008: £59.2 million) that can be carried forward against taxable profits. Unrecognised tax losses 
of £49.2 million (2008: £7.8 million) have no expiry date and £35.0 million (2008: £51.4 million) in respect of the US, China, Italy and the

No deferred income tax is provided on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings as the Group is able to control the 
remittance of such earnings and has no intention of making any such remittance.
A deferred income tax liability of £1.4 million (2008: £1.4 million) is provided in respect of the tax that would be payable on the remittance 
of the retained earnings of associates.

20  Retirement  benefit  obligations
The major pension schemes operated by the Group are in the United Kingdom and are of the defined benefit type, the assets of which 
are held in trustee‑ administered funds. The Group also provides post‑employment medical benefits in the United States.
The valuation of United Kingdom and overseas defined benefit pension schemes and the liability for United States post‑employment 
medical benefits are assessed by professionally qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows:
2009 2008
UK
%
Overseas
%
UK
%
Overseas
%
Discount rate 5.70 5.60 6.30 5.60

Expected return on plan assets – equities 8.00 9.10 7.50 8.80
 – bonds 4.90 5.30 4.50 5.60
 – property 7.50 7.00
 – other 4.25 5.60 3.00 5.15
 – total 6.20 7.20 5.70 7.00
Future salary increases 4.60 4.00 3.60 3.45
Future pension increases 3.55 2.30 2.80 1.95
Medical costs inflation (ultimate rate) 5.00 5.00
The mortality assumptions for the UK schemes are based on either the PA92 or PA00 standard mortality tables after retirement with 
allowance for future mortality improvements and scheme‑ specific factors. Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who 
retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 27 years (2008: 27 years) after retirement if they are male and for a further 30 years 
(2008: 30 years) after retirement if they are female. A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 26 years 
(2008: 26 years) if they are male and for a further 29 years (2008: 29 years) if they are female.
The overseas schemes are principally in the United States. The mortality assumptions for the United States schemes have been derived 
from the RP‑2000 table with allowance for further mortality improvements. Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who 
retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 24 years (2008: 24 years) after retirement if they are male and for a further 26 years 
(2008: 26 years) after retirement if they are female. A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 23 years 
(2008: 23 years) if they are male and for a further 25 years (2008: 25 years) if they are female. Mortality assumptions for schemes in 
Sweden and Germany have been derived from the FFFS 2007 tables and the Heubeck 2005 G tables respectively.
The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long‑term results for the various asset classes. Equity returns are 
developed based on the selection of the equity risk premium above the risk‑free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on 
government bonds. Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the 
schemes’ holdings of these instruments. Other class asset returns are determined by reference to current experience. 
The estimated impact on the liability for defined benefit pensions and post‑employment medical benefits as at 31 December 2009 
resulting from changes to key assumptions is set out below:
Estimated  increase  in liability
2009
£m
2008
£m
Discount rate – 0.25 per cent decrease 23 20
Mortality – one year increase in life expectancy after retirement 19 17
A 1 per cent increase in the inflation assumption on medical costs would increase the total service cost and interest cost by £0.1 million 
(2008: £0.1 million) and the liability by £1.9 million (2008: £2.1 million). A 1 per cent decrease in the inflation assumption on medical costs 
would reduce the total service cost and interest cost by £0.1 million (2008: £0.1 million) and the liability by £1.8 million (2008: £2.0 million). 96      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

21  Financial  instruments  and  risk  management
(i)  Financial  risk  management
The international profile of Charter’ s operations exposes it to financial risks including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, 
interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks. The Board sets policies to address these risks and there is a specific treasury policy setting 
out guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments.
Charter’ s central treasury department is responsible for ensuring there are appropriate funding arrangements to meet the ongoing 
requirements of the Group and for managing effectively liquid funds held in the Group. Regular cash flow forecasts are prepared by 
subsidiaries and reviewed by management. In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks and balance sheet foreign 
currency translation risks of the Group within guidelines agreed by the Board. Foreign currency transaction risks are generally managed 
directly by operating subsidiaries in accordance with guidelines and controls defined in the treasury policy.
(a) Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations mainly from its own cash resources. It is the Group’ s objective to minimise the cost of borrowings and 
maximise the value from cash resources, whilst retaining the flexibility of funding opportunities. If considered appropriate, the Group would 
use interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest profile and to manage 
the Group’ s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
(b) Currency risk
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in Europe and America, and recurring exposures to exchange 
rate fluctuations in respect of foreign currency transactions. As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the Group’ s balance 
sheet and income statement. The Group seeks to comply with the requirements of hedge accounting where considered appropriate.
Subject to Board approval, balance sheet translation exposures may be mitigated through the use of currency borrowings, forward foreign 
exchange contracts or other derivatives. In 2008 the Group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge part or all of the net 
investment in subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro or the US dollar. These contracts were closed out during 2009 such that 
none existed at 31 December 2009.
Foreign currency transaction exposures result from sales or purchases by subsidiaries in a currency other than their functional currency. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts may be used to hedge the net cash flows resulting from these transactions to the extent these are 
certain or highly probable.
(c) Financial credit risk
The principal credit risks relate to the failure of dealing counterparties for foreign currency transactions and financial institutions with whom 
surplus funds are deposited in the short term. Charter’ s central treasury department monitors regularly the credit status of such 
counterparties and financial institutions, as well as the location of surplus cash worldwide with credit limits being set and subject to

(d) Liquidity risk
The Group’ s objective is to maintain committed facilities to ensure that, together with cash flows generated from operations, there are 
sufficient funds for current operations and their future requirements. During the year the Group increased its principal committed facilities 
by £25 million to £170 million, which have maturity dates in 2011, 2012 and 2013. All facilities are unsecured. Whilst these facilities have 
certain financial and other covenants, the financial strength of the Charter Group means that the covenants attaching to these facilities are 
not expected to prevent the full utilisation of the facilities if required. Charter’ s central treasury department reviews weekly cash balances 
held worldwide to ensure that optimal use is made of liquid funds within the Group and to avoid unnecessary borrowing.
(e) Capital management
The Group aims to manage its capital structure in order to safeguard the going concern of the Group and to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets. Capital is regarded as consisting of 
total equity, net cash and retirement benefit obligations.

Assets and liabilities included in the balance sheet at fair value
Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet 
at fair value. This requires disclosure of fair value measurements according to their level within the following fair value measurement 
hierarchy:
 ■ Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
 ■ Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or 
indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
 ■ Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).
At 31 December 2009 only derivative financial assets and liabilities were included in the balance sheet at fair value. The fair values were 
derived from observable market data and are considered to be level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. 
(iii)  Market  price  risk
(a) Interest rate risk
On the basis of the Group’ s analysis, it is estimated that a rise/fall of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to which the 
Group’ s cash balances are exposed would increase/decrease profit before tax by approximately £0.4 million (2008: £0.6 million). Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    101

On the basis of the Group’ s analysis, it is estimated that a rise/fall of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to which the 
Group’ s borrowings are exposed would decrease/increase profit before tax by approximately £0.2 million (2008: £0.4 million).

It is estimated that the impact of every 10 per cent strengthening/weakening of the exchange rates of the principal currencies to which the 
Group’ s receivables are exposed would increase/decrease profit before tax by approximately £3.2 million (2008: £2.6 million).
It is estimated that the impact of every 10 per cent strengthening/weakening of the exchange rates of the principal currencies to which the 
Group’ s payables are exposed would decrease/increase profit before tax by approximately £2.5 million (2008: £3.4 million).
(iv)  Credit  risk
The Group’ s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets is represented by the amount of cash and cash equivalents, 
trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments. Details of the credit risk relating to financial assets are given in note 14 and 
note 15 in relation to trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents respectively.
(v)  Liquidity  risk
Financial liabilities included within trade and other payables (note 17) have a contractual maturity date within twelve months of the balance 
sheet date as at 31 December 2009 and 2008 except for accruals of £1.6 million (2008: £1.0 million) which are mainly payable between 
one and three years (2008: one and two years).

The fair values of short‑term deposits and borrowings approximate to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these 
instruments. The fair values of long‑term borrowings approximate to the carrying amount because these loans bear interest at floating 
rates and can be repaid at any time without penalty.

In 2009, 149,089 ordinary shares were issued for consideration of £324,999 on the vesting of awards under the MF Plan and 54,497 
(2008: 52,439) ordinary shares were issued for nil consideration on the vesting of awards under the CI LTIP . As a result a total of 
£0.8 million (2008: £0.2 million) share premium arose.
At 31 December 2009, one participant held options over a total of 66,413 ordinary shares of the Company. These options were granted 
under an employee share option scheme and are exercisable up to 29 March 2011 at a price of 139.9 pence. At 31 December 2008 
two participants held employee share options over 215,502 ordinary shares of the Company exercisable during various periods up to 
29 March 2011 at prices ranging from 139.9 pence to 218.0 pence.
Details of awards of contingent rights to the allotment of ordinary shares in the Company under long‑term incentive plans are given in the 
Remuneration report on pages 55 to 61.
The cost of the purchase of 44,502 (2008: 29,618) shares by the Charter Employee Trust in connection with the Deferred Bonus Plan has 
been deducted from retained earnings. The consideration paid was £0.2 million (2008: £0.2 million). At 31 December 2009 the Charter 
Employee Trust held 74,120 (2008: 29,618) ordinary shares of the Company with a market value of £0.5 million (2008: £0.1 million). 
The dividends receivable on these shares have been waived.
23  Share‑based  payments
Share‑based compensation arrangements established since 7 November 2002 for the Executive Directors and selected other senior 
executives are set out in the Remuneration report on pages 55 to 61.
2009 and 2008 awards
The awards granted under the CI LTIP were valued using the Stochastic (‘Monte Carlo’) model as follows:
Grant  date
9 March   2009
25  March  2008
21  November  2008
Number of shares 396,537 172,512 12,479
Fair value – £ 1,174,700 854,900 10,576
 – pence per share 296.2 495.6 84.8
Expected volatility % 58.7 35.4 55.8
Risk‑free interest rate % 1.8 4.1 2.5
Dividend yield % – – –
Expected volatility is calculated based on historical volatility for the Company. The total shareholder return performance condition of the 
awards has been incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent at the end of the vesting period therefore a dividend yield is not included in the valuation.
Deferred bonus plan
On 9 March 2009 awards over 44,236 shares were made under the Deferred Bonus Plan at a fair value of 387.5 pence per share based 
on the share price at the date of grant.
On 25 March 2008 and 23 May 2008 awards over 29,229 shares and 389 shares respectively were granted under the Deferred Bonus 
Plan. The fair value of the awards granted under the Deferred Bonus Plan on 25 March 2008 was based on the share price at the date of 
grant of 801 pence. The awards made on 23 May 2008 represent the reinvestment of the final dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2007 using a share price of 899 pence to calculate the number of shares subject to the award. 104      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

(i)  Central  operations
Since about 1985, certain subsidiaries of Charter, including Charter Limited (formerly Charter plc) and Charter Consolidated P .L.C. and 
certain of their wholly‑ owned subsidiaries, have been named as defendants (the ‘defendants’) in asbestos‑related actions in the United 
States. These lawsuits have alleged that the defendants were liable for the acts of Cape PLC, a former partly‑ owned subsidiary of Charter 
Limited. Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was resolved in the defendants’ favour either at 
trial or on appeal. In subsequent years, the defendants have continued to be named in asbestos‑related lawsuits. The defendants have 
contested these actions and, in most cases, have obtained dismissals. The defendants have settled some of the cases brought in 
Mississippi. Currently, the only pending cases against the defendants in which they have received service of process are in Mississippi, 
which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued by plaintiffs. The Directors have received legal advice that the defendants 
and their wholly‑ owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions brought against them, but that 
uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action. It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case 
the amount of damages which might ensue if liability were imposed on any of the defendants. The defence costs and other expenses 
charged against Charter’ s operating profits in 2009 were negligible. The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and 
legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charter’ s financial position. 
In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make provision for any liability in respect of such actions.
(ii)  Welding
The ESAB Group Inc. (‘EGI’), an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits in state and 
federal courts in the United States alleging personal injuries from exposure to manganese in the fumes of welding consumables. Other 
current and former manufacturers of welding consumables have also been named as defendants as well as various other defendants 
such as distributors, trade associations and others. The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for 
unspecified amounts. A multi‑district litigation proceeding has been established to consolidate and co‑ordinate pre‑trial proceedings in the 
federal court cases. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    105

** EGI’s share is US$1.75 million 
EGI was also a defendant in a number of other state court cases set for trial in 2009. However, all of those cases were either dismissed or 
postponed.
With the exception of the punitive damage awards, if upheld on appeal, EGI’ s share of the adverse verdicts rendered in December 2007, 
March and November 2008 and October 2009 should be covered in substantial part by insurance. EGI, together with its co‑defendants, 
is appealing all of the plaintiffs’ verdicts noted above. There is, however, no guarantee that an appeal of an adverse verdict will be 
successful.
There are 8 manganese trials scheduled for the balance of 2010, although it is not anticipated that they will all proceed to trial as 
scheduled. Additional trials could also be scheduled.
Over the last 18 years, the Welding Industry Defense group, which was established to represent a number of the welding company 
defendants, including EGI, in this and other litigation, has succeeded in obtaining defence verdicts in the vast majority of cases in which 
one or more of its members have been named as a defendant.
Whilst litigation is notoriously uncertain and the risk of an adverse jury verdict in any trial exists, having considered the advice of EGI’ s 
counsel in the United States, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims, most of which should be covered in 
whole or in part by insurance. EGI, in conjunction with other current and former US manufacturers of welding consumables, is defending 
these claims vigorously. EGI’ s defence costs, net of insurance recoveries, are estimated to be of the order of US$18.2 million, which is 
reflected in EGI’ s balance sheet at 31 December 2009. In view of the foregoing and, in particular, the legal advice received in the United 
States, the Directors do not consider that such claims will have a material adverse effect on Charter’ s financial position.
EGI has also been named as a defendant in a small number of lawsuits in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in which claimants allege 
asbestos‑ induced personal injuries. The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts 
from EGI, other welding consumable manufacturers and other defendants who manufactured a variety of asbestos products. EGI has no 
asbestos cases listed for trial in 2010. EGI has been dismissed prior to trial in the previous cases in which it was named as a defendant. 
Upon the advice of counsel, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims and EGI intends vigorously to defend 
these lawsuits, which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance. In addition, the majority of defence costs are being borne by 
EGI’ s insurers.
(iii)  Air  and  gas  handling
Howden Buffalo Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos‑related actions in the 
United States. On the advice of counsel, Howden Buffalo is vigorously defending all the cases that have been filed against it. Over the past 
few years, Howden Buffalo has sought and received dismissals in 11,116 cases and has, on the advice of counsel, settled 406 cases. 
These cases were typically settled for nuisance value amounts, much less than the cost of defending the cases at trial. Howden Buffalo 
has received legal advice indicating that it should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions that are brought. At this time, it is 
not practical to estimate the amount of any potential damages or to provide details of the current stage of proceedings in particular cases, 
as the majority of cases do not specify the amount of damages sought and the cases are at varying stages in the litigation process.  106      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2009
27  Contingent   liabilities  (continued)
However, legal fees associated with the defence of these claims and the cost of the settlements have been covered, in substantial part, 
by applicable insurance. The Directors believe, based on legal advice, that the majority of asbestos‑related lawsuits against Howden 
Buffalo, including those resulting from the historical operations of a predecessor of Howden Buffalo known as Buffalo Forge Company, 
will continue to be covered, in substantial part, by applicable insurance. The situation is reviewed regularly and based on the most recent 
review and legal advice obtained by Howden Buffalo, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any potential liability is unlikely to have a 
material effect on Charter’ s financial position.
The Company announced on 19 February 2010 that it had launched an investigation into possible irregular payments that may have been 
made in connection with an attempt to obtain business by an overseas Howden subsidiary in an emerging market; this investigation has 
been concluded.
Some evidence came to light which, whilst not conclusive, indicated that some inappropriate payments may have been made by two 
overseas third party agents of two Howden subsidiaries to obtain business in an emerging market. Appropriate steps have been taken to 
notify the relevant authorities.
At this time, the Company cannot determine whether any action will be taken by the relevant authorities. The timing or the outcome of any 
such action is uncertain. Accordingly no provision has been made for liabilities in these accounts in respect of the potential consequences 
of such action being taken. On the basis of external legal advice, the Directors do not believe the possible consequences are likely to have 
a material adverse impact on the Company’ s financial position. 
(iv)  Other
In addition there are contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of business from which no liability is expected to crystallise.

29  Acquisitions   and  disposals
Current  year
During the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group made no acquisitions of subsidiaries. Costs of £0.3 million in relation to a potential 
acquisition have been charged to the income statement. As explained in note 1, acquisition accounting adjustments have been finalised in 
relation to the acquisition of Aeolus Industria e Comercio Ltda by Howden on 22 August 2008 and the 2008 comparatives included below 
have been restated accordingly. During the year ended 31 December 2009, no adjustments have been made to the estimated fair value 
of the net assets of the other businesses acquired in 2008.
On 13 May 2009, ESAB completed the disposal of HD Engineering Limited, a manufacturer of drilling equipment, consumables and 
accessories with net assets of £3.1 million for a cash consideration of £1.7 million, net of disposal costs, resulting in a loss of £1.4 million. 
Cumulative exchange translation gains previously taken directly to equity of £0.9 million have been recycled through the income statement 
following this disposal. The cash inflow of £1.3 million, included in the cash flow statement, comprises the net cash consideration of 
£1.7 million less cash disposed of £0.4 million. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    107

Prior  year  acquisitions
(i)  Romar  Positioning  Equipment  Pte  Limited  (‘Romar’)
On 25 April 2008, ESAB completed the acquisition of Romar Positioning Equipment Pte Limited (‘Romar’), a leading designer, 
manufacturer and distributor of handling equipment for use in automated welding applications, in particular for customers in the energy 
industry, for a cash consideration of £25.5 million. Initial consideration for the transaction was S$65.0 million in cash with a further payment 
in 2008 of S$2.7 million. Additional consideration is payable to the extent that average EBIT for the 3 years to 31 December 2010 
exceeds S$9.0 million. The acquisition of Romar increases ESAB’ s presence in mid‑market automation equipment which is expected to 
become an increasingly important market segment given the world‑wide shortage of skilled welding operatives. Synergy opportunities are 
expected to arise, including through the cross‑selling of product to ESAB’ s and Romar’ s customer lists.
The revenue and profit after tax of Romar for the year ended 31 December 2008 were £16.5 million and £1.8 million respectively of which 
£6.1 million and £0.4 million respectively were for the period prior to acquisition.
(ii)  Other  acquisitions
(a) On 17 July 2008, ESAB agreed to acquire from a receiver the factory, plant and certain other assets of Linkweld, located near Milan, 
Italy, for a cash consideration of £3.6 million.
(b) On 22 August 2008, Howden acquired Aeolus Industria e Comercio Ltda (‘Aeolus’) for a cash consideration of £15.4 million. Initial 
cash consideration was 38.5 million reais (£11.5 million). Additional cash consideration, up to a maximum of 11.5 million reais, is 
potentially payable based on the profit of Aeolus for 2008. The revenue and profit after tax of Aeolus for the year ended 
31 December 2008 were £11.3 million and £3.1 million respectively of which £6.9 million and £3.0 million respectively were for the 
period prior to acquisition.

29  Acquisitions   and  disposals  (continued)
In 2008 the net cash outflow included in the cash flow statement of £39.4 million comprised cash paid of £41.5 million in respect of 2008 
acquisitions less cash acquired of £2.6 million plus cash paid of £0.5 million in respect of prior period acquisitions.
Intangible assets acquired principally represent customer relationships and brands.
The goodwill arising principally reflects the anticipated profitability of the new markets to which the Group has gained access and to 
additional profitability and operating efficiencies in respect of existing markets.

Audit opinion – parent Company financial statements
Independent  Auditors’  report  to  the  members  of  Charter  International  plc
We have audited the accompanying parent Company financial 
statements of Charter International plc which comprise the balance 
sheet as of 31 December 2009 and the income statement, for the 
year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory notes. We have also audited the information 
in the Directors’ Remuneration report that is described as having 
been audited, in accordance with the Listing Rules.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair 
presentation of these financial statements in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice) and with the requirements of Jersey law. 
This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and 
maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying 
appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates 
that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditors’ responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. Those Standards 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
The procedures selected depend on the Auditors’ judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making 
those risk assessments, the Auditors consider internal control 
relevant to the entity’ s preparation and fair presentation of the 
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’ s internal 
control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ 
report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration report, 
the Chairman’ s statement,the Chief Executive’ s statement, the 
Business and financial review, the Corporate governance 
statement and all of the other information listed on the contents 
page. We consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any other information.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the financial position of the parent Company as of 31 December 
2009, and of the financial performance of the parent Company for 
the year then ended in accordance with UK Accounting Standards 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) and have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’ s members as a body in accordance with 
Article 110 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

For the year ended 31 December 2009
1  Basis  of  preparation
The registered office of the Company is situated at 22 Grenville Street, St Helier, Jersey JE4 8PX, Channel Islands.
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented in compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are 
listed on the London Stock Exchange. They were approved by the Board on 23 March 2010. The Company’ s financial statements are 
presented in sterling, as that is the functional currency of the Company.
The financial statements for the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention and in 
accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’) on the 
basis of the accounting policies set out in note 2 below.
These financial statements comprise the profit and loss account, balance sheet and related notes. The Company has taken advantage of 
the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 (Revised 1996) ‘Cash flow statements’. The Company is 
also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related party disclosures’ from disclosing transactions with other members of the Charter Group.
2  Principal  accounting  policies
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Foreign  currencies
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising 
from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year‑end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in 
the profit and loss account.
Investments  in  subsidiary  undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Deferred  income  taxation
Deferred income taxation is provided on the incremental liability approach in respect of timing differences giving rise to an asset or liability. 
Deferred income taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
Deferred income taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share‑based  payments
The Company operates equity‑settled share‑based compensation plans. These include awards made in respect of shares in the then 
Charter plc exchanged for awards in respect of shares in the Company, following the Scheme of Arrangement establishing the Company 
as the holding company of the then Charter plc in 2008.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss 
account.
The fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This expense is spread over the vesting 
period of the instrument. The corresponding entry is credited to equity. The Company’ s liability for social security costs arising in relation to 
the awards is remeasured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant 
vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share‑based compensation is 
accounted for as equity‑settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for 
such compensation in accordance with FRS 20 ‘Share‑based payment’, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a 
contribution from the parent. Consequently, in the financial statements of the parent (Charter International plc), the Company has 
recognised an addition to fixed asset investments of the aggregate amount of these contributions of £1.0 million with a corresponding 
credit to equity shareholders’ funds.
Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’ s shareholders are recognised in the period when paid. Dividends receivable are recognised when 
the Company’ s right to receive payment has been established and is unconditional. 114      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

On 29 April 2009 the Company increased its authorised share capital to £6,000,000 by the creation of an additional 70,000,000 ordinary 
shares of 2 pence each.
In 2009, 149,089 ordinary shares were issued for consideration of £324,999 on the vesting of awards under the MF Plan and 54,497 
ordinary shares were issued for nil consideration on the vesting of awards under the CI LTIP .
On incorporation on 14 March 2008, the authorised share capital was £10,000 divided into 10,000 ordinary shares of £1 each. Of such 
shares, two were subscribed by the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association, Juris Limited and Lively Limited, and were paid up in 
full by those subscribers.
On 16 July 2008, the two issued ordinary shares in the Company held by Juris Limited and Lively Limited were transferred to each of 
James Deeley and Robert Careless.
On 16 July 2008:
(a) each of the two issued ordinary shares of £1 each in the Company were sub‑ divided into 50 ordinary shares of 2 pence each, 
these shares being cancelled on 6 November 2008; and
(b) the 9,998 unissued ordinary shares of £1 each in the Company were sub‑ divided into 499,900 ordinary shares of 2 pence each; 
and

The Charter International plc shares issued pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement which established the Company as the holding 
company of the then Charter plc were recorded at fair value based on the closing mid‑market price of the then Charter plc shares on 
21 October 2008, the day prior to their delisting and the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective. This resulted in the creation of a 
share premium account of £646.6 million. On 6 November 2008, following confirmation by the Jersey court, a reduction of capital 
became effective with all amounts then standing to the credit of the share premium account being recharacterised as a 
distributable reserve.
In 2008 transaction costs attributable to the issue of shares as part of the Scheme of Arrangement of £1.6 million have been deducted 
from equity.

14  Dividends
Following the Scheme of Arrangement establishing the Company as the holding company of the Charter Group in 2008, Income Access 
Share arrangements have been put in place to enable shareholders in the Company to elect to receive their dividends from a UK source 
(the ‘IAS election’). All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked. Unless shareholders make an IAS election, dividends will be 
received from an Irish source and will be taxed accordingly.
During the year, as disclosed in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements, a dividend of 14.0 pence per share for the year ended 
31 December 2008 and an interim dividend of 7 pence per share for 2009 totalling £35.0 million was paid to the Company’ s 
shareholders. Of this amount £5.5 million was paid by the Company to those shareholders who did not elect to receive dividends under 
the IAS election and £29.5 million was paid by Charter Limited under the IAS election.
On 23 March 2010 the Directors declared a second interim dividend of 14.5 pence per share in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2009 to be paid on 7 May 2010 to holders of ordinary shares registered on 16 April 2010. This dividend, totalling 
£24.2 million, has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2009.
The Charter Employee Trust has waived its entitlement to receive dividends on its holding of 74,120 ordinary shares in the Company. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    119

Cautionary statement 
Certain sections of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that are 
subject to risk factors associated with, amongst other things, the economic and 
business circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries and sectors 
in which the Company and its subsidiaries and associates operate. It is believed 
that the expectations reflected in the Annual Report are reasonable but they may 
be affected by a wide range of variables which could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those currently anticipated.

SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION
With our low cost, dependable copper production from the 
Kounrad SX-EW plant in Kazakhstan, we are well positioned 
to continue returning cash to shareholders, progress our 
Copper Bay technical studies and maintain our business 
development activities.
What we do
CAML is a copper producer with a solvent extraction electro-winning 
(“SX-EW”) production plant in Kazakhstan. We have operated this plant for 
four years and guidance for 2016 is for copper cathode production of  
13,000 to 14,000 tonnes. We have invested in Copper Bay, and now have a 
75% interest which is advancing its project in Chile through  
technical studies. 
Kounrad – Kazakhstan 
CAML owns 100% of the Kounrad SX-EW copper recovery plant at the 
Kounrad mine site in Kazakhstan. This facility recovers copper from dumps 
that originated from the open-pit copper mine, and is located near the city 
of Balkhash in central Kazakhstan. 
The JORC compliant resources at Kounrad are estimated to be in excess of 
600,000 tonnes of contained copper, of which 27% are situated in the 
eastern dump area and the remaining 73% are situated in the western dump 
area. In total, it is estimated that over 250,000 tonnes of copper is 
recoverable over the life of the operation of which 40,302 tonnes has been 
recovered to the end of December 2015. 
Since the commencement of leaching operations in April 2012, the focus of 
activity has been on the eastern dump area. The Stage 2 Expansion, which is 
currently underway, will extend the life of the mine to 2034 as it will enable 
the resource from the western dumps to be leached and processed. 
The SX-EW processing plant produces copper cathode, and the metal is 
delivered from the Kounrad site by rail and sea to the end customers, 
predominantly in Turkey.
Copper Bay – Chile
Copper Bay is a private company in which CAML has a 75% interest and 
owns 100% of the project at Chañaral Bay, in the Atacama region of Chile, 
some 1,000km north of Santiago. The total estimated mineral resources are 
124,000 tonnes of contained copper. 
Between 1938 and 1975 the Potrerillos and later the El Salvador copper 
mines, disposed of tailings from their respective mineral processing 
operations into the Rio Salado which outflows into Chañaral Bay. Over that 
period, it is believed that some 250Mt of tailings were discharged into the 
bay. These tailings now sit in the bay and on the beach at Chañaral, covering 
an area of 13km
2
. 
On 30 June 2015, CAML exercised its right to invest a further $3 million to 
increase its shareholding in Copper Bay from 50% to 75% following the 
completion of the Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”). The PFS examined the 
viability of reclaiming and processing the copper tailings to produce copper 
cathode and copper concentrate. The Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) is 
underway and should be concluded in Q4 2016.

CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
POSITIONING OURSELVES 
FOR THE FUTURE
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
Key achievements
Over nine years ago, in December 2006, I was appointed the 
Chairman of Central Asia Metals Limited, a small privately owned 
resource company with six projects in various stages of 
development across Mongolia and Kazakhstan. The Company 
has come a long way since then through to the Initial Public 
Offering (“IPO") and listing on the AIM market (“AIM") of the LSE 
in 2010 and the subsequent commencement of copper cathode 
production at Kounrad in 2012.
During 2015, the Company reached a notable milestone and 
returned over 100% of the funds raised at IPO to shareholders 
with the announcement of the 2015 interim dividend. In addition, 
we reported record copper cathode production and completed 
the Stage 1 Expansion at Kounrad during the period. Delivery of 
the Stage 2 Expansion is a primary objective for 2016 and further 
to our Chilean investment in Copper Bay, we are also looking at 
expanding the business where we see an opportunity to create 
value for our shareholders. Further details on the key 
achievements during the year are set out in the Chief Executive 
Officer’s Statement on pages 8 and 9. 
We have now established ourselves as one of the top performers 
on AIM with a profitable copper project at Kounrad, strong 
balance sheet and a robust dividend policy. I am extremely 
proud of our achievements since I became Chairman and want 
to thank all of our people and the management team in 
particular for their hard work.
Board changes
After nine years, I feel it is appropriate for me to step down from 
the role of Chairman. In order to provide continuity, I will remain 
as a Non-Executive Director in the role of Deputy Chairman.
Not only am I delighted to be staying with the Company and on 
the Board, but I am also pleased to advise you that Nick Clarke, 
our current Chief Executive Officer, will be assuming the role of 
Executive Chairman. This appointment will provide further 
continuity given Nick’s close relationship with our shareholders 
and his key involvement in the Company’s IPO and subsequent 
successful transition through to profitable production.
Due to personal reasons, Howard Nicholson, our Technical 
Director, will be stepping down from the Board. Howard will 
remain with the Company and will be focussed on delivering 
the western expansion programme at Kounrad as well as 
ensuring the continued strong operational performance of 
the project. Howard’s exceptional technical expertise and 
leadership of the local team has been instrumental in the 
successful development of the Kounrad project. We are 
pleased that Howard will remain with the Company and we 
wish to express our gratitude for his continued dedication. 
As we look to grow the business, we will be appointing Gavin 
Ferrar, our existing Business Development Director, to the 
Board to oversee this aspect of the Company’s strategy.
During 2015, we further strengthened the CAML Board with 
the appointment of Roger Davey. Roger is an experienced 
mining engineer with over 45 years of experience in the 
industry and we are delighted to secure his services.
I trust that as shareholders you will support the above 
changes and recognise that they further strengthen the 
Board and management of the Company. 
All the above appointments and changes will take effect at 
conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM") on 8 June 2016. 
 
We remain focussed on the success of our operations for all 
of our stakeholders and we provide more details on 
corporate governance on pages 36 to 47.

CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
We have now returned to shareholders over 100% of 
the $60 million raised at IPO five years ago. With the 
proposed 2015 final dividend of 8 pence per share, 
total returns to shareholders since commencement 
of operations in 2012 represents 31% of the gross 
revenue generated.
MAXIMISING 
SHAREHOLDER VALUE 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
30 September 2015 marked the fifth anniversary of CAML joining 
the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange and we have 
accomplished a great deal since that time. The success we have 
achieved is the result of the skill and hard work of every one of 
our employees and I thank them for their contributions over the 
past five years. 
At IPO, the Company raised $60 million and soon thereafter 
started construction of the Kounrad SX-EW plant which was 
completed on time and under budget. Since production 
commenced in April 2012, the plant has produced 40,302 tonnes 
of copper at an average C1 cash cost of $0.63/lb based on the 
industry definition as explained on page 23. This low cash cost of 
production has enabled the Company to pay back to 
shareholders via share buy-backs and dividends over $73 million 
including the proposed 2015 final dividend of 8 pence per share. 
This was a notable milestone for the Company and one of which 
we are extremely proud. 
It is all the more pleasing that these achievements have been 
made in the current challenging market conditions where the 
copper price fell to a six-year low of approximately $4,500/t 
during 2015. Whilst the commodity price environment is outside 
our control, CAML’s low cash costs at Kounrad gives us the 
resilience to weather a prolonged commodity downturn. The 
current market conditions are challenging for all mining 
companies, many of whom, we note, have cut or suspended 
dividend payments. 
Kounrad operations – record production in 2015
During the year, we reported record copper cathode production 
of 12,071 tonnes (2014: 11,136 tonnes) representing an 8.4% 
increase year on year. 
Our continued focus on cost control together with the 
devaluation of the Kazakh Tenge against the US Dollar since 
August 2015, has maintained Kounrad’s position in the lowest 
quartile of the industry cash cost curve.  2015 C1 cash costs were  
$0.60/lb (2014: $0.62/lb) representing a 3% decrease year on year.
The production incident we reported in June 2015 impacted 
adversely on our 2015 production, but nonetheless we have still 
managed to increase our output compared to 2014. To 31 
December 2015, the Kounrad SX-EW plant had been in operation 
for 44 months at an average utilisation rate of 98.5% and 
produced 40,302 tonnes of copper, and this was the first such 
major interruption to operations. 
The Company has an established presence in Kazakhstan and 
since the start of commercial operations at Kounrad, has paid 
$68 million in various taxes to the Kazakhstan authorities. We 
have contributed close to $1 million towards social programmes 
and the local community and currently employ approximately 
276 staff, the majority of whom have been recruited locally.
Regrettably, after three years of production at Kounrad with an 
exemplary health and safety record, we experienced our first 
major accident in July 2015. The accident resulted in injuries to 
two employees, both of whom have received the appropriate 
medical treatment and were given all of the necessary support 
to ensure a swift recovery. Detailed internal and external 
investigations were undertaken to ensure that the risk of a similar 
accident is minimised.

Kounrad – Stage 2 Expansion  
programme underway 
In November 2015, the Ministry for Investment and Development 
of the Republic of Kazakhstan approved an amendment to the 
project’s existing Subsoil Use Contract (“SUC”). This approval 
gives CAML the right to exploit the copper contained in the 
western dumps with commencement of production scheduled 
in 2017.
The procurement of materials and equipment for the Stage 2 
Expansion is now underway, with the programme’s capital cost 
remaining within the $19.5 million estimate. The construction 
works will be executed primarily by Company personnel.
Whilst a formality, this State approval offers a clear indication of 
the Kazakhstan government’s readiness to support foreign 
investors, and enabled CAML to fully commit to the second 
phase of the Kounrad project’s expansion. The successful 
commissioning of the additional SX-EW facilities in 2015 has 
already had a positive impact on our unit cost of production, 
and I have full confidence in our team at Kounrad successfully 
completing this next stage of the projects’ development in a 
diligent and timely manner.
Copper Bay – Definitive Feasibility Study 
(“DFS”) in progress 
In June 2015, we announced that we had increased our 
shareholding in the Copper Bay project in Chile to 75%, 
following an additional investment of $3 million. These funds  
are being used for the DFS that is currently underway, which  
will provide more accuracy and confidence regarding all aspects 
of the project. The DFS should be completed in late 2016. 
CAML management will continue to monitor the future 
technical and economic viability of the project based on  
the outputs of the DFS and the prevailing copper  
market environment. 
Outlook and growth opportunities 
We will focus our efforts on maintaining our low cash costs and 
meeting our 2016 production target of 13,000 to 14,000 tonnes. 
Consistent monitoring and analysis of the copper leaching rate 
since production commenced in April 2012 indicates that the 
recovery of copper from the dumps is taking slightly longer than 
originally projected. The Company remains confident of 
producing the same total tonnage of copper from the Kounrad 
resource as previously estimated, thereby extending the life of 
the operation beyond 2030.
Delivery on time and within the capital budget of the Stage 2 
Expansion programme at Kounrad is a primary objective for 
2016. Further to our investment in Copper Bay, we continue to 
look for only the very best investment opportunities to create 
value for our shareholders. With CAML’s strong balance sheet, 
the Company is confident that it has sufficient funds available to 
finance the dividend policy, complete the capital expansion at 
Kounrad and provide the Company with the financial flexibility 
to support the growth of the business.

WELL POSITIONED  
IN CHALLENGING  
MARKET CONDITIONS
MARKET OVERVIEW
During 2015, copper prices fell by 28% to a six-year 
low, however, as a low cost producer we are able to 
maintain our profitability. 
Focused on copper 
During 2015, copper prices dropped to their lowest level since 
2010. As demand for copper has declined over the past 18 to 24 
months, the increased levels of output from copper mines which 
commenced development several years ago, is now having a 
negative impact on the price.
After falling even lower in 2016, the copper price appears to have 
stabilised between $4,500 and $5,000/t. However, there remains 
considerable caution in the market place over the extent of 
possible further price falls in the next two to three years. Most 
analysts are expecting a surplus for this period as demand slowly 
recovers and production is realigned to the revised demand.
Despite the bearish sentiment for the short to medium term, the 
longer-term outlook appears healthier with a consensus view 
that copper supply is set to decline significantly with mine 
closures, falling ore grades and potential delays in new projects 
caused by the current economic situation. Copper ore grades 
are expected to decline by up to 17% over the next decade. 
Indeed, it has been estimated that copper supply may reduce by 
as much as 400,000 tonnes in each of the five years from 
2017 onwards.
Strong CAML share price performance
During 2015, CAML’s share price performed strongly against the 
FTSE 350 Mining Index which was adversely impacted by falling 
commodity prices. 
Management believes CAML’s low production cost, dividend 
payments and strong management team were key pillars for the 
strong performance of the shares. 
The graphs on page 13 show CAML’s share price performance 
against the FTSE 350 Mining Index and the copper price over the 
course of the year. 
Kazakhstan’s economy 
Kazakhstan is primarily a US Dollar economy with c. 80% of GDP 
related to natural resources and consequently the country’s 
economy was adversely impacted by the drop in commodity 
prices during 2015. 
During the second half of 2015, Kazakhstan’s currency, the Tenge 
(“KZT”) devalued against the US Dollar by 85%, following the 
path of neighbouring countries whose economies are heavily 
dependent on tax receipts from commodities. The average 2015 
exchange rate was 222 KZT/USD compared to an average rate of 
179 KZT/USD in 2014. As at 31 December 2015 it had devalued to 
340 KZT/USD compared to 188 KZT/USD only four months 
previously in August 2015. 
The functional currencies of the Group’s Kazakhstan based 
subsidiaries is the Tenge and the devaluation has resulted in a 
number of foreign exchange impacts on the Group financial 
statements which are explained in the Financial Review section.
With regard to the worsening economic situation, the 
Kazakhstan Government has responded with a number of 
initiatives to try to help stimulate the economy. These range 
from a widespread planned privatisation programme to some 
fundamental proposals for changes in the law as a means of 
attracting foreign investment into the country. Indeed, the 
Kazakhstan president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, visited the UK 
recently with a view to strengthening trade relationships and 
reviewing the planned privatisation programme. 
Whilst there has been a desire on the part of Government to 
contain any inflationary pressures caused by the devaluation, it 
would appear that price rises for many goods and services are 
starting to occur. The National Bank of Kazakhstan official rate of 
inflation for 2015 was published at 13.6%, which already 
represents a 7% increase from 2014 and with only effectively four 
months of the devaluation factored into the calculations. Indeed, 
some local prices have anecdotally increased by in excess of 30% 
since August 2015. 
The financial impact of the devaluation on the Group has seen a 
reduction in the cost base given that approximately 60% of the 
total cost base in Kazakhstan is denominated in the local 
currency. It is expected that some of the immediate cost benefits 
will be eroded as inflationary pressures take hold during 2016.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Record annual production
12,071t
(2014: 11,136t)
2015 plant availability
99.1%
(2014: 98.7%)
As at 31 December 2015, the Kounrad SX-EW plant 
has been in operation for over three and a half 
years following the initial production of copper 
cathode in April 2012. Since that time, the plant has 
produced 40,302 tonnes of copper cathode and 
plant availability has averaged 98.5%. The operation 
now employs 276 personnel of which 99% have been 
recruited and employed from the local area.
Leaching operations
A total of 12,071 tonnes of copper cathode were produced in 
2015 which represents an 8.4% increase on 2014. 
During 2015, we continued our leaching operations in the 
eastern area of the Kounrad project. As at 31 December 2015, we 
had recovered just over 90% of the planned recoverable copper 
from dumps 6, 7 and 9-10 with an estimated further 4,000 
tonnes of recoverable copper to be extracted during 2016 from 
these dumps.
From operational experience gained by the site management 
team since start-up, it is now understood that the leaching cycle 
is somewhat longer in duration than originally envisaged. As a 
result, all three of these dump areas began to enter the slower 
phase of the leach recovery curve during 2015. 
At the beginning of August 2015, we commenced our initial 
leaching operations on dump 5. This dump is the largest and 
highest of the dumps in the eastern area with an estimated 
67,000 tonnes of contained copper but with a lower leach 
recovery of 42%, resulting in around 28,000 tonnes extractable. 
As we progressed our leaching operations onto dump 5, we 
moved further away from the SX-EW plant and were irrigating 
material almost 3km away from the processing plant. 
Dump 5 is 25m higher than dump 9-10, thus requiring an 
increased pumping pressure to reach it. This increased pumping 
pressure will also be required when operations move to dump 2 
and so a booster pump station was commissioned at the 
junction of dumps 7 and 5 to ensure required volumetric flow 
rates were achieved. The first block of material to be leached on 
dump 5 required a pre-soak volume estimated at about 
65,000m
3
 of solution, which presented a challenge in respect of 
the water balance flows through the system but which was 
successfully implemented by the operations team.
The extra heating capacity generated by the two additional 
2.8MW boilers installed in late 2014 enabled the winter flow rates 
to increase from an average 514m
3
/hr for 2013/2014 to 774m
3
/hr 
for 2014/2015.
Towards the end of the year all of the areas under irrigation were 
on dump 5, with two reserve blocks on dump 7 held as stand-by 
from the previous winter leaching cycle of 2014. The operations 
team continue to learn about the solution return flow paths, 
speed of return and the pregnant leach solution (“PLS") grades 
from the eastern dumps as the distance from the plant increases. 
Whilst the overall recoveries appear to be very much in line with 
the feasibility study predictions from 2010, the rate of recovery of 
copper from the dumps is taking slightly longer than originally 
projected, particularly in the final quartile of the curve.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
SX-EW plant operations
During the first quarter of 2015, the plant produced 
approximately 445 tonnes more copper than the corresponding 
period in 2014 despite a decrease in the average PLS grade from 
2.03gpl to 1.54gpl copper. The increased output was a result of 
the higher solution flows that the plant was able to process due 
to the increased boiler capacity.
With the start of commissioning the fourth mixer-settler unit 
(part of the Stage 1 Expansion) in late April and through May, the 
PLS flow rate was increased to a level of 1,059m
3
/hr, representing 
a 22% increase over the same period in 2014.
In late June 2015, an incident occurred on the new mixer-settler 
resulting in the loss of around a third of the organic reagent from 
the SX processing circuit. Consequently, this resulted in the 
outflow and irretrievable loss of organic inventory to the dumps. 
Steps have now been taken to eliminate the possibility of this 
occurring again.
The loss of the organic inventory meant that solution flows into, 
and hence copper output from the SX-EW plant, was reduced 
until such time as the inventory could be replenished from 
European sources of reagent stocks. This resulted in the 
reduction of the production guidance by almost 1,000 tonnes 
for the year. In mid-September 2015, the operations had  
returned to normal levels of output and in the following two 
months, October and November, the plant achieved record 
levels of production.
Following the incident an insurance claim was submitted. In 
March 2016, the Group received notification that the merits of 
the claim had been accepted and negotiations are ongoing as  
to the quantum. 16

OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
2016 production guidance
The Company is now targeting increased copper production for 
2016 in the range 13,000 to 14,000 tonnes, having successfully 
completed the expansion of the Kounrad SX-EW plant capacity 
(Stage 1) as described earlier.
Consistent monitoring and analysis of the copper leaching rate 
since production commenced in April 2012 indicates that the 
recovery of copper from the dumps is taking slightly longer than 
originally projected. The Company remains confident of 
producing the same total tonnage of copper from the Kounrad 
resource as previously estimated, thereby extending the life of 
the operation beyond 2030.
The SX-EW plant’s increased nominal capacity of 15,000 tonnes 
per annum is predicated on two inputs: the throughput volume 
of PLS to the plant from the dumps and the grade of copper 
within the solution. The plant is now capable of handling up to 
1,200m
3
 of PLS per hour and this throughput was achieved in Q3 
2015. Due to the seasonal temperature variations at Kounrad, the 
average annualised throughput is estimated at approximately 
80% of design.
The combination of a longer leaching cycle, seasonal variations 
to the volume of PLS and a stabilisation of the long run PLS 
grade means that the Company believes a production guidance 
range of between 13,000 and 14,000 tonnes of copper cathode 
is appropriate to ensure sustainable copper production over an 
extended period. Governance

OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
SX-EW plant maintenance
The SX-EW plant has now been operating continuously in an 
acidic medium at 98.5% availability for over three and a half years 
and consequently, various aspects of the plant require regular 
maintenance in order to ensure their continued efficiency in 
producing high quality copper cathode.
In early 2015, all 50 EW cells were thoroughly cleaned in order  
to remove any sludge material that had accumulated over the 
previous year’s operation. During this process, it was determined 
that a number of the original anodes were showing signs of 
natural deterioration and consequently a decision was taken to 
replace all the anodes by Q1 of 2016. In addition, replacement  
of the EW cell capping boards with an improved specification in 
order to prolong their useful life and electrical efficiencies will  
be completed as part of the programme.
The roof of the new EW building completed in June 2015 as part 
of the Stage 1 Expansion is a variation on the existing plant, 
incorporating a vented roof ridge. This new design has greatly 
improved the working environment within the new EW section. 
As a result, a decision was taken to modify the original EW roof at 
a cost of around $0.2 million, fully funded through internal cash 
generation. Work commenced in August and was completed in 
September 2015 and has resulted in a much improved working 
environment.
 
Kounrad Stage 1 Expansion programme
Stage 1 of the Kounrad Expansion programme was 
commissioned in May 2015 with the first harvest of copper  
from the new EW section. The whole programme of  
works was completed on schedule and for $13.4 million,  
some $2.1 million below budget. 
Kounrad Stage 2 Expansion programme 
The technical project documentation and engineering design 
for this stage of the expansion programme was completed in 
July 2014 and submitted to the authorities by that date. The State 
project approval was obtained in November 2015 following a 
series of clarifications and modifications to ensure compliance 
with Kazakh design and construction regulations. 
During 2015, we commenced the installation of the 10kV 
overhead power line and sub-station required for the access  
to the western area. As at 31 December 2015 a total of $5 million 
of commitments had been placed related to the necessary 
equipment required for construction to commence in late 
March 2016. 
The works include, inter alia, two 12.5km pipelines for PLS and 
raffinate products, 10kV power distribution, a three-unit 
coal-fired boiler house, 2km of HDPE lined solution interceptor 
trenches, solution ponds and the top of dump irrigation system. 
In Q2 2015, work commenced on a new 18km main technical 
water line connection from Lake Balkhash to the existing  
SX-EW plant and was 80% complete as at 31 December 2015.  
In addition, a potable water line was installed and commissioned 
from Kounrad village to the plant in May 2015. 
It is envisaged that all Stage 2 capital works will be completed by 
the end of 2016 with commissioning during Q1 2017 within the 
budget of $19.5 million.
Copper sales and quality 
Since the commencement of operations at Kounrad, the final 
product has consistently been of a very high standard and the 
quality of copper produced meets all our consumer 
requirements, with no copper that has been shipped resulting in 
rejection or penalty for non-compliance.
The original off-take arangement with Traxys dating back to 
March 2012 ended on 31 December 2015. In June 2015, the CAML 
Board decided to run an open tender process for the renewal of 
the contract for the next three years through to 31 December 
2018. Following initial expressions of interest from 13 parties and 
subsequent proposals from 11, a detailed review was carried out 
by CAML management, with the assistance of an experienced 
third party consultant, of the logistics and costs involved of 
selling the copper cathode from the site at Kounrad.
The tendering process reviewed a number of financial and 
non-financial criteria and a decision was made by the CAML 
Board in early December 2015 to award the contract to Traxys. 
The agreed commercial terms are an improvement on the 
previous contract and have been fixed to 31 December 2018. 18

COPPER BAY 
Following completion of the PFS and with additional 
funding from CAML, Copper Bay commenced the DFS. 
Pre-Feasibility Study completed
2015 saw the completion of the PFS on the Copper Bay project at 
Chañaral Bay. The PFS encompassed all the major aspects of the 
project and was compiled by the Copper Bay team using 
independent consultants for certain aspects of the study’s 
constituent parts.
A drilling campaign of 135 holes to an average depth of 9.2m  
was conducted and a mineral resource estimate prepared as  
set out below:

Inferred 5,645,741 8,469 0.234 19,838
Currently, it is envisaged that the resource will be mined using 
dredging operations feeding the tailings product to the  
process plant. Metallurgical test work indicates that the most 
effective means of extracting the copper from the tailings is  
by initial acid leach to produce a copper cathode product 
followed by froth flotation of the leach tails to produce a clean 
copper concentrate. Indicative metallurgical recovery from  
the PFS test work is 72.8%. 
The PFS only covered the Chañaral beach area and there is 
potential upside to increase this resource and the scale of the 
project significantly through the future inclusion of a similar 
amount of additional mineralised material in the surf and bay 
zones covered by existing licences held by Copper Bay, which 
may provide significant economic upside for the project.
The principal results of the PFS were as follows:
• Copper production – 8,600 tonnes per annum: 
 – Copper cathode – 6,200 tonnes per annum
 – Copper in concentrate – 2,400 tonnes per annum
• Mine life – nine years
• Preliminary capital expenditure estimate – $88 million
• Estimated C1 cash operating costs – $1.34/lb 
• Project NPV (at 8% discount rate and $3/lb Cu price) – 
approximately $50 million after tax
• IRR – 21%

Further CAML investment
Following completion of the PFS in Q2 2015, CAML exercised an 
option to invest a further $3 million to increase its ownership to 
75% of the fully diluted share capital of Copper Bay Limited.
After this further investment, Copper Bay had cash resources  
of slightly in excess of $4 million on commencement of the DFS. It 
is anticipated by management that these funds will be sufficient 
to complete the DFS. 
DFS in progress
The DFS will cover the following areas:
• Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”)
• Hydrogeological and geotechnical aspects
• Updated mineral resource estimate
• Mine planning 
• Metallurgical test work
• Process engineering
• Power infrastructure and supply
• Acid supply
• Financial analysis
A further drilling programme has been undertaken in support of 
the hydrogeological and geotechnical studies and this will permit 
an update of the mineral resource estimate prepared for the PFS. 
The metallurgical test work is well advanced and the mine 
planning study is underway. Consultants have been appointed to 
complete the EIA, with the environmental baseline work and risk 
analysis having been completed. Consultants for the basic 
engineering study have been appointed and have commenced 
work. It is expected that the DFS will be competed in Q4 2016.
An important and continuing part of the project is engagement 
with the local community. Environmental and social baseline 
studies are continuing and given the adverse environmental 
impact caused by the historical deposition of tailings, the  
project is strongly supported by the local community and  
at a national level.  w

Overview 
CAML’s financial performance during the year was impacted by 
the market downturn but also demonstrated the Company’s 
resilience to the weakening copper price. Despite the copper 
price falling to a six-year low of close to $4,500/t in December 
2015, the Company continued to operate profitably at Kounrad 
due to sustained low costs of copper production. 
Group EBITDA margins throughout 2015 remained in excess  
of 50% and with $42.0 million of cash and no debt,  
the Company is well positioned to both maintain its dividend 
policy and continue its plans for growth.
The combined strength of CAML’s balance sheet and its low cost 
operations at Kounrad will enable the Company to withstand 
any prolonged downturn in the commodity markets. 
Income statement
Group profit after tax from continuing operations was $22.4 
million (2014: $59.7 million). The 2014 comparative year results 
were impacted by a one-off gain of $33.0 million arising from the 
completion of the Kounrad Transaction in May 2014. Earnings per 
share from continuing operations were 20.21 cents (2014: 56.28 
cents, or 24.91 cents excluding the one-off gain). 
The graph on page 23 shows the reduction in 2015 EBITDA to 
$34.9 million compared to 2014 EBITDA of $47.3 million with the 
biggest factor being the reduction in copper price. 
 
Revenue 
A total of 11,750 tonnes (2014: 10,687 tonnes) of copper cathode 
were sold as part of the Company’s off-take arrangements with 
Traxys at Kounrad and a further 290 tonnes (2014: 476 tonnes) 
were sold locally. Total sales at Kounrad were 12,040 tonnes 
(2014: 11,163 tonnes) representing an 8% increase in volumes 
year on year.
The average selling price achieved over the year was $5,336/t 
(2014: $6,794/t) representing a 21% decrease in prices. 
Consequently, the Group gross revenues for the year declined to 
$67.3 million (2014: $76.6 million) or by 12%.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015

During the year, the Group’s off-take arrangements at Kounrad 
went to tender with Traxys being retained as CAML’s off-take 
partner following a competitive process. The revised off-take 
commercial terms have been agreed through to 31 December 
2018 and will provide additional cost savings fixed for the 
three-year period. The commitment is for a minimum of 90% of 
the Kounrad copper cathode production. 
The Group reports both a gross revenue and net revenue line 
which reflects the offset of the fixed fee from the price of the 
copper achieved. During 2015 the fixed fee for the year was $2.9 
million (2014: $3.4 million), a reduction of 15% despite the 
increased export volumes.
Cost of sales 
Cost of sales for the year were $25.5 million (2014: $26.0 million). 
This consists of the costs associated with the production of 
copper cathode, the mineral extraction tax levied by the 
Kazakhstan government and the depreciation and  
amortisation charges.
The costs related to the physical production of copper cathode 
are the production labour, reagents and electricity, plus any 
other SX-EW site related costs. These costs amounted to $10.6 
million (2014: $9.4 million) with the 13% increase year on year due 
to a combination of increased production output of 8% and 
higher electricity costs. 
Mineral extraction tax is charged by the Kazakhstan authorities 
at the rate of 5.7% on the value of the metal recovered and 
during the year, this amounted to a further cost of $3.8 million 
(2014: $4.4 million). The reduction was due to lower copper 
prices during 2015. 
Total depreciation and amortisation charges recognised within 
cost of sales for the year were $10.3 million (2014: $11.3 million). 
This included an amount of $5.7 million (2014: $6.6 million) as a 
result of the uplift to the asset values following the completion 
of the Kounrad Transaction in May 2014. This amount is 
denominated in Tenge and the devaluation of the currency 
during 2015 resulted in a reduction in the charge compared  
to the prior year.
Following receipt of the regulatory approvals required for the 
Kounrad Stage 2 Expansion in November 2015, management  
has extended the useful economic lives of certain property, 
plant and equipment and the fair value uplift on the Kounrad 
Transaction. The original estimate of 10 years useful economic 
life has now been increased through to 2034 which represents 
the end of the subsoil use licence. This change in estimate will 
be applied from 1 January 2016. In future years, this change will 
result in a reduction in the annual depreciation and amortisation 
charge of approximately $4.0 million but this amount is dependent 
on the Tenge exchange rate. Such changes are always subject to 
future periodic reviews of the Group’s depreciation policy.
Administrative expenses
During 2015, administrative expenses were $14.1 million  
(2014: $10.9 million). The increase of $3.2 million is due to 
increased business development activities and support for the 
Copper Bay feasibility studies as well as increased share based 
payment charges and withholding tax on dividend payments 
made between subsidiaries within the Group. 
C1 cash costs of production 
C1 cash costs of production are a standard metric used in the 
copper mining industry as a reference point to denote the basic 
cash costs of running a mining operation to allow comparison 
across the industry. Whilst there is no strict definition of C1,  
the most widely accepted definition is that from consultants  
Wood Mackenzie (formerly known as Brook Hunt). 
CAML has historically calculated C1 by including all direct costs of 
production at Kounrad (reagents, power, production labour and 
materials) as well as mineral extraction tax and distribution and 
selling costs. Local administrative expenses were excluded and 
reported within the fully inclusive unit costs of production. 
However, under the industry definition, all local taxes including 
mineral extraction tax are excluded from C1 and local administrative 
expenses are included.
Management believes that the industry definition is more 
appropriate to enable better comparison across the mining 
industry. The table on page 24 shows the C1 cash costs of 
production since commencement of operations using both 
approaches and in future periods the industry definition  
will be reported.

CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Given that the Group’s operations in Kazakhstan generate their 
income in US Dollars through the export of copper, the immediate 
financial impact is positive as approximately 60% of the total cost 
base in Kazakhstan is denominated in Tenge and 70% at the C1  
cash cost level using the industry basis. 
The Group does not keep large amounts of cash in Tenge and as  
at 31 December 2015 held the US Dollar equivalent of $0.1 million 
(2014: $0.4 million). 
The Tenge ended the year at 339 Tenge per US Dollar which has 
resulted in the recognition of foreign exchange gains through the 
income statement of $9.0 million (2014: $1.9 million), arising mostly 
on US Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by 
the Group’s Kazakhstan based subsidiaries whose functional 
currency is the Tenge. 
The fall in value of the Tenge has also resulted in a non-cash foreign 
exchange loss of $77 .4 million recognised within equity and the 
statement of comprehensive income. This is primarily due to the 
translation on consolidation of the Group’s Kazakhstan based 
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Tenge as well as the 
goodwill and fair value uplift adjustments to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities arising on the Kounrad Transaction which are 
also denominated in Tenge.
Balance sheet 
During 2015, there were additions to property, plant and equipment 
of $7 .8 million (2014: $1 1.3 million). The majority of this expenditure 
was incurred on the construction work at Kounrad for the Stage 1 
Expansion which was commissioned in May 2015. 
As at 31 December 2015, current trade and other receivables were 
$2.6 million (31 December 2014: $3.2 million) and non-current  
trade and other receivables were $4.3 million (31 December 2014: 
$6.4 million). 
The Group’s main receivable is the VAT incurred on purchases within 
Kazakhstan. As at 31 December 2015, a total of $4.5 million (2014: 
$6.4 million) of VAT receivable was still owed to the Group by the 
Kazakhstan authorities. The decrease in this balance is as a result of 
the devaluation of the Kazakh Tenge during 2015. In February 2016, 
the authorities refunded a portion of this outstanding amount 
totalling $1.7 million. The Group still remains confident about its 
prospects to recover the remaining portion of $2.8 million and is 
working closely with its advisers and local partners to achieve this. 
The planned means of recovery will be through a combination of 
the local sales of copper cathode to effectively offset VAT liabilities 
and by a successful appeal to the authorities. 
As at 31 December 2015, prepayments of $2.3 million had been 
made towards the Stage 2 Expansion programme with construction 
works commencing in early 2016. 
The table above shows that the C1 cash cost of production at 
Kounrad, as measured by the industry methodology, is slightly 
lower than previously reported by approximately 12%. The change 
in reporting the Kounrad C1 cash cost has no impact on the fully 
inclusive costs.
Kounrad’s C1 cash costs of production remain in the lowest  
quartile on the industry cost curve at $0.60/lb (2014: $0.62/lb).  
This represents a 3% decrease year on year as a result of a reduction 
in the off-takers’ fixed buyers’ fee and savings due to the Kazakh 
currency devaluation. 
Given that the Group currently only has one significant project, it 
seems reasonable to also report the Group’s unit cost base on a fully 
inclusive basis including depreciation and amortisation charges,  
all local taxes including mineral extraction tax and corporate 
overheads associated with the Kounrad project. The Group’s fully 
inclusive unit costs were $1.58/lb (2014: $1.65/lb) which includes a 
one-off charge of $0.6 million, equating to $0.02/lb, arising from the 
write-off of organic inventory following the incident on 26 June 
2015. The reduction in the fully inclusive unit cost is due to the lower 
C1 cash costs, mineral extraction tax and depreciation and 
amortisation charges. 
Kazakhstan Tenge devaluation
During August 2015, the Kazakhstan Tenge immediately devalued 
by almost 37% when the government transitioned to a free-floating 
exchange rate, allowing the market to determine its value. The 
Tenge devalued further towards the end of 2015 resulting in a total 
devaluation over the year of approximately 85%. The Board’s 
response was to increase salaries for staff at Kounrad by 25% from 1 
January 2016 to compensate for the devaluation.

CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic Report Financial Statements
The Group had $42.0 million of cash as at 31 December 2015 (31 
December 2014: $46.3 million) including restricted cash of $0.5 
million (31 December 2014: $0.1 million) and no debt.
 
As at 31 December 2015, current trade and other payables were  
$6.3 million (31 December 2014: $4.3 million). During 2015, 
instalment payments of $9.3 million were paid towards the 2015 
corporate income tax liability in Kazakhstan and at 31 December 
2015, approximately $0.6 million remained outstanding. 
On 13 May 2015, the Company completed a court approved  
capital reduction scheme, which resulted in $67 .1 million being 
transferred from the share premium account to distributable 
reserves. A condition of the capital reduction scheme was to set 
aside an amount into a restricted bank account, which would cover 
certain creditors as of the effective date of the capital reduction.  
The balance of the restricted bank account in relation to the capital 
reduction scheme as at 31 December 2015 was $0.4 million. 
Copper Bay investment 
Following completion of the pre-feasibility study (PFS) on 30 June 
2015, CAML subscribed for 135,621,610 newly allotted ordinary 
shares in Copper Bay for a cash consideration of $3,000,000, which 
increased CAML ’s shareholding from 50% to 75% and commenced 
consolidation of Copper Bay Ltd.
Previously this investment was treated as a mineral right. This has 
resulted in a reduction in Group retained earnings at 30 June 2015 of 
$1,149,000. An intangible asset of $3,222,000 recognised in 2013 
equal to the cash consideration paid for the initial 50% shareholding 
has been reduced by $1,581,000. The resulting value of the 
intangible exploration and evaluation assets acquired in the Copper 
Bay Group on 30 June 2015 were $1,641,000.
Cash flows
The continued strong operational performance of the Kounrad 
project and the associated low costs of production resulted in 
strong cash flows for the Group. Cash generated from operations 
decreased to $33.6 million (2014: $47 .2 million) and during 2015 $20.4 
million was returned to shareholders as dividends (2014: $17 .9 
million) and a further $8.4 million was invested back into the project 
(2014: $1 1.1 million). 
$10.0 million of Kazakh corporate income tax was paid during 2015 
(2014: $16.6 million). The reduction is a consequence of $8.1 million 
of 2013 corporate income tax paid in April 2014. As mentioned 
previously, payments made during 2015 included $9.3 million 
towards the 2015 corporate income tax liability and $0.7 million of 
2014 corporate income tax paid in April 2015. 
Dividend 
The Company’s dividend policy is that it will return a minimum  
of 20% of the gross revenues generated from the Kounrad project 
to shareholders. 
As part of these annual results, the Board will propose a final 
dividend for 2015 of 8 pence per Ordinary Share, making a total 
dividend for the year of 12.5 pence (2014: 12.5 pence). This dividend 
equates to approximately 30% of the gross revenue for the year  
and will be payable on 15 June 2016 to shareholders registered on 
20 May 2016.
Having raised $60 million at IPO in September 2010, this latest 
dividend will increase the amount returned to shareholders in 
dividends and share buy-backs since the listing to over $73 million. 
The graph above shows the cash flows of the Group since the IPO. 
Growth opportunities 
As of 31 December 2015, the Group has no debt and $42.0 million  
of cash in the bank. The total capital cost for the Stage 2 Expansion 
at Kounrad is $19.5 million and is expected to be largely completed 
by the end of 2016, with $3.1 million already spent up to  
31 December 2015. This expenditure is in addition to the estimated 
$3.0 million that will be spent each year on sustaining capital 
expenditure for the operations at Kounrad. 
With the cash reserves at its disposal and strong balance sheet,  
the Company is in a strong position to support the growth of the 
business in these challenging market conditions.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
CSR overview
CAML has ensured that CSR is integral to its operational activities 
in Kazakhstan. CAML’s only full time expatriate employee based 
at Kounrad is its CSR Director, Nick Shirley who coordinates all 
site-based health and safety, environment and social activities 
with regular reporting to London. The Corporate CSR 
Committee, consisting of Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors, meet on a quarterly basis to review CSR related 
statistics and issues. 
Whilst the focus of CSR activity within the CAML Group is  
clearly at its operational site at Kounrad, the management  
team endeavour to ensure that all non-operational areas of the 
Group also adhere to high standards of CSR. This ranges from  
the site activities at the Copper Bay project through to support 
functions in London and Kounrad. 
LOOKING AFTER ALL OF

Actively managing health and safety 
CAML strives to ensure that every individual within the  
Company understands that safety is their responsibility. One of 
the key initiatives to improve and encourage feedback from the 
workforce has been the quarterly safety award for the best  
safety suggestion, the winner of which receives a prize of $250.  
A full time safety and fire team is based on site together with a 
fully staffed medical clinic and in 2015, all employees undertook 
a medical examination. 
An integral component of the safety management system is 
training which was conducted for employees and contractors 
throughout the year. Several key programmes included first aid 
training, emergency response, risk identification and reporting  
of near misses. 
A central component of the health and safety management 
system is the regular reporting and management of safety 
statistics. A monthly Health and Safety Committee is held to 
review the data and report back to head office. 
One of the major focus areas of 2015 was further development  
of the risk-based approach to safety. Where risks were identified, 
they were categorised and mitigation measures taken.  
Where necessary, further measures such as job safety analysis 
have been undertaken in order to reduce future risk.

A number of actions have been taken following the accident to 
ensure that the appropriate lessons have been learnt with a full 
review of working procedures undertaken and an external and 
independent safety review conducted.
The Kounrad team constantly review the operational processes 
on site, determining where health and safety improvements can 
be made and during 2015 the following were implemented: 
• Ventilation improvements to the EW building;
• Reverse alarms were installed on all large mobile plant;
• Ventilation and stairs in the boiler house were improved;
• A defibrillator was purchased for site, and training given for 
medical staff; 
• Gas vapour analysers were installed in the extraction plant 
building to monitor the concentration of hazardous vapours.
One internal and one external audit was conducted in 2015 on 
Kounrad’s safety management systems.
Our environment 
The Company continues to focus on its environmental 
responsibilities at Kounrad. In total 135 environmental 
inspections were undertaken during the year and one external 
environmental audit was conducted in accordance with the 
Company’s procedures. 
During 2015, CAML invested in the onsite laboratory, with the 
purchase of a spectrometer, enabling the Company to 
accurately measure up to 40 chemical parameters at one time 
and as such significantly reduce analysis time. The Company 
also purchased a Comacchio drill rig to facilitate easier and 
more cost effective environmental sampling and already we 
have been able to drill an increased number of boreholes and 
will continue this programme as the Company expands its 
operations into the western dumps. 
The Company has employed a third site based environmental 
engineer to monitor and control operations. This helps to 
ensure that environmental issues are addressed and to raise 
awareness within the workforce and contractors. The 
hydrogeological team was relocated to site and the team 
expanded, with the employment of an internal drilling team, 
field technicians and samplers.
Examples of environmental improvements made on site in 2015 
include the following:
• Relining of the raffinate and emergency ponds with double 
liner of clay and HDPE;
• Environment awareness courses for staff; 
• Improvements to the waste disposal and waste 
management system; and 
• Further refinements of the extensive groundwater 
monitoring programme.
During 2015, Kounrad’s groundwater remedial action plan was 
further enhanced. This plan includes details of the current 
monitoring programme and a range of remedial actions that 
can be undertaken in the event of contamination being 
identified in one of the monitoring or technical boreholes.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
CAML employed international consultants SRK Consulting to 
undertake a detailed hydrogeological and geochemical analysis 
of the eastern dumps leaching operation. 
Environmental efforts on the western dump areas have been 
increasing as CAML gets closer to producing copper from this 
area. An integral part of the expansion has been the 
groundwater site investigation focused around the initial 
leaching area. This work was undertaken alongside SRK 
Consulting, which is producing a detailed risk assessment and a 
numerical groundwater model of the initial leaching area waste 
rock dumps and the underlying geological strata. 
During 2015, the State Geology Committee approved the 
extension of the subsoil use licence abstraction boundary to the 
second ring of boreholes around the eastern dumps. Whilst this 
extension has no impact on the Company’s proactive and 
long-term programme for environmental monitoring, it is a 
positive outcome that has resulted in Kounrad retaining control 
of its environmental activities and monitoring systems over a 
larger area. 
Working with the local community
Throughout 2015, CAML was active in stakeholder engagement 
and donating to worthy local causes, as well as further 
development of its social management system. The site-based 
committee, consisting of the CSR Director and the in-country 
General Directors, meets on a regular basis to discuss 
community and social related issues and activities. Feedback is 
routinely shared with CAML’s head office in London. During 2015, 
CAML did not receive any complaints from the community or 
any of its stakeholders. There were two notable visits to site 
during the year from the Deputy Regional Akim and the new 
Akim of Balkhash.
During 2015, the CSR Committee with CAML’s CEO undertook a 
site visit to see various CSR initiatives. The CSR Committee visited 
the Kounrad School, where CAML has made a number of 
contributions including the renovation of the gymnasium and 
the purchase of equipment for a computer classroom. During 
the visit, the CSR Committee also made a commitment to assist 
with the renovation of the school’s kitchen, and this was 
completed in 2015. CAML continues to make social donations, 
typically with an emphasis on health and education. Several of 
these are highlighted in our CSR case study on page 32.  Governance

IDENTIFYING AND  
MANAGING RISKS
The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for risk management and further details are contained in the Audit Committee 
Report on page 41.
The following have been identified as the principal risks and uncertainties within the business. They are not set out in any order of 
priority and do not constitute the entire risks and uncertainties to the business.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Nature and impact of risk Movement in 
risk/uncertainty 
How we manage the risk
Operational
Leaching operations
The nature of in-situ leaching means that there are varying 
grade and flows of copper bearing solution from the dumps. 
Should the flow and/or grade drop, this could lead to a 
reduction in copper cathode produced.
An interruption to the project’s water supply could have an 
adverse impact on leaching operations. 
The Company has conducted extensive testing on the 
grades and expected recovery of the copper bearing 
solution from the Kounrad dumps. Production to date 
has correlated reasonably well with the initial testing and 
management has no reason to believe that this correlation 
will not continue with future operations. The Company 
also utilises the services of consultants to regularly review 
leaching performance and advise on operating strategy. 
A second water source is being constructed from Lake 
Balkhash to ensure water availability.

The SX-EW operations have a number of critical supplies 
(particularly electricity and water) and components, the loss 
of any one may have a significant adverse impact on the 
production of copper cathode. 
Key critical spare parts are maintained on site. As part of 
the expansion programme, a second rectifier was installed. 
This will ensure that copper cathode production can be 
maintained upon the loss of one of the rectifiers, albeit at a 
lower level of output. Generator capability and secondary 
power connections have been installed at Kounrad to ensure 
that no damage occurs to the SX-EW facility in the event of a 
power shortage. 
Fire
The SX operations of the Kounrad facility have a
significant risk of fire due to the materials used in the 
extraction of copper. 
A comprehensive fire detection and fighting system has 
been installed. Business interruption insurance has been 
taken out to mitigate the majority of loss from a significant 
fire event.
Safety, social and environmental
Health and safety of employees
An incident involving the health of an employee is always 
possible and may have a material impact on the operations.
The Company’s emphasis on health and safety is prioritised 
above all other factors of the business. Further details on 
our proactive health and safety approach are contained on 
page 28. Governance

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Nature and impact of risk Movement in 
risk/uncertainty 
How we manage the risk
Leaching operations – environment 
The in-situ leaching operations at Kounrad must be carefully 
managed to ensure that the environment is not adversely 
impacted by leaching operations. 
The Company places a strong emphasis on protecting the 
environment. Further details on our approach are contained
on page 29.
Corporate
Political and country
The Company’s only producing asset is located in Kazakhstan, 
meaning the Company could be susceptible to any adverse 
changes in the political or business environment of  
the country.
During 2015, the Kazakhstan economy was impacted by 
declining commodity prices. During 2015, the local currency 
devalued by 85%. The worsening economic climate has 
increased the perception of business risk. 
The Board is assessing opportunities for expanding the 
Company’s asset base outside of Kazakhstan which will 
spread country and political risk. To date, CAML has 
invested in the Copper Bay project located in Chile and 
has a dedicated business development team. Kazakhstan 
has been a stable country since the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. CAML maintains an extensive network of business 
contacts in the country and has successfully operated in 
Kazakhstan for over eight years. 
Changes to key personnel
The Company has a core of highly experienced and skilled
senior management who are responsible for the develop-
ment and execution of its business strategy. Any changes to 
the senior management may have a material impact on the 
success of the business. 
The Company sets high standards for the recruitment of its 
staff both in the UK and in Kazakhstan. CAML remunerates 
employees accordingly through competitive salaries and 
performance related awards. The Company also places 
importance on training the team, so that staff are able to 
progress through the business. 
Financial*
Foreign exchange
The Company operates in foreign jurisdictions with associated 
currency risk. During 2015, the devaluation of the Kazakh 
Tenge highlighted the volatility of the local currency.
The Company manages its exposure to foreign currency 
exchange risk associated with material commercial 
transactions and working capital requirements by 
maintaining controlled amounts of cash in the required 
currencies.
Commodity pricing 
Copper cathode is sold on the basis of LME pricing which 
fluctuates daily. Being a single commodity company, copper 
price fluctuation can have a material impact on our business. 
During 2015, the spot prices for copper significantly reduced 
negatively impacting Group revenue.
The Company’s Treasury policy allows limited hedging 
up to a maximum of 30% of Kounrad’s rolling 12-month 
production. This policy allows management to combine 
the benefits of an exposure to the copper price for 
its shareholders whilst also facilitating the ability for 
management to put in place limited hedging to cover the 
cost base. There are currently no hedges in place. 
The low cash costs of operations at Kounrad and strong 
balance sheet provide protection against deteriorating 
copper prices. 
* A description of other financial risks that the Group is potentially exposed to are contained in note 3 to the financial statements.

CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial Statements Governance
The past year for CAML and our Board has been one of 
development. Of course, we already had a strong Board 
with active Directors bringing value as well as oversight  
to our business. We think it important though to seek 
ongoing improvement in our activities as a Board as well  
as in the Group more generally.
As part of the development of the Board, we welcomed 
Roger Davey in December 2015 as a Non-Executive 
Director. Roger brings over 45 years of mining experience 
to the Board and his contribution on technical matters is 
welcome. He has also been appointed Chairman of the CSR 
Committee.
This is all part of our continuing commitment to good 
practice in corporate governance and we see that as key  
to directing our business to ongoing success. It forms the 
foundation of our aim of continuing to build value for 
shareholders over the long term.
As an AIM quoted company, we are not obliged to comply 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). 
Nonetheless, we draw on its provisions in guiding our 
governance structures and comply with a number of its  
key provisions including:
1. A strong independent representation on the Board  
with four other independent Non-Executive Directors as 
well as myself.
2. An Audit Committee led by David Swan of which I am 
also a member.
3. A Remuneration Committee led by Robert Cathery 
comprising solely independent Non-Executive Directors 
as well as myself.
Although not a Code requirement, we also have a 
Corporate Social Responsibility Committee comprising 
both Executive and Non-Executive Directors, as we see this 
as another key area of governance.
Each of these committees reports into and provides great 
value to the Board. The Board itself comprises a diverse 
group of Directors from the UK and Kazakhstan, most of 
whom have worked internationally in different parts of the 
world. This enriches debates within the Board which can 
often be lively and are always constructive. I believe this 
provides a good environment for decisions to be taken in 
the best interests of shareholders.
In the context of the changes outlined in my statement on 
page 6, the Board has considered the independence of 
each Director, including assessment of their character, 
judgement and business or other relationships which could 
materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement. In 
line with the Code, the independence of each of the 
Non-Executive Directors who have served on the Board for 
over nine years was reviewed. The other independent 
Non-Executive Directors have confirmed that Robert 
Cathery and myself continue to demonstrate the 
characteristics of independence, such as challenging 
management and providing valuable contributions to the 
Board. As such, the Board continues to consider both Mr 
Cathery and myself to be independent Directors. With 
Roger Davey, David Swan and Nurlan Zhakupov, our more 
recently appointed independent Non-Executive Directors, 
more than half the Board is considered to be independent. 
The Board believes this to provides a good balance within 
the Board for the future. 
Of course, success of our business depends on our 
employees. We are fortunate to have great people working 
throughout the Group managing our operations on a 
day-to-day basis. We, as Non-Executive Directors, as well as 
Executive UK based Directors, visit the team in Kazakhstan 
regularly and are always impressed by the hard work being 
carried out there.
On the following pages are further details of our individual 
Directors and separate reports of our Board, Audit, 
Remuneration and CSR Committees. I hope that these 
provide insight both to the governance of the Company 
and the importance that my Board colleagues and I place 
on this.

Board Report
The role of our Board 
The Board of Directors leads the Company in making key decisions 
about strategy, financial planning, investments and its Directors. We 
consider this role as fundamental to steering and enabling the Group 
to achieve success in its business, and to the Company in delivering 
long-term value to shareholders. 
We have a diverse Board, constituted as follows:
• Three Executive Directors: Nick Clarke, Nigel Robinson,  
Howard Nicholson. 
• Six Non-Executive Directors (including myself currently as Chairman 
and following our forthcoming AGM as Deputy Chairman):
– Five are considered fully independent: Robert Cathery, Nurlan 
Zhakupov, David Swan, Roger Davey, who was appointed during 
the year, and myself;
– Two are based in Kazakhstan including Kenges Rakishev, who  
is a major shareholder in the Company, who brings depth of 
experience in the Kazakh business environment. Details of  
the arrangements to maintain his independence are shown  
under relationship agreement below.
Our Board offers significant expertise and experience in the mining 
industry, financial and operational aspects of businesses, public 
markets and in operating in different geographies around the world.
We meet as a Board at least four times per year, and at other times 
where required for specific matters. Some of the key matters 
considered by the Board during the year are shown in the table to  
the right. The Board receives comprehensive reports in advance of 
meetings to enable matters to be properly considered and debated  
on an informed basis during the meetings.
Whilst most contact with the Company’s institutional investors is with 
the Executive Directors, the other Board members receive reports of 
views expressed by shareholders, and the other directors and are 
available to meet with investors where requested.
All Directors on the Board have access to the Company Secretary who 
acts as secretary of the Board and its Committees, reporting directly  
to the Chairmen in ensuring appropriate governance procedures are 
followed. All Directors are also able to seek advice from the Company’s 
external advisors if they wish, although this has not been required in 
the past year.
Further details of the activities of our Audit, Remuneration and CSR 
Committees follow in this report.
Relationship agreement 
Kenges Rakishev has entered into a relationship agreement with the 
Company due to his position as both a Board member and significant 
shareholder. This is to ensure that transactions entered into between 
any member of the Group and Kenges Rakishev, or any of his 
associates, are conducted on an arm’s length basis and on normal 
commercial terms.
Under this agreement, Kenges Rakishev has given certain undertakings, 
including, to exercise his voting rights, insofar as he is able, as a 
shareholder and as a Board member to: (1) ensure that no variations  
are made to the Company’s Articles of Association which would be 
contrary to the maintenance of the Company’s independence; (2) that 
transactions between Kenges Rakishev (and his associates) are made 
on an arm’s length basis and on, in the Company’s opinion, normal 
commercial terms; and (3) that the Company will make decisions for 
the benefit of shareholders of the Company as a whole and not solely 
for the benefit of Kenges Rakishev.
During the year ,  
our Board:
• Reviewed the Group, its operations and its financial 
performance at each of its four main Board meetings 
including separate reports from the:
– CEO, including strategic matters and performance;
– Technical Director, including operational performance; 
and
– CFO, including financial performance.
• Reviewed risk management in the Group and how  
this could be enhanced further at the head office  
and operational levels in the UK and in Kazakhstan.
• Monitored the expansion of the Kounrad plant in  
terms of construction and the necessary consents.
• Approved the Annual Budget for the year, regularly

Audit Committee
The role of our Audit Committee 
As the Audit Committee we assist the Board in its oversight of the 
Company’s financial reporting, internal control and risk management. Our 
Committee is made up solely of Nigel Hurst-Brown, our independent 
Chairman and myself David Swan as Committee Chairman.
Our primary responsibilities as a Committee are:
• to evaluate and when appropriate select external auditors and 
ensure their independence and objectivity;
• to review with the external auditor the nature and scope of their 
audit and review of half year results and outcomes from these;
• to review the effectiveness of the Company’s systems of internal 
controls; and
• to monitor the effectiveness of risk management of the Group.
We consider these roles to be of fundamental importance to the long 
term sustainability of the Group, achievement of its ongoing success, 
and continuing to build value for our shareholders over the long term. 
Further details of our activities during the year are included in the table 
to the right.
System of internal control
The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems. Key elements 
within the internal control structure are summarised as follows:
• The Board and management – the Board is responsible for 
overseeing the day-to-day management of the Company which is 
undertaken by the CEO supported by the Executive Directors. 
• Budgeting – there is an annual budgeting process whereby 
budgets for the following financial year are reviewed by the Board. 
• Long-term forecasts are reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
• Management reporting – the financial performance of the Group is 
monitored against budget on a monthly basis and are updated by 
periodic reforecasts.
• Operating controls – such controls are in accordance with Group 
policies and include management authorisation processes.
• Monitoring – the effectiveness of the system of internal control is 
monitored regularly through internal reviews and external audits.
Risk management
Whilst the Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for risk 
management, but Group staff have a role to play in the 
implementation of policies and procedures aligned to mitigate and 
manage risk. A Risk Committee consisting of senior staff is responsible 
for the development of risk management policies and procedures, the 
identification, analysis, mitigation and review of the risks of the 
business. This Committee reports to the Audit Committee on a regular 
basis and during 2015 met on three occasions. 
The criteria against which a risk is assessed has been established by  
the Group, so that a standardised assessment can be obtained.  
Risks are assessed against the likelihood of the risk event occurring  
and the impact and severity of the risk event. Using this assessment 
risks are then categorised into a priority level. 
All risks identified are recorded in a register which is maintained by the 
Risk Committee. The “owner” of a risk is tasked with formally reviewing 
the risk on a regular basis and reporting any changes to senior 
management. If risk assessment shows an unacceptable risk, the 
mitigation plans are developed and enacted to reduce risk. 
Further details of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties,  
together with an assessment of their movement during the year  
are set out on pages 34 to 35.
During the year ,  
the Audit Committee:
• Reviewed the Group’s annual accounts, including:
– Report from the CFO;
– Report from the Auditors;
– Annual Report and Accounts; and 
– Letter of Representation to the Auditors.
• Reviewed the Group’s half year results, including:
– Report from the CFO; and 
– Report from the Auditors.
• Plans for the preparation and Audit of the Company’s 
accounts, including:
– Report from the CFO; and 
– Report from the Auditors.
• Reviewed risk management, including:
– Report from the Risk Comittee;
– Plans for further enhancement of risk management in  
the Group; and 
– Key risks facing the Group and their management  
and mitigation.
• Treasury risk management and hedging, including:
– Review of views from shareholders;
– Consideration of expert input; and
– Development and implementation of ongoing policy.
• Discussed matters with the Auditors in the absence  
of management.
• Reviewed reports from the Group’s external  
whistleblowing hotline.

The role of our CSR Committee
Our Board has always considered the Group’s corporate social 
responsibilities to be at the core of its activities. We view these as key 
to operating an ethical and sustainable business. It was in this context 
that our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) Committee was 
established in June 2012.
Our Committee comprises independent non-executive Directors from 
both the UK, David Swan and myself (since December 2015), and from 
Kazakhstan, Nurlan Zhakupov plus our Technical Director, Howard 
Nicholson. This ensures their full breadth of perspectives are brought 
to the Committees’ important and varied activities. 
Given the importance which the Board places in this area, the 
Committee meets on a regular basis throughout the year, usually on 
the same day as Board meetings. During 2015, it also met in Kazakhstan 
visiting the Group’s operations. Further details of the Committees’ 
activities in the year are given in the table to the right. A summary of 
CSR matters in the Group is given in the CSR Report on pages 28 to 33. 
The Group CSR policy can be found on the Group’s website at  
www.centralasiametals.com.
CAML continues to believe that the health and safety of our 
employees, protecting the environment in which we operate, and 
helping to develop the local communities are extremely important 
matters. These areas will continue to receive the appropriate attention 
from the CSR Committee and from the Group as a whole.
During the year ,  
the CSR Committee:
• Reviewed and considered regular reports on:
– Health and safety;
– Environmental matters; and
– Local community matters.
• Considered particular CSR aspects of the Group’s operation 
as they arose, agreeing appropriate action.
• Met at the Company’s operation in Kazakhstan - reviewing 
the operation and meeting local employees.
• In relation to an accident on site during the year which 
caused injuries to two of our employees:
– Reviewed the circumstances of the accident;
– Confirmed that the employees were being properly 
cared for; and
– Reviewed the measures being taken to minimise the  
risk of such an accident recurring.

The role of our Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of our 
Executive Directors, oversees the remuneration of our senior 
management, and approves awards under the Company’s Long Term 
Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). Our Committee is made up solely of 
independent Non-Executive Directors), David Swan, Nigel Hurst-Brown, 
Chairman of the Board and myself as Committee Chairman.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of the 
Executive Directors and sets the scale and structure of their 
remuneration and the basis of their service agreements. In doing so, it 
has due regard to the interests of shareholders.
In determining the remuneration of Executive Directors, the 
Remuneration Committee seeks to enable the Company to attract and 
retain executives of the highest calibre. The Remuneration Committee 
also reviews the remuneration of other senior management. In 
addition, it decides whether to grant share awards in the Company 
and, if these are to be granted, who the recipients should be.
The Company’s policy is to remunerate senior executives fairly so as to 
encourage recruitment, retention and motivation. The Committee 
agrees with the Board a framework for the remuneration of Executive 
Directors and senior management of the Company. The principal 
objectives of the Committee are to ensure that Executive Directors and 
members of the senior management of the Company are provided 
incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and 
responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the 
success of the Company. We believe this is the key to the Company 
achieving its strategic aims and building shareholder value over the 
long term.
We consider proposals from management in the development of 
which Nigel Hurst-Brown as Chairman of the Board and I are consulted 
before they are brought to the Remuneration Committee as a whole.
Non-Executive Director fees are considered and agreed by the Board 
(excluding the Non-Executive Directors) with no Director participating 
in any decision relating to his own remuneration.
Long-term incentive plan
Under the Company’s share option schemes, nominal priced share 
options were granted to the Executive Directors during the year as 
shown in the table on page 45. The shares generally vest at the rate of 
one third each year after the date of grant subject to the achievement 
of performance conditions to which the awards are subject. 
The last full review of Executive and Non-Executive Director 
remuneration took place with effect from 1 January 2015. In the 
context of the reduced copper price, the Committee and Board 
determined that there should be no increase in Executive or Non-
Executive remuneration levels this year.
Remuneration of Directors
As part of the overall remuneration review, as at 1 January 2015, the 
Remuneration Committee determined that it was appropriate for 
Executive Directors to continue to receive annual bonuses of up to 
100% of salary and to receive LTIP awards over shares equivalent in 
value to up to 100% of salary. In both cases these are subject to 
challenging performance measures. No change is being made to these 
structures or potential quanta this year. Annual bonus payments in 
2015 amounted to 70% of maximum potential for the Executive 
Directors. Further details of the targets are included in the table to  
the right.
Remuneration Committee
During the year ,  
the Remuneration Committee:
• Determined salary levels for the year of Executive Directors.
• Approved salary levels for senior management.
• Approved salary increases for Group staff more generally.
• Reviewed, considered and approved the:
– Annual bonus plans and targets for the year; and
– LTIP grants and targets.
• Determined targets including:
– Copper production; 
– Production costs;
– Construction timeline; and
– Construction capital expenditure.
• Received and approved the outturns against targets 
resulting in 70% payout of annual bonuses for the  
Executive Directors.
Executive Director service contracts and salaries
The Executive Directors have service contracts with the Company at 
the following salaries with effect from 1 January 2015.
Nick Clarke £385,000
Nigel Robinson £250,000 
Howard Nicholson £250,000

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The Directors present their report and the audited consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Details of significant events since the balance sheet date are contained 
in note 33 to the financial statements.
Principal activities
Central Asia Metals plc (“CAML” or “the Company”) is the holding 
Company for a group of Companies (the “Group”) engaged in:
• the processing and subsequent production of copper cathodes, 
from secondary mining techniques;
• the identification, acquisition and development of base and 
precious metals deposits primarily in the Central Asia region but 
also worldwide.
CAML is domiciled and incorporated in the UK with the registration 
number 5559627 and the registered office is: Masters House,  
107 Hammersmith Road, London, W14 0QH, United Kingdom.
Review of business
A review of the current and future development of the Group’s 
business is given in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 35 which forms 
part of, and by reference is incorporated in, this Directors’ Report.
Financial risk management has been assessed within note 3 to the 
financial statements.
Dividends
The Company’s dividend policy is that an annual dividend will be paid 
by the Company based on a minimum of 20% of the gross revenues 
earned from its SX-EW copper project at Kounrad, Kazakhstan. The 
payments will be made by means of an interim and final dividend 
subject to the Company’s cash reserves providing a dividend cover of 
three times or greater.
The final 2014 dividend of 7.5 pence per Ordinary Share of $0.01 each 
(“Share”) was paid on 24 June 2015 and a 2015 interim dividend of  
4.5 pence per Share was paid on 30 October 2015.
The Directors recommend a final dividend for the year ended
31 December 2015 of 8.0 pence per Share payable, subject to the 
approval of shareholders, on 15 June 2016 to those shareholders, on 
the Company’s register 20 May 2016. This will take the total dividend for 
2015 to 12.5 pence per Share.

CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group 
and parent company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs") as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are  
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European  
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis  
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
• Central Asia Metals plc’s Group financial statements and Company 
financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2015 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s and 
the Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise:
• the Statements of Financial Position as at 31 December 2015;
• the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the year then ended;
• the Statements of Cash Flows for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity for 
the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have made 
a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have 
made assumptions and considered future events.
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members  
of Central Asia Metals plc
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and 
the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, 
set out on page 48, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing. 50
CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An 
audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and 
the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence 
through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures 
or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

• The maintenance and integrity of the Central Asia Metals plc website is the 
responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve 
consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility 
for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were 
initially presented on the website.
• Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
For the year ended 31 December 2015
1. General information
Central Asia Metals plc (“CAML” or the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) are a mining and exploration organisation with operations 
primarily in Kazakhstan and a parent holding company based in the United Kingdom (“UK”).
The Group’s principal business activity is the production of copper cathode at its Kounrad operations in Kazakhstan. The Group also owns two 
exploration projects in Mongolia which are held for sale and holds a 75% interest in the Copper Bay tailings project in Chile. 
CAML is a public limited company, which is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the UK. 
The address of its registered office is Masters House, 107 Hammersmith Road, London, W14 0QH. The Company’s registered number is 5559627.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting standards (“IFRS") and  
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRSIC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of  
assets held for sale which have been held at fair value. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015. The Group financial statements are presented in US Dollars ($) and rounded to the 
nearest thousand.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or 
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are explained in note 4.
Going concern
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements though its profitable operations at Kounrad. The Group has substantial cash 
balances as at 31 December 2015 and on the date of issue of these financial statements. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Group sells and distributes its copper cathode product primarily through an off-take arrangement with 90% of the SX-EW plant’s forecasted 
output committed as sales for the period up until 31 December 2018. 
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Please refer to notes 6, 24 and 
28 for information on the Group’s revenues, cash balances and trade and other payables.
New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group
The Group has adopted the following standards for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2015:
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2010-2012 Cycle and 2011 – 2013 Cycle.
The adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the current period or any prior period and is not likely to affect future periods. 
New and amended standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the Group 
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards relevant to the Group are not yet effective and have not been 
early adopted by the Company. The items disclosed are those that could have an impact on the Group. 
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was 
issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial 
instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and those 
measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for 
managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains 
most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair 
value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this 
creates an accounting mismatch. The standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Group. The standard is subject to EU 
endorsement and not mandatory for the Group until 1 January 2018. 58

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2015
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ was issued in May 2014 which establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report 
useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from  
a contract with a customer. Revenue will be recognised based on the following five-step model framework:
 – Identify the contract(s) with a customer
 – Identify the performance obligations in the contract
 – Determine the transaction price
 – Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
 – Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation
The standard is subject to EU endorsement and not mandatory for the Group until 1 January 2018. The standard is not expected to have a  
material impact on the Group. 
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was issued in January 2016. The new standard brings most leases on-balance sheet for lessees under a single model, 
eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged and the distinction between 
operating and finance leases is retained. IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and related interpretations and is effective for periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2019, with earlier adoption permitted if IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ has also been applied. 
Management is currently reviewing the expected impact on the Group. 
There are no other standards that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of CAML and the entities it controls drawn up to 31 December 2015.
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date 
that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary 
is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. 
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value  
or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised losses/gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses/gains are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been 
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Copper Bay investment 
Following completion of the pre-feasibility study (“PFS") on 30 June 2015, CAML subscribed for 135,621,610 newly allotted ordinary shares in Copper 
Bay for a cash consideration of $3,000,000, which increased CAML ’s shareholding from 50% to 75% and commenced consolidation of Copper Bay Ltd.
Previously this investment was treated as a mineral right. This has resulted in a reduction in Group retained earnings at 30 June 2015 of $1,149,000. 
An intangible asset of $3,222,000 recognised in 2013 equal to the cash consideration paid for the initial 50% shareholding has been reduced by 
$1,581,000. The resulting value of the intangible exploration and evaluation assets acquired in the Copper Bay Group on 30 June 2015 were 
$1,641,000 (see note 19). 
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented 
separately within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position distinct from parent shareholders equity.
Where losses are incurred by a partially owned subsidiary, they are consolidated such that the non-controlling interests’ share in the losses is 
apportioned in the same way as profits. Where the subsidiary makes continuing losses such that the non-controlling interests’ share of the  
losses in a period exceeds its interest in equity, the allocation of losses to the minority ceases and the loss is allocated against the parent 
company holding. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report
59
CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Where profits are then made in future periods, such profits are then allocated to the parent company until all unrecognised losses attributable to 
the non-controlling interests but absorbed by the parent are recovered at which point, profits are allocated as normal.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker which is 
considered to be the Board. 
Foreign currency translation
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, which is the Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary  
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. 
All differences are taken to the income statement.
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the US Dollar presentation currency are 
translated into the US Dollar presentation currency as follows:
• Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date; 
• Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and 
• All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in 
the income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making 
the asset capable of operating as intended.
The cost of the item also includes the cost of decommissioning any buildings or plant and equipment and making good the site, where a present 
obligation exists to undertake the restoration work.
Following receipt of the regulatory approvals required for the Kounrad Stage 2 Expansion in November 2015, management has extended the 
useful economic lives of certain property, plant and equipment and the fair value uplift on the Kounrad Transaction. The original estimate of  
10 years useful economic life has now been increased through to 2034 which represents the end of the subsoil user licence. IAS 8 Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors accounts for a change in an assets useful economic life as a change in estimate and 
therefore the change is calculated prospectively to the carrying value of the asset at the date of change. This change in estimate will be applied 
from 1 January 2016. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over its total expected useful life as follows:
• Construction in progress  – not depreciated
• Plant and equipment  – over 5 to 22 years
• Mining assets  – over 2 to 22 years
• Motor vehicles  – over 5 to 10 years
• Office equipment  – over 2 to 10 years
Construction in progress is not depreciated until transferred to other classes of property, plant and equipment.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed 
annually and where adjustments are required, these are made prospectively.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset is included in the income statement. 60
CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2015
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise goodwill, deferred exploration and evaluation costs, mining licences and permits and computer software.
Goodwill
All business combinations in the Group are accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the acquisition method. Any excess of the 
consideration transferred of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities is recognised in the statement of financial position as goodwill and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of 
the acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the consideration transferred, a gain is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, 
at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit expected to benefit from the business combination in 
which the goodwill arose. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised 
in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to an entity is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Deferred exploration and evaluation expenditure
Capitalised costs include costs directly related to any Group exploration and evaluation activities in the relevant area of interest. Exploration and 
evaluation expenditure capitalised includes acquisition of rights to explore, topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, 
exploration drilling, trenching, sampling and activities in relation to the evaluation of the technical feasibility and commercial viability of 
extracting a mineral resource.
Deferred exploration and evaluation assets are measured at cost less provision for impairment, where required.
Amortisation is charged in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
Mining licences, permits and computer software
The historical cost model is applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives with 
charges included in either cost of sales or administrative expenses:
• Computer software  – over 2 to 5 years
• Mining licences and permits  – over the duration of the legal agreement
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group carries out impairment testing on all assets when there exists an indication of an impairment. If any such indication exists, the Group 
makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value 
less costs to sell or its value in use.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset.
The best evidence of an asset’s fair value is the value obtained from an active market or binding sale agreement. Where neither exists, fair value 
less costs to sell is based on the best available information to reflect the amount the Group could receive for the cash-generating unit in an arm’s 
length sale. In some cases, this is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the conditions that originally 
resulted in the impairment. This reversal is recognised in the income statement and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Goodwill is also reviewed annually, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. Non-financial assets other than goodwill which have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at 
each reporting date.  Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Disposal groups held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale and included in discontinuing operations when their carrying amount is to be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable from sales of metal to an end user, net of any buyers discount and 
value added tax. The value of consideration is fair value which equates to the contractually fixed price within a 30 day quotation period. The value 
of consideration in the last month of the year is fair value which equates to the contractually agreed price during that month.
The costs of delivery to the end customers are effectively borne by the Group through means of an annually agreed buyer’s fee which is offset 
from the selling price. The Group reports both a gross revenue and revenue line which reflects the offset of the buyers’ discount from the price of 
the copper achieved.
Revenue is only recognised at the point when the following criteria are satisfied:
• The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer; 
• No managerial control remains over the metal product; and 
• The amount of revenue earned can be reliably measured.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour and all other direct costs associated with mining the ore 
and processing it to a saleable product.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion. 
Provision is made, if necessary, for slow moving, obsolete and defective inventory.
Current and deferred income tax
The current income tax charge is calculated based on the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where 
the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities  
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting  
nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the statement of 
financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised when they arise from timing differences where their recoverability in the short term is regarded as 
being probable.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the 
financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of 
their nature or amount.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash is cash with banks that is not available for immediate use by the Group. Restricted cash is shown separately from cash and cash 
equivalents on the statement of financial position. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less provision for impairment. 62
CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net 
of tax, from the proceeds.
Treasury shares
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are 
cancelled or reissued. Where such Ordinary Shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable 
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Share based compensation
The Group operates two main Share Option Plans, the rules of which were approved by the Board in December 2007 and October 2011. A scheme 
similar in details to the one approved in October 2011 was also set up for the two overseas General Directors with the only difference being a 
specific two year vesting period as opposed to a three year vesting period. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the 
grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in 
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. The total amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is 
the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the 
number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the 
options are exercised.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables do not carry interest and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Provisions
Provisions for environmental restoration of mining operations are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of 
time is recognised as interest expense.
Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or Group of financial assets is 
impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of 
impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) 
has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or 
delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where 
observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic 
conditions that correlate with defaults.
For loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted) at the financial asset’s original effective interest 
rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after 
the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss 
is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

3. Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks; market risk (including foreign currency exchange risk, commodity price risk and 
interest rate risk), tax risk, liquidity risk, capital risk and credit risk. There risks are mitigated wherever possible by the Group’s financial management 
policies and practices described below.
Foreign currency exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises on financial instruments that are denominated in a foreign currency, i.e. in a currency other than the functional 
currency in which they are measured. Foreign exchange risk does not arise from financial instruments that are non-monetary items or financial 
instruments denominated in the functional currency. Kazakhstan Tenge denominated monetary items are therefore not reported in the tables 
below, as the functional currency of the Group’s Kazakhstan based subsidiaries is the Tenge. Similarly, US Dollar denominated monetary items are 
not reported in the parent company as it has a functional currency of US Dollar. 
During August 2015, the Kazakhstan Tenge devalued by almost 37% overnight when the government transitioned to a free-floating exchange 
rate, allowing the market to determine the rate. The Tenge devalued further until the end of the year resulting in a total devaluation over the year 
of approximately 85%. 
Given that the Group’s operations in Kazakhstan generate their income in US Dollars through the export of copper, the immediate impact from a 
purely financial standpoint is positive as approximately 60% of the cost base in Kazakhstan is denominated in the Tenge.
The Group does not keep large amounts of cash in Tenge and as at 31 December 2015, held the US Dollar equivalent of $111,000 (31 December 
2014: $400,000).
The Group manages its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk associated with material commercial transactions and working capital 
requirements by maintaining controlled amounts of cash in the required currencies. The Group does not hedge foreign exchange risk. 
The primary Group currency requirements are US Dollar, British Pound, Kazakhstan Tenge and Chilean Peso. The Mongolian Tugrik, Chinese Yuan 
Renminbi, and European Euro requirements are immaterial to the Group’s operations.
The following table highlights the major currencies the Group operates in and the movements against the US Dollar during the course of the year: 
Average rate Reporting date spot rate

Commodity price risk
Commodity price risk is the risk that the Group’s future earnings will be adversely impacted by changes in the market prices of commodities, 
primarily copper. Management is aware of this impact on its primary revenue stream but knows that there is little it can do to influence the price 
earned apart from a hedging scheme.
The Group’s Treasury policy allows limited hedging up to a maximum of 30% of the Group’s rolling 12 month production. This policy allows 
management to combine the benefits of an exposure to the copper price for its shareholders whilst also facilitating the ability for management to 
put in place limited hedging to cover the cost base. There were no hedges in place during the year or at the year end. 
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the copper price against the invoiced price. 10% is the 
sensitivity used when reporting commodity price internally to management and represents management’s assessment of the possible change in 
price. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit for the year and other equity where the price increases.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk relates to the ability of the Group and Company to meet future obligations and financial liabilities as and when they fall due.
As the Group currently has sufficient cash resources and a material income stream from the Kounrad project, the liquidity risk is  
considered minimal.

Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group manages its capital in order to provide sufficient funds for the Group’s activities. Future capital requirements are regularly assessed and 
Board decisions taken as to the most appropriate source for obtaining the required funds, be it through internal revenue streams, external fund 
raising, issuing new shares or selling assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends 
paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
In order to ensure appropriate distributable reserves during the year, the Company completed a court approved capital reduction scheme (see 
note 25), which resulted in $67,079,000 being transferred from the share premium account to distributable reserves. A condition of the capital 
reduction scheme was to set aside an amount into a restricted bank account, which would cover certain creditors as of the effective date of the 
capital reduction.  The balance of the restricted bank account in relation to the capital reduction scheme as at 31 December 2015 was $400,297.   
The Group will continue to monitor any such risks and take appropriate actions. 
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that the Group and Company’s financial assets will be impaired by the default of a third party. The Group and Company are 
exposed to credit risk primarily on its cash and cash equivalents as set out in note 24 and on its trade and other receivables as set out in note 22.
The Directors have considered the credit exposures and do not consider that they pose a material risk at the present time. The credit risk for cash 
and cash equivalents is managed by ensuring that all surplus funds are deposited only with financial institutions with high quality credit ratings.
The Group is exposed to the risk of not recovering VAT receivable from Kazakhstan tax authorities as explained in note 22.
Interest rate risk
The Group has no borrowings as at 31 December 2015 (2014: nil) and is funded 100% by equity. The Group had $8,004,000 of cash balances on 
short-term deposit as at 31 December 2015 (2014: nil). The average fixed interest rate on short-term deposits during the year was 0.3% (2014: nil). 
The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk.
Tax risk
The taxation systems in Kazakhstan are at an early stage of development. The interpretation and application of tax laws and regulations are 
evolving, which significantly increases the risks with respect to mining and subsoil use operations, and the Group’s investments in Kazakhstan in 
comparison with more developed tax systems.
Tax legislation is subject to different and changing interpretations, as well as inconsistent enforcement. Tax regulation and compliance is subject to 
review and investigation by the authorities who may impose extremely severe fines, penalties and interest charges. The fact that the tax authorities 
have conducted an audit of a particular period does not prevent them from revisiting that period and raising an additional assessment.
In addition, Kazakhstan’s tax system does not recognise the concept of tax authorities giving legally binding rulings on tax issues that are put 
before them. The inconsistent enforcement and the evolution of Kazakhstan tax laws creates a risk of excessive payment of tax or penalties by the 
subsoil users if they fail to comply with tax legislation.
The Group manages this risk by complying locally with all tax regulations and ensuring that its local accounting staff are adequately trained and 
updated regarding any appropriate tax law changes. CAML also receives tax advice on local issues from its tax advisers in Kazakhstan.
The Group’s main receivable is the VAT incurred on purchases within Kazakhstan as explained in note 22. As at 31 December 2015 a total of 
$4,423,000 (2014: $6,392,885) of VAT receivable was still owed to the Group by the Kazakhstan authorities. The decrease in this balance is as a result 
of the devaluation of the Kazakh Tenge during 2015 as explained within the foreign exchange risk section. In February 2016, the authorities 
refunded a portion of this outstanding amount totalling $1,666,060. The Group still remains confident about its prospects to recover the 
remaining portion of $2,757,000 and is working closely with its advisers and local partners to achieve this. The planned means of recovery will be 
through a combination of the local sales of cathode copper to effectively offset VAT liabilities and by a successful appeal to the authorities.

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The Group has six key areas where critical accounting estimates and judgements are required that could have a material impact on the 
financial statements:
Impairment
As mentioned above estimates are required periodically to assess assets for impairment. The critical accounting estimates are future commodity 
prices, ore reserves, discount rates and projected future costs of development and production. This includes an assessment of the carrying values 
of assets held for sale.
The carrying value of the goodwill generated by accounting for the business combination of the Group acquiring an additional 40% in the 
Kounrad project in May 2014 requires an annual impairment review. This review will determine whether the value of the goodwill can be justified 
by reference to the carrying value of the business assets and the future discounted cash flows of the business.
Functional currency 
The functional currency of the Kazakhstan subsidiaries is Kazakh Tenge, which is the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. 
Determination of functional currency may involve certain judgments to determine the primary economic environment and this is re-evaluated for 
each new entity, or if conditions change.
Mineral reserves and resources
The major value associated with the Group is the value of its mineral resources. The value of the resources have an impact on the Group’s 
accounting judgements in relation to depreciation and amortisation, impairment of assets and the assessment of going concern. These resources 
are the Group’s best estimate of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the relevant mining property. The Group’s 
estimates are supported by geological studies and drilling samples to determine the quantity and grade of each deposit.
Significant judgement is required to generate an estimate based on the geological data available. Ore resource estimates may vary from period to 
period. This judgement has a significant impact on impairment consideration and the period over which capitalised assets are depreciated within 
the financial statements.
The Kounrad resources have been independently verified by Wardell Armstrong International and were classified as JORC Compliant in 2013.
Decommissioning and site rehabilitation estimates
Provision is made for the costs of decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs when the related environmental disturbance takes place. 
Provisions are recognised at the net present value of future expected costs using a discount rate of 7.22% (2014: 8.65%) representing the risk free 
rate (pre-tax) for Kazakhstan.
The provision recognised represents management’s best estimate of the costs that will be incurred, but significant judgement is required, as 
many of these costs will not crystallise until the end of the life of the mine. Estimates are reviewed annually and are based on current contractual 
and regulatory requirements and the estimated useful life of mines. Engineering and feasibility studies are undertaken periodically; however 
significant changes in the estimates of contamination, restoration standards and techniques will result in changes to provisions from period 
to period.
Business combination
The Kounrad Transaction which completed in two stages during 2013 and 2014, resulted in the Group acquiring the 40% of the joint venture 
project at Kounrad that it did not previously own. The assessment of the fair value uplift of the underlying assets acquired and the treatment of 
the two legal entities involved in the project required a high degree of judgement.
The assessment of the overall project as a business combination for both legal entities, Kounrad Copper Company LLP and Sary Kazna LLP , and 
the impact on that judgement caused by the different stages of completion required a careful review of the overall transaction as opposed to the 
specific nature of the assets being acquired. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report
67
CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The fair value uplift of the assets acquired as a result of that judgement and the resulting accounting treatment have resulted in a significant 
change to both the income statement in prior periods and the statement of financial position of the business. 
Further details on the accounting treatment of the business combination are set out in the 2014 Annual Report and note 33 of the 2014 
financial statements. 
VAT recoverability 
The Group’s main receivable is the VAT incurred on purchases within Kazakhstan as explained in note 22. As at 31 December 2015 a total of 
$4,423,000 (2014: $6,392,885) of VAT receivable was still owed to the Group by the Kazakhstan authorities. The decrease in this balance is as a  
result of the devaluation of the Kazakh Tenge during 2015. In February 2016, the authorities refunded a portion of this outstanding amount 
totalling $1,666,060. The Group still remains confident about its prospects to recover the remaining portion of $2,757,000 and is working closely 
with its advisers and local partners to achieve this. The planned means of recovery will be through a combination of the local sales of cathode 
copper to effectively offset VAT liabilities and by a successful appeal to the authorities. 
5. Segmental information
The Board is the Group’s chief operating decision maker. Management have determined the operating segments based on the information 
reviewed by the Board for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. The Board considers the business from a  
geographic perspective. 
The Group has two business segments consisting of an SX-EW copper plant at Kounrad in Kazakhstan and the Copper Bay project in Chile.  
The Copper Bay project has been reported as a segment for the first time for the year ended 31 December 2015 following the additional 25% 
investment made by CAML on 30 June 2015. The Group operations are controlled from a head office in London, UK, but this does not represent  
a separate business segment. 
The Board assesses the performance of the Kounrad project based on a number of key operational and financial measures which relate to copper 
production output, revenues from the sales of copper and the overall costs of producing the copper. 
All capital related expenditure at the Kounrad and Copper Bay projects are closely monitored and controlled.

The total production at Kounrad for 2015 was 12,071 tonnes (2014: 11,136 tonnes) whilst the total quantity of copper sold was at 12,040 tonnes 
(2014: 11,163 tonnes). The average gross price achieved from the sale of copper was $5,335 per tonne (2014: $6,794 per tonne).
EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure. CAML calculates EBITDA as profit or loss for the year excluding the following items:
• Income tax expense;
• Exceptional items such as inventory write-off;
• Finance income and expense; 
• Depreciation and amortisation; and 
• Discontinuing operations; and 
• Gain on re-measuring to fair value and other income or expenses.
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts. It does not have any standardised meaning prescribed by IFRS and 
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA excludes the 
impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes, and the effects of changes in operating working capital balances, and therefore is not 
necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate 
EBITDA differently.

The Group sells and distributes its copper cathode product primarily through an off-take arrangement with Traxys, which has been retained as 
CAML’s off-take partner through to 31 December 2018. The off-take arrangements are for a minimum of 90% of the SX-EW plant’s output. The 
copper cathodes are delivered from the Kounrad site by rail under an FCA (Incoterms 2010) contractual basis and delivered to the end customers 
primarily in Turkey. As part of the off-take arrangements, the Group sells the copper cathodes at a price linked to the London Metal Exchange 
(“LME") copper price based on an agreed quotational period.
The costs of delivery to the end customers have been effectively borne by the Group through means of an annually agreed buyer’s fee which is 
offset from the selling price.
During 2015, the Group sold 11,750 tonnes (2014: 10,687 tonnes) of copper through the off-take arrangements. Some of the copper cathodes are 
also sold locally and during 2015, 290 tonnes (2014: 476 tonnes) were sold to local customers.

10. Inventory write-off
An incident occurred on site on 26 June 2015, which resulted in approximately a third of the organic inventory being lost to the dumps within a 
very short time frame. The incident resulted in the write-off of inventory totalling $600,000 (2014: nil).   
Following the incident an insurance claim was submitted. In March 2016, the Group received notification that the merits of the claim had been 
accepted and negotiations are ongoing as to the quantum. The Group has not recognised a receivable for the claim.

As part of the off-take arrangements, the Group may receive payment for copper cathodes immediately upon dispatch rather than waiting for 
delivery to the end customer. In such cases, interest is charged to the Group on such amounts received up to a maximum period of 60 days from 
the date of dispatch. During the year the Group incurred interest charges of $59,441 (2014: $45,940) under these arrangements.
The above finance costs also include $183,639 (2014: $276,683) related to the unwinding of discount of the Group’s asset retirement obligations 
associated with the Kounrad project. The unwinding of discount is calculated on the environmental rehabilitation provision presented in note 29. 
For cash flow purposes, unwinding of discount is excluded from the finance expense movement.

The Company had $124,465 of office equipment at net book value as at 31 December 2015 (2014: $158,916).
The fall in value of the Tenge has resulted in non-cash foreign exchange losses within property, plant and equipment. This is due to the translation 
on consolidation of the Group’s Kazakhstan based subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Tenge as well as the goodwill and fair value uplift 
adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the Kounrad Transaction which are denominated in Tenge. Further details 
on the accounting treatment of the Kounrad Transaction business combination are set out in note 33 of the 2014 financial statements. 
The change in estimate in relation to the asset retirement obligation of $207,000 is as a result of adjusting the provision recognised at the net 
present value of future expected costs using an inflation rate of 5.68% (2014: 6.6%) and discount rate of 7.22% (2014: 8.65%) representing the risk 
free rate (pre-tax) for Kazakhstan.
Following receipt of the regulatory approvals in November 2015 required for the Kounrad Stage 2 Expansion to exploit the copper contained in 
the Western dumps, management have transferred deferred exploration and evaluation costs within intangible assets (note 19) to mining assets 
within property, plant and equipment at net book value $1,539,000.
Following receipt of the regulatory approvals required for the Kounrad Stage 2 Expansion in November 2015, management has extended the 
useful economic lives of certain property, plant and equipment and the fair value uplift on the Kounrad Transaction. The original estimate of 10 
years useful economic life has now been increased through to 2034 which represents the end of the subsoil user licence. This change in estimate 
will be applied from 1 January 2016. In future years, this change will result in a reduction in the annual depreciation and amortisation charge of 
approximately $4.0 million, but this amount is dependent on the Tenge exchange rate. Such changes are always subject to future periodic reviews 
of the Group’s depreciation policy.  74

Deferred exploration and evaluation costs 
Following receipt of the regulatory approvals in November 2015 required for the Kounrad Stage 2 Expansion to exploit the copper contained in 
the western dumps, the deferred exploration and evaluation costs at Kounrad have been reclassified to mining assets within property, plant and 
equipment (note 18). The net book value of deferred exploration and evaluation costs of $2,039,000 as at 31 December 2015 relates solely to the 
Copper Bay project. 
Copper Bay investment 
Following completion of the pre-feasibility study (“PFS") on 30 June 2015, CAML subscribed for 135,621,610 newly allotted ordinary shares in 
Copper Bay for a cash consideration of $3,000,000, which increased CAML’s shareholding from 50% to 75% and commenced consolidation of 
Copper Bay Ltd.
Previously this investment was treated as a mineral right. This has resulted in a reduction in Group retained earnings at 30 June 2015 of $1,149,000. 
An intangible asset of $3,222,000 recognised in 2013 equal to the cash consideration paid for the initial 50% shareholding has been reduced  
by $1,581,000. The resulting value of the intangible exploration and evaluation assets acquired in the Copper Bay Group on 30 June 2015  
were $1,641,000.  Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

Impairment test for goodwill
The Kounrad project located in Kazakhstan has an associated goodwill balance. In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ and IAS 38 
‘Intangible Assets’, a review for impairment of goodwill is undertaken annually or at any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist  
and in accordance with IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’, a review for impairment of long-lived assets is undertaken at any time an  
indicator of impairment is considered to exist.  
 
The discount rate applied to calculate the present value is based upon the real weighted average cost of capital applicable to the cash generating 
unit (“CGU"). A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from 
other assets or groups of assets.
The discount rate reflects equity risk premiums over the risk-free rate, the impact of the remaining economic life of the CGU and the risks 
associated with the relevant cash flows based on the country in which the CGU is located. These risk adjustments are based on observed equity 
risk premiums, historical country risk premiums and average credit default swap spreads for the period. 
The value in use (“VIU") of a CGU is generally lower than its fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD"), due primarily to the fact that the optimisation  
of the mine plans has been taken into account when determining its FVLCD. Consequently, the recoverable amount of a CGU for impairment 
testing purposes is determined based on its FVLCD.  
 
The key economic assumptions used in the review were copper price $6,000 per tonne and a discount rate of 8%. Assumptions in relation to 
operational and capital expenditure are based on the latest budget approved by the Board.  
 
The carrying value of the net assets is not currently sensitive to any reasonable changes in key assumptions.

process is taking far longer than the CAML Board ever anticipated due to the current political and regulatory uncertainties in the country and the

The carrying value of all the above receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value. There are no amounts past due at the end of the 
reporting period that have not been impaired apart from the VAT receivable balance as explained below. Management’s policy is to assess all 
trade and other receivables for recoverability on a regular basis. A provision is made where doubt exists and amounts are fully written off when 
information becomes known that the amounts due will not be recovered. 
As at 31 December 2015 a total of $4,423,000 (2014: $6,392,885) of VAT receivable was still owed to the Group by the Kazakhstan authorities. In 
February 2016, the authorities refunded a portion of this outstanding amount totalling $1,666,060, which is classified within current receivables. 
The Group still remains confident about its prospects to recover the remaining portion of $2,757,000 and is working closely with its advisers and 
local partners to achieve this. The planned means of recovery will be through a combination of the local sales of cathode copper to effectively 
offset VAT liabilities and by a successful appeal to the authorities.

The fall in value of the Tenge has resulted in a non-cash foreign exchange loss of $77,352,000 recognised within equity. This is primarily due to the 
translation on consolidation of the Group’s Kazakhstan based subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Tenge as well as the goodwill and fair 
value uplift adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the Kounrad Transaction which are denominated in Tenge.
The Group and Company made a reserve transfer during 2014 to include the share option reserve as part of retained earnings as permitted by 
IFRS. The share option reserve continues to be recognised within retained earnings as at 31 December 2015. 
27. Equity settled share based payments
The Company provides additional rewards to staff, in addition to their salaries and annual discretionary bonuses, through the granting of share 
options in the Company. The Company effectively has two such option schemes in place, the Old Scheme and the New Scheme.
Old Scheme
The first share option plan was introduced by the Company in February 2008 and initially had an exercise price of $6.42. On the recommendation 
of the Remuneration Committee, the exercise price for the participants was reduced to $0.68 in February 2010 to reflect the changed economic 
circumstances of the Company and maintain some form of incentive for staff. Only those staff still employed by the Group at this time benefited 
from this decision and those participants who had left the Group maintained an exercise price of $6.42 on their options. The vesting of share 
options in the plan is purely conditional upon time served by the participant and as at 31 December 2015, all options have fully vested. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
New Scheme
The Company introduced the second share option plan in October 2011. This scheme has an exercise price of effectively nil for the participants. 
The nil-cost share options granted under this scheme vest on the basis of a third annually depending on the achievement by the Group and the 
participant of the performance targets as determined by the CAML Remuneration Committee. Under a separate Non-Executive share option plan 
2012, Nurlan Zhakupov was granted 100,000 nil-cost options in 2012, and 50,000 nil-cost options in 2014, which vest on the basis of a third 
annually, without any performance conditions due to his Non-Executive role.
As at 31 December 2015, 180,000 (2014: 330,543) Old Scheme options and 2,380,361 (2014: 2,017,384) New Scheme options (including those issued 
to Nurlan Zhakupov) were outstanding. Share options are granted to Directors and selected employees. The exercise price of the granted options 
is presented in the table below for every grant. In general, options vest in 1/3 tranches over a three-year period. The Company has the option but 
not the legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average price are as following:

The related weighted average share price at the time of exercise was $2.47 (2014: $2.65) per share. Out of the 2,560,361 outstanding options 
(2014: 2,347,927), 913,079 options (2014: 581,833) were exercisable. 
An amount of $2,396,032 (2014: $1,913,617) has been credited to retained earnings and expensed within employee benefits expense from 
continuing operations for the grant of stock options for the year ended 31 December 2015. Included in this amount is an additional dividend 
related share option charge of $514,634 (2014: $450,566). The period between the date an award is issued and the date it is exercised the 
number of shares covered by such awards is increased by up to the value of dividends as if these were reinvested in Company shares at the  
dates of payment.
Share options exercised by the Directors during the year are disclosed in the Remuneration Committee Report on page 45.

Employee Benefit Trust
The Company set up an Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT") during 2009 as a means of incentivising certain Directors and senior management of 
CAML prior to the Initial Public Offering (“IPO"). All of the shares awarded as part of the EBT scheme vested on the successful completion of the 
IPO on 30 September 2010.
2,534,688 Ordinary Shares were initially issued as part of the arrangements in December 2009 followed by a further issue of 853,258 in 
September 2010. The shares were issued at the exercise price of $0.68, which was the best estimate of the Company’s valuation at the time. Details 
of the awards to Directors of the Company are contained in the Remuneration Committee Report on page 45.  80

The only provision accounted for by the Group is for the asset retirement obligation associated with the mining activities at Kounrad, estimated to 
be required in 2034. The provision is recognised at the net present value of future expected costs using a discount rate of 7.22% (2014: 8.65%) 
representing the risk free rate (pre-tax) for Kazakhstan.
The provision recognised represents management’s best estimate of the costs that will be incurred based on current contractual and regulatory 
requirements and the estimated useful life of mine to 2034. 
The change in estimate in relation to the asset retirement obligation of $207,000 is as a result of adjusting the provision recognised at the net 
present value of future expected costs using an inflation rate of 5.68% (2014: 6.6%) and discount rate of 7.22% (2014: 8.65%) representing the risk 
free rate (pre-tax) for Kazakhstan. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

In line with the Company dividend policy, the Company paid $20,368,000 in 2015 (2014: $17,932,000) which consisted of a 2015 interim dividend of 
4.5 pence per share and a final dividend for 2014 of 7.5 pence per share (2014: interim dividend of 5 pence per share and a final dividend for 2013 
of 5 pence per share). The dividend declared amount recognised in the statement of changes in equity of $20,358,000 is different to the dividend 
paid recognised in the cash flow statement of $20,368,000 due to foreign exchange differences on the GBP declared dividend. 
The Directors will propose a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2015 of 8 pence per share at the forthcoming Annual 
General meeting (“AGM").  82

33. Events after the reporting period 
VAT recoverability 
The Group’s main receivable is the VAT incurred on purchases within Kazakhstan as explained in note 22. As at 31 December 2015 a total of 
$4,423,000 (2014: $6,392,885) of VAT receivable was still owed to the Group by the Kazakhstan authorities. An amount of $1,666,060 was refunded 
from the authorities in February 2016 and has been reclassified from non-current to current trade and other receivables as at 31 December 2015.
Off-take arrangements at Kounrad 
During 2015, the Group’s off-take arrangements at Kounrad were put out to tender with Traxys being retained as CAML’s off-take partner following 
a competitive process. The revised off-take contract has been agreed through to 31 December 2018 and will provide additional cost savings fixed 
for the three-year period. The commitment is for a minimum of 90% of the Kounrad copper cathode production. 
Insurance claim 
Following the incident at Kounrad in June 2015 an insurance claim was submitted. In March 2016, the Group received notification that the 
merits of the claim had been accepted and negotiations are ongoing as to the quantum. No receivable was recognised for the claim at 
31 December 2015. 
34. Related party transactions
The Group had the following related party balances and transactions during the year ended 31 December 2015. Related parties are those entities 
owned or controlled by the Company, which is the ultimate controlling party of the Group.

$26,288 (2014: nil).
Directors’ remuneration, EBT shares and options
Directors’ remuneration, including Non-Executive Directors, during the year is disclosed in the Remuneration Committee Report on page 44.
Kenges Rakishev 
Mr Kenges Rakishev (“KR”) became a major shareholder of CAML on 23 May 2014 following completion of the Kounrad Transaction. He was 
appointed to the CAML Board on 9 December 2013 following the completion of the first part of the transaction. Consequently, KR is considered  
a related party in any dealings he has with the Group. 
As part of the obligations on KR for completing the Kounrad Transaction, he signed a relationship agreement with CAML setting out the terms  
of the relationship between KR and the Group.
On 29 December 2015, JSC Kazkommertsbank (“KKB”) announced that KR, a director of KKB, completed a transaction with Alnair Investment 
Company to purchase its parent company, JSC Alnair Capital Holding (“Alnair”), which owns 28.08% of KKB’s issued and outstanding share capital.
As a result of the transaction, KR became the General Partner of the Alnair investment group and effectively acquired full control over the voting 
and other rights of a combined 56.75% stake in KKB’s issued and outstanding share capital, made up of shares in KKB held by KR directly and 
indirectly, through Alnair. Alnair has subsequently been renamed Qazaq Financial Group JSC.
The Group uses the facilities of KKB within Kazakhstan for its normal day-to-day banking and has insurance agreements with a subsidiary of KKB.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group held $6,107,000 with KKB (2014: $12,479,000). Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

Deferred tax liability, net (9,652) (11,013) 58 40 (20,567)
The fall in value of the Tenge has resulted in a currency translation difference on the deferred tax liability of $10,306,000. This is primarily due to 
the translation of the goodwill arising on the Kounrad Transaction which is denominated in Tenge.
Where the realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent on future profits, the Group recognises losses carried forward and other deferred tax 
assets only to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
Further reductions to the UK corporation tax rate have been announced which will reduce the rate to 17% by April 2020. However, these changes 
had not been substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not recognised in these financial statements. 
The Group did not recognise other potential deferred tax assets arising from losses of $5,385,000 (2014: $3,700,000) as there is insufficient evidence 
of future taxable profits within the entities concerned. Unrecognised losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had other deferred tax assets of $934,000 (2014: $1,222,000) in respect of share based payments and other 
temporary differences which had not been recognised because of insufficient evidence of future taxable profits within the entities concerned.
There are no significant unrecognised temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of subsidiaries at 31 December 2015 
and 2014, respectively.
Company
At 31 December 2015 and 2014 respectively, the Company had no recognised deferred tax assets or liabilities.
At 31 December 2015, the Company had not recognised potential deferred tax assets arising from losses of $5,385,000 (2014: $3,345,000) as there

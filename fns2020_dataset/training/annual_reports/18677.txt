directors report - review helical bar plc 2012 As Chairman of the Nominations Committee, I have 
reported in detail on page 45 of this Annual Report 
regarding the present and proposed future constitution 
of your Board of Directors. Most importantly, I have 
asked Michael Slade to consider continuing in his 
current position as Chief Executive for a further ﬁ ve 
years and am pleased that he has indicated his 
willingness and enthusiasm to do so. 
In June 2011, Duncan Walker was promoted to the Board 
as an executive director and Michael O’Donnell was 
appointed as an independent non-executive director. 
Having been on the Board of Helical for almost 19 years, 
I intend to step down at the conclusion of this year’s 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). My fellow long-
serving non-executive directors, Antony Beevor and 
Wilf Weeks will also step down at the same time. I would 
very much like to thank them for their substantial 
contribution to your Company for many years and 
particularly to Antony for his masterful management 
of the Audit Committee. 
Nigel McNair Scott, Finance Director, has been on the 
Board of the Company since 1985 and has also indicated 
that he wishes to step down as Finance Director from 
the conclusion of  the AGM. I am, however, pleased 
that Nigel has accepted the request of the Nominations 
Committee to continue his close involvement with the 
Group and be appointed Chairman following my 
retirement. Tim Murphy, who joined the Group in 1994 
and has worked alongside Nigel since then, will be 
promoted to Finance Director immediately following 
the AGM. 
As Nigel will not be regarded as independent, the 
Committee determined that it is essential that the 
Board be strengthened by the appointment of two 
new independent non-executive directors. After an 
extensive search using external consultants, and 
having interviewed a number of strong candidates, 
I am pleased that we have identiﬁ ed two excellent 
individuals in Richard Gillingwater, who will become 
the Board’s Senior Independent Director, and will 
serve on all the Board’s committees, and Richard 
Grant, who will become the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and will serve on the other two 
committees. Both individuals will be appointed to the 
Board immediately following the AGM. 
It has been a privilege to serve on this exceptional 
Company’s Board for almost 19 years and to be 
Chairman for seven years. I shall be sad to relinquish 
my association with such a dynamic and successful 
team of people after so long. However, I believe that 
the Group, the executives and the portfolio of 
investment properties and developments are poised 
for a successful future which should be enhanced 
by a refreshed Board and a new Chairman.
Giles Weaver, 
Chairman

chairman’s statement
Helical Bar plc returned to proﬁ tability in the year to 31 March 2012 
and is poised to continue its upwards progress, with a number of 
exciting development schemes approaching realisation, backed up by 
sound ﬁ nances and an investment portfolio generating a signiﬁ cant 
surplus over costs. This has been achieved against a background 
of signiﬁ cant economic uncertainty and I am conﬁ dent that the Group 
is well prepared for the strong headwinds approaching from Europe. 
Michael Slade reports fully on the results for the year and the 
prospects for the Group in his Chief Executive’s Statement. 
04
directors report - review helical bar plc 2012 chief executive’s 
statement
In the year to 31 March 2012 we continued the process of 
rebalancing our portfolio between income producing investment 
assets and non-income producing development sites. In the 
economic environment we ﬁ nd ourselves in today, we believe this 
will help deliver long term shareholder value through combining 
the twin drivers of an investment portfolio generating signiﬁ cant 
cash surpluses and a London centric development programme. 
Applied together, these portfolios offer defensive qualities much 
needed in this uncertain world, whilst providing the potential 
to deliver outperformance in the future. 
Strategy 
Our prime objective is to maximise returns for shareholders through 
income returns, development and trading proﬁ ts and capital growth. 
Our strategy for achieving this is to: 
 yielding retail, ofﬁ ce and industrial property which offers considerable 
opportunity to increase income and enhance capital values through 
proactive asset management and skilful stock selection;
 creating positive net cash ﬂ ow for the business which exceeds our net 
ﬁ nancing costs, administration costs and dividends; 
 refurbishments, creating value through land assembly, planning and 
implementation in the ofﬁ ce, residential, mixed use and retail sectors;
 situations; and,
 retirement villages. 
Progress
During the year we made signiﬁ cant progress in each of these key strategic 
areas. We have sold £50m of investment assets and £26m of development 
sites, recovered £16m of cash through the sale of 50 per cent of our retail 
development at Gliwice in Poland and re-cycled these proceeds in over 
£100m of investment assets, increasing our annualised net rental income 
from £23m to circa £26m. We have also obtained over 850,000 sq ft of 
planning permissions at our ofﬁ ce development at Mitre Square, our 
foodstore scheme at Fulham Wharf, our retail schemes at Shirley and 
Tyseley and our industrial scheme at Stockport and for over 850 residential 
units at Fulham Wharf, Shirley and our retirement villages at Great Alne, 
Milton and Exeter. More recently, we have submitted a planning application 
for our major mixed use scheme at Barts Square and intend to submit a 
planning application in respect of our scheme at White City later this summer.
The impact of this activity is clearly illustrated in the annual results for the 
year to 31 March 2012, with a 29% increase in the Group’s share of net 
rental income to £22.9m (2011: £17.8m), a development proﬁ t of £0.7m 
(2011: loss of £16.6m), a net gain on the sale and revaluation of the 
investment portfolio of £3.3m (2011: £7.5m) and a pre-tax proﬁ t of £7.4m 
(2011: loss of £6.3m). EPRA earnings per share were 3.4p (2011: loss of 
6.4p). This return to proﬁ tability encourages us to propose an increased 
ﬁ nal dividend of 3.40p (2011: 3.15p) per share, up 8% on 2011, taking 
the total dividend to 5.15p (2011: 4.90p). Our property portfolio delivered 
an ungeared total return of 5.6% (2011: 2.7%). EPRA net asset value per 
share fell marginally to 250p (2011: 253p).
Future
We live in a world where the news from Europe is dominating the 
headlines with daily warnings of the potential consequences of the impact 
of a collapsing Eurozone economy. Whatever the end result, there will be 
 Group is well placed to ride out the storm that seems to be gathering. 
We have performed strongly over the year and the continued effort to 
address the imbalance in our business by increasing the Group’s weighting 
 return to proﬁ tability. Our ability to outperform our peers in the future will 
depend upon the strength of our development pipeline and it is that part 
of the business that offers the greatest opportunity for growth. We are 
increasingly redirecting our hard earned equity to London and the South-
East, markets which currently represent 47% of our portfolio. The next 
few years are all about Central London and happily that is where we hold 
our most exciting assets. The prospects for substantial proﬁ ts in respect 
of our London and retail developments provide cause for optimism for 
the future performance of the Group.

performance
Our portfolio by equity invested
Investment strategy
The investment portfolio, which is mainly let 
and income producing, has two main purposes:
 interest;
 to growth in the Group’s net asset value.
We seek to achieve these aims through careful, disciplined stock picking, 
generally of multi-let London ofﬁ ces, shopping centres, industrial estates 
and mixed portfolios. Our key aim is to be conﬁ dent that there is 
sustainable demand from occupiers for all of our assets. 
We frequently reposition our properties through signiﬁ cant refurbishment 
or extensions. We work closely with our tenants to maintain maximum 
occupancy and these relationships often lead to opportunities to increase 
value through re-gearing leases or moving tenants within a building as 
they expand or contract. Finally, at certain points in the cycle we may buy 
entirely vacant buildings (such as the Morgans, Cardiff or Shepherds 
Building, London W14) with a view to carrying out a major refurbishment, 
where we are conﬁ dent that the occupational market is strong enough to 
allow the whole building to be let quickly.
Development strategy
We employ a wide variety of approaches in our 
development activities. The principal aim is to 
be ‘equity lean’ to maximise our share of 
proﬁ ts by leveraging our capital employed and 
managing the risks inherent in the 
development process given the size of our 
balance sheet. A summary of the alternative 
ways of participating in development schemes 
is as follows:
 minimise our ongoing fee to maximise our proﬁ t share so that our 
interests are completely aligned with our partners e.g. Fulham Wharf 
and 200 Aldersgate.  
 or options e.g. Mitre Square, where we have entered into conditional 
 stake e.g. Barts Square, where we will receive a “waterfall” above a

directors report - review helical bar plc 2012 How is directors’ remuneration 
linked to the Group’s strategy?
The Group’s executive remuneration policy 
is designed to ensure that Executive Directors 
and senior management are provided with 
appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced 
performance and are, in a fair and responsible 
manner, rewarded for their individual 
contributions to the success of the Group.
The remuneration packages of individual directors are structured so that 
the performance related elements form a signiﬁ cant proportion of the total 
and are designed to align their interests with those of the shareholders.
Share incentives are designed so that they recognise the long-term 
growth of the Group. The performance periods are longer term, 
 if performance criteria are met. Share incentive schemes are also 
 Further details of the remuneration of directors can be found in the 
directors’ remuneration report on page 50.
How is corporate and social 
responsibility linked to this 
strategy?
Helical recognises that our business activities 
impact on the environment and the wider 
communities in which we operate.  
We are aware of the inﬂ uence we can exert through the implementation 
of responsible environmental and social practices via our partners, 
contractors and suppliers.

What is our risk strategy?
Risk is an integral part of any Group’s 
business activities and Helical’s ability to 
identify, assess, monitor and manage each 
risk to which it is exposed is fundamental 
to its ﬁ nancial stability, current and future 
ﬁ nancial performance and reputation.
Risk management starts at Board level where the Directors set 
the overall risk appetite of the Group and the individual risk policies. 
 to run the business. 
Part of the management’s role is to act within these policies and 
to report to the Board on how these policies are being operated.
The Group’s risk appetite and speciﬁ c risk policies are continually 
assessed by the Board to ensure that they are appropriate and consistent 
with the Group’s overall strategy and the external market conditions.
The effectiveness of the Group’s risk management strategy is reviewed 
annually by the Directors.
The principal risks faced by the Group are:
Strategic risk
The main strategic risks the Group face are that its strategy is inconsistent 
with market conditions and it has an inappropriate capital structure. 
Financial risks
The Group is vulnerable to a number of ﬁ nancial risks due to the way in 
which it is funded. The Group has a signiﬁ cant level of cash and debt and 
as such is subject to the following ﬁ nancial risks:

A property company’s share price should reﬂ ect 
growth in net assets per share. Our Group’s main 
objective is to maximise growth in assets from

from retained earnings from other property 
related activities.
Key performance indicators and benchmarks
We incentivise management to outperform the Group’ s competitors by setting 
the right levels for performance indicators against which rewards are 
measured. We also design our remuneration packages to align management’ s 
 reporting against identiﬁ able performance targets and benchmarks. For a 
number of years we have reported on these, the most important of which are:

Net asset value
Net asset value per share represents the share of net assets attributable 
to each ordinary share. Whilst the basic and diluted net asset per share 
calculations provide a guide to performance the property industry prefers 
to use an adjusted diluted net asset per share. The adjustments 
necessary to arrive at this ﬁ gure are shown in note 32 to these accounts.
Management is incentivised to exceed 15% p.a. growth in net asset value 
per share. The adjusted diluted net asset value per share, excluding trading 
stock surplus, at 31 March 2012 was 221p (2011: 225p).
Including the surplus on valuation of trading and development stock, the 
diluted EPRA net asset value per share at 31 March 2012 was 250p (2011:

370,000 sq ft ofﬁ ce building had remained 
vacant since Clifford Chance left for Canary 
Wharf in 2005. In 2010, we were appointed 
under an asset and development management 
agreement by the owners of the building to 
advise on a refurbishment and re-letting 
programme. We have refreshed and re-clad 
parts of the building, creating a “vertical village” 
for ofﬁ ce users. 
 2010 the building was launched in January 
2011 and since then we have completed 
twelve ofﬁ ce lettings totalling 112,000 sq ft. 
In addition we have let 35,000 sq ft of 
basement to Virgin Active who have 
opened a new ﬂ agship Classic Club gym. 
The remaining space continues to attract 
interest from potential tenants and we are 
optimistic that there will be further letting 
success in 2012.

building by the current owners, we will receive

At Mitre Square, London EC3 we have 
signed agreements to purchase two 
adjoining sites from the City of London 
and SFL2 Limited (previously Ansbacher). 
The S.106 agreement which enabled the

signed last June. In addition we have 
been working with the City to obtain 
a Section 237 TCPA 1990 to overcome 
any injunctable rights to light. We now

of the existing buildings to facilitate the 
construction of a new building comprising

retirement villages
A retirement village is a private 
residential community in 
which active over-55s are 
able to live independently in 
retirement. Residents have 
typically down-sized from a 
larger family home into a 
cottage or apartment with no 
maintenance or security issues.
With access to a central 
clubhouse containing a bar and 
restaurant facilities and health 
and ﬁ tness rooms and 
surrounded by maintained 
grounds, this retirement option 
is proving increasingly popular.

business review helical bar plc 2012 Asset Management 
During the year £2.0m of rent was lost at lease end (7.6% of rent roll). A 
further £0.6m (2.1% rent roll) was lost through administrations (net of rent 
from regearing leases as tenants in administration were acquired). £1.8m 
of leases were renewed (6.5% rent roll) with a further £2.3m (8.6% rent 
roll) added through new letting and ﬁ xed uplifts. The net rental reduction 
was £0.2m. Of the rent lost, £0.4m was attributable to Barts Square and 
£0.7m to 200 Great Dover Street, both of which were anticipated and 
facilitate refurbishments / redevelopments. Excluding these anticipated 
losses, net rental gain was £0.9m. 
Our material exposures to tenant administrations have been Peacocks / 
Bon Marche, Priceless Shoes, Shoon, Game and Clintons. 
Including units which have been let or are under offer since March 2012, 
we have lost £0.4m of rent from administrations. Total rent at risk from 
administration was £1.5m. Of this total we have retained/re-let or have 
under offer 63% of rent at risk from administration. 
Sales
We have continued to make good progress in selling non-income 
producing assets or assets where we perceive there to be limited further

to Aviva, our Joint Venture partner in our White City development, and will 
contribute to our development site. 61 Southwark Street was sold for 
 F3 portfolio) was sold for £8.25m, together with a number of other smaller 
sales. 
Of the non-income producing sales, £10.3m consists of units at our 
retirement village at Bramshott Place, Liphook and £3.3m of units at 
Southall (the entirety of our remaining interest). 
Since the year end, we have exchanged or completed on £20.8m of 
sales (£13.8m non-income producing). A further £12.9m is under offer 
(all non-income producing). 
Acquisitions 
We have continued to acquire income producing properties throughout 
the year, some with longer term redevelopment or refurbishment potential. 
The acquisition of Barts Square, EC1, was completed in joint venture with 
 major mixed use development has been submitted. 
Vacant possession will be attained between 2014 and 2016. In the 
meantime we are receiving a net yield of circa 5.5%. 
Ofﬁ ce investments were acquired in Chiswick (£3.7m, 10% NIY) on a 25 
year RPI linked sale and leaseback transaction, Botleigh Grange for £2.4m 
 we acquired a part vacant ofﬁ ce building with retail on the ground ﬂ oor 
from the receivers for £14.1m. This is currently being refurbished and we 
hope to achieve a running yield in excess of 8% upon letting. 
We also acquired a retail parade in Basildon and Corby Town Centre for a 
total of £81.3m, both yielding 8% where we intend to continue letting 
vacant space and implement minor refurbishments where necessary. 
Total gross annual rental income (before joint venture shares) arising from 
these acquisitions is circa £12m. 
There was a valuation increase of 0.7% in the year to 31 March 2012 
including capex, sales and purchases which compares to the IPD monthly 
index of 0.7% over the same period.
Future Investment Acquisitions
Following our recent acquisitions in the retail sector, especially Corby for 
circa £70m last October, we are now concentrating on London for future 
purchases. We are targeting multi-let ofﬁ ces with low rents (£20/£30 psf) 
 preference is for buildings in need of refurbishment and active 
management, often with some vacancies. 
An example of the sort of assets we are keen to purchase is illustrated by

through the sale of a 50% interest in our largest Polish retail development, 
provided funds for the acquisition of over £100m of new investment 
assets. This net new investment of over £52m, including capital 
 interest in its investment portfolio to £394m, including its share of assets 
held in joint ventures, up from £338m. The impact of this increase in 
investment assets is seen in the Income Statement where net rents, 
including assets held in joint venture, increased from £17.8m to £22.9m, 
a 29% increase.
Deepening economic concerns over the Eurozone and its potential 
 development sites held by the Group and this has been reﬂ ected in a 
 by proﬁ ts made on the remainder of our development portfolio and the 
Group posted its ﬁ rst net development proﬁ t since 2008 of £0.7m (2011: 
loss £16.6m).
Administration costs, before performance related awards, increased by 
6%. Net ﬁ nance costs rose from £6.3m to £7.8m, reﬂ ecting the increase in 
the size of the investment portfolio. The downward trend in interest rates 
between April 2011 and March 2012 gave rise to a small loss when 
comparing the fair value of the Group’s derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to 
their book value, but as a result of the cancellation of a number of these 
instruments during the year, the remaining fair value liability on the Group’s 
balance sheet is now just £3m. During the year the Group was exposed to 
exchange rate movements on its share of the assets and liabilities relating 
to Poland and ﬂ uctuating rates generated a loss of £1.1m.
The net result for the year was a pre-tax proﬁ t of £7.4m compared to a 
£6.3m loss in the previous year. This proﬁ t resulted in a diluted EPRA 
earnings per share of 3.4p (2011: loss of 6.4p) which allows the Group 
to fund a total dividend of 5.15p (2011: 4.90p), of which 3.40p is 
recommended to shareholders as a ﬁ nal dividend, payable on 26 July 2012.
The total comprehensive income of £4m added 3.43p to the diluted 
 4.90p reduced this to 250p.
During the year, the Group entered into a number of new bank facilities 
totalling £130m, which were used to reﬁ nance existing assets and fund 
its purchase of new investment properties. The principal new facility was 
a ﬁ ve year £100m revolving credit facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland 
plc which was used to reﬁ nance its recent acquisition of Corby Town 
Centre, consolidate a number of other facilities with the bank and provide 
capacity for future acquisitions. The Group also entered into new 
investment facilities with Barclays enabling it to acquire properties in 
 investment at Shepherds Building, Shepherds Bush in a new three year 
 village at Durrants Village to be built out. In addition, new investment 
facilities were agreed with Nationwide and Clydesdale Bank during the 
year. Despite the perception that bank ﬁ nance is difﬁ cult to obtain, we 
continue to receive strong support from our banks. 
The Group faces the future with a sound ﬁ nancial base, having increased 
its income stream by replacing low growth assets with higher yielding 
retail properties, reﬁ nanced maturing debt with longer term bank facilities 
and reduced its exposure to any future interest rate rises by entering into 
new hedging instruments, taking advantage of current low interest rates. 
In addition, and with the backing of the major property lending banks, the 
Group has access to a number of new bank facilities which, when added 
to its cash balances, provides a level of liquidity and resources to enable 
it to deal with the current economic uncertainties and to continue to 
rebalance its portfolio.
Net rental income
The Group’s share of net rental income increased to £22.9m (2011: £17.8m) 
 payable to freeholders increased following the acquisition of Newmarket 
on a long leasehold interest. Property overheads increased to £5.5m 
(2011: £5.3m). Tenant bad debts remain low at 2% of gross rental 
income.

Total net development proﬁ ts of £0.7m (2011: loss of £16.6m) 
were generated after deducting write-offs and provisions of £4.5m 
(2011: £14.9m). 
Development proﬁ ts were generated at the retirement village scheme at 
Bramshott Place, Liphook, at our mixed use scheme at Fulham Wharf, 
London SW6, at our ofﬁ ce development at Tilgate, Crawley and in 
Poland. In addition, we recognised the remaining proﬁ t in respect of our

at Clyde Shopping Centre, Clydebank and Barts Square and our 
development schemes at Europa Centralna Gliwice Poland, Shirley 
 from joint venture partners was £2.5m (2011: £2.9m) mainly due to 
the Group’s share of net rental income and the net revaluation surplus 
from its investment in the Clyde Shopping Centre and Barts Square.
Gain on sale and revaluation of investment properties 
During the year the Group sold investment properties with book values of 
£50.8m (2011: £27.9m) on which it made a loss of £0.4m (2011: gain of 
£4.8m). The properties sold included 61 Southwark Street, Aldridge, 
 The revaluation surplus for the year was £3.7m (2011: £2.7m).
Finance costs, ﬁ nance income and derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments
Interest payable on bank loans including our share of loans on assets 
held in joint ventures but before capitalised interest, increased from 
£12.9m to £13.9m due to a higher level of average debt during the year 
more than offsetting the lower average cost of debt. Capitalised interest 
reduced from £4.2m to £3.3m reﬂ ecting the lower level of development 
stock held during the year. As a consequence of these two movements, 
total ﬁ nance costs increased by £1.9m. Finance income earned on cash 
deposits reduced marginally to £0.6m (2011:£0.7m).
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments have been valued on a mark to market 
basis and a charge of £0.3m (2011: credit of £1.8m) has been 
recognised in the Income Statement.
Taxation 
The deferred tax asset is principally derived from tax losses which the 
Group believe will be utilised against proﬁ ts in the foreseeable future.

Review of progress in the year to 31st March 2012 
We manage our environmental and social impacts because there are 
business beneﬁ ts in doing so. These beneﬁ ts include increased ability to 
secure planning consent, improved marketability of assets to prospective 
tenants, reduced operating costs of assets, mitigating the risk of future 
legislation and regulation, and enhanced corporate reputation.
Below we outline our progress in relation to the each of our Corporate 
Responsibility impact areas. 
Environment
Our high-level corporate commitment to environmental issues is outlined 
in the Group’s Environmental Policy which can be found on the company 
website. The Policy details our commitments across a range of impact 
areas and our development and property management activities. In 
 of its Corporate Responsibility programme over the following 12 months. 
These targets addressed a range of impacts arising from our development 
and property management activities, including resource use and waste

 a 2% reduction in water use and energy, with a signiﬁ cant reduction in 
water use of 78% and a reduction of 22% gas use and 7% electricity 
use. This reﬂ ects an ongoing efﬁ ciency and internal awareness of how 
we use and manage our ofﬁ ces.

water efﬁ ciency through the implementation of low and no cost measures. 
The speciﬁ c target for 2011 was to achieve a 5% improvement against 
the 2010 baseline. A review of the data in the table below shows that 
performance is variable across the portfolio with the properties generally 
showing an overall increase in consumption. This reﬂ ects increasing 
occupancy and changes to the portfolio structure. An additional 
performance measure of average utilisation of kWh/sqm for electricity 
and gas is provided for the portfolio this year and shows a general trend 
of a year on year decrease. An equivalent assessment is made of 
average water consumption which shows a very pleasing downward 
trend to below 0.5 m

 The success of our approach was particularly demonstrated at Corby 
Shopping Centre where our managing agents Ashdown Phillips were 
awarded a Shining Star of the Year award in the National Recycling 
Stars Awards for 2011. At our other managed assets we comfortably 
exceeded our ongoing target of a recycling rate of at least 35%.

principal managed assets and is displayed in public areas to help 
achieve this aim. Following from this, individual property managers 
have engaged with the larger tenants to try and see if there are ways in 
which efﬁ ciencies can be made. The success of this holistic approach 
to environmental management was demonstrated by Clyde Shopping 
Centre which won a Green Apple award in November 2011 for the ‘Big 
Steps – Smaller Footprints’ initiative. Through a combination of regular 
communication with tenants and staff, promoting good practice with

The UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”)
The Board is accountable to the Group’s shareholders for good corporate 
governance. 
We believe in applying the highest principles of corporate governance 
and, except where stated below, have complied throughout the year with 
 Code (“Code”) headed “The Main Principles of the Code”. The Group also 
takes into account the corporate governance guidelines of institutional 
shareholders and their representative bodies.
–  Appointment of Chairman
  Following the retirement of the current Chairman, Giles Weaver, at this 
year’s AGM the Nominations Committee is intending to appoint current 
Finance Director Nigel McNair Scott as Chairman of the Company, 
subject to his being re-appointed a director at the AGM. The Code 
requires that a new chairman should satisfy, on appointment, the 
independence criteria set out in provision B.1.1 and Nigel will not 
satisfy this Code provision on appointment. The Committee has 
engaged in an extensive consultation process with shareholders and 
representative bodies, explaining its reasons for the proposed 
appointment and has received indications that there will be 
considerable support for Nigel’s re-election at the AGM and his 
appointment as Chairman at the conclusion of the AGM. In proposing 
this appointment, the Committee is conscious of non-compliance with 
the Code and has sought to strengthen shareholder protections by the 
appointment of two new, independent, non-executive directors, 
Richard Gillingwater and Richard Grant. Richard Gillingwater, who has 
 listed companies, details of which are noted in his biography on page 
47, will become the Senior Independent Director. Richard Grant is the 
Finance Director of Cadogan Estates Limited and a former partner 
 Senior Independent Director, Richard Gillingwater will take on the 
responsibility for liaising with shareholders and their representative 
bodies regarding the governance of the Company and will also be 

will hold meetings of the independent non-executive directors separately 
from the rest of the Board to ensure that any issues may be discussed 
without the presence of a non-independent director. The Committee 
believes this will provide shareholders with sufﬁ cient comfort that the 
governance of the Company and the review of its Board procedures 
and processes are not compromised by a perceived lack of 
independence. 
– Composition of the Board
  The Code requires a Board to have an appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Company to enable 
 with a strong management team of senior decision-makers backed up 
by ﬁ nance and other support staff. Given its size the Board does not 
consider it appropriate to operate both a main board and a separate 
executive committee, a structure commonly seen in larger companies.

 which are below the FTSE350, are required to have at least two 
independent non-executive directors. The Board has determined, 
 executive directors is appropriate to balance the current executive 
team, to provide the experience and advice that the executive team 
seeks and to ensure the interests of shareholders and other 
stakeholders are adequately protected. In the year to 31 March 2012, 
the team of non-executive directors included Antony Beevor, who was 
appointed to the Board in April 2000 and has, therefore, served as a 
non-executive director for 12 years. In the view of the Board, Antony 
provides a robustly independent approach to his position as a 
non-executive and to his roles as Senior Independent Director and 
 at this year’s AGM and will be succeeded as Senior Independent 
Director by Richard Gillingwater and as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee by Richard Grant.
  In the Board’s view, the composition of the Board will continue to 
have an appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge of the Company as required by the Code.
–  Notice of Annual General Meeting
  The code recommends that the Notice of AGM and related papers be 
sent to shareholders at least 20 workings days before the meeting. For 
the 2011 AGM the Notice and related papers were sent out 17 working 
days before the AGM. 
Chairman and Chief Executive
The Chairman and the Chief Executive collectively are responsible for the 
leadership of the Company. The Chairman’s primary responsibility is for 
leading the Board and ensuring its effectiveness, whilst the Chief Executive 
is responsible for running the Company’s business. The division of 
 approved by the Board. Following the proposed changes to the Board,

Board responsibilities

the long term success of the Group and returns for its shareholders. The 
Board is collectively responsible for providing the entrepreneurial leadership 
of the Group within a framework of controls and reporting structures which 
assist the Group in pursuing its strategic aims and business objectives. The 
Board sets the Group’s strategic aims, ensures that the necessary ﬁ nancial 
and human resources are in place for the Group to meet its objectives and 
reviews management performance. The Board sets the Group’s values and 
standards and ensures that the Group’s obligations to its shareholders and 
others are understood and met.
All directors take decisions objectively in the interests of the Group. 
As part of their roles as members of the Board, non-executive directors 
constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy and the 
risk appetite of the Group. Non-executive directors scrutinise the 
performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and 
monitor the reporting of performance. They satisfy themselves on the 
integrity of ﬁ nancial information and that ﬁ nancial controls and systems 
of risk management are robust and defensible. They are responsible for 
determining appropriate levels of remuneration of executive directors and 
have a prime role in appointing and, where necessary, removing executive 
directors, and in succession planning. In addition to Boardroom discussions, 
the Chairman contacts other non-executive directors by telephone and, if 
appropriate, will hold meetings with the non executive directors without the 
executive directors present.
The Board has a schedule of matters speciﬁ cally reserved to it for 
decision. The Board controls the business but delegates day-to-day 
 of matters which are required to be or, in the interests of the Group, 
should only be, decided by the Board of Directors as a whole. A 
summary of the decisions reserved for the Board is set out below:

served on the Board for 18, 12 and 7 years respectively. Nigel McNair 
Scott will offer himself for re-election as a director and if re-elected, will be 
appointed Chairman of the Company and Chairman of the Nominations

Annual evaluation of the Board and its Committees
The annual evaluation process involves each director submitting an 
appraisal in respect of the performance of the main Board, of each 
member of the Board and in respect of each Board Committee of which 
they are a member. The non-executive directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, are responsible for the performance evaluation 
of the Chairman, taking into account views of executive directors. Each 
director completes an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance and 
provides this evaluation to the Senior Independent Director.
During the year the Board undertook a formal evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its Committees and individual directors in the 
period and the Chairman reported the results of that evaluation process to 
the Board. The most signiﬁ cant issue arising from the evaluation process 
concerned the succession of the current Chief Executive, Michael Slade. 
In the light of this issue being raised the Chairman engaged in a review of 
the business needs of the Company with regard to the composition of the 
Board. The Chief Executive, Michael Slade, was asked to continue his 
tenure on the Board for the next ﬁ ve years and, as referred to in the Letter 
from the Chairman of the Nominations Committee on page 45, he 
conﬁ rmed his willingness and enthusiasm to continue leading the 
Company for that period. The Senior Independent Director reported that 
there were no matters arising from the evaluation of the Chairman that 
necessitated any action or required a meeting to be held without the 
Chairman present.
Directors – information and professional development
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with information in a form and of 
a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties and its directors 
 the direction of the Chairman, the Company Secretary’s responsibilities 
include ensuring good information ﬂ ows within the Board and its 
Committees and between senior management and non-executive 
directors, as well as facilitating induction and assisting with professional 
development as required. The Company Secretary is responsible for 
advising the Board through the Chairman on all governance matters.
The Board ensures that directors, especially non-executive directors, 
have access to independent professional advice at the Group’s expense 
where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as 
directors. Training is available for new directors and other directors as 
necessary. All directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that 
board procedures are complied with.
Committees of the Board
The report of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the 
report of the Chairman of the Audit Committee are found on pages 49 
and 57 respectively of this Annual Report. The report of the Nomination 
Committee can be found on page 45. 
Relations with shareholders
The Group values the views of its shareholders and recognises their interest 
in the Group’s strategy and performance, Board membership and quality of 
management. It therefore holds regular meetings with, and presentations 
to, its institutional shareholders to discuss its results and objectives. The 
Group also regularly meets, with the help of its brokers, institutions that do 
not currently hold shares in the Group to inform them of its objectives. 
Michael Slade, as Chief Executive, attends most of these meetings and is 
usually accompanied by one of the other executive directors. 
Since the end of the ﬁ nancial year under review, Andrew Gulliford as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, has engaged with principal 
shareholders (holding more than 3% of the Company’s shares) and 
shareholder representative bodies, to seek their approval for a new, 
codiﬁ ed, Performance Related Cash Bonus Scheme as detailed on page 53. 
The Chairman, Giles Weaver, has also engaged with principal 
shareholders and shareholder representative bodies since the year end, 
regarding the proposed changes to the Board due to become effective 
on the date of the Annual General Meeting. 
The AGM is used to communicate with private investors and they are 
encouraged to participate. The Chairman, Senior Independent Director 
and members of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees 
are available to answer questions. Separate resolutions are proposed on 
each issue so that they can be given proper consideration and there is a 
resolution to consider the annual report and accounts. The Group counts 
all proxy votes and will indicate the level of proxies lodged on each 
resolution, after it has been dealt with by a show of hands.
The Group communicates with all shareholders through the issue of 
regular press releases and through its website at www.helical.co.uk.
The Group receives regular reports from sector analysts and its investor 
relations advisors on how it is viewed by its shareholders.

corporate governance review helical bar plc 2012 Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal 
control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets. 
Such a system is designed to manage, but cannot eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives. There are inherent limitations in 
any control system and, accordingly, even the most effective system can 
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control are as follows:
 The day-to-day involvement of the executive directors in the running 
of the business ensures that these responsibilities and limits are 
adhered to;
 expenditure forecasts. The Board receives regular and comprehensive 
reports on the day-to-day running of the business;
 signiﬁ cant internal control matter. In the year under review the 
Committee met with the Auditors on two occasions.
The Board is responsible for the management of the Group’s risk proﬁ le. 
An analysis of the Group’s risk strategy can be found on page 7.
Internal audit
The Board reviewed its position during the year to 31 March 2012 and 
reafﬁ rmed its stance that in view of the relatively small size of the Group 
it does not consider that an Internal Audit function would provide any 
signiﬁ cant additional assistance in maintaining a system of internal controls.
Charitable and Political Donations
The Company continues to support charitable causes and in the year to 
31 March 2012, made charitable donations of £21,742. Further details 
are provided in the Corporate Responsibility Report on page 39. The 
Company’s policy with regard to political donations is to ensure that 
shareholder approval is sought before making any such payments. No 
shareholder approval has been sought and, accordingly, the Company 
made no political donations in the year to 31 March 2012. 
Going Concern
The directors have reviewed the current and projected ﬁ nancial position 
of the Group making reasonable assumptions about future trading 
performance.
The key areas of sensitivity are:
 loan repayments:
 The forecast cashﬂ ows have been sensitised to eliminate those cash 
inﬂ ows which are less certain and to take account of a further 
deterioration of property valuations. From their review the directors 
believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue to be 
operational as a going concern for the foreseeable future.

corporate governance review helical bar plc 2012 Dear shareholder,
 Committee, and my primary responsibility as its Chairman, is to ensure that 
the Company is headed by an effective Board which is collectively responsible 
for the long-term success of the Company. This is best achieved through 
the provision of entrepreneurial leadership and a talented executive team, 
supported by committees with an appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the company to be able to constructively 
challenge and assist the executive team in achieving its objectives. In the 
year to 31 March 2012, the Committee comprised Antony Beevor, Andrew 
Gulliford, Wilf Weeks, Michael O’Donnell (from June 2011) and me.
During the year, the main focus of the Committee was succession planning, 
both for the executive team and the non-executive directors. In early 
2011 the Committee identiﬁ ed a need for an additional independent 
 assist in this process. After considering a number of candidates, the 
Committee recommended to the Board the appointment of Michael 
O’Donnell, who was appointed to the Board on 24 June 2011. At the 
same time the Committee also recommended to the Board the promotion 
of Duncan Walker who joined the Company in August 2007. Duncan has 
primary responsibility for the Company’s retail investments.
The results of the annual Board evaluation process held during the year 
identiﬁ ed a number of other succession issues. The Company’s Chief 
Executive, Michael Slade, joined the Board in 1985 and turned this previously 
small engineering company into a highly successful real estate company. 
 shareholder. I have asked Michael to consider continuing in his current 
position of Chief Executive for the next ﬁ ve years and am pleased that he 
has indicated his willingness and enthusiasm to do so. The Company’s 
Finance Director, Nigel McNair Scott, has been in charge of the ﬁ nances 
since 1987 and has informed the Committee that he intends to retire as 
Finance Director at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. In addition, 
I have been on the Board for nearly 19 years, the last seven as Chairman. 
Antony Beevor, Chairman of the Audit Committee, has been on the Board 
for 12 years. Both Antony and I are considered to be non-independent under 
Corporate Governance best practice and we both believe it is appropriate 
that we stand down from the Board. Wilf Weeks has also indicated his 
wish to retire from the Board. The consequence of these changes is that 
we are looking to make a number of new appointments to the Board 
immediately after the Annual General Meeting. 
Tim Murphy, who joined the Company in 1994, will be promoted to 
Finance Director at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting and 
will retain his role as Company Secretary until a suitable successor is 
appointed. The executive team will, therefore, comprise Michael Slade, 
 Duncan Walker. 
In the knowledge of the proposed changes, the Committee has undertaken 
a review of the balance of the Board and set out a number of objectives 
in its search for new non-executive directors. In the light of my imminent 
retirement, the main concern of the Committee has been to ensure that 
the long term succession issue of who is to replace Michael Slade as Chief 
Executive is handled by a Chairman with a good understanding of the 
Company. I am pleased that Nigel McNair Scott has accepted the request 
of the Committee to continue his involvement with the Company and to 
act as Chairman following my retirement. Conscious that this appointment 
 Corporate Governance Code, we have engaged in an extensive consultation 
process with shareholders and representative bodies and have received 
indications that there will be considerable support for Nigel’s re-election 
at the AGM and his appointment as Chairman at its conclusion.
Since Nigel will not be regarded as independent, the Committee determined 
that it is essential that the Board be strengthened by the appointment of 
two new independent directors. The Committee appointed search ﬁ rm 
Norman Broadbent to assist in this process. Their brief was to provide a 
list of potential candidates to satisfy two perceived gaps in the ongoing 
non-executive team. The ﬁ rst was for a director with City experience who 
could become the Senior Independent Director and provide a signiﬁ cant 
level of leadership and support for the rest of the non-executive team. 
The second was for a director who has recent and relevant ﬁ nancial 
experience to replace Antony Beevor as Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
In considering potential candidates, the Committee, conscious of the 
recommendations of Lord Davies, asked Norman Broadbent to ensure 
that women candidates were identiﬁ ed and included in their search. 
After an extensive search, and having interviewed a number of strong 
candidates, I am pleased that we have identiﬁ ed two excellent individuals 
in Richard Gillingwater, who will become the Board’s Senior Independent 
Director, and will serve on all the Board’s committees, and Richard Grant, 
who will serve as the Chairman of the Audit Committee and as a member 
of the other two committees. Further details of these two new directors 
appear on page 47. Both of these appointments will become effective 
immediately after the Annual General Meeting and at that point the 
non-executive team of directors will comprise Nigel McNair Scott 
(Chairman), Richard Gillingwater (Senior Independent Director), Andy 
Gulliford (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee), Richard Grant 
(Chairman of the Audit Committee) and Michael O’Donnell. 
I am extremely grateful to the two continuing non-executive directors, 
Andy Gulliford and Michael O’Donnell, who have been instrumental in 
the process of appointing these new directors. 
With regard to my retiring colleagues, Antony and Wilf, I would very much 
like to thank them for their substantial contribution to your Company for 
many years and particularly to Antony for his masterful management of 
the Audit Committee. 
Annual General Meeting 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2012 the following 
resolutions relating to the appointment of directors are being proposed: 
 subsequently be appointed non-executive Chairman;
 Matthew Bonning-Snook, Jack Pitman and Duncan Walker; and,
 Gulliford and Michael O’Donnell. 
I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour of 
these resolutions. 
It has been a privilege to serve on this exceptional Company’s Board for 
19 years and to be Chairman for seven years. I shall be sad to relinquish 
my association with such a dynamic and successful team of people after 
 portfolio of investment properties and developments are poised for a 
successful future. This success should be further enhanced by a 
refreshed Board and a new Chairman.

The nominations committee 
The Nominations Committee is chaired by Giles Weaver. The other 
members of the Committee during the year under review were Antony 
Beevor, Andrew Gulliford, Wilf Weeks and Michael O’Donnell (on his 
appointment to the Board). None of the Committee members has any 
personal or ﬁ nancial interest in the matters to be decided (other than 
as shareholders), potential conﬂ icts of interest arising from cross-
directorships nor any day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
At the 2012 AGM, Giles Weaver, Antony Beevor and Wilf Weeks will 
retire from the Committee (and the Board). Immediately following the 
2012 AGM Nigel McNair Scott will be appointed Chairman of the 
Committee and Richard Gillingwater and Richard Grant will be appointed 
to the Committee. 
Board appointments
Appointments to the Board and its Committees are made on merit and 
against objective criteria. Care is taken to ensure that appointees have 
enough time available to devote to the job. The Nominations Committee 
controls the process for Board appointments and makes 
recommendations to the Board.
The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee are available by 
request and are included on the Group’s website at www.helical.co.uk.
Advisors to the Committee
During the year under review the Committee appointed search 
 candidates for appointment to the Board as non-executive directors. 
The work of the Nominations Committee in the year
The Committee met four times during the period and a record of 
attendance at these meetings is shown above. Including the matters 
referred to in the Letter from the Chairman of the Nominations Committee 
on page 45, the Committee considered the following matters during 
the year:
 of Michael O’Donnell as an independent non-executive director in 
June 2011;
 candidates for appointment as independent directors; and,
 new Chairman of the Company.
Shareholder consultation
On appointment as the new Chairman of the Company, Nigel McNair 
Scott will not be regarded as independent by shareholders and their 
representative bodies. In the light of this, the current Chairman, Giles 
Weaver, has conducted an extensive consultation exercise with the 
Company’s largest investors and representative bodies, to explain the 
rationale behind this appointment. Whilst concern has been expressed by 
some shareholders that such an appointment is not in accordance with 
 Nigel McNair Scott is the most appropriate candidate for the role. This 
role will speciﬁ cally require him to ensure that the long term succession 
issue of who replaces Michael Slade as Chief Executive is handled in the 
best interests of shareholders. In discharging this task, he will be assisted 
by four independent non-executive directors, from whom the next 
Chairman of the Company is expected to be identiﬁ ed. 
Directors’ re-election
The Committee has been informed that Giles Weaver (Chairman), 
Antony Beevor and Wilf Weeks will not be offering themselves for 
re-election at the 2012 Annual General Meeting, to be held on 24 July 
2012. Nigel McNair Scott will offer himself for re-election and, if re-
elected, be appointed non-executive Chairman of the Company. The 
Board continues to believe that the requirements of Code Provision B.7.I 
 fulﬁ lled. This provision requires all directors of FTSE350 companies to 
be subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Whilst the Company 
is no longer in the FTSE350 the Board has chosen to comply with this 
provision as it accepts that shareholders should annually have the right 
to vote on each director’s re-election to the board. The Nominations 
Committee conﬁ rms to shareholders that, following the annual formal 
performance evaluation, these directors continue to be effective and 
demonstrate commitment to their roles.
Biographical details of the directors are given on page 47.

the board of directors and senior management helical bar plc 2012 Dear Shareholder,
The year to 31 March 2012 has been one of analysis and scrutiny for 
remuneration committees with the implementation of the provisions of 
 politicians and in the media about the appropriate level of remuneration 
for the executive directors of listed companies. This debate is likely to 
continue in the coming year following the recent consultation by the 

and its expected proposals to signiﬁ cantly increase levels of disclosure of 
incentive targets and strengthen the shareholder vote from 2013 onwards. 
It is with this background that I present this remuneration report.
Remuneration policy
 provide a basic remuneration package below the median level of its 
peers within the listed real estate sector combined with an incentive 
based bonus and share scheme structure aligned with the interests of 
its shareholders. Remuneration within the real estate sector is monitored 
and reviewed regularly to ensure that the Group’s positioning of its 
remuneration remains in line with these objectives. In addition to this 
external view, the Committee also monitors the remuneration levels of 
senior management below Board level and the remuneration of other 
employees to ensure that these are taken into account in determining the 
remuneration of executive directors and considers environmental, social, 
governance and risk issues.
Remuneration issues dealt with during the year
The Committee has considered a number of matters during the ﬁ nancial 
year under review and the following decisions were taken:
 Jack Pitman;
 due to his external commitments;
 2011 and increases awarded to Giles Weaver, as Chairman, Antony 
Beevor, as Chairman of the Audit Committee and Andy Gulliford, as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, 
 Chief Executive and the Finance Director, was reviewed and a 
resolution to renew the Scheme for a further ﬁ ve years was approved 
by shareholders at the 2011 AGM;
 executive directors, was reviewed in the light of shareholder feedback. 
Following extensive consultation with major investors and 
representative bodies, the Committee determined to seek shareholder 
approval for a codiﬁ cation of the scheme, with appropriate shareholder 
protections, at the 2012 AGM. Further details and the main terms of 
the proposed scheme are detailed below;
 Plan (“PSP”), which was approved by shareholders in 2004, should 
continue in its present form until expiry in 2013/14; and
 terms of the PSP in 2008 and considered the performance of the 
Company during the three year performance period to 31 March 2011 
and the Committee resolved in July 2011 to make a further award of 
shares under the terms of the PSP .
The results of these decisions are outlined in further detail in this report, 
together with additional information on the remuneration paid and 
payable to the directors of the Group and the short term and long term 
incentive schemes. 
Annual General Meeting 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2012 the following 
resolutions relating to remuneration are being proposed:

 I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour 
of these resolutions.

letter from the chairman of the remuneration committee helical bar plc 2012 The Board recognises that directors’ remuneration is of legitimate 
concern to shareholders and is committed to following current best 
practice. This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the 
Listing and Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Services 
 Governance Code as they relate to Directors’ remuneration. It has been 
approved by the Board and will be submitted to shareholders for approval 
at the Group’s Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2012. Grant 
 and share awards on pages 54 to 56. 
The remuneration committee (“Committee”)
The Committee is chaired by Andrew Gulliford. The other members of the 
Committee during the year under review were Antony Beevor, Wilf Weeks 
and Michael O’Donnell (on his appointment to the Board). None of the 
Committee has any personal or ﬁ nancial interest in the matters to be 
decided (other than as shareholders), potential conﬂ icts of interest arising 
from cross-directorships nor any day-to-day involvement in running the 
business. At the 2012 AGM, Antony Beevor and Wilf Weeks will retire 
from the Committee (and the Board) and immediately following the 
2012 AGM, Richard Gillingwater and Richard Grant will be appointed
to the Committee. 
The Committee has responsibility for determining and agreeing with 
the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the 
Chairman, Chief Executive and the executive directors and, subject 
to proposals submitted by the Chief Executive, shall recommend 
and monitor the level and structure of remuneration for such other 
members of the senior management as report directly to the Board. 
The remuneration of non-executive directors shall be a matter for the 
Chairman and the executive directors to be decided at a meeting of 
the Board.
In determining such policy, the Committee shall take into account all 
factors which it deems necessary. The objective of the remuneration 
policy shall be to ensure that executive directors and senior management 
are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced 
performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for 
their individual contributions to the success of the Group. Within the 
terms of the agreed policy, the Committee shall determine, for the 
executive directors:
 including, where appropriate, basic salaries, bonuses, share awards, 
pensions and other beneﬁ ts;
 compensation commitments.
In determining such packages and arrangements the Committee gives

request and are included on the Group’s website at www.helical.co.uk.
Advisors to the Committee
The Committee consults the Chief Executive and Finance Director about 
its proposals and has access to professional advice from remuneration 
consultants, New Bridge Street, to help it determine appropriate 
remuneration arrangements. Terms of reference for New Bridge Street, 
which provided no other services to the Company, are available from the 
Company Secretary on request. 
The executive directors’ remuneration packages
There are three main elements to the executive directors’ remuneration 
packages:
 those made in accordance with the terms of the Executive Bonus Plan; 
and,
 Share Incentive Plan. 
Balance of ﬁ xed versus variable pay
In line with its policy, the Committee seeks to ensure that the balance of 
remuneration provides a basic salary below the median, and performance 
related bonuses and share awards that reward outperformance of the 
Group’s peer group. In the year to 31 March 2012 the balance of ﬁ xed 
versus variable pay on an actual basis for the executive directors 
compared to the maximum payable was as follows:

directors’ remuneration report helical bar plc 2012 Executive directors’ basic annual salary and beneﬁ ts-in-kind
The basic package of salary and beneﬁ ts is designed to match the 
experience and responsibilities of each director and is reviewed annually 
to ensure that it is consistent and appropriate to their responsibilities 
and expectations. The Group does not provide any separate pension 
provision for Executive Directors and expects individuals to provide for 
their retirement through their basic salaries and incentive payments. 
Basic salary levels were last reviewed in July 2011. Executive directors’ 
current basic annual salaries, together with salaries for the prior year, 
are as follows:
 1 April 2011  1 April 2012
 £ £
Michael Slade 500,000 500,000
Nigel McNair Scott 335,000 235,000
 Matthew Bonning-Snook 275,000 300,000
Jack Pitman 275,000 300,000
Duncan Walker 175,000 250,000
The salaries of Matthew Bonning-Snook and Jack Pitman were increased 
by circa 9% on 1 July 2011 to reﬂ ect inﬂ ationary rises since their last 
 by circa 15% to reﬂ ect both an inﬂ ationary rise over that period and 
additional responsibilities undertaken. The salary of Nigel McNair Scott 
was reduced to £235,000 on 1 August 2011 to reﬂ ect his reduced 
 2011/12. The salary of Duncan Walker was increased to £250,000 as 
from 1 April 2012 to reﬂ ect his appointment to the Board of the Company.
Going forward, the Committee has resolved that the basic salaries of 
executive directors should be reviewed annually and increased to reﬂ ect 
an appropriate level of salary inﬂ ation. Accordingly, the basic salary levels 
 increased by 3% from 1 July 2012. Mr Slade has advised the Committee 
that he will not be taking an inﬂ ationary increase this year, thereby 
retaining his current salary level. Nigel McNair Scott is to become 
non-executive Chairman and will not receive an increase and Duncan 
Walker is not eligible for this year’s inﬂ ationary increase given the increase 
in his basic salary he received following his appointment to the Board. 
Beneﬁ ts-in-kind provided to executive directors comprise the provision 
of a company car or car allowance and health insurance.
Non-executive directors salaries
Salaries payable to non-executive directors were reviewed in the year and 
increases awarded to Giles Weaver, Antony Beevor and Andrew Gulliford, 
effective from 1 July 2011. The salaries payable to Giles Weaver and 
Antony Beevor were last increased in April 2007. The salary payable 
to Andrew Gulliford was last increased in February 2010 following 
his appointment as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
Non-executive directors’ current annual salaries, together with salaries 
for the prior year, are as follows:
 1 April 2011 1 April 2012

The Board have resolved that with effect from 1 July 2012, the salaries 
payable to non-executive directors will comprise a basic £40,000 plus 
an additional £10,000 for the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees and the Senior Independent Director. 
Chairman
Following consultation with the Company’s major investors and 
representative bodies, it is proposed that Nigel McNair Scott, if re-elected 
at the 2012 AGM, will become Chairman of the Company following the 
 affairs will principally concern dealing with the issue of succession 
as well as providing guidance and advice on the Company’s strategy. 
Accordingly, his day to day involvement in the Company’s affairs will 
exceed those of his predecessor and in recognition of this, the Board 
have resolved to pay him an annual salary of £150,000 pa.

Executive Bonus Plan
During the year Shareholders approved the renewal of the existing 
Executive Bonus Plan, previously approved in 2006. The renewed plan 
(“2011 Plan”) contains the same features and performance targets as 
its predecessor and is designed to align the motivations of the Chief 
Executive and Finance Director with the interests of shareholders and 
to link their remuneration to the performance of the Group’s property 
portfolio. Michael Slade and Nigel McNair Scott were eligible for Executive 
Bonus Plan bonuses during the year. No Executive Plan Bonuses have 
been paid in respect of the year to 31 March 2012 (2011: nil).
The Committee may, at its discretion, award bonuses in respect of a 
ﬁ nancial year subject to performance conditions, the aim of which is to 
link the size of bonuses paid to the ﬁ nancial growth of the Group over 
that ﬁ nancial year. No bonus will be payable unless the following 
conditions are satisﬁ ed:
 year exceeds net asset value at the beginning of the ﬁ nancial year;
 percentage increase in the total return on property assets of the Group 
over the ﬁ nancial year (the “Performance Period”) is greater than the 
percentage increase achieved by the portfolio ranked nearest to 
threequarters up the performance table (taken in ascending order of 
 funds measured by the Investment Property Databank at the beginning 
of the relevant Performance Period and compounded monthly during 
the Performance Period (the “IPD Total Return Benchmark”); and,
 in net asset value per share for the Performance Period must be 
 the portfolios of all quarterly valued funds measured by the Investment 
Property Databank at the beginning of the relevant Performance Period 
and compounded monthly during the Performance Period (the “IPD 
Capital Growth Benchmark”).
The Committee will recommend the size of the bonus payable by 
reference to the same sliding scale based on the amount by which the 

total amount of the bonuses payable in any one year shall be determined 
by: 
 asset value per share for the Performance Period and the percentage 
 over the same period (the “Difference”); and,
 of the Difference on the following basis:
 % of base net asset
  Amount of Difference value payable
Less than 1%  0.01
1% to less than 2%  0.02
And thereafter for every additional 1% An increment of 0.01
For example: From 4% to less than 5% 0.05
If the net asset value at the end of a ﬁ nancial year is less than the net 
asset value at the beginning of that year, the bonus payable for any 
subsequent year will be calculated by reference to the highest net asset 
value in the preceding year.
The total amount payable under the 2011 Plan in any one year is limited 
to £2m (2010: £2m). An individual employee’s participation in the 2011 
Plan is limited so that the bonus which may be paid to him under the 
2011 Plan will not exceed £1.5m per annum. There is a further limit that 
payments under the 2011 Plan in any year may not exceed 20% of the 
Group’s pre-tax proﬁ ts plus any payments under the 2011 Plan. Among 
other constraints the Committee could restrict the bonuses if payment 
would affect the ﬁ nancial or trading position of the Group.
Following feedback received during the investor consultation in respect 
of the codiﬁ cation of the bonus arrangement set out below, the 
Committee agreed that future participants in this scheme who do not 
have a minimum shareholding in the company of 2 times salary should 
receive up to one third of any bonus in deferred shares.
Performance related cash bonus scheme
For executive directors other than the Chief Executive and Finance 
Director, the Group operated a performance related cash bonus scheme 
 establishes the objectives which must be met for performance related 
cash bonuses to be paid. The calculations of the performance related 
cash bonuses payable to each participant are directly related to the 
proﬁ ts generated by the participants. In each case these proﬁ ts are 
recognised in the accounts of the year in which the bonus is accrued and 
these proﬁ ts will have been received by the time the bonuses are paid. 
Any losses on other projects are deducted from the proﬁ ts, as are all 
costs directly attributable to the generation of the proﬁ ts, including all 
ﬁ nance costs and an apportionment of central overheads. The net proﬁ ts 
generated by each participant are available as a bonus pool and bonus 
payments are made based on individual performance. Bonuses are 
calculated in a range of 0 to 10% of the bonus pool with appropriate 
percentages depending on the level of equity contributed to each 
 Jack Pitman and Duncan Walker were eligible for performance related 
cash bonuses in the period under review. The maximum amount payable 
in respect of the year was a total of £5m. Payment of these performance 
related cash bonuses is at the discretion of the Committee. In the year 
under review, performance related cash bonuses were paid to Matthew 
Bonning-Snook (£105,000) and Duncan Walker (£115,000).

directors’ remuneration report helical bar plc 2012 Performance Share plan
The Performance Share Plan (“PSP”), which was approved by shareholders 
in 2004 and is the Company’s primary long-term incentive arrangement, 
rewards participants for net asset value growth and performance relative 
to an industry comparator over a three year period. The Plan is designed 
to encourage long term performance and participants are required to 
retain shares acquired for at least two years after vesting. The main 
features of the plan are as follows:
 grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions (see 
below) have been satisﬁ ed and the participant is still employed by the 
Group. Once exercisable, awards will remain capable of exercise for a 
period of normally no more than six months.

gross (ungeared) total property return per share relative to other 
property funds as determined by IPD but excluding those funds worth 
less than £50m at the start of the three year period. Performance will 
be measured over the three years following grant.
 o  For the growth in net asset value, the “fully diluted triple net” net 
asset value as at the start of the ﬁ nancial year in which a grant takes 
place will be compared to the value three years later (having added

excess over the 3% per annum average.
 o For the Total property return v IPD property funds condition:

3.3 and 33.3

Provided the net value per share (having added back dividends) increases 
over the three year period.
Share awards will lapse where the gross return falls below the IPD 
median and where the growth in triple net asset value is below 7.5% per 
annum over the three year period.
During the year the performance conditions relating to the ﬁ fth award, 
granted on 14 July 2008, were considered. The three year performance 
period to 31 March 2011 showed that the net asset value per share, 
calculated in accordance with the terms of the PSP , had reduced by 
7.6% p.a.
 as determined by IPD, was 1.4% compared to the upper quartile of the 
IPD Benchmark which showed a return of 1.0%. Therefore, although the 
IPD comparison performance criteria had been met, no shares could vest 
as the net asset value per share had fallen.
Subsequent to the year end the performance conditions relating to 
the sixth award, granted on 9 July 2009, were considered and it was 
determined that no shares would vest in respect of this award. 
Further details will be included in the 2013 Annual Report.
Awards made to directors under the terms of the PSP which have not yet vested are as follows:

Participants will not normally be permitted to sell shares received through the PSP , other than to meet taxation (and national insurance contributions) 
liabilities, until they own shares to the value of 2 x salary for directors and 1 x salary for other executives. In addition, and whilst it is not a condition of

date, all shares received by the executive directors under the terms of the group’s Performance Share Plan and Share Incentive Plan have been 
 Alignment with shareholder interests
The Remuneration Committee has analysed the potential gains that may be made by executives (directors and those below Board level) through the

increase in the net asset value plus cash returned as dividends to shareholders) that could accrue to all executives through the Group’s long and 
short-term incentive and bonus plans at the point at which the maximum awards vest might be of the order of 20%. At this point, in absolute terms, the 
Group will have increased its triple net asset value by at least 15% per annum with the Group’s relative performance placing it in the top quartile of IPD, 
over the three year period.

directors’ remuneration report helical bar plc 2012 The audit committee 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Antony Beevor. The other members 
of the Committee during the year under review were Andrew Gulliford, 
Wilf Weeks and Michael O’Donnell (on his appointment to the Board). 
None of the Committee members has any personal or ﬁ nancial interest 
in the matters to be decided (other than as shareholders), potential 
conﬂ icts of interest arising from cross-directorships nor any day-to-day 
involvement in running the business. At the 2012 AGM, Antony Beevor 
and Wilf Weeks will retire from the Committee (and the Board) and 
immediately following the 2012 AGM, Richard Grant will be appointed 
Chairman and Richard Gillingwater will be appointed to the Committee. 
The Committee endorses the principles set out in the FRC Guidance on 
Audit Committees. The Board has formal and transparent arrangements 
for considering how it applies the Group’s ﬁ nancial reporting and internal 
control principles and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with 
its auditors. Whilst all directors have a duty to act in the interests of the 
Group, the Committee has a particular role, acting independently from 
the executive, to ensure that the interests of shareholders are properly 
protected in relation to ﬁ nancial reporting and internal control. 
Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nominations Committee in consultation with 
the Audit Committee Chairman.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are available by request 
and are included on the Group’s website at www.helical.co.uk.
The work of the audit committee in the year
The Committee met three times during the year and a record of 
attendance at these meetings is shown on page 43. It is common 
 all Board members who are available, whether or not they are members 
of the Committee so that their contribution to the matters discussed 
may be obtained.
Matters formally reviewed and discussed by the Committee during the 
year included:
 including its whistle-blowing policies;
 with the Bribery Act 2010;
 Announcement of the annual results to 31 March 2011 and the 
Interim Statement on the half year results to 30 September 2011; 
 services by the external auditors.
The Audit Committee met the external auditors on two occasions to 
discuss matters arising from the annual and interim audits.
Audit independence
A policy of reviewing audit independence has been adopted whereby 
non-audit services undertaken by the auditors are approved prior to work 
being carried out. The audit committee considers the external auditors to 
be independent and has satisﬁ ed itself of the effectiveness of the external 
auditors.
The Group’s policy on awarding non-audit work to its auditors is designed 
to ensure that the Group receives the most appropriate advice without 
compromising the independence of the auditors. Whilst no fee caps or 
limits have been set by the Committee, the level of fees would be a factor 
in considering whether the auditors’ independence could be affected by 
the award of non-audit work.
Annual General Meeting 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2012 the following 
resolutions relating to the auditors are being proposed: 
 Auditor; and, 
 Auditor.
I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour 
of these resolutions.

Note: all deferred tax balances have been calculated at the rate of corporation tax for the year to 31 March 2013 of 24%. Accordingly, the tax reconciliation also uses this rate of corporation tax.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
The tax charge is expected to be less than the full rate in future years, primarily due to the Group continuing to claim allowances in respect of eligible 
expenditure on investment properties and unrealised capital losses at 31 March 2012 of £10m.

Other temporary differences      945 2,167 463 746
Deferred tax asset      9,050 8,879 463 717
Other temporary differences represent deferred tax assets arising from the recognition of the fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and future tax 
relief available to the Group from capital allowances and when share awards vest.
If upon sale of the investment properties the Group retained all the capital allowances, the deferred tax provision in respect of capital allowances of 
£2.5m (2011: £2.8m) would be released and further capital allowances of £7.7m (2011: £10.6m) would be available to reduce future tax liabilities.

13. Parent company
The Company has taken advantage of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own income statement in the ﬁ nancial 
statements. The loss for the year of the Company was £9,334,000 (2011: £4,592,000).
notes to the ﬁ nancial statements helical bar plc 2012
75 14. Earnings per share
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year. This is a different basis to the net asset per share calculations which are based on the number of shares at the year 
end. Shares held by the ESOP , which has waived its entitlement to receive dividends, are treated as cancelled for the purposes of this calculation.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the issue of shares on the assumed 
exercise of all dilutive options.
The earnings per share are calculated in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share and the best practice recommendations of the European Public 
Real Estate Association (“EPRA”).
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

In accordance with IAS 33 no dilutive weighting adjustments have been made for share awards in existence during the year to 31 March 2011 as a loss 
was made during that year making the adjustments anti-dilutive. Accordingly, the basic and diluted losses per share for that year are the same.
The earnings/(loss) used for calculation of diluted EPRA earnings per share includes net rental income and development property proﬁ ts/losses but 
excludes trading property losses.

Included within current available-for-sale investments is an amount lent to a company promoting a mainly residential mixed–use development and an 
investment of 20% of the equity of this company.
The loan and the equity are classed as available-for-sale investments and are held at fair value. The Group has determined its fair value by considering 
both the loan and the equity element separately. The loan element is valued at the fair value of the expected consideration to be received including 
anticipated future costs of recovering this loan. This amount has been impaired in the year due to a revision in the expected receipt. The equity element 
is given a nil value with the Group valuing the underlying company on a break up basis at £nil as it is believed that this is the most probable outcome. 
This nil valuation is derived because the Group believe that the value of the property and any other of the company’s assets, after the repayment of the 
loan payable to the Group, would be required to repay the outstanding creditors leaving negligible value to the shareholders.
Of the movement in the fair value of the loan and equity and the associated deferred tax movement, £19,000 of other fair value movement has been 
recognised in the Income Statement and the impairment of £3,521,000 has been recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.

the Income Statement as Impairment of available-for-sale investments and the remaining £11,508,000 was written off in Other Comprehensive Income. 
In the year to 31 March 2012 the Group sold its investment for nominal consideration.

 ﬁ nancial position were consolidated in the Group’s results and ﬁ nancial position. The results of this Company for the part of the year before the sale 
were consolidated in the Group’s results and for the results of this Company for the part of the year after the sale and for the ﬁ nancial position at the 
balance sheet date have been accounted for as an investment held for sale due to a commitment to sell the remaining 50% within the next 3 years.
Following the purchase of Barts in 2011, the joint venture company has a contingent liability to pay up to a further £35m which will be dependent upon 
the timing of vacant possession and the ﬂ oor area of any future redevelopment scheme for which planning permission is received. The meeting of the 
conditions in which an extra payment is required will almost certainly result in an increase in the valuation of the property equal to or above the amount 
of the additional payment.

86 The Group’s capital management objectives are:
–  to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and,
–  to provide an adequate return to shareholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall ﬁ nancing structure. It manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the 
light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. Capital 
is deﬁ ned as being issued share capital, retained earnings, revaluation reserve and other reserves. (2012: £246,139,000; 2011: £247,797,000). The 
Group continually monitors its gearing level to ensure that it is appropriate. Gearing increased from 81% to 90% in the year due to the rebalancing of 
the Group’s property portfolio.
The deferred shares were issued on 23 December 2004 to those shareholders electing to receive a dividend, rather than a capital repayment or further 
shares in the Company, as part of the Return of Cash approved by shareholders on 20 December 2004. The deferred shares carry no voting rights and 
have no right to a dividend or capital payment in the event of a winding up of the Company. 
The Company’s Articles of Association give the Company irrevocable authority to purchase all or any of the deferred shares for a maximum aggregate 
total of 1 penny for all deferred shares in issue on the date of such purchase.
28. Share options
At 31 March 2012 there were 34,713 unexercised options over new ordinary 1p shares in the Company (31 March 2011: nil). No options over 
purchased ordinary 1p shares held by the ESOP had been granted to directors and employees under the Company’s share option schemes 
(31 March 2011: nil).

The Group and Company ﬁ nancial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale assets, forward 
exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, caps and ﬂ oors. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are externally measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps, caps and ﬂ oors are measured at the present value of future cash ﬂ ows estimated and 
discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. 
IFRS 7 categorises ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities as being valued in 3 hierarchical levels:
 – Level 1: values are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 – Level 2: values are derived from observing market data
 – Level 3: values cannot be derived from observable market data
The derivative ﬁ nancial instruments above have been valued using a Level 2 methodology and the available-for-sale investments, which are described 
in note 18, are classiﬁ ed as Level 3 fair value measurements, being those not based on observable market data. There were no transfers between 
categories in the current or prior year.

94 35. Principal accounting policies 
Basis of consolidation 
 up to 31 March 2012. Subsidiary undertakings are those entities over which the Group has the ability to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies 
through the exercise of voting rights. Subsidiaries are accounted for under the purchase method and are held in the Company balance sheet at cost 
and reviewed annually for impairment.
Joint Ventures are entities whose economic activities are controlled jointly by the Group and by other ventures independent of the Group and are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Group’s share of proﬁ t after tax in the Joint Venture is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement and the Group’s share of the Joint Venture’s net assets are incorporated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company’s cost of investment in Joint Ventures less any provision for permanent impairment loss is shown in the Company Balance Sheet.
Associates are those entities over which the Group has signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence but which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures. 
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries are eliminated. 
 Going concern
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Corporate Governance review on page 44.
Revenue recognition 
Rental income – rental income receivable is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Any incentive for lessees 
to enter into a lease agreement and any costs associated with entering into the lease are spread over the same period.
Sale of goods – assets, such as trading properties, development sites and completed developments, are regarded as sold upon the transfer of the 
signiﬁ cant risks and rewards of ownership to the purchaser, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. This occurs on exchange of unconditional contracts 
for the sale of the site, on satisfaction of any and all conditions on a conditional contract for the sale of the site or on completion of the contract on a 
conditional sale where those conditions are satisﬁ ed at completion. Measurements of revenue arising from the sale of such assets are derived from the 
fair value of the consideration received in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
Construction contracts – where an asset is constructed under a speciﬁ c contract with a purchaser (a “pre-sold development”) the initial sale of the 
site to that purchaser is recognised as a sale of goods in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. The construction element of the contract is treated, for the 
purposes of revenue recognition, as a construction contract in accordance with IAS 11 Construction Contracts. Revenue is recognised by reference to 
the stage of completion which is typically determined by reference to project appraisals, normally supported by independent valuation certiﬁ cates 
provided by quantity surveyors. The Company’s principal other responsibility on pre-sold developments is the identiﬁ cation of and agreement of terms 
with potential tenants of the completed building(s). The revenue recognition of this additional component of the funding agreements is considered 
separately to reﬂ ect the substance of the transaction as the rendering of services, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. The amount of revenue 
recognised is determined by reference to the percentage of the building(s) that are let. 
Investment income – revenue in respect of investment and other income represents investment income, fees and commissions earned on an 
accruals basis and the fair value of the consideration received/receivable on investments held for the short-term. Dividends are recognised when the 
shareholders’ right to receive payment has been established. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and 
the effective interest rate.
Share-based payments 
The Group provides share-based payments in the form of performance share plan awards and a share incentive plan. These payments are discussed 
in greater detail in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 56. The fair value of share-based payments related to employees’ service are 
determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the related instrument at the grant date. All share-based payment arrangements granted after 
7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2005 are recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements. The Group uses the stochastic valuation 
model and the resulting value is amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement (“Income Statement”) over the vesting period of the 
share-based payments.
For the performance share plan and share incentive plan awards, where non-market conditions apply, the expense is allocated, over the vesting period, 
to the Income Statement based on the best available estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if 
there is any indication that the number of awards expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
notes to the ﬁ nancial statements helical bar plc 2012
95 Depreciation 
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, depreciation is not provided for on freehold investment properties or on leasehold investment 
properties. The Group does not own the freehold land and buildings which it occupies. Costs incurred in respect of leasehold improvements to the 
Group’s head ofﬁ ce at 11–15 Farm Street, London W1J 5RS are capitalised and held as short-term leasehold improvements. Leasehold improvements, 
plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Residual values are reassessed annually.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets less residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the 
following basis:
Short leasehold improvements – 10% or length of lease, if shorter
Plant and equipment  – 25%
Taxation 
The taxation charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as 
adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. Tax payable upon realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the 
associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁ nancial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁ t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

and liabilities. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax proﬁ t nor the accounting proﬁ t.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁ cient 
taxable proﬁ ts will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
The deferred tax asset relating to share based payment awards reﬂ ects the estimated value of tax relief available on the vesting of the awards at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when 
the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. It is recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items 
credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
The Group recognises a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests 
in joint ventures, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisﬁ ed:
a)  the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and,
b)  it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Dividends 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the ﬁ nancial statements in the period in which dividends are approved.
Investment properties 
Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held for long-term rental income and for capital appreciation. Investment 
properties are initially recognised at cost, including associated transaction costs, and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value. These fair values 
are based on market values as determined by professionally qualiﬁ ed external valuers or are determined by the directors of the Group based on their 
knowledge of the property. In accordance with IAS 40, investment properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised ﬁ nance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are recognised as gains or losses on revaluation in the Income Statement 
of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property is treated as investment property in accordance with IAS 40. 
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property, the property remains an investment 
property measured at fair value and is not reclassiﬁ ed. Interest is capitalised before tax relief until the date of practical completion.
Details of the valuation of investment properties can be found in note 15.

96 Goodwill 
Goodwill, representing the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁ able net assets acquired, is capitalised 
and reviewed annually for impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Negative goodwill is recognised immediately 
after acquisition in the Income Statement.
Land, developments and trading properties 
Land, developments and trading properties held for sale are inventory and are included in the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to completion and estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale.
Gross borrowing costs associated with expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised. The interest 
capitalised is calculated using the Group’s weighted average cost of borrowings. Interest is capitalised from the date of commencement of the 
development work until date of practical completion. 
Investments 
Available-for-sale investments are revalued to fair value at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that losses are attributable to impairment, in which case they are recognised in the 
 Held for sale investments 
Investments are deﬁ ned as held for sale when the Group intends to sell the investment and if sale is highly probable. Such held for sale investments are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amounts immediately prior to their classiﬁ cation as held for sale and their fair value less costs to sell. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost. For the purposes of the cash ﬂ ow statement, cash and cash equivalents 
comprise cash in hand, deposits with banks, and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowing and borrowing costs 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of ﬁ nance and other costs yet to be amortised.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of new developments and investment properties are added to the costs of 
such properties until the date of completion of the development or investment. After initial recognition borrowings are carried at amortised cost. This 
treatment has been adopted since transition to IFRS.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments 
Derivative ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate caps and ﬂ oors, and forward foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risks 
arising from its activities. Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to fair value based on market prices, estimated 
future cash ﬂ ows and forward rates as appropriate. Any change in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Further information on the categorisation of ﬁ nancial instruments can be found in note 34.
Leases 
Leases are classiﬁ ed according to the substance of the transaction. A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee is classiﬁ ed as a ﬁ nance lease. All other leases are classiﬁ ed as operating leases.
In accordance with IAS 40, ﬁ nance leases of investment property are accounted for as ﬁ nance leases and recognised as an asset and an obligation to 
pay future minimum lease payments. The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet at fair value, gross of the recognised ﬁ nance lease 
liability. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and ﬁ nance charges so as to achieve a constant ﬁ nancing rate.
notes to the ﬁ nancial statements helical bar plc 2012
97 Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were 
initially recorded are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise. Exchange differences on non-monetary items are recognised 
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to the extent that they relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item which is included in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, otherwise such gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement. 
The assets and liabilities in the ﬁ nancial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Income and expenses are translated at the average rate. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in 
subsidiaries are taken directly to retained earnings in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences (including, if 
applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to the Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 
Net asset values per share 
Net asset values per share have been calculated in accordance with the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate 
Association (“EPRA”).
Earnings/(loss) per share 
Earnings/(loss) per share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and the best practice recommendations of EPRA.
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
 and reserves of the ESOP are included in the statutory headings to which they relate. Purchases and sales of own shares increase or decrease the 
book value of “Own shares held” in the Balance Sheet. At each period end the Group assesses and recognises the fair value of “Own shares held” and 
accounts for movement between book value and fair value as a reserves transfer.
Use of estimates and judgements 
To be able to prepare accounts according to the accounting principles, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset and 
liability items and revenue and expense amounts recorded in the ﬁ nancial statements. These estimates are based on historical experience and various 
other assumptions that management and the Board of Directors believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these considerations 
form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgement that may signiﬁ cantly impact on the Group’s earnings and ﬁ nancial position are:
– revenue on construction contracts where the valuation is spread over the construction period using estimates of the ﬁ nal outcome (note 2);
– valuation of investment properties, where external valuers are used to provide third party valuations (note 15);
–  recognition of share–based payments which is dependent upon the estimated number of performance share plan awards that will vest at the end of 
the performance periods (note 29);
–  calculation and assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, where it has been assumed that sufﬁ cient taxable proﬁ ts will be available in 
future periods to allow all of the assets to be recovered (note 11);
– valuation of the investment in a property developer which is based on a valuation method (note 18); and,
–  directors’ valuation of land, development and trading properties include subjective assumptions including the results of future planning decisions and 
future sales values and timings (note 21).

appendix I helical bar plc 2012 Strategic risk
Risk Mitigation/remarks Action to be taken
Group’s strategy is inconsistent with 
market conditions e.g.:
-  Asset concentration/lot size impacts on 
liquidity (e.g. if investments becomes 
difﬁ cult to sell does this affect our 
liquidity)
-  Asset concentration/mix creates 
excessive volatility in property 
revaluation movements
Management constantly monitors the Group 
strategy and changes it where market conditions 
dictate. Management team is very experienced and 
has a strong track record in the property market
Due to the small size of the Group and the 
management team, changes to the strategy can be 
effected more quickly than most other property 
companies
Inappropriate capital structure 
(i.e. too highly geared)
The group’s gearing was 90% at March 2012
The group’s gearing is constantly monitored to 
ensure that it remains within the parameters that are 
considered reasonable for the industry
Continue monitoring capital structure
Take gearing level into account when making 
business decisions
Reputational risk
Risk Mitigation/remarks Action to be taken
 Code of conduct and whistle-blowing policy 
updated in 2010
Anti-bribery policy introduced in 2011
Currently no concerns identiﬁ ed
Continue to monitor adherence to policies and 
identify any new high-risk projects
Financial risk
Risk Mitigation/remarks Action to be taken
Inability to roll over loans Good relationship with several 
established lending institutions
Maturity proﬁ le at 31 March 2012 is:
£59m maturing within 1 year
£72m maturing between 1 to 2 years
£1m maturing between 2 and 3 years
£22m maturing between 3 and 4 years
£110m maturing after 4 years
Since March 2012 £32m of loans expiring within 
one year have been renewed until 2015
Borrowing is spread between a number 
of different institutions
Agreed a £100m revolving credit facility 
with RBS until January 2017
Focus on reﬁ nancing over loans due before 
March 2013

Risk Mitigation/remarks Action to be taken
Foreign exchange risk been reduced in the year
Increase in cost of borrowing At 31 March 2012 the Group had £120m of ﬁ xed 
rate debt and interest rates caps of £125m
 Ensure that hedging % remains at an 
appropriate level
Breaching loan covenants Adherence to loan covenants are constantly 
monitored and if necessary remedial action is taken 
to cure the breach
Continue monitoring loan covenants
Insufﬁ cient liquidity to take advantage 
of opportunities
As at 31/03/12 the Group had £35m of cash, 
£38m of undrawn borrowings and £16m of 
uncharged property
Maintain overdraft facilities
Ensure that cash resources do not fall below 
currently forecast levels
Tenant default Tenant covenant strength is considered when 
making property decisions. Currently only 1 tenant 
represents more than 5% of the Group’s share of 
total rent roll
Maintain dialogue with tenants to reduce risk of 
unexpected non-payment
Ensure no over reliance on individual tenants
Loss of deposits due to banking 
counterparty failure
All deposits are held at high quality ﬁ nancial 
institutions
 Regular monitoring of ﬁ nancial institutions
Ensure that all deposits remain at well capitalised 
institutions

Inability to add to the current development 
pipeline
Experienced development team with an excellent 
track record
Good reputation in property sector

in receiving planning permission
Good relationships with planning consultants and 
local authorities
 Continue to use specialist professional advisors
Lack of demand for new property Group’s strategy is to avoid doing speculative 
developments
Continue to avoid speculative developments
Inability to ﬁ nd suitable contractors/
JV partners
Well established network of Joint Venture partners 
which it has worked with in the past

Unsolicited investment advice – warning to shareholders
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have 
received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. These are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ 
 very persistent and extremely persuasive. A 2006 survey by the Financial 
Services Authority (FSA) reported that the average amount lost by 
investors was around £20,000. It is not just the novice investor that has 
been duped in this way; many of the victims had been successfully 
investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of 
any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
reports into the company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
 involved. You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/register


from such organisations should be reported to the FSA so that this list 
can be kept up to date and any other appropriate action can be 
considered.

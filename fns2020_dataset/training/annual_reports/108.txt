Chairman’s Statement 
 
2011 has been a year of significant change, both for 888 as 
a business and in the ever-shifting landscape in which we 
operate. Changes made to the focus of the business and 
ongoing improvements to our market-leading offering, 
have helped to increase player numbers, build revenues and 
produce this excellent set of results. European regulation 
continued apace and there are a number of exciting 
initiatives in the United States seeking to regulate internet 
poker at both a federal and a state level. Which route will 
be undertaken and exactly when this will happen remains 
unclear, but the wheels are in motion and 888 is positioned 
to take advantage of any and all outcomes.
There were a number of changes to the Board and the 
senior management team in the period under review.  
Gigi Levy stepped down as CEO in April and I would like 
to thank Gigi for the contribution he made to the business 
during his tenure. The Board invited Brian Mattingley, our 
Deputy Chairman, to step into a more hands-on role within 
the business to help provide more focus on key areas of 
performance and deliver on our immediate objectives, 
following the outstanding achievements of the Group and 
his excellent performance during this period. I am delighted 
that Brian Mattingley has, in March 2012, been appointed 
as our full time Chief Executive Officer. I look forward to 
continuing to work closely with him in his new role.
It was also appropriate to undertake a review of the 
business requirements in terms of personnel and restructure 
the senior management team. As part of that restructuring, 
we appointed Itai Frieberger as Chief Operating Officer.  
Itai has a wealth of experience in the online world and 
has spent the last seven years with 888 in various senior 
management roles covering the full spectrum of disciplines 
within our Company.
After the macroeconomic shocks of the previous financial 
year and the business challenges that accompanied them, 
the operating environment for 888 improved during 2011. 
There were also a number of notable strategic achievements 
which we believe will underpin our growth in the coming 
years: the finding of suitability by the Nevada Gaming 
Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission 
in respect of our relationship with Caesars Interactive 
Entertainment (Caesars), the significant upgrade to our 
back office systems and the expansion of our agreement 
with Caesars to enter the US market when regulation is 
enacted. In addition the launch of Poker 6 which won 
industry accolades fuelled tremendous growth in our  
poker business.
We have refocused the business and, in doing so, created a 
strong and sustainable base for long-term growth.  
By continuing our customer-centric approach and offering 
innovative products and services that are both exciting and 
relevant, we expect to continue to be successful and deliver 
benefit to you, our shareholders.
Financial Results
Group revenue increased significantly by 26% to US$331 
million (2010: US$262 million) driven in the main by the B2C 
performance of casino and our stand out poker offering, 
Poker 6. EBITDA* was US$56 million (2010: US$29 million). 
As at 31 December 2011 the Group had US$82 million of cash 
and cash equivalents of which US$45 million represented 
liabilities to customers. In February 2012 the Group prepaid 
£20 million of the Wink deferred consideration to reduce 
interest costs. This resulted in a balance of £3.8 million 
payable on 21 May 2012.
We will continue to review the dividend policy with a view 
to reinstating payment of dividends as appropriate.
B2C
As part of our strategic refocus we have concentrated on 
our core product groups of Casino, Poker and Bingo.  
This includes focusing our attention on our B2C customers, 
ensuring we deliver a ‘best in class’ product, excellence in 
customer service, and a true value-for-money proposition. 
This compelling offering, supported by highly successful 
targeted marketing campaigns, has resulted in a strong 
trading performance across our B2C division.

Poker has had an exceptional year, and since the launch of 
our award-winning Poker 6 platform we have significantly 
outperformed the industry. New player recruitment in Poker 
has increased by 77% compared to last year and we now rank 
4th in the global liquidity rankings.
Casino has also enjoyed a strong performance and this year 
we have made a significant investment in our back office 
systems. In July we launched into the newly regulated Italian 
market and have already gained more than 5% market share. 
We also developed an exciting new casino product, casino 
50, which was launched in February 2012.
Whilst the bingo market is maturing we continue to focus 
on our core strengths of product innovation and promotion 
initiatives.
Dragonfish
This year has seen a change of approach as we have 
worked on fewer deals concentrating on those which are 
substantially revenue and profit enhancing.
In March 2011 we became the first ever foreign-based 
internet gaming operator to come before the Nevada 
Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission 
when, following a year long process and public hearings, 
they approved the suitability of our commercial relationship 
with Caesars. This enabled us to continue working with 
Caesars, one of America’s pre-eminent gaming groups, in 
the UK. Since the year end we have announced an extension 
of the Caesars agreement to cover the US. This is the first 
strand of our US online strategy and gives us a strong 
platform to develop the US and sign with further potential 
partners. We are amongst the first applicants for the new 
class of licence in Nevada as an internet gaming service 
provider.
In July 2011, the Italian regulated market opened for Casino 
following which we launched our own casino offering and 
the Dragonfish-powered casinos of several customers in 
that market.
Dragonfish continued to receive industry accolades and won 
two of the most prestigious awards at the eGaming Review 
B2B Awards: Poker software of the year and Bingo supplier 
of the year.
Board
At the year end one of our Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, Michael Constantine, retired from the Board.  
I would like to express on behalf of the Board and all at  
the Company our appreciation of Michael’s contribution  
to 888 for over five years. We are actively seeking new  
Non-Executive Directors with the experience and skill-set  
to help the Group continue its next phase of growth.
Outlook
2012 is set to be a year of major opportunity for 888, with 
the opening of several newly regulated markets across 
Europe and the US potential. The Group intends to invest in 
these markets in order to establish and build market share 
and, whilst the impacts of regulatory changes are difficult 
to predict, we believe that we have now created a great 
platform for the future and are confident about the Group’s 
full year prospects.

Introduction
We have enjoyed a highly successful year of trading driven 
by continuous improvements in our offering, and renewed 
focus on our core strengths, resulting in a 26% increase in 
Group revenue to US$331 million (2010: US$262 million).
2011 was about going back to basics and I have reiterated  
in this statement our refocused strategy.
From a financial perspective we delivered a record 
performance: EBITDA
*
 reached US$56 million (2010:  
US$29 million) with our EBITDA
*
 margin increasing to 
16.8% (2010: 10.9%). As at 31 December 2011 the Group had 
US$82 million of cash and cash equivalents of which US$45 
million represented liabilities to customers. On 23 February 
2012 the Group prepaid £20 million of the Wink deferred 
consideration to reduce interest costs. This resulted in a 
balance of £3.8 million payable on 21 May 2012.
As online gaming evolves, 888 continues to innovate and 
change with it. By providing players of all ability with 
a compelling offering, and promoting the offering with 
targeted marketing campaigns, we have grown our active 
B2C casino and poker customer numbers to almost half 
a million — an increase of 69% since Q4 2010. Further 
improvements are in the pipeline, and potential significant 
regulatory opportunities, leaving us very well positioned for 
the future.
Strategy
As I set out in our interim results last August, following a 
review of the business we reaffirmed our commitment to 
maximising revenues and taking the company forward.  
This strategy is made up of a number of key strands.
First, we will concentrate on our core product groups,  
which are Casino, Poker, Bingo, and to a lesser extent Sport, 
where we depend upon partners to operate a sportsbook 
in a highly competitive market. These products will be 
delivered via our B2C offering and through our Dragonfish 
to B2B clients.
Second, we will continue to focus our attention on our B2C 
customers, ensuring we deliver a ‘best in class’ product, 
excellence in customer service, and a real value-for-money 
proposition. Our back-office is a key asset of the Company 
and truly world class, ensuring maximum returns on 
investment from our marketing and customer recruitment 
campaigns, monitoring and improving lifetime value of 
our customers whilst fulfilling high standards of social and 
corporate responsibility. Moreover this is done using world 
class fraud detection, player monitoring and excellent CRM 
practices. We will continue to develop this key asset as it is 
a true competitive advantage that benefits both customers 
and clients alike.
Third, we have appraised our Dragonfish B2B contracts and 
where they were sub optimal, renegotiated or terminated 
them. We will continue to develop a pipeline of new 
opportunities which will be fewer but have a greater positive 
impact on our revenues and profit.
Fourthly, we will work to improve margins, by maximising 
operational efficiencies and driving volume and where 
necessary cutting costs. There was some impact on the 2011 
results but we have yet to see the full benefit of savings 
made to head count and other operational efficiencies. It is 
our short-term goal to return to levels of margin achieved in 
2009, and then to further improve on these.

21273-04  04/04/2012 Proof 17
Finally, it is a clear strategic imperative that we concentrate 
on locally regulated markets. We view these markets in three 
specific categories which have individual characteristics:
● ● Implementational — For example, in Italy and France, 
where regulation has been introduced and we have 
already commenced trading.
● ● Formational — As in Spain where governments have 
announced regulation and are working towards a 
framework. Here we will decide on a trading strategy, 
start dialogue with local partners either for B2C or B2B 
tie- ups, and lobby governments in an attempt to assist 
in shaping the framework.
● ● Developmental — Where there is a strong indication 
that at some time in the near future, the market will 
open. Here we talk to local enterprise with a view to 
forming partnerships with whom we can jointly explore 
opportunities and attempt to influence the regulatory 
framework; currently we are focusing primarily on 
the USA.
We have already delivered against and realised the benefit 
of this renewed focus. Our focus on driving key product 
areas has significantly increased player sign-ups leading 
to significant growth in volumes. We will continue to focus 
on maximizing the potential of our existing core offering 
augmented with innovations in both product and customer 
interaction and service.
B2C
The B2C offering remains our core area, and the bedrock of 
the success of the business. Performance across the offering 
has been excellent in 2011, with revenue up 28% to US$284 
million (2010: US$222 million), as a result of our focused 
investment in order to provide the best possible customer 
experience, and improved and targeted marketing. We have 
pursued a volume-led strategy, aimed at attracting a large 
number of players through providing an entertaining and 
accessible platform on which customers enjoy playing. The 
strategy has lead to Customer lifetime value preserved over 
time with retention programmes performing well, so that 
churn rate is lower than it has been in the past.
2011 was a phenomenal year for 888’s poker business with 
revenue increasing 58% to US$61 million (2010: US$38 
million). Our Poker 6 platform has transformed our poker 
network and we have risen from 13th to 4th in the global 
liquidity rankings in little over 12 months. In Q4 alone the 
number of active poker customers increased by 58%.
The Poker 6 network is carefully managed. We aim to attract 
players in to enjoy the game which has a more recreational 
feel with players placing smaller initial stakes. We have 
worked hard over the last year on the software suite which 
is dedicated to targeted marketing — almost targeting 
players individually with specific incentives and promotions, 
and we are now reaping the benefits of that investment.
In Casino this ‘smart marketing’ also worked for us, with 
revenues up 27% to US$148 million (2010: US$117 million). 
The success of Casino has been driven both by the highly 
successful marketing campaigns and significant back-
office improvements. Our efforts were recognised with 888 
winning Best Online Casino of the Year at the ICE Totally 
Gaming Awards. 888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

21273-04  04/04/2012 Proof 17
As I said above a key focus for us is newly regulated 
markets. Our fully localised Casino helps penetration into 
new markets. We launched into the Italian market in July, 
with more than 30 games, and with the introduction of the 
first live casino in Italy — Live Dealer on 888. Initial trading 
has been encouraging and we have already achieved more 
than 5% market share.
We have just launched a new Casino offering, a state-of-
the-art platform similar to Poker 6, with a number of new 
features, and we will continue to invest in functionality, 
customisation and localisation of features such as payment 
methods.
Bingo is becoming a mature market but we continue to 
hold our own. We added 15 new Instant Games on our 
Bingo platform including a number of global brands. We 
will continue to invest in new features such as progressive 
jackpots, new games and Mini Games to keep the platform 
refreshed and relevant.
888sport, while relatively small, is an important part of the 
customer offering, particularly around significant sporting 
events which in 2012 will be dominated by the London 
Olympics and football’s Euro 2012.
Dragonfish
This year we undertook a widespread appraisal of the 
Dragonfish business — reviewing existing contracts and 
evaluating the right deals to pursue. Revenue was up 16% 
at US$47 million (2010: US$40 million). As a result we 
also have a more profitable B2B business by successfully 
renegotiating and terminating suboptimal contracts.
The most significant step this year was the Nevada Gaming 
Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission 
voting unanimously to grant a finding of suitability of 
the commercial agreement between Caesars Interactive 
Entertainment and Dragonfish. This finding, which was 
the result of a rigorous and lengthy process of scrutiny, 
underlines the integrity, sophistication and professionalism 
that the Company maintains as its core tenets of its 
business model.
After the period ended we announced an extension of our 
agreement with Caesars into the US — the first strand of 
our US strategy. Dragonfish is now in a very strong position 
to explore the potential of the US market. We have a strong 
platform to roll out our cutting edge, turnkey solution to 
other potential partners as the market opens.
People
It’s not just the offering that makes 888 stand out, it is our 
people. I am a true believer in teamwork and we have a 
fantastic team of people working at 888. There is no doubt 
we have some of the most gifted technological staff in 
the industry. I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
everyone for their hard work this year. The more I get to 
know the employees, the more impressed I am with their 
enthusiasm and commitment to the business. It is their 
drive, innovation and effectiveness that has helped deliver 
such a successful year.
Regulation
Regulation of online gaming continued to present both 
opportunities and challenges to the Group during 2011, 
and this is likely to be the case during 2012. A growing 
number of jurisdictions (most notably in Europe) have 
adopted legislation regulating the Group’s business, often 
in widely divergent manners. While regulation in various 
jurisdictions has the effect of providing legal certainty, 
contributing to stability and bolstering the long-term 
value of the Group’s various markets, it is also inevitably 
accompanied by the burden of local taxation and costly 
compliance requirements. The Group continues to remain 
actively engaged in regulatory developments worldwide and 
continues to seek opportunities for growth presented by 
regulation while facing the accompanying challenges.
Chief Executive's Review 
  www.888holdingsplc.com

21273-04  04/04/2012 Proof 17
Two notable regulatory developments that are likely to 
have a significant impact on the Group during 2012 are the 
possible reform of the UK online gaming regime (with the 
imposition of UK gaming duty on foreign operators) and the 
emergence of a US online poker market (initially in Nevada, 
where the Group continues to pioneer the developing online 
market). 888 is investing effort to averting or minimise the 
potentially adverse impact of a UK reform, taking all steps to 
maximise the benefit of the potential for growth presented 
by a regulated US online poker market.
Responsible Gaming
As a global leader in online gaming entertainment, 888 is 
committed to a pro-active policy of corporate and social 
responsibility. Conducting our business responsibly is 
fundamental to our future success and the sustainability 
of our business. Our values place the community and 
the customer at the centre of our endeavours. We are 
constantly exploring new and innovative ways to create 
a caring, responsible gaming environment and to ensure 
under age, addictive or other inappropriate customers 
are unable to access our gaming sites. We work closely 
with organisations such as GamCare and Gambling 
Therapy to enhance the training of our customers support 
representatives.
Current Trading and Outlook
2011 marked a new chapter in 888’s history. We have 
realigned the business to focus on its core strengths under 
a team that is steeped in online gaming. We are more than 
ready to take advantage of liberalisation in the industry and 
we are well positioned to achieve first mover advantage.  
We have a unique position in the US to allow the launch of a 
real money offering promptly in either federal or state based 
once regulation is finalized by gaming authorities.  
Our markets are changing and evolving and we are moving fast 
to ensure we continue to innovate and expand our horizons.
While market liberalisation offers new growth opportunities 
for regulated businesses such as ours it also means 
investment in marketing to position the brand and acquire 
customers. We will continue to invest in regulated markets 
to secure our future for the long term.
We continue to exceed our customers’ expectations both 
in terms of offering and service. We will continue to pursue 
our strategy of focusing on recreational players and as well 
as major product enhancements during the year, such as 
the launch of our new Casino offering, we will focus on the 
continuous improvement of the customer experience at 
every point.

Expenses
Geographical Segmentation
888’s turnover by geography is set out in the table below. 
Growth was achieved in each of the geographies and UK 
still remains our largest market with 46% of total revenues 
(2010: 49%). Revenue generated in Europe excluding UK has 
also increased this year by 28% driven primarily by poker 
and casino.
1  Excluding depreciation of US$9 million (2010: US$8.5 million), amortisation of US$4 million (2010: US$ 3.8 million) and restructuring costs of 
US$1 million (2010: US$1.2 million).
Over the last twelve months, we have continued to invest in 
our platforms and our offering as well as investing in newly 
regulated markets.
Operating expenses
1
, which include mainly employment 
costs and volume-driven expenses such as chargebacks and 
payment service providers’ commissions, totalled $109 million 
(2010: US$97 million) representing a lower proportion to 
revenue of 33% compared to 37% in 2010. Chargebacks ratio 
remained stable at 1.0% (2010: 1.1%) and PSP commissions 
ratio increased slightly to 5.9% (2010: 5.5%) as a result of the 
inclusion of the Mytopia business for the entire year which 
incurs a higher cost proportion than the core business.
Research and development expenses increased in 2011 
to $30 million (2010: $22 million) as we invested in our 
technological platform and in product adaptation to 
regulated markets. Nevertheless this expense remained at a 
stable ratio to revenue, at 9.0% (2010: 8.3%).
Gaming duties incurred during the year were US$7 million 
(2010: US$1 million), primarily in respect of the activities in 
Spain during the second half of the year and Italy from Q4.
Marketing expenses during the year were US$102 million 
(2010: US$92 million). This was a result of an increased 
number of high-profile campaigns aimed to drive record 
numbers of players to our new offerings. Despite the 
increase in marketing spend, marketing ratio reduced to 31% 
in 2011 compared to 35% in 2010, demonstrating enhanced 
marketing efficiency. 888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

In 2011, the Group continued to focus on attracting and 
retaining customers and optimising the recruitment channel 
to cost. During the year, 888’s marketing team recruited 
more than 330,000 new Casino and Poker first time 
depositors (“FTDs”).
Administrative expenses
1
 increased to US$28 million (2010: 
US$22 million). This increase is primarily associated with 
professional expenses arising from regulated markets and 
the refocusing of the B2B business.
Impairment Review — Mytopia
Given the financial performance of Mytopia, the social 
games development business acquired in 2010, a prudent 
accounting decision was taken to fully impair the Mytopia 
goodwill which has resulted in a full impairment charge of 
US$20.7 million.
Share Benefit Charges
Share benefit charges were US$2.9 million (2010: US$2.3 
million). The increase was primarily a result of US$0.5 million 
of accelerated share benefit charges arising on termination 
following the departure of the former Chief executive on 30 
April 2011.
Finance Income
Given the low interest rate environment net interest income 
was US$0.2 million (2010: US$0.2 million).
Finance Expenses
Finance expenses during the year totalled US$13.3 million 
(2010: US$1.5 million). This amount comprises (a) US$3.7 
million (2010: nil) interest paid to the Wink bingo vendors 
in relation to the deferred consideration, (b) US$3.7 million 
(2010: US$1.1 million) a non cash charge representing the 
difference between the discounted present value and future 
nominal value of the Wink deferred consideration, (c) US$1.6 
million (2010: nil) representing fair value adjustment in 
respect of the open forward contract entered into in 2011 
in order to hedge the Sterling denominated Wink deferred 
consideration following the March 2011 agreement and (d) 
US$4.3 million (2010: US$0.3 million) representing the result 
of closing forward contracts entered into during the year 
aimed to hedge costs which are not denominated in US$ 
(such as ILS, Euro and Sterling) and revaluation of various 
balance sheet assets which are not denominated in US$.
EBITDa
EBITDA
2
 reached a record US$56 million (2010: US$29 
million) representing an increase of 94%. EBITDA
2
 margin 
increased significantly to 16.8% from 10.9% in 2010.
Taxation
The tax charge for 2011 was US$3.9 million (2010: US$2.7 
million) reflecting the Group’s efficient tax position. Out 
of this amount US$0.9 million (2010: nil) was payable in 
respect of the new corporation tax in Gibraltar.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share was 0.6¢ in 2011 (2010: 2.3¢). 
Adjusted basic earnings per share excluding share benefit 
charges, restructuring costs, impairment charges and release 
of contingent consideration better reflects the underlying 
performance of the business and assists in providing a 
clearer view of the performance of the Group. Adjusted basic 
earnings per share was 7.4¢ in 2011 (2010: 3.6¢).
Dividend
Given our cash requirements we did not pay a dividend 
in 2011. However we will continue to review the dividend 
policy with a view to reinstate payment of dividends as 
appropriate.
Cash Flow
The Group’s profitability during the year was matched 
by strong cash generation with net cash generated from 
operating activities reaching US$79 million (2010: US$16 
million). This surplus cash was used primarily to pay Wink 
and Mytopia earn-outs at US$ 40 million and US$6 million 
respectively.
Balance Sheet
The Group’s cash position as at 31 December 2011 was 
US$82 million (31 December 2010: US$62 million). Liabilities 
owed to customers were US$45 million (2010: US$35 
million). This increase reflects the natural healthy growth 
of the business in terms of customer numbers and revenue 
during 2011.

B2C
888 is a global gaming entertainment destination, with 
localised offerings providing players the games they want in 
the language they speak. The 888 gaming experience is now 
available in a total of 19 languages to over 150 countries.
Casino
888’s casino offering is a significant growth driver for the 
business, and has benefited from ongoing improvements 
in the customer experience and successful marketing to 
deliver record results.
Our focus has been on player acquisition, and we have been 
very successful in this area. By continuing to offer the best 
possible online gaming experience, we aim to continue to 
drive record player numbers and revenues, while building 
brand loyalty and successfully increasing lifetime value as 
we go forward.
A key way to build this loyalty is by ensuring that the 888 
offering remains at the forefront of the online gaming 
experience. To do so means continuously providing new 
content and innovative ways of playing the games that 
customers want.
The ever-growing portfolio of top notch games offered was 
bolstered through the addition of more than two dozen 
third party games to our suite of casino products. Dedicated 
teams were built to make integration more streamlined as 
we start to release more games into the market. 
Optimisation of the Live platform has seen the introduction of 
additional tables for high rollers and VIPs, more types of games 
(London Roulette with UK dealers, Venetian Roulette with 
Italian dealers, Auto roulette) and an enhanced user interface.
A key focus continues to be newly regulated markets, and 
our fully localised casino helps penetration into these new 
markets. In August, 888 launched in the Italian market, with 
more than 30 games that passed certification by the Italian 
regulator. The introduction of Live Dealer on 888.it was  
the first live casino in Italy. Following increased marketing 
spend in Italy, 888 now enjoys market share of over 5%.  
In 2012, 888 will look to build on this position in Italy, while 
also opening in Spain, which has the potential to be a 
significant market, and a licence has also been applied for to 
offer online gaming in the smaller Danish market.
The first quarter of 2012 saw the launch of our revamped 
casino offering, Casino 50, which reconstructs the casino 
platform to provide an industry leading casino product. 
Utilising state-of-the-art web and design technology, the 
new 888casino software is simpler and faster than ever 
before. From easy tab-based navigation, to opening multiple 
games in parallel, 888casino provides a sleek, smooth 
transition which now includes a higher screen resolution 
and allows a perfect platform for crisp, vibrant graphics 
and clear wide & HD screen viewing. With personalisation 
at the heart of the new design, 888casino allows players to 
create the lobby of their choice and create shortcuts to their 
favourite games. The intuitive features of the new 888casino 
adapt to each individual player, allowing players to play 
online casino ‘their way’.

In addition, 888 has also entered into the mobile gaming 
sector with the launch of our first Android application 
for 888roulette, and further mobile opportunities are in 
development.
The success of the 888casino platform was publicly 
acknowledged, with 888 winning Best Online Casino  
of the Year at the ICE Totally Gaming Awards.
Poker
Poker has had an exceptional year, achieving significant 
growth despite a declining online poker market through 
effectively pursuing our strategy of focusing on recreational 
players. The launch of Poker 6 in June 2010 has been 
transformational, and we have reaped the rewards across 2011.
888’s poker offering is now an accepted industry leader. 
With an intuitive usability that targets the casual player,  
and innovative features that appeal to a broad demographic, 
the increase in number of active customers in 888poker led 
the industry in 2011. With 318,000 active customers in Q4, 
this has moved 888poker up to fourth, from thirteenth,  
in the public liquidity rankings.
This surge in activity has been the result of constant 
investment in our poker strategy to build a platform that 
appeals to players of all abilities. 888 has developed a 
diverse network in which players can enjoy the game 
regardless of skill level and offers customized promotions 
and communications targeted for every stage of a 
player's journey. This leads to higher player retention and, 
in turn, increased lifetime value. Poker 6 is a technically 
sophisticated product that can manage a host of activities: 
matching marketing campaigns; monitoring product 
performance and delivering bespoke customer interfaces.
We are continually improving our poker offering, and during 
the year, we introduced some additional innovative features. 
These included PokerCam, a feature that allow players to 
interact via webcam while playing on the 888poker tables, 
and more social features, such as Team-Play and Private 
Games (where players can personalize their own private 
poker games and invite their friends to join the game).
The success of 888poker was recognised at awards 
ceremonies, with 888 being awarded the 2011 Poker 
Operator of the Year at the eGaming Review Awards,  
and 888poker being named Best Online Gaming Product  
of the Year at the ICE Totally Gaming Awards.
Bingo
It has been a challenging year for 888bingo. The market is 
maturing and is highly competitive. Nonetheless, we saw 
year on year improvement, as 888 continues to provide 
our customers with a first class offering, including regular 
promotions, attractive prizes and a host of interactive features.
Instant games remain a key revenue stream, dramatically 
enhancing the gaming experience, customer retention and 
yield. These were embellished throughout 2011 with more than 
a dozen new Instant Games launched on the Bingo platform. 
Games include brands such as ‘Roland Rat’, progressive 
jackpots games and Mini Games.
Other notable features introduced throughout the year 
included enhanced ‘Invite a Friend’ capabilities — whereby 
friends from Facebook, Gmail, Hotmail and social networks  
can be invited to join games — and Side Bets — enabling bingo 
players to place a bet on an event that will happen during  
a Bingo game.

We will continue to launch innovative new products, 
and look for new ways to bring new customers to the 
business. In partnership with Endemol, Big Brother Bingo 
was exclusively launched in the UK at the end of 2011 to 
take advantage of the high-profile Celebrity Big Brother 
series. The performance of this product has been very 
encouraging, with promotions for exclusive Big Brother 
prizes including behind-the-scenes access, task props & VIP 
passes to eviction nights attracting new customer numbers.
Sport
888sports is a small percentage of our total business, but 
is nevertheless important for our customers, particularly at 
the time of significant sporting events, and we will continue 
to invest in this offering in order to drive more revenue and 
improve margins.
In 2011, the focus was on retaining those high value 
customers that have been acquired during recent high-
profile events, and in promoting Casino and Poker to our 
888sports customers via the ability to share wallet across 
888’s core platforms.
Following prominent and successful marketing campaigns, 
the business grew year on year — this is especially pleasing 
as 2010 saw the impact of the FIFA World Cup. With both 
the London Olympics and football’s Euro 2012 taking place 
in the summer and offering significant opportunity for 
growth, marketing activities are being prepared to take 
advantage of these major events. 888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

21273-04  04/04/2012 Proof 17
Marketing and Promotions
The 888 offering provides something for players of all 
abilities and requirements, and our marketing suite identifies 
the best way to target people with the offering that will be 
of most interest to them.
A significant area of investment in 2011 was in back-office 
systems. 888’s marketing suite is now amongst the best 
in the business, and allows us to better target offers and 
promotions. This helped boost conversion ratios and 
allowed marketing campaigns to be more focused. In turn, 
campaigns such as Free Spin and Millionaire were highly 
successful. 
888poker is a different type of destination, and the 
communication of this has been integral to the surge in 
numbers over 2011. Our marketing campaigns reflect the 
focus of our offering, with our Poker advertising targeted 
at the casual player and emphasising the enjoyment factor. 
Shane Warne continues to successfully front our campaigns 
in several parts of the world, and has helped us to begin 
to build on an Ambassador-led marketing strategy as we 
enter into new markets. Using prominent sports players and 
celebrities rather than professional poker players as the face 
of our campaigns presents our brand to a larger audience 
and reinforces 888poker as a recreational, fun destination. 
Our advertisement campaigns and marketing in 2012 
will continue to build on the positioning slogan, ‘We Play 
Different’, as we continue to offer players an entertaining 
poker experience that is unique from our competitors' and 
enjoyable for all players.
In 2011, 888casino executed a very successful marketing 
campaign across several markets, focusing on 365 spins 
to win a million dollar jackpot. To continue to capitalise 
on this success, campaigns in 2012 will continue to build 
strong brand awareness of 888casino as a leading casino 
where players can win big and have fun. With the support 
of innovative, personalised software and a continually 
improving customer communication protocol, customer 
acquisition from these campaigns should see optimum 
conversion with increased player values and retention.
Consistent with our strategy, we continued to invest heavily 
in marketing. Marketing spend in 2011 was larger in absolute 
terms than in 2010, but equalled only 31% of revenue 
compared to 35% in 2010. As our marketing improves and 
becomes more intelligent and targeted, we are achieving dollar 
for dollar growth in terms of marketing spend year on year.
Customer Relationship Management
Strong customer relationships are the bedrock of our 
success. Whilst eye-catching promotions help to drive 
customer acquisition, customer retention comes from 
engendering loyalty through building bonds with players. 
This leads to people playing more games, more often, for 
more time.
888’s ongoing commitment to localisation strengthens 
relationships worldwide through speaking to people in their 
language and culture, while the market-leading usage of 
social features and interactivity with players strengthens 
brand loyalty.
As the back-office suite improves, and allows all players to 
use a personalised product, with promotions targeted to 
their requirements, churn rate has reduced across 2011.
Search Engine Optimisation (‘SEO’)
The specialist Search and Web Optimisation Technologies 
(‘SWOT’) team continue to give 888’s websites prominence 
on worldwide search engines, maximising the impact of the 
product offering. Successful use of SWOT has helped to 
drive players to 888 brands, helping customer acquisition 
and ongoing growth.
2012 Focus
We will continue to focus on our core strengths, and build 
on the excellent results achieved in 2011. Following the 
success of Poker 6, our new Casino offering has significant 
potential, and we will invest across our product line in order 
to provide players with cutting-edge games and innovative 
ways in which to play them.
Targeted marketing campaigns will support our products, 
with the aim of attracting and retaining customers, growing 
lifetime value and reducing churn rate. We will also explore 
innovative avenues and ways to play on 888 gaming 
platforms in order to drive growth.

Dragonfish
Dragonfish, 888’s standalone-business to business arm, 
continues to offer clients a best in class Total Gaming 
Services solution. The quality of the offering, coupled with 
a renewed focus has given us a strong position in which to 
enter newly regulating jurisdictions.
In 2011, Dragonfish successfully launched CasinoFlex in Italy 
in conjunction with some of the most popular established 
online Italian brands, and focused on future regulated US 
markets by entering discussions with major US partners. In 
January 2012, Dragonfish extended its deal with Caesars 
Interactive Entertainment to include the US.
Dragonfish further undertook a widespread appraisal of all 
its contracts, and looked to renegotiate or terminate deals 
that did not have the desired effect on the bottom line. The 
pipeline of new opportunities continues to develop towards 
deals that are more enhancing to revenue and profit.
The strength of the offering, coupled with increased 
marketing efforts by our partners, helped drive revenue up 
16% to a record US$47 million.
We were delighted to see Dragonfish’s position as a leading 
B2B provider recognised through the awarding of two of the 
most prestigious awards at the eGaming Review 2011 B2B 
Awards — Poker Software of the Year and Bingo Supplier  
of the Year.
The Total Gaming Services Offering
New entrants to the online gaming market require 
diverse gaming content delivered over a high performing 
technology platform, operational expertise and, above all, 
knowledge of how to leverage their assets and target the 
gaming consumer.
The state-of-the-art Poker 6 platform provides a contemporary 
look and feel for poker clients, with enhanced usability, 
functionality and playability on the tables. The platform is 
a proven success, and has been a driving force behind the 
exceptional performance of 888’s global poker offering.
The casino offering continues to reflect 888’s 14 years 
of experience as a leading online casino operator. This 
enables Dragonfish to provide a suite of games that 
helps its partners’ casino brands appeal to beginners and 
experts alike through the provision of a vast range of 
games, a user-friendly casino lobby with intuitive buttons 
for communicating promotions, tutorials, 24/7 customer 
help, wins and bonuses. In 2011, the successful launch of 
the CasinoFlex modular product specifically designed for 
regulated markets, allowed partners to choose to operate 
their own back-office under their own licence.
The bingo platform achieved an important milestone in 
2011, with the launch of the BingoFlex Modular Platform 
providing full integration with partners’ back-office systems. 
The new platform enables the offering of individual platform 
components to potential partners, and thus significantly 
strengthens the Bingo sales proposition by creating a 
broader spectrum of potential partners.

Regulated Markets
Choosing the right partner is critical for success in 
regulated markets, and Dragonfish offers flexible best-
of-breed solutions that have been rigorously tested to 
meet the regulatory requirements across the international 
jurisdictions, such as Italy and Spain. We have developed 
a methodology which drives our solutions for regulated 
markets: tracking the new laws through drafting and 
publication, adapting, testing and certifying our products 
and operations in parallel to the first new licences being 
issued. We also have the strength and depth to spread 
our focus across multiple jurisdictions so we maintain our 
leading position in all the largest markets as the regulations 
take effect. This means that Dragonfish licencees are first 
in line to receive their eGaming licences in newly regulated 
territories.
We have also adapted our products to meet the new 
tax requirements of each market. We provide integral 
tax-compliant acquisition and retention tools, bonuses 
and cross-selling that maximise cost-effectiveness for 
our partners while increasing the Lifetime Values of their 
players.
Our track record is second to none and we have already 
clocked up invaluable experience launching hundreds of 
brands on our regulated gaming solutions.
888 is well placed to continue harnessing the many 
opportunities that the changing regulatory environment 
will bring. Our reputation as a trusted, leading international 
operator was demonstrated in March 2011, with the Nevada 
Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission 
suitability finding for the commercial relationship between 
Caesars Interactive Entertainment and Dragonfish. This, the 
first deal ever approved between a state-licenced gaming 
company and a foreign-based Internet gaming operator, 
was a significant development enabling us to continue to 
work with Caesars to offer support for its UK product.
The partnership with Caesars already covered a real-money 
World Series of Poker Casino offering to the UK market and 
a World Series of Poker Free Play Poker site in the United 
States.
More significantly, in January 2012, the partnership was 
extended into the United States. The first strand of 888’s 
US strategy, the agreement will allow the launch of a real 
money offering as soon as either Federal or state based 
regulation is finalised, upon licencing by gaming authorities.
Dragonfish is in pole position for the US market, and we 
have a strong platform on which to roll out our cutting 
edge, turnkey solutions to other potential partners as the 
market opens.
Another notable market in which Dragonfish is well 
positioned is Italy. Following certification of 888 products 
by the Amministrazione Autonoma dei Monopoli di Stato 
(AAMS), the Italian regulatory authority, we launched 
our Casino offering into the Italian market in August. The 
Dragonfish Italian casino offering includes both Download 
and No-Download (Instant Play) clients, with a customized 
and enhanced proposition presenting the Italian player with 
the most compelling and engaging gaming experience in 
the regulated market.
2012 Focus
Dragonfish will continue to focus on leveraging new 
opportunities in significant newly regulating markets, 
focusing on utilising the compelling offering to sign 
agreements that will enhance revenue and profit.

TECHnOl OGICal InFR a STRuCTuRE
888’s success is built on the strength of its technological 
infrastructure, which provides the platform for the cutting-
edge innovation for which we are renowned. The cutting-
edge offering provided for our players, including the ground-
breaking Poker 6, is all a result of the behind-the-scenes 
expertise that is at the heart of 888.
The right technology for regulated markets
Having the right technology is crucial to operating in newly 
regulated markets, as the platform must be tailored to 
conform to all specific requirements. During H2 2011, 888 
launched a regulated Casino offering in Italy, both for B2C 
(888.it) and for B2B partners. In Q4, our platform was 
adjusted to support Gibraltar AML regulation for the .com 
brands.
The ability to quickly make changes to our platform, while 
also ensuring that the customer experience remains at the 
cutting edge of online gaming, stands us in good stead to 
gain market share as new geographies are regulated. Based 
on the changes we made to our gaming systems to comply 
with Italian regulations, in 2012 we will adjust the platform in 
order to launch in Spain.
Subject to successful conclusion of the licencing process 
in Nevada, tentatively expected in 2012, we are perfectly 
positioned with the required infrastructure and platform 
changes in order to launch.
The right technology for our customers
The record numbers of concurrent users on 888 sites in 2011 
demonstrate the robustness of our platform. Preparations 
to serve these incoming users began in Q2, and over the 
course of 2011 the data center was redesigned to improve 
the availability of the network infrastructure in the server 
room and allow for faster installations of new hardware. 
The networking hardware was also reconfigured to improve 
availability and network stability. This was done smoothly and 
ensured that all IT operating parameters were maintained.
The backup software and hardware were also upgraded to 
support the increasing size of data, reduce backup window 
time frame and improve data retention. The updated systems 
and procedures were awarded level 1 PCI Certification in the 
yearly audit performed by the Qualified Security Assessors.
The successful updating of systems meant all service 
level agreement performance parameters were met and 
surpassed.
Other notable improvements to 888’s back-office systems  
in 2011 included:
● ● Unified Offering Infrastructure: During 2011, B2C casino, 
poker and sport brands were transferred to the new 
unified offering infrastructure, which includes support  
of the new bonus structure.
  In addition, the “My Account” site was launched, which 
includes tabs on bonuses and personal details to ensure 
that all customers are able to easily manage their 888 
accounts. More content will be added to this site during 
2012.
● ● Gaming Infrastructure Improvements: In order to support 
the growing load on our gaming infrastructure caused 
by the significant increase in player numbers, steps were 
taken in order to improve performance and enable a 
more robust and stable platform.
● ● Registration Process Improvements: Optimising the 
usability of the registration process can be a major boost 
to 888, through maximizing the number of deposits 
made from visitors to the site. In 2011, we introduced an 
enhanced registration form with, amongst other things, 
an improved look and feel, more meaningful validations, 
and new password length requirements for increased 
security.
● ● Real Time Segmentation (Queue Manager 
Improvements): During 2011, we added new abilities to 
the Queue Manager tool including the ability to retrieve 
population data based on data mining models, and 
the ability to perform automatic actions (in addition to 
manual actions that are already supported).
● ● Affiliate System Improvements: A number of 
improvements to 888's internal Affiliates System were 
introduced during 2011, supporting the growing number 
of affiliates, enhancing reporting capabilities and 
optimising the billing process. 888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

unique Casino Games
An essential part of 888’s strategy is its focus on the player 
experience. To fulfil this goal a new robust gaming platform 
— the Generic Gaming Platform or GGP was introduced.
888’s GGP offers a simple way to develop or integrate 
Casino games. It is built over existing infrastructure and 
back-office systems and contains a number of games 
engines: core Casino games (like Blackjack and Roulette) 
as well as unique Video Slots. 888 plans to utilise this 
platform to offer unique games in parallel to the already 
well-established games integration channel via the 888 
Integration Platform.
During 2011, a new French Roulette and American Roulette 
was launched over the GGP and we are planning to add a 
number of additional games and unique features during 2012.
GGP supports Flash games, and also new technologies such 
as HTML5. This enables 888Casino to deliver and integrate 
games easily on mobile platforms.
ePayments
The comprehensive Total Payment Services offering 
includes payment processing tailored for local markets, 
fully managed fraud detection and prevention services, and 
customer support.
The ability for players to deposit and withdraw in their local 
currency via their preferred payment option is key to 888’s 
personalisation and localisation of the products offered. In 
2011 we introduced new currencies and seven new payment 
options in key countries.
Fraud prevention was also bolstered through the addition 
of major tools including 3D Secure Code (offered as Verified 
by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode to Visa and MasterCard 
card users respectively), and the payment platform was 
amended to be compliant with those jurisdictions in which  
a new regulatory regime was introduced.
Introducing new features and capabilities in the payment 
platform helped us to better convert customers in the 
cashier. These capabilities allow much shorter login time to 
the system from all over the world, and much more effective 
and reliable ways to process payments.

Customer Relationship Management
Strong customer relationships are the bedrock of 888’s 
success, and the Group remains committed to its goal  
of providing the best customer support and service in the 
global online gaming industry.
First class customer support is offered for each of the 
Group’s brands and White Labels via telephone, e-mail 
and chat to customers around the world, in 10 different 
languages. 888’s ongoing commitment to localisation 
strengthens relationships worldwide, through speaking to 
people in their language and cultural context, while the 
market-leading usage of social features and interactivity 
with players strengthens brand loyalty.
The launch of 888.it, a tailor-made product for the newly 
regulated Italian market, in August 2011, marked a milestone 
for 888. To support this venture, a wholly new customer 
support team was recruited and trained to, for the first time, 
handle all aspects of the operation; successfully establishing 
a range of new processes and procedures.
In 2011, 888’s support teams, on average, converted 20% 
of all incoming phone calls and 10% of relevant incoming 
chats to deposits; maintaining this convenient service to 
players and continuing to benefit the business. We see 
the forthcoming expansion of live telephone and chat 
deposit capabilities to our Bingo customers as exciting new 
developments. This feature was launched as a pilot project 
at the end of 2011 and is expected to boost revenues and 
open new marketing opportunities.
The Telemarketing and Proactive Chat Department 
continued to deliver excellent performance as measured 
by the deposits generated by interaction with customers. 
The Department has increased its performance for the 
third successive year in all three key metrics — efficiency, 
productivity and revenue generated.
The implementation of an easy-to-use newly customised 
layout, and improved design of the Online Web Self-Service 
tool, along with the continual evaluation and refinement 
of content, resulted in an increased usage of this tool by 
customers. Improvements helped to reduce customer 
issues while increasing people’s ability to find answers to 
their queries themselves, enabling 888 to further reduce its 
operational expenditure, improve agent efficiency and more 
effectively manage its resources.

As a result of well-received amendments to our offering,  
the overall volume of queries coming in to our support 
centres decreased by 6% in 2011. This result is especially 
pleasing as it was achieved despite the significant increase 
in active casino and poker customers and despite a 20% 
increase in B2B Bingo contact volumes.
Total contact volumes handled at our Support 
Centres — all B2C/B2B Brands and languages:
2010 contacts handled via phone, e-mail and chat:  960,095
2011 contacts handled via phone, e-mail and chat: 900,741
The main Gibraltar contact centre focuses on providing 
support for 888’s principal markets in Europe, Asia Pacific 
and Latin America, while the Antiguan contact centre focuses 
on supporting the English speaking markets in Europe, 
Australia, Asia Pacific and Canada. The fully established 
contact centre in Romania is providing mainly telemarketing 
and proactive chat activities in several languages for 888  
and Dragonfish.
Support teams in all operational locations aim to close the 
majority of issues during the first contact, as exemplified in 
the Service Level Achievement reached in 2011. Throughout 
the year, we further improved the handling of customer 
interactions by prioritising inbound queries according to 
customer statuses and specified business priorities.
Customer Satisfaction
888 monitors customer satisfaction at key points 
throughout their lifetime cycle in order to assist 
stakeholders in the Group to identify and understand habits 
and expectations of loyal players, as well as to design 
service initiatives and ongoing refresher training based on 
the results.
In 2011, the customary annual study conducted to 
benchmark 888’s service level within its primary markets 
included English, German and Spanish speaking casino and 
poker players, as well as English speaking sport customers. 
888 is pleased that, for the third year running, respondents 
from our main language markets gave their highest rating to 
the level of professionalism of our support representatives.
The survey also sought insight into customer awareness and 
usage of the Online Self-Help facility available to English, 
German and Spanish customers. In 2011, 80% of respondents 
were aware of the Online Web Self-Service tool vs. 73% in 
2010. 71% of customers who are aware of the tool reported 
using it.
Review forums, customer surveys and feedback analysis 
assisted in the continual evaluation and refinement of the 
Online Help content. In 2012, we plan to enhance the visual 
representations of supplied information to reduce textual 
materials, adapting to customer needs and increasing  
user satisfaction.

The regulatory framework governing online gaming in 
different countries around the world remains as dynamic 
and rapidly evolving as ever. While some jurisdictions 
have moved to curtail the activities of online gaming 
sites, many others (including many European jurisdictions 
and even some US states) are currently contemplating 
liberalisation and regulation of the industry, and several have 
already taken this route. The Group remains committed to 
monitoring closely and addressing regulatory changes as 
they occur, and to fostering, so far as possible, the trend 
towards liberalisation and regulation of online gaming 
throughout the world.
Eu
As the hopes for pan-European harmonization of online 
gaming laws waned during 2011, a growing number of EU 
Member States have introduced (or are in the process of 
introducing) local legislation governing the offering of online 
gaming. Several EU Member States are either contemplating 
or have already put in place, a liberalised (or partially 
liberalised) gaming regime: The UK, France, Italy, Spain, 
Denmark, Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Romania and 
others have already adopted a regulatory regime governing 
online gaming. Other EU Member States, including Ireland, 
Germany, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, and Sweden are also 
considering (or are already in the process of) revising their 
gaming laws, possibly to include liberalization of the online 
gaming market. The proliferation of varying regulatory 
regimes throughout the EU Internal Market has inevitably 
resulted in increased regulatory constraints and compliance 
challenges impacting the Group’s European business.
In March 2011, the European Commission published a long-
awaited Green Paper on online gaming. The Green Paper 
launched a public consultation between EU Member States, 
EU institutions and other stakeholders regarding the legal 
and technical challenges arising from the activities of both 
“lawful” and “unlawful” online gambling operations.  888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

Enhanced Business Review 
 
In this context, rather than strongly advocating 
harmonization of gaming laws across the EU Internal Market, 
the Paper notes the existence of the two regulatory models 
adopted by EU Member States — a liberalized licencing 
model and the restrictive national monopoly model. As 
with the declaration adopted in late 2010 by the EU Council 
of Ministers, the Green Paper recognizes that the online 
gaming market has not been the subject of pan-European 
regulation, indicating that this state of affairs is unlikely to 
change in the immediate future. The Green Paper highlights 
the need to identify ways in which cooperation between 
national regulatory authorities at EU level will assist Member 
States in achieving more effectively the objectives of their 
gambling policy, in line with the principles of the EU internal 
market. 888 responded to the Green Paper consultation 
process by filing a detailed position paper supporting pan-
European regulation of the industry.
The end of 2011 saw France evaluating the online gaming 
regime put in place by a 2010 law (which introduced 
a licencing regime for online poker, sports betting and 
horserace wagering). It remains unclear whether and to 
what extent this evaluation will lead to amendments of the 
French legal regime, possibly including further liberalization 
of the market, or changes to the tax structure.
Also in 2011, Denmark launched the regulatory regime 
established under a 2010 law (after a state aid claim against 
this regime was rejected by the European Commission). 
Under this new regime, the 888 Group has been issued an 
online gaming licence by the Danish Gambling Commission.
Spain also adopted a new regulatory and licencing regime 
for online gambling during 2011, and issued a time-restricted 
call for applications by the end of the year. Following 
national general elections, issuance of licences has been 
postponed to 2012, and an overall review of the 2011 regime 
by the new administration cannot be ruled out. Until 
such time, the Group’s Spanish business continues to be 
governed by an interim regime put in place by the 2011 law.
Italy, where the Group holds an online gambling concession, 
introduced new legislation in 2011, expanding the scope of 
licencable online activities, and significantly easing access to 
the market by EU-based operators. The Group has updated 
its Italian licence concession in accordance with this new 
legislation. Further expansion of the licencable online 
activities may occur during 2012.
The regulation of online gaming in Germany continued to be 
characterized by legal ambiguity and chaos during 2011 and 
early 2012. The Inter-State Gambling Treaty, struck down 
in 2010 by the European Court of Justice, was scheduled 
to expire at the end of 2011. At that time, 15 of the German 
federal states (Lander) (not including the state of Schleswig-
Holstein) extended the treaty by six months to allow for 
the adoption of a new treaty (expected to introduce a very 
limited online sports-betting regime, allowing for no more 
than 20 licencees). The new treaty awaits the approval 
of the individual states’ parliaments. In a letter issued by 
the European Commission in March 2012, the Commission 
expressed serious doubts over the compliance of the new 
draft treaty with EU law, echoing criticism voiced regarding 
the previous treaties on earlier drafts of the new treaty. The 
EC indicated that it stood to the Lander to demonstrate how 
the proposed treaty could be considered compliant with EU 
law (or risk having it struck down as the previous treaty had 
been). This position by the EC is likely to further contribute 
to the legal uncertainty already characterizing the German 
gaming market.
In contrast, the German state of Schleswig-Holstein 
introduced its own regulatory and licencing regime for 
online casino games (including poker, but excluding 
roulette, baccarat and blackjack) and online betting (lottery 
games remain under state monopoly). Despite granting 
certain advantages to the incumbent land-based gambling 
operators, the Schleswig-Holstein regime was generally 
approved by the European Commission. The licencing 
process for online gaming operators was scheduled to begin 
in March 2012, but has been delayed, as secondary legislation 
specifying the technical requirements is yet to be enacted.
There remains a certain degree of legal uncertainty 
surrounding the ability of Schleswig-Holstein licencees 
to accept players from throughout Germany. While the 
Schleswig-Holstein law does not prohibit the acceptance 
of players nation-wide, and while strong legal arguments 
are available to support the right of Schleswig-Holstein 
licencees to operate in such a manner, the issue is likely to 
be the subject of legal debate once the Schleswig-Holstein 
regime has been fully launched.
As part of a broader austerity package, and with the 
undisguised aim of generating significant tax revenue from 
online gaming, Greece adopted a regulatory and licencing 
regime governing online gaming regime during 2011.  www.888holdingsplc.com
21
21273-04  04/04/2012 Proof 17
The new Greek legislation (which has not yet been fully 
launched) has come under severe criticism due to its 
incompatibility with EU law. This is primarily due to the 
fact that applicants for an online gaming licence must be 
established in Greece, locate their gaming infrastructure 
and store data in Greece and conduct payment processing 
in Greece. The law also subjects applicants to retroactive 
taxation.
Belgium’s licencing regime for online gaming activities  
became effective on February 2012 after a year of “temporary 
test permits” granted to selected operators. Belgian licences 
may only be issued to terrestrial operators already operating  
a casino or gaming arcade. In addition, servers containing  
(as a minimum) the data pertaining to Belgian operations,  
are to be located in Belgium. For these reasons, the European 
Commission has declared the Belgian regulatory regime  
to be incompatible with EU law.
Hungary also amended its gambling law during 2011 
introducing a limited regulatory regime governing online 
gaming. The implementation of these new regulatory regimes 
awaits publication of secondary legislation, and is anticipated 
during 2012.
In August 2011, Romania adopted secondary legislation 
necessary to implement the online gaming portion of its 
2010 gaming legislation. Though formally in force, the regime 
established by this legislation has not yet been practically 
implemented by the Romanian authorities and it is presently 
unclear when such implementation will commence.
uK
Following a review of the current online gaming licencing 
regime, the DCMS is considering reforming the existing regime. 
In March 2012, the Chancellor of the Exchequer formally 
announced a consultation process aimed at introducing 
legislation (in the form of a new Finance Act) which would 
subject all online operators accepting UK customers to UK 
gaming duty (presently at 15% of Gross Gaming Revenue).  
The announcement explicitly refers to December 2014 as the 
target date for implementation of the aforementioned reform, 
which would require a change of primary legislation. 
uSa
Late in 2011, the US Department of Justice released a 
memorandum reversing the Department’s long-standing 
position regarding the scope of the Wire Act. The Department 
of Justice concluded that the Wire Act does not apply to non-
sports betting, and hence does not prohibit the intra-state sale 
online of lottery tickets by licenced state lotteries. 
Several legislative initiatives at state level seek to regulate intra-
state online gaming (including in New Jersey, Iowa, Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, California, Ohio and Washington D.C.).
These initiatives come after the State of Nevada implemented, 
during 2011, a new regime governing intra-state interactive 
poker. The newly introduced Nevada regime allows licenced 
terrestrial gaming operators to offer online poker to patrons in 
Nevada, including through partnership with online operators  
in possession of an appropriate service provider licence.  
The Group has already applied for a licence as an interactive 
gaming service provider and manufacturer in Nevada.  
In so doing, the Group continues to pioneer the Nevada online 
gaming market.
Early in 2012, the New Jersey state legislature began debating 
a bill seeking to allow the offering of online gaming by Atlantic 
City licencees, possibly through partnerships with established 
online operators.
Similar bills are being debated by the state legislatures of 
California, Iowa, Mississippi and Hawaii. Under the California 
bill, terrestrial licencees and Indian tribes could obtain an 
online poker licence, pursuant to which they could operate 
through partnership with online operators (subject to the 
condition that such operators did not accept wagers from 
the United States after 31 December 2006). Similar bills have 
been proposed in Iowa and Mississippi. In Hawaii a proposed 
bill seeks to establish a single state online gaming operator 
(monopoly).
Other US jurisdictions, including Illinois, Maryland and New 
York, are considering launching online platforms for the sale 
of lottery products. These developments could all present 
potential business opportunities for the Group, which could act 
as service provider to licencees and lottery corporations in the 
various states.
Federal legislation governing online gaming (most likely online 
poker, initially) remains a possibility in 2012. Late 2011 saw 
consensus between Senator Harry Reid (longtime supporter 
of online poker legislation) and Senator Jon Kyl (who has 
traditionally objected to federal legislation condoning online 
poker). This newly formed alliance greatly increases the 
odds in favour of federal legislation regulating online gaming, 
though the complex political landscape resulting from the 
2012 general election may impact the likelihood of such 
development during 2012. 888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

Corporate Social Responsibility 
 
As a global leader in online gaming entertainment, 888 is 
committed to a pro-active policy of corporate and social 
responsibility that reflects the high professional and ethical 
standards we have set for ourselves.
Conducting our business responsibly is fundamental to the 
future success of 888 and the sustainability of the business. 
At 888, we understand that our responsible approach is 
both the correct way to do business and one that enhances 
our credibility, thereby supporting the development of the 
business.
Our philosophy
We aim to contribute to the global community in which  
we operate:
● ● We sponsor and participate in activities in the 
neighbourhoods in which we live and work.
● ● We create collaborative and rewarding work 
environments where new ideas can flourish and 
employees can grow.
● ● We encourage responsible gaming practices to avoid 
the dangers of problem gambling, and we have taken 
rigorous steps at all our online sites to prevent under-
age gambling.
Our values
At 888 we place the community and the customer at the 
centre of all our endeavours. We are constantly looking at 
new and innovative ways to create a caring, responsible 
gaming environment and to ensure that minors are unable 
to access our games. For any customers who suspect they 
have a problem, our Director of Responsible Gaming and 
our well-trained staff provide individual assistance that is 
considerate, supportive, and helpful.
Community
Community Involvement
888 is committed to supporting both the various local 
communities in which it operates and also the broader 
global community. Our community investment program 
includes cash donations and long-standing community 
involvement in our key areas across the world.
In addition, 888 employees are actively involved with the 
local community. In the first part of the year, employees 
in the Gibraltar office volunteered to raise money for the 
Alzheimer's foundation. 
Our employees in the Israel office also continue with their 
long-standing relationship with the national Derech Haetgar 
charity which focuses on enhancing the education of 
disadvantaged teenagers. The program allows volunteers 
to assist with homework and studies by combining fun and 
educational indoor and outdoor activities and workshops 
according to various public festivals.
As has been the case for the past few years, employees 
in Israel also joined the “Day of Good Will” national 
volunteering organization and for the third year, 888 
employees dedicate this day to host Sudanese kids for  
a day of fun activities.
Charity and our customers
The annual 888 Charity Weekend was hosted on 9-12 
December 2011. For the fifth consecutive year, 888.com 
donated 8% of the house profits during the entire weekend 
from across the business — casino, poker, bingo & sport.  
The charity donations were shared between three well know 
and deserving charities, Breast Cancer Care U.K., Bliss and 
Sport Relief.
As well as this general promotion, during the 888 Charity 
Weekend individual brands allowed players to contribute 
more through promotions like 888casino’s Santastic video 
slot, 888poker’s Charity Challenge and 888ladies £200

Environment
As an online business 888’s activities have a relatively small 
impact on the environment, but 888 continues to develop its 
commitment to environmental issues:
● ● Green IT: Recycling IT: all 888’s redundant IT equipment 
is now recycled. Virtualisation (VDI project): More than 
120 stations were transformed from a PC to the VDI 
system, enabling us to use less hardware.
● ● Energy consumption: Alongside these projects we 
continuously monitor our energy consumption to help 
us ensure we are being as energy efficient as possible.
● ● Recycling: We recycle as much as possible. Paper, 
bottles and cans are collected from all of our sites.
● ● Water: We use only ecological detergents in our offices 
and use water saving devices in all our locations.
● ● Travel: To minimise the impact of travel on the 
environment we encourage employees to either cycle 
to work and, in certain locations, provide buses for 
commuters. We also continue to invest in state-of-the-
art technology to help meetings occur remotely.
Responsible gaming
We are constantly creating new and innovative ways to 
create a caring, responsible gaming environment and to 
ensure children are unable to access our gaming sites.
888 aims to provide responsible adults with the best 
online gaming entertainment experience. However, we 
acknowledge that gaming poses a potential danger to a 
small minority of people. We continuously train our staff 
in how to provide a safe gaming experience. Our training 
program incorporates methods and techniques to help our 
employees to recognise and take appropriate actions if they 
identify compulsive or underage gambling.
Protecting Customers
● ● As a responsible, regulated gaming company we 
comply with both the GamCare and the eCOGRA 
guidelines.
● ● GamCare is the leading authority on the provision of 
counselling, advice and practical help in addressing the 
social impact of gambling in the UK.
● ● eCOGRA ensures that approved online casinos are 
properly and transparently monitored to provide player 
protection.
● ● Our site has links to helping agencies and we have 
placed many safeguards for those who need help with 
controlling their gaming.
● ● Self-assessment test: For gamblers who are worried 
about their gambling habits and want to know more 
about the signs of compulsive gambling,
● ● Controlling deposit limits: Should clients feel the need 
to they can control their gambling by self limiting the 
amounts they deposit per day, per week or per month.
● ● Self exclusion: A customer can request to be self 
excluded for a chosen period, due to different concerns. 
Based on internal studies we decided to increase time 
periods available for clients to cool off. Clients can 
choose from six different exclusion periods from one 
day to six months. During this period, 888 blocks the 
account and no promotional e-mails are sent to the 
client.
In 2011, 888’s Director of CSR and Responsible Gaming 
worked with Gambling Therapy and GamCare, aiming 
to enhance the training of our customer support 
representatives in order to help them identify potential 
compulsive players’ profiles and the most effective way  
that they can be helped before a problem arises.
Protecting minors
Under-age gambling on our sites is prohibited and 888 
takes the prevention of under-age gaming extremely 
seriously.
Our offering is not designed to attract minors. We make 
every effort to prevent minors from playing on our sites 
and use sophisticated verification systems as well as a third 
party verification supplier to identify and track minors if 
they log into our software. The verification process today 
consists of two verification systems, both 192.com and URU.
We train our staff to be highly sensitive to the possibility of 
underage gambling and make sure we suspend any account 
suspected to be an under-age account. 888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

888responsible
Since 2007 a dedicated website, www.888responsible.
com, has been available, providing information regarding 
all aspects of responsible gaming. The site is available in 
English, French, Spanish and German.
This year we upgraded and expanded the site so that 
the content reflects our holistic CSR approach, while the 
updated platform allows for greater flexibility in content 
changes as well as supporting more languages.
united nations Global Compact (unGC)
During 2009 888 entered into in the United Nations  
Global Compact.
The UNGC is the largest global initiative to promote the 
social responsibility of businesses. It is a voluntary initiative, 
which brings together thousands of businesses across 
more than 100 sectors worldwide. Representatives confirm 
their commitment to the UNGC in order to promote ten 
universally accepted principles in the field of human rights, 
workplace standards and anti-corruption.
We believe that the activities of 888 are in line with the 
principles of the Global Compact, and it therefore seemed 
appropriate that we should publicly declare our support and 
ensure greater exposure to a wider public. By joining the 
UN Global Compact we are now in line with an established 
and globally recognised policy framework of environmental, 
social, and governance policies and practices.
Employee Care at 888
888 values its employees’ opinions and conducts regular 
pulse checks to gain an understanding regarding employees’ 
working experiences. This year we conducted an online 
staff opinion survey which included some of the following 
topics: ‘me as an employee’, ‘my manager’, ‘my team’ and 
‘888 management’. The survey findings proved high levels of 
employee satisfaction and provided excellent guidelines for 
ongoing efforts.
l earning and Development
At 888 we invest in our employees’ professional 
development with regular and ongoing training and 
development programs. This year a number of new learning 
opportunities were devised and offered to our employees; 
including an internal learning program: ‘Up2Date with  
888’, teaching about our various products and offerings;  
a new training initiative for our sales team in Antigua  
which included new online marketing methods as well as  
a number of leadership developmental courses including  
a new program for General Managers in our Israel office 
and a supervisory skills program for Team Leaders in our 
Gibraltar office.
All 888 employees receive feedback about their work 
performance during the annual talking@888 process. This 
year we incorporated an interactive feedback scheme, which 
allowed managers to collect feedback online from different 
stakeholders across the business, including employee’s 
colleagues and indirect managers. A Company-wide grading 
scale was utilized to allocate scores and feedback sessions 
were then carried out.

Risk Report
 
The Group operates in a dynamic business environment.  
In addition to the day-to-day commercial risks faced by 
most enterprises, the online gaming industry faces particular 
challenges in respect of Regulatory risk, Reputational risk, 
Information Technology risk and Taxation risk, each of which 
is detailed below.
Regulatory risk
The regulatory framework of online gaming is dynamic 
and complex. Change in the regulatory regime in a specific 
jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on business 
volume and financial performance in that jurisdiction.  
A detailed regulatory review is set out in the Regulation and 
General Regulatory Developments section above. The Group 
manages its regulatory risk by routinely consulting with legal 
advisors in the jurisdictions where its services are offered or 
are accessible, where necessary obtaining formal legal opinions 
from local counsel. Furthermore, the Group obtains frequent 
and routine updates regarding changes in the law that may 
be applicable to its operations, working with local counsel to 
assess the impact of any changes on its operations. The Group 
constantly adapts and moderates its services to comply with 
legal and regulatory requirements. Finally, the Group blocks 
players from certain ‘blocked jurisdictions’ at various stages 
and using various technological methods.
Reputational risk
Under-age and problem gaming are inherent risks 
associated with the online gaming industry. The Group 
devotes considerable resources to putting in place 
prevention measures coupled with strict internal procedures 
designed to prevent under-aged players from accessing 
its real money sites. In addition, the Group promotes a 
safe and responsible gaming environment to its customers 
supplemented by its corporate culture. The Group has a 
dedicated Director of CSR & Responsible Gaming tasked 
with the responsibility of implementing such policies. 
Further details about the Group’s responsible gaming 
initiatives are set out in previous pages.
Information Technology risks
As a leading online business, the Group’s IT systems 
are critical to its operation. The Group is reliant on the 
performance of these systems.
Cutting-edge technologies and procedures are implemented 
throughout the Group’s technology operations and designed 
to protect its networks from malicious attacks and other 
such risks. These measures include traffic filtering, anti-
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) devices and Anti-Virus 
protection from leading vendors. Physical and logical network 
segmentation is also used to isolate and protect the Group’s 
networks and restrict malicious activities. The IT environment 
is audited by independent auditors, such as PCI DSS security 
audit and eCOGRA audit. These audits ensure proper IT 
procedures and a high level of security. In order to ensure 
systems are protected properly and effectively, external 
security scans and assessments are carried out in a timely 
manner. The Group has a redundant storage solution to 
ensure storage availability and performance. All critical data 
is replicated to another storage device for disaster recovery 
purposes and all data is stored off-site on a daily basis.
In order to minimise dependence on telecommunication 
service providers, the Group invests in network infrastructure 
redundancies whilst regularly reviewing its service providers. 
The Group has two internet service providers in Gibraltar in 
order to minimise reliance on one provider.
As a part of its monitoring system, the Group deploys set 
user experience tests which measure performance from 
different locations around the world. Network-related 
performance issues are addressed by rerouting traffic using 
different routes or providers. 888 operates a 24/7 Network 
Operations Centre (NOC). The NOC’s role is to conduct 
real time monitoring of production activities using state-
of-the-art systems. These systems are designed to identify 
and provide alerts regarding problems related to systems, 
key business indicators and issues surrounding customer 
usability experience.
The IT environment tracks changes, incidents and SLA 
KPIs in order to ensure that client experience is consistent 
and well managed. As part of these procedures, capacity 
planning takes place and infrastructure is built accordingly. 
System-wide availability and business-level availability is 
measured and logged in the IT information systems.
Taxation risk
The Group aims to ensure that each legal entity within 
the Group is a tax resident of the jurisdiction in which it 
is incorporated and has no taxable presence in any other 
jurisdiction. While the Group’s customers are located 
worldwide, certain jurisdictions may seek to tax the 
Group’s activity which could have a material adverse 
effect on the amount of tax payable by the Group or on 
customers’ behaviour. Furthermore, jurisdictions in which 
online gambling is regulated may impose gaming duties on 
licenced operators. The Group actively monitors taxation 
risk in the relevant jurisdictions and takes such steps as it 
considers necessary to minimize such risks. 888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

Corporate Governance
 
888 Holdings plc is admitted to the UK Official List and its 
shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange under 
a Premium Listing. As such, despite being incorporated in 
Gibraltar, the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) 
applies to the Company.
Statement of Compliance
The Board remained committed to high standards of 
corporate governance which it considers to be central to the 
effective management of the business and to maintaining 
the confidence of investors. During the year, the Board 
considers that it and the Group have complied with all 
relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Business Model
A discussion of the basis on which the Company generates 
and preserves value over the longer term, together with 
its strategy for delivering its objectives, is set out in the 
Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s review on 
pages 2 to 7.
The Board
The Directors consider it essential that the Company should 
be both led and controlled by an effective Board.
Composition
During 2011, the Board consisted of seven Directors as 
follows: three independent Non-executive Directors, two 
Non-independent Non-executive Directors, a Non-executive 
Chairman, and one Executive Director, being the Chief 
Financial Officer. One of the former Executive Directors, 
Gigi Levy, stepped down from his role as Chief Executive 
Officer as of 30 April 2011 but has remained on the Board as 
a Non-executive Director. From that date Brian Mattingley 
took on certain Chairman duties. Brian Mattingley was 
appointed full-time Chief Executive Officer in March 2012. 
Following such appointment, the composition of the various 
committees on which Mr Mattingley was a member is under 
review. In addition, one of the independent Non-executive 
Directors, Michael Constantine, stepped down from the 
Board as of December 31, 2011. The biographical details of 
all of the Directors are given on page 26. The Company 
is actively seeking new Non-executive Directors with the 
experience and skill-set to help the Group continue its next 
phase of growth.
Strategic approach
The Board focuses upon the Group’s long-term objectives, 
strategic and policy issues and formally and transparently 
considers the management of key risks facing the Group, 
as well as determining the nature and extent of significant 
risks it will take in achieving its strategic objectives, 
maintaining sound risk management and internal control 
systems and reviewing annually the effectiveness of the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems. 
The Board is responsible for acquisitions and divestments, 
major capital expenditure projects and considering Group 
budgets and dividend policy. The Board also determines 
key appointments. The Board receives regular updates 
on shareholders’ views. The Board has established a 
calendar of business. This covers the financial calendar, 
strategic planning, annual budgets and performance self-
assessments, as well as the conduct of standing business. 
The calendar forms the basis for effective integration of 
business activities as between the Board and its principal 
Committees (see page 29), which individually consider their 
own operating frameworks against the Board’s business 
programme. The Board intends to establish a formal process 
for the annual evaluation of its performance, its committees 
and individual Directors. The evaluation process is to cover 
a range of issues such as Board processes, Board roles and 
responsibilities, Board agendas and committee processes. 
Whilst no evaluation was carried out in 2011, the Board 
intends to carry out such an evaluation in 2012. The Board 
plans to meet six times a year. During 2011, the Board 
met five times. Set out below are details of the Directors’ 
attendance record at Board and Committee meetings  
in 2011. 888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

21273-04  04/04/2012 Proof 17
The Chairman has responsibility for ensuring that agendas 
for Board meetings are set in advance. Board papers are 
issued to Directors sufficiently in advance of meetings to 
facilitate both informed debate and timely decisions.
non-executive review and performance 
appraisal
The Chairman holds meetings at least once per year with 
the Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors 
being present. Led by the Senior Independent Director, the 
Non-executive Directors meet once per year without the 
Chairman present in order to appraise the performance of 
the Chairman. The Directors have wide-ranging business 
experience, and no individual, or group of individuals, 
dominates the Board’s decision making.
The Board considers that Brian Mattingley and Amos Pickel 
satisfy the independence criteria of the Code in 2011. The 
Board is satisfied that, upon his appointment as Chairman, 
Richard Kilsby met the independence criteria of the Code. 
The other significant commitments of the Chairman during 
2011 are detailed in his biography on page 26. It is noted that 
Mr Kilsby resigned as a Non-executive Director of Tullett 
Prebon plc in 2011. The Board considers that Mr Kilsby’s 
other commitments do not interfere with the discharge 
of his responsibilities to the Group and is satisfied that 
he makes sufficient time available to serve the Company 
effectively.
Reserved powers and delegation
A schedule of matters reserved to the Board has been 
adopted and its content is reviewed to align it with 
operational needs and the Board’s preference to monitor 
and, where appropriate, approve matters of substance to 
the Group as a whole. Senior Executives have given written 
undertakings to ensure compliance within their business 
operations with the Board’s formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it for decision or approval.
Division of responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Chairman are clearly and formally 
defined, with the Chairman being responsible for the 
effective operation of the Board as a whole, leadership of 
the Board in achieving a culture of constructive challenge 
by Non-executives, regularly agreeing and reviewing each 
Director’s training and development needs, and supporting 
key external relationships.
Other issues
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and the Company’s nominated advisers, 
who are responsible for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed. Directors are able to seek independent 
professional advice, if required, at the Company’s expense 
provided that they have first notified their intention to do so.
The appointment or removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the Board as a whole.
The Board accepts that there should be a formal, rigorous 
and transparent procedure for the induction of new 
Directors, which has been formulated with the guidance of 
the Nominations Committee.
The opportunity to hold office as Non-executive Directors of 
other companies enables Directors of 888 to broaden their 
experience and knowledge, which will benefit the Company. 
Executive Directors may be allowed to accept Non-
executive appointments with the Board’s prior permission, 
so long as these are not likely to lead to any conflict of

The Company has arranged insurance cover in respect of 
legal actions against its Directors. To the extent permitted by

Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover 
where a Director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Re-election of Directors
All Directors are subject to reappointment by shareholders 
on an annual basis.
a udit Committee
The Audit Committee comprised three independent 
Non-executive Directors: Brian Mattingley (Chair until 
30 April 2011), Michael Constantine (Chair from 30 April 
2011) and Amos Pickel. The Board is satisfied that both 
Brian Mattingley and Michael Constantine have sufficient 
recent and relevant financial experience to Chair the Audit 
Committee. Michael Constantine stepped down from the 
Board as of 31 December 2011, and the Audit Committee 
is presently considering appointment of a new Chair. 
Normally, by invitation, the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer and, where appropriate, 
representatives of the Company’s external auditors attend 
the Audit Committee meetings.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference are available on 
request to the Company Secretary and are included on the

reporting, external and internal audits and controls, including 
reviewing 888’s annual financial statements, considering 
the scope of annual audit and the extent of non-audit work 
undertaken by external auditors, approving 888’s internal 
audit programme, advising on the appointment of external 
auditors and reviewing the effectiveness of internal control 
systems.
nominations Committee
During the year, the Nominations Committee comprised 
three independent Non-executive Directors: Michael 
Constantine (Chair), Brian Mattingley and Amos Pickel, 
as well as Richard Kilsby, Chairman. The Nominations 
Committee met in 2011 to discuss, amongst other matters, 
the departure of Gigi Levy from his position as Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company and the recruitment 
of a new Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Brian 
Mattingley was appointed Chief Executive Officer in March 
2012. Michael Constantine stepped down from the Board 
as of 31 December 2011, and the Nominations Committee is 
presently considering appointment of a new Chair.
The Nominations Committee assists the Board in discharging 
its responsibilities relating to the composition of the Board. 
The Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing, 
from time to time, the structure of the Board, determining 
succession plans for the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer, and identifying and recommending suitable

the Company Secretary and are included on the Company’s 
website, www.888holdingsplc.com.
Remuneration Committee

Mattingley (Chair until 30 April 2011), Michael Constantine and 
Amos Pickel (Chair from 30 April 2011). Michael Constantine 
stepped down from the Board as of 31 December 2011.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the 
framework of Executive remuneration and its cost. It is 
required to take account of any recommendation made 
by the Remuneration Committee in determining the 
remuneration, benefits and employment packages of the 
Executive Directors and senior management and the fees  
of the Chairman.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report, which outlines the 
Remuneration Committee’s work and details of Directors’ 
remuneration, is on pages 31 to 37. The Remuneration 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on request to 
the Company Secretary and are included on the Company’s 
website, www.888holdingsplc.com.
Risk Management and Internal Control
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the 
Company’s system of internal control, for setting policy on 
internal control and risk management, and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal control and risk management. It is 
management’s role to implement Board policies on risk and 
control, including reporting. The system of internal control 
is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.

legislation relevant to companies in Gibraltar is the Gibraltar

Directors’ Remuneration Report
 
In accordance with the Listing Rules, the Company presents its 
report on the remuneration of its Directors for the year ended 
31 December 2011. The Company is incorporated in Gibraltar 
and, therefore, is not required to comply with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report requirements in Schedule 8 to the UK 
Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008, but in order to comply with 
the Listing Rules has prepared this Remuneration Report on 
the basis of those requirements, as appropriate.
The report sets out the structure and details of the 
remuneration of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 
2011. It also describes the Board’s policy and approach to 
the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ 
remuneration. BDO LLP and BDO Limited have audited the 
sections headed ‘Directors’ Remuneration Summary’ and 
‘Directors’ Interests in Share Awards and Share Options’.
A resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
is proposed, annually, to shareholders for approval.  
This Remuneration Report will be put to shareholder vote at 
the 2012 Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration Committee
During the year, the Remuneration Committee consisted 
solely of independent Non-executive Directors, Brian 
Mattingley (Chair until 30 April 2011), Michael Constantine 
and Amos Pickel (Chair from 30 April 2011). Michael 
Constantine stepped down from the Board as of 
31 December 2011. Details of attendances at Committee 
meetings are contained in the statement on Corporate 
Governance on page 28. The Remuneration Committee has 
formal terms of reference (which are available on request 
in writing to the Company Secretary and on the Company’s 
website, www.888holdingsplc.com).
Independent a dvice
The Board intends that Executive remuneration policies be 
both formal and transparent. It further acknowledges the 
importance of taking into consideration independent advice 
in setting remuneration policies and benefit levels. In 2011, 
the Remuneration Committee took advice from Compvision 
with regard to remuneration of Israeli Executives together 
with a remuneration survey as well as from Hewitt New 
Bridge Street with regard to acceleration of share awards.
Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors
Remuneration packages must be sufficient to attract, retain 
and motivate Directors of the calibre appropriate to a global 
business in a competitive environment.  
The Remuneration Committee is mindful that most of the Group’s 
competitors are not UK listed companies and acknowledges 
the unique risk profile associated with online businesses of the 
nature of the Group’s, and takes these matters into account in 
determining appropriate remuneration levels. The components of 
the remuneration structure are set out below.
At least half of the total potential remuneration of the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer 
is represented by a variable element, dependent on the 
performance of the Group. The Remuneration Committee 
considers that these represent achievable and motivational 
levels of personal rewards commensurate with stipulated 
levels of corporate performance.
The Remuneration Committee is mandated by the Board 
to satisfy itself that the level of the Directors’ and senior 
management’s remuneration is appropriate, having 
regard to pay and conditions throughout the sectors in 
which the Group operates. It will further satisfy itself that 
such remuneration aligns with the risks and rewards to 
shareholders. In this context the Remuneration Committee 
will regularly review individual and corporate performance 
targets. In the current economic climate, executive 
leadership is more important than ever. The Remuneration 
Committee will continue to use careful and rigorous 
judgement to match remuneration to achievements.
The Remuneration Committee applies a remuneration policy 
which has at its core the following objectives:
● ● To align the interests of Executives with those of 
shareholders.
● ● To focus on top-line growth and margin improvement.
● ● To link a significant proportion of remuneration to 
financial and individual performance, both in the short 
term and long term.
● ● To provide strong linkage between remuneration and 
performance.
● ● To ensure total remuneration is market-competitive in 
the industry and helps attract and retain Executives  
of the highest calibre.
It is the Company’s policy to take into account the pay 
and conditions of employees throughout the Group when 
determining Directors’ remuneration. In this respect, the 
Remuneration Committee takes note of both the average 
pay and conditions of employees and the range thereof, and 
gives substantial weight to the maintenance of a reasonable 
proportionality between the Directors’ remuneration and 
that of other employees of the Group. 888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2011

non-executive Directors
The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors receive fees 
only, and are not eligible to participate in any bonus plan, 
pension plan, share plan, or long-term incentive plan of the 
Company. The Chairman and the Executive Directors determine 
the fees paid to the Non-executive Directors. The Chairman’s 
fees are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Fees paid to the Non-executive Directors are set by 
reference to an assessment of the time commitment and 
responsibility associated with each role. Levels take account 
of additional demands placed upon individual Non-executive 
Directors by virtue of their holding particular offices, such 
as Committee Chairman and/or Deputy Chairman, and 
travel time to Board meetings at the Group’s headquarters 
in Gibraltar. The fees paid to each Non-executive Director 
during 2011 are disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration 
summary on page 35.
Resignation of Gigi l evy as CEO
Mr Gigi Levy stepped down from his role as Chief Executive 
Officer of the Company with effect from 30 April 2011.

$2,981,400 (comprising $2,368,000 in lieu of salary and 
contractual benefits during Mr Levy’s notice period; $113,400 
in lieu of pension contributions during his notice period; and 
an ex gratia payment of $500,000). Of this amount, Mr Levy 
has to date received $1,981,400. A further $1,000,000 will 
be paid on 22 May 2012, provided that Mr Levy remains a 
member of the Company’s Board of Directors on that date.
The Company also agreed to make a conditional payment 
of $80,000 to Mr Levy on 22 May 2012, representing the 
amount of salary which Mr Levy waived in respect of his 
salary for 2010. The Company agreed to continue to provide 
health insurance and life assurance cover to Mr Levy until 
30 April 2012 and allowed Mr Levy to retain his company 
car until 30 April 2012 (with the Company bearing the 
costs of insuring, repairing and maintaining the car), and in 
addition agreed to redeem Mr Levy’s accrued but untaken 
leave days by way of a payment made on 11 April 2011 in the 
amount of $45,000. In connection with Mr Levy’s unvested 
awards under the 888 All-Employee Plan, the Remuneration 
Committee exercised its discretion to treat Mr Levy as 
a good leaver, such that his awards over 167,352 shares 
granted on 8 April 2008 and over 10,500 shares granted on 
14 January 2009 vested on 30 April 2011. The Remuneration 
Committee also agreed that the award over 167,351 shares 
made on 8 April 2008 should vest in accordance with the 
terms of Mr Levy’s service agreement.
Following the termination of his employment Mr Levy 
continued to provide services to the Company pursuant  
to an agreement with effect from 1 May 2011 in return for  
a monthly fee of $50,000. This arrangement terminated  
on 31 October 2011.
Mr Levy agreed to remain as a Non-executive Director of 
the Company after the termination of his employment. His 
services as a Non-executive Director are made in return for 
an annual fee of £66,000. This arrangement took effect on 
and from 1 May 2011 and will continue for a period of three 
years, provided that Mr Levy is re-elected at each Annual 
General Meeting. Mr Levy is not eligible to receive a bonus or 
to participate in the Company’s share incentive arrangements 
in connection with his role as a Non-executive Director.
Special Indemnity for Certain Directors and 
Key Personnel
In connection with the Group undergoing various 
compliance and licencing procedures relating to its 
contemplated business in the United States, it has 
requested, and may in future request, that each of Brian 
Mattingley, Aviad Kobrine and Itai Frieberger, and each 
of their spouses, provide various personal information, 
documentation, consents, indemnities and waivers to 
various United States federal or state regulatory authorities.
 
In this respect, the Company has executed on 23 March 
2012 in favour of each such disclosing party an undertaking, 
pursuant to which such parties shall be indemnified 
(including advancement of expenses) in the event of any 
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative proceeding 
arising from the aforementioned disclosures and related 
documentation, provided the disclosing party acted in 
good faith, in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not 
opposed to the best interests of the Company, and had 
no reasonable cause to believe the Indemnitee’s conduct 
was unlawful. The undertaking is limited such that in no 
event shall the Company be liable to any disclosing party 
(taken together with such person’s spouse) in an aggregate 
amount exceeding US$528,000.
Remuneration Structure
Base Salary and Benefits
The Executive Directors’ base salaries are subject to annual 
review. Gigi Levy’s salary until his departure from office as 
CEO in April 2011 was maintained at US$756,000 and Aviad 
Kobrine’s salary was increased with inflation from April 2011 
to GBP315,000. *Benefits provided to Aviad Kobrine include 
a car allowance and health, disability and life insurance.
*  Part of which is paid by the Company and part by Cassava 
Enterprises (Gibraltar) Limited.

annual Cash Bonus
Aviad Kobrine is entitled to an annual cash bonus of up  
to 120% of annualised salary, subject to the achievement  
of pre-determined targets. The Remuneration Committee  
sets bonus targets and levels of eligibility each year.  
For the 2011 financial year, the performance target was 20% 
growth in revenue compared to 2010 and provided that 
the EBITDA* margin for 2010 was maintained. The payout 
levels were set at 50% of base salary for 80% performance, 
increasing on a linear basis up to 100% where targets were 
fully satisfied. In the event that revenue growth exceeded 
20%, the percentage bonus entitlement increased by 4% 
for every 1% additional revenue growth, up to a maximum 
bonus entitlement of 120%. The pre-determined targets 
were achieved and Aviad Kobrine was entitled to his full 
annual cash bonus. Having considered the extraordinary 
achievements of the Group in 2011, the Remuneration 
Committee considered that it was appropriate to make 
an additional bonus payment such that the total bonus 
payment payable will be 170% of annualised salary. 30% of 
the bonus payment will be deferred and payable in January 
2013 should Mr Kobrine still be employed by the Company 
(and not in a notice period) on 1 January 2013.
Pensions
Aviad Kobrine is entitled to a cash payment in lieu of an 
annual contribution to his personal pension scheme of 15% 
of his base salary.
l ong-Term Incentives
The Company has two employee share incentive plans: (i) 
the 888 All-Employee Share Plan, and (ii) the 888 Long-
term Incentive Plan. The Company currently only grants 
awards under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan.
Performance-dependent options and awards were granted 
under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan to the Executive 
Directors on 8 April 2008 and 24 May 2011. In addition, on 14 
January 2009 an award was made to the Executive Directors in 
lieu of their waiver of a part of their annual cash bonus. Details 
of these awards and options are set out on pages 35 to 36. 
Other than the award in lieu of cash bonus no equity awards 
have been made to Executive Directors since April 2008.
888 all-Employee Share Plan
All employees, exclusive consultants and Executive Directors 
of the Group who are not within six months of their normal 
retirement age are eligible to participate in the 888 All-
Employee Share Plan at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee.
Awards under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan can either 
be granted for no consideration (or with a nil exercise price 
for options) or at an exercise price that will normally be 
no less than the market value of an ordinary share at the 
time of grant or average share price during a period as 
determined by the Remuneration Committee at time of 
grant. In countries where an award or option involving real 
shares is not appropriate or feasible for legal, regulatory or 
tax reasons, a phantom award may be used.
The maximum number of ordinary shares that an eligible 
employee may acquire pursuant to share awards or options 
granted to such person in any calendar year under the 888 
All-Employee Share Plan and the 888 Long-term Incentive 
Plan may not have an aggregate market value, as measured 
at the date of grant, exceeding 200% of such person’s 
annual base salary or such higher limit as the Remuneration 
Committee may determine is appropriate in any individual 
case. Awards vest over a fixed period of up to four years. 
The Remuneration Committee may determine that the 
vesting and release or exercise of share awards and options 
under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan are subject to 
performance conditions imposed at the time of grant.
888 l ong-term Incentive Plan
All employees and Executive Directors of the Group who 
are not within six months of their normal retirement age are 
eligible to participate in the 888 Long-term Incentive Plan 
at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. As at the 
date of this report, no awards have been granted pursuant 
to the 888 Long-term Incentive Plan. As set out above, the 
Company has given long-term incentive awards to Executive 
Directors under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan.
Scheme limits
Awards and options granted under the 888 All-Employee 
Share Plan and the 888 Long-term Incentive Plan may be 
satisfied through the issue of new shares. It is intended that 
grants of options and awards are to be planned so as not 
to exceed 5% of the issued ordinary share capital in any 
rolling ten year period for the 888 Long-term Incentive Plan, 
and 10% of the issued ordinary share capital in any rolling 
ten year period for the 888 All-Employee Share Plan and 
the 888 Long-term Incentive Plan, in the aggregate. The 
Committee intends to have regard to appropriate annual 
flow-rates so as to ensure that these limits are not breached.

Executive Directors) of any Group Company to enable the 
Group to attract, retain and motivate employees.
The 888 IPO Share Award Trust and the 888 Holdings plc 
Share Plan Trust were created pursuant to Trust Deeds dated 
14 September 2005. The 888 IPO Share Award Trust was

Plan Trust currently holds 46,432 ordinary shares in the 
Company.
Director appointments — Service Contracts 
and Directors’ Fees
Executive Directors
It is the Company’s policy that each Executive Director’s 
service agreement is terminable on no more than 12 months’ 
written notice by either party. Each Executive Director’s 
employment can be terminated by making a payment equal 
to the salary and pension contributions and the value of 
other contractual benefits due to the Executive Director in 
lieu of any unexpired notice period. The Executive Directors 
continue to be entitled to be paid a bonus during any 
unexpired part of the notice period even if the employment 
is terminated by making payment in lieu of notice. A Share 
Award granted under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan 
to Aviad Kobrine pursuant to his service agreement, on 15 
January 2008, continues to vest during any unexpired part 
of the notice period and he shall be treated as a ‘good leaver’ 
under the terms of the 888 All-Employee Share Plan where 
his employment has been terminated by making a payment 
in lieu of notice. Furthermore, certain Share Awards granted 
under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan to Aviad Kobrine on 
24 May 2011 are subject to accelerated vesting in the event his 
employment with the Group is terminated other than for cause 
prior to 24 May 2012. No other benefits upon termination of 
employment are payable. An Executive Director’s entitlement 
to share awards and share options under the 888 All-Employee 
Plan on termination of employment will be governed by the 
terms of that plan (and in the case of the initial awards made 
to Aviad Kobrine by the relevant provisions of his service 
agreement) as set out above.

are held by a person other than the holder of the shares.
A Relationship Agreement governing the relationship 
between the above Principal Shareholder Trusts and 
the Company was entered into in connection with 
the Company’s flotation. The Relationship Agreement 
provides that all transactions between the Group and the 
Principal Shareholder Trusts will be on a normal business 
basis, that the Group will be allowed to carry on business 
independently of them and that the Principal Shareholder 
Trusts will not cause the Company to contravene the 
Combined Code unless required by law or as contemplated 
in the Relationship Agreement. It further provides that 
each of the Principal Shareholder Trusts will not solicit 
Group employees without consent, that only Independent 
Directors can vote on proposals to amend the Relationship 
Agreement, that the Principal Shareholder Trusts will consult 
the Group prior to disposing of a significant number of 
shares in order to maintain an orderly market and shall 
not disclose confidential information unless required to 
do so by law or relevant regulation or having first received 
the Company’s consent. The Relationship Agreement also 
includes restrictions on the Principal Shareholder Trusts 
power to appoint Directors and includes obligations on the 
trusts to ensure that the majority of the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, is independent. The Principal Shareholder Trusts 
can nominate a Non-executive Director for appointment 
to the Board. In the event that this right is exercised 
and it results in fewer than half the Board (excluding the 
Chairman of the Board) being Independent Directors, 
such appointment shall only become effective upon the 
appointment to the Board of an additional Independent 
Director acceptable to the Nominations Committee. 
Such restrictions and obligations apply in respect of the 
E Shaked Shares Trust and O Shaked Shares Trust whilst 
they collectively hold not less than 7.5% of the issued share 
capital of 888, and in respect of the Ben-Yitzhak Family 
Shares Trust whilst it individually holds not less than 7.5%  
of the issued share capital of 888.
Change of Control
Other than the Group’s gaming licences where change of 
control is subject to prior consent, and the Wink earn out 
amendment announced in March 2011, there are no material 
contracts to which the Group is a party which would allow 
the counterparty to terminate or alter those contractual 
arrangements in the event of a change of control of the Group.
Charitable Contributions
Contributions for charitable purposes were made during  
the year amounting to US$198,726 (2010: US$223,075).
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company, for safeguarding 
the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the 
preparation of a Directors’ report which complies with the 
Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar 
Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the 
Gibraltar Companies Act.
Financial statements are published on the Group’s website 
in accordance with legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements,  
which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is the 
responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility 
also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report and the financial statements. The Directors are 
required to prepare financial statements for the Group 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) and have also chosen to prepare financial 
statements for the Company in accordance with IFRSs.

Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies 
(Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated 
Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group 
and Company’s financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of 
the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the 
International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for 
the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. 
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be 
achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. A fair 
presentation also requires the Directors to:
● ● Consistently select and apply appropriate accounting 
policies;
● ● Present information, including accounting policies,  
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; and
● ● Provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to  
enable members to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the  
entity’s financial position and financial performance.
We confirm, to the best of our knowledge:
(a) The financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss 
of the Group and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
(b) The Enhanced Business Review, includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Group and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

2 Significant accounting policies continued
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and 
assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year. These policies together with references to the related notes to the financial statements can

Contingent consideration 21
Intangible assets 12

Regulatory compliance and contingent liabilities 28 
Presentation of accounts
Following a review of the financial statements, the following amendments have been made to the consolidated statement 
of income. In light of the increased regulated markets in which the Group operates, the Directors believe it helpful to 
separately disclose those gaming duties and taxes not directly related to profit. Accordingly, these amounts have been 
separately disclosed on the face of the consolidated Income Statement under the heading “gaming taxes and duties”, 
and the comparatives amended accordingly. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated 
assets and liabilities, and settlement of forward foreign exchange contracts are now included in finance income and 
finance charges as they relate to financing decisions made by the Group. Previously they were included in administrative 
expenses. The comparative figures, whilst immaterial, have been amended accordingly.
A comparative prior year balance sheet for 31 December 2009 has not been presented as the new presentation has no 
effect on the reported profit or loss, nor on net assets.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are 
companies controlled by 888 Holdings Public Limited Company. Control exists where the Company has the power 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are 
consolidated from the date the parent gained control until such time as control ceases. 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements using the purchase 
method of accounting. On the date of the acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair 
values and any excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill. 
Inter-Company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company and using 
consistent accounting policies.

Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue  
can be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occurred. 
Revenue consists of revenue from online gaming and revenue generated from processing customers’ cross currency 
deposits and withdrawals. It comprises: 
Casino and Bingo
Winnings which are represented by the differences between the amounts of bets placed by customers less amounts  
won by customers.  
Poker 
Ring games: Rake, which is the commission charged from each winning hand played. 
Tournaments: Entry fees charged for participation in Poker tournaments are recognised when the tournament  
has concluded. 
Emerging offerings 
Revenue from Emerging Offerings mainly comprise winnings from Sportsbook activity and revenue from social games.
Casino and Bingo winnings, and revenues from the Poker business and Emerging Offerings are stated after deduction  
of certain bonuses granted to customers. 
B2B 
In the case of white label activity, revenue is the net commission charged.
f oreign currency 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-US dollar currencies are translated into US dollar equivalents using 
year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing  
at the dates of the transactions. Exchange rate differences on foreign currency transactions are included in financial 
income or financial expenses as appropriate. 
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US dollars are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows: 
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance 
sheet; and
(ii)  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate (unless this average  
is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which 
case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions). 52

Taxation 
The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet 
differs from its tax base. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Recognition of deferred tax assets is 
restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit. The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/
assets are settled/recovered. 
Intangible assets 
Acquisitions 
Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised 
at their fair value at the acquisition date. The identified intangibles are amortized over the useful economic life of the 
assets. This has ranged between three months to four years for acquisitions to date.
The exception is acquisitions of trade names, which have an indefinite useful economic life and therefore an annual 
impairment test is conducted. 
Intangible assets are reviewed annually for evidence of impairment. Any impairment in carrying value is charged to the 
consolidated income statement. 
Internally generated intangible assets 
Expenditure incurred on development activities is capitalised only when the expenditure will lead to new or substantially 
improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has 
sufficient resources to complete development. All other development expenditure is expensed. Subsequent expenditure on 
capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset 
to which it relates. The Group estimates the useful life of these assets as between three and five years, except for certain 
licence costs which are considered to have indefinite useful life and are reviewed annually for evidence of impairment.
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Cost comprises the fair value of any assets transferred, liabilities 
assumed and equity instruments issued, plus, for acquisitions completed prior to 1 January 2010, any direct costs 
associated with the acquisition. 
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated 
income statement. Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of 
consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated income statement on the acquisition.
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010 changes in the estimated value of contingent consideration 
post acquisition are treated as an adjustment to cost and therefore change the carrying value of goodwill. For business 
combinations completed after that date changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are charged or credited 
to the income statement. In addition, for those business combinations completed after 1 January 2010, the direct costs of 
acquisition are treated immediately as an expense.

Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. Assets are assessed at each 
balance sheet date for indications of impairment. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets  
less their estimated residual values over their expected useful lives. The annual depreciation rates are as follows: 
IT equipment 33%
Office furniture and equipment 7–15%
Motor vehicles 15%
Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives
Impairment of non-financial assets 
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually  
on 31 December, and where applicable an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. Other non-
financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of 
value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on 
the asset’s cash generating unit (i.e. the lowest Group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows). 
financial instruments 
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Investment in equity accounted joint ventures
Jointly controlled entities (JCE) are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by 
contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions.
JCEs are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are recognized initially at cost.  
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that losses 
in excess of the Group’s investment in the JCEs are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good those losses. 
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its JCEs are recognised only to the extent of unrelated 
investors’ interests in the JCE. The investor’s share in the JCEs profits and losses resulting from these transactions is 
eliminated against the carrying value of the JCEs.
Any premium paid for a JCE above the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the JCE. Where there is objective evidence that 
the investment in a JCE has been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same 
way as other non-financial assets. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost and principally comprise amounts due from 
credit card companies and from e-payment companies. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the  
full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when there is objective evidence that the full amount may not 
be collected.  54

Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into contracts for derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge risks 
associated with foreign exchange rates. Such derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value under IAS 39 and 
comprise level two fair value measurement instrument and carried in the statement of financial position as assets when 
the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair 
values of derivatives are recorded immediately in the consolidated income statement.
A fair value measurement hierarchy is based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value to increase 
consistency and comparability. The inputs are categorised into three levels, with the highest priority given to unadjusted 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs. Level 
two inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level one that are either directly or indirectly observable for 
the asset or liability. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash. They include short-term deposits originally purchased with maturities of 
three months or less. 
Equity 
Equity issued by the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost. 
Liabilities to customers 
Liabilities to customers comprises the amounts that are credited to customers’ bankroll (the Group’s electronic ‘wallet’), 
including provision for bonuses granted by the Group, less management fees and charges applied to customer accounts, 
along with full provision for jackpots. These amounts are repayable on demand in accordance with the applicable terms 
and conditions. 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets comprise non-derivative financial assets not included in any of the above financial asset 
categories and comprise principally the Group’s investments in entities not qualifying as joint ventures or subsidiaries. 
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in a separate component of equity. Where there 
is a significant decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset the full amount of the impairment, including 
any amount previously charged to equity, is recognised in the income statement. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset 
any balance within equity is transferred to the income statement. 
Chargebacks 
The cost of chargebacks is included in operating expenses.

Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to income on  
a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which  
it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated. 
Segment information 
Segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the management team comprising the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Chief Financial Officer. These segments are: 
● ● B2C (Business to Customer) Casino, Poker, Bingo and Emerging Offering which mainly comprises 888’s Sportsbook, 
Live dealer offering and games, Mytopia social games; and
● ● B2B (Business to Business) which offers Total Gaming Services under the Dragonfish trading brand. Dragonfish 
offers to its business partners use of technology, software, operations, e-payments and advances marketing services, 
through the provision of offline/online marketing, management of affiliates, SEO, CRM and business analytics. 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends this is when paid. In the case 
of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
Share-based payments 
Where the Company grants its employees or contractors shares, nil priced options or market value options, the fair value 
at the date of grant is charged to the income statement over the vesting period. Non-market performance conditions are 
taken into account by adjusting the number of instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, 
the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest. 
Severance pay schemes
Severance scheme surpluses and deficits are measured at:
● ● The fair value of plan assets at the reporting date; less
● ● Plan liabilities calculated using the projected unit credit method discounted to its present value using yields available 
for the appropriate government bonds that have maturity dates appropriately to the terms of the liabilities; plus
● ● Unrecognised past service costs.
Any difference between the expected return on assets and that actually achieved, and any changes in liabilities over the 
year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the scheme, are recognised in other comprehensive income in 
the period in which they arise.
financial guarantee contracts
Where the Group enters into financial guarantee contracts the Group considers these to be insurance contracts and 
accounts for them as such. The Group treats the guarantee as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable 
that the Group will be required to make payments under the guarantee. 56

1  Following the departure of the former CEO on 30 April 2011, the Group has restructured its management team resulting in aggregated 
terminated staff and related costs of US$4,949,000 for the year ended 31 December 2011 of which US$3,909,000 are in relation to the 
former CEO. Total costs include $503,000 in respect of accelerated share benefit charges arising on termination.
  During 2010 the Group initiated measures designed to reduce its overheads and increase operational efficiency. These measures mainly 
affected employment costs and included redundancies across the Group’s locations. Costs associated with these redundancies are 
reflected in the restructuring cost line for the year ended 31 December 2010.

Severance pay liability — Israel 
The Group’s employees in Israel are eligible to receive certain benefits from the Group in certain defined circumstances. 
As such the Group operates a defined benefit severance pay plan which requires contributions to be made to separately 
administrated funds. 
The method used to determine the current service cost and the present value of the defined benefit obligation, according 
to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ is the Projected Unit Credit actuarial cost method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
by the Group using the equity method.

Gibraltar — The Company and its Gibraltar registered subsidiaries were subject to the provisions of the Gibraltar 
Companies (Taxation and Concessions) Act (the ‘CTCA’) as tax-exempt companies. Subject to a change of ownership or 
activity of a tax-exempt company, the grandfathering of tax-exempt benefits in respect of existing tax-exempt companies 
extended up to 31 December 2010. Commencing as of 1 January 2011, Gibraltar companies are subject to a corporate tax

9 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share 
In accordance with IAS 33, ‘Earnings per share’, the weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share 
takes into account all potentially dilutive shares and share options granted, which are not included in the number of  
shares for basic earnings per share. In addition, certain employee options have also been excluded from the calculation  
of diluted EPS as their exercise price is greater than the weighted average share price during the year and it would not be 
advantageous for the holders to exercise the option. The number of options excluded from the diluted EPS calculation is 
1,305,779 (2010: 781,953).

mytopia social games
On 16 June 2010 the Group acquired the trade and assets comprising the Mytopia social games development studio 
(“Mytopia”) from Real Dice Inc. for an all cash consideration.
In calculating the goodwill arising on acquisition, the fair value of the assets of Mytopia were valued by a professional 
valuation firm and recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised) and adjustments from book value were necessary. 
These adjustments are summarized as follows: 
Book value on

The fair value relates to the recognition of online bingo game application (US$830,000), software licence agreement 
(US$410,000), non-compete agreement (US$540,000) and a service agreement (US$90,000) acquired as part of the 
acquisition. The online bingo game application intangible asset is being amortised over its estimated useful economic life 
of three years. The software licence agreement intangible asset is being amortised over its estimated useful economic life 
of nine months. The non-compete agreement intangible asset is being amortised over its estimated useful economic life of 
four years. The service agreement is being amortised over its estimated useful economic life of one year. 
During the year the goodwill arising on acquisition of US$20,173,000 was tested for impairment and fully provided against. 
Further details are given in note 12.
The Group paid US$6.0 million in February 2011 of contingent consideration in respect of the acquisition. The remaining 
contingent consideration of US$5.1 million (before discounting) that was recognised on acquisition has been written back 
in the year. Further details are given in note 21.
Wink online Bingo business
On 31 December 2009 the Group acquired the trade and assets comprising the Wink online Bingo business of Daub 
Limited (‘Wink Bingo Business’) for an all cash consideration.
As noted in last year’s annual report the financial performance of the Wink business post acquisition led to increases in the 
contingent consideration payable. In March 2011 the Group entered into an amendment agreement to fix the consideration 
payable. Further details are given in note 21.
The unwinding of the discount element of the deferred consideration is charged to finance expenses in the Income 
statement.

1  As a result of the financial performance of the Wink Bingo business since the commencement of the earn-out period on 1 April 2010 the 
Board revised its estimate of the potential contingent consideration that would  become payable to US$75.5 million in 2010. This estimate 
was based on the assumption that the earn-out payment would reach its contractual cap. As the Wink Bingo acquisition was accounted 
for under IFRS 3 (2004) the adjustment to contingent consideration was taken to goodwill. On 18 March 2011 the Group announced that 
it had entered into an amendment agreement with the Wink Bingo vendors to reschedule the earn out payment payable in May 2011.

12 Intangible assets continued
Bingo Online Business 
Intangible assets and goodwill associated with the cash generating online Bingo business unit relates to the acquisition 
of the online Bingo business of Globalcom Limited during 2007 and the acquisition of the Wink Bingo business in 2009. 
The income streams generated from the bingo business, comprising the B2C Bingo cash generating unit and the B2B cash 
generating unit, have been treated together as the risks and rewards associated with those income streams are deemed to 
be sufficiently similar. 
At the year end, the carrying value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the online 
Bingo cash generating units, to their present value. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were those 
regarding discount rate and growth rates of the business. The Directors estimate discount rates that reflect the current 
market assessment of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the online Bingo business. The discount rate that 
is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is 8% (2010: 12%) being the Group’s specific weighted average cost of 
capital which also applies to the online Bingo cash generating units. 
Discount rate is re-calculated each year by taking into account prevailing risk free rates, equity risk premium and beta.  
The result this year was a lower discount rate primarily due to a lower company beta.
In estimating the future cash flows the Group has used conservative estimates in respect of revenues generated and costs 
incurred and therefore certain B2B contracts due to end in the next five years have not been projected to be renewed 
and have been expected to decline gradually over the period to contract end. Growth rates of the online Bingo business 
are based on past experience and projections of future changes in the online gaming market, taking into account external 
sources of information such as analysts' research reports. These suggest that Bingo is expected to demonstrate year on 
year growth. The Group has used lower growth rates in estimating the future cash flows conservatively reflecting the 
current uncertainties about the medium-term global economic outlook. The Directors have used forecasts for the next  
five years of the expected cash flows, of which the first year is based on the Group's current approved budget. 
Excluding the effects of B2B contracts projected to come to an end over the five year period, an annual underlying growth 
rate of 2% (2010: 7%) was used for 2012 mainly attributed to the stabilization in the Wink Bingo business revenues after 
the earn out period ended on March 2011. For 2013-2016, no growth rate was assumed (2010: no growth). Following year 
five, the Group extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity, using an estimated conservative growth rate of 1% (2010: 1%), which 
is lower than the forecast long-term growth rate of the UK economy. Marketing costs associated with the Bingo cash 
generating units were projected as a fixed percentage of revenues. All other operational costs are forecast as percentage 
of revenue, such percentage increased conservatively by 6% (2010: 7%) in each of the five year periods to 2016, over and 
above the level of growth in revenues and well above the actual level experienced in 2011.
The Directors are not aware at this time of any need to change their key assumptions on which they have based their 
determination of the recoverable amount of the goodwill which would cause its carrying amount to exceed its recoverable 
amount. In fact, although such movements are not expected to arise, neither a 1% decrease in the growth rate in each of 
the next three years nor a 5% increase in the discount rate would have led to an impairment of the acquired intangible 
assets and goodwill in the current year.
Mytopia social games
The Group has performed an impairment review during the year on the cash generating Mytopia social games unit which 
was acquired in June 2010, and was affected by commercial disputes which arose during the year over two branded social 
games which Mytopia was developing. This review compared carrying value to value in use and fair value less costs to 
sell, adjusting  the originally forecast revenue arising. Due to the overall reduced expectation of income growth from the 
Mytopia business, it was determined that the recoverable amount of that business was US$957,000 based on an estimate 
by management of fair value less costs to sell which has resulted in a full impairment charge of US$20,173,000 against 
goodwill. Other assets acquired have not been impaired.

12 Intangible assets continued
The impairment charge has been taken to administrative expenses in the consolidated Income statement and is included 
within the B2C operating segment.
Other intangible assets associated with the cash generating Mytopia social games unit acquired during June 2010 
including an online bingo game application, software licence agreement, non-compete agreement and a service 
agreement, are being amortized over their estimated useful economic lives of up to four years.
At the previous year end, the carrying value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to their 
present value. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were those regarding discount rate, users’ life time 
value, marketing spend and growth rates of the business. 
In estimating the future cash flows the Directors used estimates in respect of revenues generated and costs incurred. 
Growth rates of the Mytopia business were based on projections of future changes in the social games market, taking into 
account external sources of information such as analysts’ research reports and publicly available information that analyzes 
KPIs of various social networks game providers and the development of new games by Mytopia. Forecast revenues 
assumed lower user’s life value compared to other major social games.
The Directors used forecasts for the following five years of the expected cash flows, of which the first year was based on 
the Group’s 2011 budget. Revenue was forecast to grow between 2011 and 2014 assuming a compound quarterly growth 
of 21%, and cost of sales was forecast at an average of 23% of revenue. Marketing costs were projected to increase by a 
fixed compounded monthly percentage during 2012 to 2014 across all games. All other overhead costs (mainly wages) 
were forecast in line with 2011 budget which, on an annualized basis assumed an increase of 50% over 2010 actual figures. 
Thereafter these costs were assumes to increase by 3 % in each of 2012 to 2014. Following year five, the Group used a long 
term growth rate of 2%. The Directors estimated discount rates of 18%.  
Internet domain name
During 2008 the Group acquired an internet domain name based business which is used to generate traffic into the 
Group’s various websites. Out of total consideration of US$513,000, an intangible asset of US$13,000 was recognized 
whilst the remainder of US$500,000 was recognised as goodwill. 
The Group has performed an impairment review at the year end, in respect of the carrying value-in-use of the internet 
domain name. comparing carrying value to value in use and fair value less costs to sell, adjusting the originally forecast 
revenue arising. Due to the overall reduced expectation of income growth from the internet domain, it was determined that 
the recoverable amount of the internet domain was nil based on an estimate by management of fair value less costs to sell 
which has resulted in a full impairment charge of US$500,000 against goodwill and US$13,000 against intangible assets. 
Licences
In respect of certain licences costs amounting to US$3.7 million where the Group considers these to have an indefinite life, 
the Group has conducted an impairment review at the period end, in respect of the carrying value-in-use of its licences 
comparing carrying value to value in use and fair value less costs to sell. At the year end, the carrying value-in-use was 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit (CGU), to its present 
value. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were those regarding discount rate and growth rates of the 
business. The Directors estimate discount rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and 
risks appropriate to the relevant CGU. The discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is 8% being 
the Group’s specific weighted average cost of capital. 68
21273-04  04/04/2012 Proof 17
888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2011
12 Intangible assets continued
The Group has used prudent growth of 3% in respect of revenue and conservative costs figures in assessing the expected 
cash flows from the CGU. At 31 December 2011 no impairment needs to be recognised. 
Internally generated intangible assets 
The Group has put in place processes and procedures which enable it to ascertain technological feasibility before 
development costs are incurred and therefore be in a position to capitalise costs incurred after that point. Such 
expenditure is only capitalised when the development cost meets the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition 
criteria as set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’. 
The Group estimates the useful life of these assets as between three and five years. These assets are subject to 
impairment test wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
on the same basis as described above for acquired intangible assets. At 31 December 2011 no impairment needs to be 
recognised and the carrying value of internally generated assets is considered appropriate.

1  On 18 March 2011 the Group announced that it had entered into an amendment agreement with the Wink Bingo vendors to reschedule 
the earn out payment payable in May 2011. The earn out payment reached its maximum cap of £59.7 million out of which £11 million was 
paid on 31 December 2009. Under the revised payment terms the Group made a payment out of its cash resources of £9.26 million on 
18 March 2011, £9.26 million on 21 May 2011 and £6.173 million on 31 August 2011. On 23 February 2012 the Group paid an amount of £20.2 
million resulting in a balance of £3.8 million payable on 21 May 2012 without a penalty. Payments after 21 May 2011 bear interest at 15% per 
annum. The Group has implemented security over the assets comprising the Wink bingo business in favor of the vendors.
2  On February 2011 the Group paid US$6.0 million due upon meeting certain milestones connected to the mobile and social networking 
games. An estimated earn-out payment of US$5.1 million was supposed to be payable in cash during the second quarter of 2012 based 
on achieving certain performance criteria during 2011. The subsequent financial performance has led to a release of that liability as the 
performance criteria were not achieved.

Prior to flotation, the Company adopted two equity-settled employee share incentive plans — the 888 All-Employee 
Share Plan and the Long-term Incentive Plan. The 888 All-Employee Share Plan is open to all employees and Executive 
Directors of the Group who are not within six months of their normal retirement age at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee. Awards under this scheme will vest in instilments over a fixed period of up to four years. 
The Company grants awards to certain Executive Directors and members of its senior management. These awards are 
subject to performance conditions imposed by the Remuneration Committee at the dates of grant.

27 financial risk management 
The Group is exposed through its operations to risks that arise from use of its financial instruments. Policies and 
procedures for managing these risks are set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer.  
The Board reviews the effectiveness of these procedures and, if required, approves specific policies and procedures  
in order to mitigate these risks. 
The main financial instruments used by the Group, on which financial risk arises, are as follows: 
● ● Cash and cash equivalents.
● ● Restricted cash.
● ● Trade and other receivables.
● ● Trade and other payables.
● ● Liabilities to customers.
● ● Contingent consideration on acquisition.
● ● Available-for-sale financial investments.
Detailed analysis of these financial instruments is as follows:

In accordance with IAS 39, all of the above financial liabilities are held at amortised cost, except for US$1,534,000 relating 
to the forward currency contracts to hedge risks associated with foreign exchange rates. Such derivative financial 
instruments are measured at fair value under IAS 39 and comprise level two fair value measurement instruments.  
(2010: US$82,271,000 relating to the contingent consideration arising on acquisitions which are recognised at fair value). 
At 31 December 2011 and 2010, the fair value and the book value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities were 
materially the same.

Capital
The capital employed by the Group is composed of equity attributable to shareholders. The primary objective of the 
Group is maximizing shareholders’ value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital 
structure most suited to the Group’s size, strategy, and underlying business risk. Other than disclosed elsewhere in 
note 28, there are no demands or restrictions on the Group’s capital. 
The main financial risk areas are as follows: 
Credit risk
Trade receivables
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables who are the Group’s payment service providers (‘PSP’). 
These are third party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawals of funds to and from customers’ virtual wallet 
with the Group. These are mainly intermediaries that transact on behalf of the main credit card companies. 
The risk is that a PSP would fail to discharge its obligation with regard to the balance owed to the Group. The Group 
reduces this credit risk by: 
● ● Monitoring those balances on a regular basis.
● ● Arranging for the shortest possible cash settlement intervals.
● ● Replacing rolling reserve requirements, where they exist, with a Letter of Credit by a reputable financial institution.
● ● Ensuring a new PSP is only contracted following various due diligence and ‘Know Your Customer’ procedures.
● ● Ensuring policies are in place to reduce dependency on any specific PSP.
The Group believes that based on the above and on extensive past experience, the PSP receivables are of good credit 
quality and there is no requirement to provide for any potential bad debts arising from a PSP failing to discharge its 
obligation. None of the balances owed by the various PSP are overdue or impaired (2010: nil). 
An additional credit risk the Group faces relates to customers disputing charges made to their credit cards (‘chargebacks’) 
or any other funding method they have used in respect of the services provided by the Group. Customers may fail to fulfil 
their obligation to pay which will result in funds not being collected. These chargebacks and uncollected deposits, when 
occurring, will be deducted at source by the PSPs from any amount due to the Group. As such the Group provides for 
these eventualities by way of a provision based on analysis of past transactions. This provision is netted off from the trade 
receivables balance and at 31 December 2011 was US$1,161,000 (2010: US$886,000). 
The Group’s in-house Fraud and Risk Management department carefully monitors deposits and withdrawals by following 
prevention and verification procedures using internally developed bespoke systems integrated with commercially available 
third party measures. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
The Group controls its cash position out of its Gibraltar headquarters. Subsidiaries in its other locations (Israel, Antigua 
and London) maintain minimum cash balances which are deemed required for their operations. 
Cash settlement proceeds from PSPs, as described above, are paid into bank accounts controlled by the Treasury function. 
The Group maintains its funds with highly reputable financial institutions and will not hold funds with financial institutions 
with low credit rating. 
The Group maintains its cash reserve in highly liquid deposits and regularly monitors rates in order to maximize yield.  78

become due. 
The Group monitors its liquidity in order to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to allow it to meet its 
obligations.

market risk 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the interest bearing deposits in which the Group invests surplus 
funds. 
The Group’s policy is to invest surplus funds in low risk money market funds or on call over night facilities. The Group also 
arranges with its principal bankers that excess funds are swept automatically across its accounts, every night, in order to 
maximize availability of funds for investments. 
Downside interest rate risk is minimal as the Group has no floating rates borrowings. Given current low US$ interest rate 
a 0.5% downward movement in bank interest rates would not have a significant impact on finance income for the year. 
However, a 0.5% increase in interest rates would, based on the year-end deposits, increase annual profits by US$250,000. 
Currency risk 
The Group’s financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations is mainly attributed to: 
● ● Mismatch between Balance sheet Liabilities to customers which is predominantly denominated in US$ and the net 
receipts from customers which are settled in the currency of the customer’s choice, of which sterling (GBP) and euros 
(EUR) are significant.
● ● Mismatch between reported revenue which is mainly generated in USD (the Group’s functional and reporting 
currency) and significant portion of deposits which are settled in local currencies. 
● ● Expenses, the majority of which are denominated in foreign currencies including sterling (GBP), euro (EUR) and 
New Israeli shekel (ILS).
● ● The Wink Bingo deferred consideration is denominated in GBP. The Group entered into a specific forward contract in 
order to fix the economic impact of the currency mismatch.
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure 
is kept to an acceptable level, inter alia by using foreign exchange forward contracts designed to fix the economic impact 
of known liabilities. At 31 December 2011 there were 20,000,000 GBP outstanding forward contracts regarding the Wink 
deferred liability whose fair value is US$1,534,000 and with a remaining contractual life of five months.

28 Contingent liabilities and regulatory issues
(a) As part of the Board’s ongoing regulatory compliance and operational risk assessment process, the Board continues to 
monitor legal and regulatory developments, and their potential impact on the business, and continues to take appropriate 
advice in respect of these developments. 
(b) Given the nature of the legal and regulatory landscape of the industry, from time-to-time the Group has received notices, 
communications and legal actions from a small number of regulatory authorities and other parties in respect of its 
activities. The Group has taken legal advice as to the manner in which it should respond and the likelihood of success 
of such actions. Based on this advice and the nature of the actions, the Board is unable to quantify reliably any material 
outflow of funds that may result, if any. Accordingly, no provisions have been made. 
(c) The Group operates in numerous jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Group is filing tax returns, providing for and paying 
all taxes it believes are due based on local tax laws, transfer pricing agreements and tax advice obtained. The Group 
is periodically subject to audits and assessments by local taxing authorities. The Board is unable to quantify reliably 
any exposure for additional taxes, if any, that may arise from the final settlement of such assessments. Accordingly no 
additional provisions have been made.
29 Post balance sheet events
(a) As part of commercial negotiations between the Group and one of its B2B white label customers, the Group has acquired 
the customer’s domain names and brands as at 1 January 2012. As a result the Group will be recognising the income within 
its B2C business for 2012 rather than the net commission charged within B2B income as was the case for 2011. Based upon 
the provisional estimates of fair value there is no material effect on the Group assets and liabilities.
(b) On 23 February 2012 the Group prepaid £20.2 million of the Wink deferred consideration to reduce interest costs.  
This resulted in a balance of £3.8 million payable on 21 May 2012 without a penalty. 82

impairment provision required. 
The following standard issued by the IASB has not been adopted by the Company as this was not effective for the year

periods. 
IAS27 Separate Financial Statements (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). IAS27 has

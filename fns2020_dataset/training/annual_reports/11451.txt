if larger quantities are consumed. Common offenders include milk 
products, wheat and other grains that contain gluten.
Autoimmune disease P4
Autoimmune diseases arise from an overactive immune response  
of the body against substances and tissues normally present in  
the body – i.e. the body attacks its own cells. 
Infectious disease P6
Infectious diseases are clinically evident diseases that result  
from the presence of infectious agents such as microbial agents, 
including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, multicellular parasites, 
and aberrant proteins known as prions.

Our Strategy for Growth
Strategy
Our global distribution network and increasing routes to market 
have been crucial to our success this year. We now have a 
significant presence in the food intolerance testing market  
but opportunities still exist for more expansion in this area and 
other high-growth niche markets such as IgE Allergy testing.

Chairman’s Statement
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report the progress 
we have made throughout the Group, 
both in delivering organic growth from 
existing products and the completion 
of a small acquisition in the year.
Strategy
The Group has achieved another year of solid progress where  
the in-house strength of being able to build successful distribution 
relationships has led to further growth for key products. Food 
Detective™ has performed particularly strongly where its market 
positioning, focussed on the professional nutritionist market in  
the UK and abroad, has enabled growth into over 40 countries.  
The Genarrayt™ microarray assay system continues to offer 
laboratories superior performance over conventional microplate 
formats and is now being used in all five continental regions we 
report on. These two products were key in delivering growth 
following the acquisition of Genesis-CNS and it is pleasing to  
report their ongoing success. Future growth will also be dependent 
on our ability to use the microarray platform for tests other than for 
food intolerance, and our ability to identify and execute on other 
opportunities will be key to this.
We also successfully achieved the opportunistic acquisition of  
Co-Tek (South West) Ltd in September last year which, prior to  
its acquisition, was already a supplier to the Group through an 
intermediary company. Bringing Co-Tek into the fold has put  
us in a position of being able to supply part of the range of  
infectious disease products on a more competitive basis.
We are grateful for the support from existing and new shareholders in 
supporting the £1m fundraising for this transaction and we continue 
to review suitable acquisition opportunities in recognition of a need  
to transform ourselves if we are truly to deliver shareholder and 
stakeholder value and benefits.
Financial
Turnover for the Group increased to £6.2 million (2009: £5.4 million),  
up 14% over last year. We are pleased with the achievement of this 
result against an economic backdrop that has been challenging for 
many, and we will continue to ensure a wide geographic coverage  
for our products to mitigate this risk as far as possible.
The Group achieved an EBITDA of £698k (2009: £915k) before 
exceptional items and share-based payment charges. The relative 
strength of sterling against the US dollar compared to the previous year 
led to a turnaround in foreign exchange differences on trading activities 
of £122k, with a loss this year of £28k (2009: £94k gain). The remaining 
difference of £95k arises on the increase in gross profit of £272k being 
offset by increased investment in operational costs of £367k, driven 
largely by an increase in sales and marketing costs to support the 
increased sales growth I have referred to above.
We consistently report on adjusted profit before tax so shareholders 
can easily gauge our performance as compared to external market 
forecasts. The Group achieved an increase in adjusted profit before tax 
to £589k (2009: £540k). This figure is arrived at by taking headline profit 
before tax of £210k and adding back analyst-adjusted items including 
IFRS-related net discount charges of £92k, amortisation of intangible 
assets of £109k and share-based payment charges of £178k.
“ Turnover has continued its growth 
of recent years, climbing to £6.2 
million representing an increase  
of 14% over last year.”
David Evans
Non-executive Chairman 11
Overview Annual Report and Accounts 2010
www.omegadiagnostics.com
Net finance costs have reduced significantly to £97k (2009: £306k)  
for two reasons. Firstly, the benign environment for interest rates  
has seen the UK base rate at 0.50% throughout the year which  
has led to a reduction in net interest on borrowings and secondly,  
the strengthening of sterling against the US dollar has the opposite 
effect leading to translation gains on US dollar borrowings. 
Profit after tax amounted to £187k (2009: £221k) which resulted in 
earnings per share of 1.0p versus earnings per share of 1.4p in the 
previous year. 
Balance sheet
The Group has intangible assets of £5.2 million (2009: £4.9 million)  
at the year-end comprised of goodwill of £3.3 million and intangible 
assets of £1.8 million, separately identified in line with current IFRS. 
The Group performs annual impairment reviews under current 
accounting standards and is comfortable with the carrying value  
of its intangible assets given the growth and results for the year  
just ended.
Net debt (total borrowings less cash) reduced to £1.26 million from 
£1.64 million as the Group continues to generate cash in excess of 
servicing its borrowings.
Research and development
It is our aim to widen the use of our microarray platform into areas 
capable of delivering increased value, to mirror successes seen  
with the food intolerance assays, which will require an increase  
in production capacity. Last year we embarked upon a project  
to upgrade the method to manufacture array slides. This project  
had certain technical issues and, whilst progress was made,  
the equipment supplier was unable to resolve all the issues to our 
satisfaction and we took the difficult decision to terminate the project 
for our existing food intolerance assays. We have since sourced
increased capacity for the tried-and-tested method and are 
comfortable with the capacity now available for production needs. 
Future development needs can, to a large extent, be met from existing 
capacity. However, we believe that by working in conjunction with the 
supplier we can resolve the technical issues so that non-contact 
printing can be commissioned for future intended applications.
Board and employees
As announced during the year, Geoff Gower joined the Board on 
22 December 2009. Geoff joined the Group in May 2009 as the 
Managing Director of Genesis and CNS and his experience in 
operations and general management of diagnostics companies 
will no doubt be of benefit for our future aims.
I know the results achieved for the year don’t happen automatically 
and I would like to thank all employees for their hard work where,  
in the second half in particular, much effort was made in delivering 
results in line with expectations.
Outlook
Trading in the first three months of the year is in line with current 
management expectation.
We continue to review acquisition opportunities to transform the Group 
and whilst there can be no guarantee of completing any transaction,  
I hope to be able to update you with progress on this element of our 
strategy during this financial year.

Chief Executive’s Review
Strategy update
Our global distribution network and increasing routes to market have  
been crucial to our success this year, despite some issues with the 
microarray production technology. We now have a significant presence  
in the food intolerance testing market but opportunities still exist for more 
expansion in this area. While we continue to see good organic growth 
with both the Genarrayt™ microarray and Food Detective™ macroarray 
technologies, organic growth alone is not sufficient to see the change  
that we all wish to see.
Acquisitive growth to ensure transformational change is key for the 
year ahead and we believe that good value propositions exist that  
can deliver growth. 13
Business Review Annual Report and Accounts 2010
www.omegadiagnostics.com
I am pleased to report that the Group has seen an increase in revenue 
for the year to £6.20 million, some 14% ahead of last year’s figures 
(2009: £5.44 million). Revenue increased in two of the three key areas  
of product application with the exception of infectious disease tests.
Infectious disease tests
Sales of infectious disease tests decreased to £1.79 million (2009: 
£1.83 million) for the year representing a decline of 2.0% which was 
due to lost tender business in a key market in the Middle East. The 
small acquisition of Co-Tek (South West) Ltd in late September 2009 
gave the Group a secure supply of low-cost bacterial diagnostic 
tests. Prior to the acquisition they had been exclusively supplying one 
of our competitors, who in turn had been supplying us. They, in turn, 
had been acquired by another competitor in a consolidation deal,  
so threatening our supply. Our ability to capture and control the 
supply chain, with decreased costs, has provided us with more 
competitive pricing for our international markets. We therefore  
expect better results in the year ahead as we access larger volume 
business with international tenders which traditionally have longer 
lead times. We have also seized the opportunity to conclude a 
long-term supply agreement with the former supplier which  
secures sales going forward.
Food intolerance
Food intolerance testing has seen a growth of 31% in the year 
resulting in sales of £2.96 million. (2009: £2.26 million).
For the Genarrayt™ laboratory system and on-going reagent sales, 
we have seen growth in sales to £1.04 million (2009: £0.72 million). 
This growth has been achieved by the installation of 15 new systems 
into a further eight territories as well as increasing the number of 
installed systems in countries already active with Genarrayt™.  
This now brings the total number of installed systems up to 57  
since launch. Sales of Genarrayt™ food intolerance systems  
reached £212k (2009: £146k) with sales of reagent kits reaching 
£828k (2009: £574k). 
As with the Genarrayt™ system, the Food Detective™ test for food 
intolerance has seen sales rise to £790k (2009: £314k) with sales  
into many new countries around the world. The number of countries 
where we have now sold product has increased to 46 (2009: 18), 
resulting in an increase in volumes of approximately 150% to 
34,241 kits (2009: 13,392). Additional distributors from other 
countries are in discussion and product registration has recently 
been achieved in Brazil, one of the Group’s largest single markets 
and a key strategic market going forward. Registration in China  
is proceeding but the timescale for completion is somewhat 
indeterminate given the complex regulatory environment existing  
in that country. 
The UK market has also seen a doubling in sales to £216k  
(2009: £104k) following a promotional campaign and by opening up 
sales to professional re-sellers. In addition, the testing services for 
food intolerance and other related tests have shown an increase in 
business to £371k (2009: £314k) and further development of this  
side of the business is anticipated.
“ We have continued to increase 
sales of key products, particularly 
in food intolerance testing, through 
further expansion of our global 
distribution network and we are 
going to build upon this success  
by the introduction of new 
products in high-value markets.”
Andrew Shepherd
Chief Executive 14
Business Review Annual Report and Accounts 2010

Chief Executive’s Review
(continued)
Autoimmune tests
Sales of autoimmune tests increased by 5% to £660k (2009: £630k) 
with growth restrained by the fact that the tests are manual assays 
without a dedicated equipment platform. In a market that is 
increasingly becoming controlled by ‘closed systems’, i.e. tests that 
can only be used on dedicated equipment, we do not see this area 
as a source for major growth in the future although some work has 
been done on adapting several of the tests to be able to work on 
other companies ‘open systems’, i.e. equipment that will allow the  
use of any manufacturer’s test kits.
While the application of the Genarrayt™ microarray technology to 
autoimmune disease testing had been considered, better prospects 
for the application of this technology have emerged (see Research 
and development).
Distribution network
The Group’s strength in distribution has seen it record growth in all 
geographic regions into which it sells. Apart from South and Central 
America, all other regions showed double-digit growth in percentage 
terms, growth which we expect to continue as we see a further roll 
out of Genarrayt™ systems and increased sales traction of Food 
Detective™ with existing distributors.
One area of business under development is the partnership with 
regional affiliated laboratories who offer food intolerance tests under 
the CNS name using the Genarrayt™ assay system and FoodPrint™ 
results trademark. This allows local provision of food intolerance  
tests in countries where, until recently, customers had to send their 
samples either to Europe or the US at great expense and with a long 
time delay. This aspect of market expansion is starting to take hold  
in the Middle East and we plan to extend this side of the business  
to other geographical areas throughout the year.
Research and development
In early 2009 we invested in a high throughput, non-contact 
microarray printer to handle the expected increase in Genarrayt™ 
business. Unfortunately, several technical issues prevented the 
equipment coming into routine production and the supplier was 
unable to resolve them to our satisfaction. In December 2009 we 
made the decision to retain the previous contact printing method 
whilst trying to resolve the outstanding technical issues with the  
new equipment. Although slightly less efficient than the non-contact 
printer, this meant we could continue production and supply of 
Genarrayt™ kits. By the end of March 2010, it was clear that the 
issues could not be resolved to our satisfaction and the decision  
was taken to remain with the established method for producing food 
intolerance arrays. In order to increase capacity of the array slides  
we have invested in additional contact printers which have also 
improved our yield. We are confident that future anticipated growth  
of Genarrayt™ products will be unaffected by the decision to stay 
with the contact printing method for the immediate future and 
manufacturing capacity is now secured for next year.
During the year most of the R&D resource was allocated to production 
and product support duties so the ability to develop new products was 
reduced. However, with resolution to production capacity issues we 
expect to be able to spend more time developing additional products 
on the Genarrayt™ microarray platform. We aim to deliver new variants 
of the IgG Genarrayt™ food intolerance assay to be able to compete 
better with our competitors and these will also include food additives 
which, until now, have not been included on the array. Several projects 
for new product development have been initiated which we expect to 
positively impact in the new financial year. 15
Business Review Annual Report and Accounts 2010
www.omegadiagnostics.com
The IgE Allergy testing market has been identified as a high-value 
niche market for application of the Genarrayt™ microarray 
technology. This will require the development of a ‘closed system’ 
which fully automates the test procedure and opportunities for 
collaboration with instrumentation companies are being explored. 
Adaptation of existing testing platforms for the arrays will mean 
reduced time to market, less development risk and cost. Work  
was completed on a Chinese variant of the Food Detective™ 
macroarray test and an Indian variant is planned for the near  
future which we expect to launch following the completion of  
product registration formalities.
Outlook
The outlook for the new financial year is encouraging and we 
continue to review promising opportunities, both organic and 
acquisitive. The market for the Group’s products continues to  
expand despite local difficulties in some eurozone countries.  
The major growth in the world IVD market, in particular, in  
countries such as India, China and Brazil, should compensate  
for any reduction in sales in problematic markets, which is one  
of the key strengths of the Group’s global distribution network.

of the IgG Genarrayt™ food

Omega still believes that viable 
acquisition opportunities exist 
and we are still pursuing this 
strategy in order to build  
critical mass and increase 
shareholder value. 16
Business Review Annual Report and Accounts 2010
www.omegadiagnostics.com
Financial Review
The Group has achieved 14% 
growth in sales for the year with  
a particularly strong performance  
in the second half. 
The Group has reported an adjusted profit before tax of £589,511 
(2009: £540,439). The Group reports on adjusted profit before tax 
(excluding IFRS-related items of share-based payment charges, 
amortisation of intangible assets and discount charges) to provide  
a better understanding of the results of our normal trading activities 
compared to external research forecasts. 
Trading activities
Revenue
Revenue for the year was £6,198,742 representing an increase of 14% 
over the previous year (2009: £5,438,313) and includes growth in all 
five major continental regions. In particular, the growth of Genarrayt™ 
systems and Food Detective™ kits for food intolerance has 
underpinned much of this.
Gross profit
Gross profit for the year was £3,616,220 (2009: £3,344,264) resulting 
in a gross margin percentage of 58.3%% (2009: 61.5%). As explained 
at the time of the interim results, some suppliers have increased 
costs due to the economic environment but internally, the Group  
has also increased operational headcount to cope with increased 
demand. The margin has been maintained during the second half 
of the year where the Group sold more Genarrayt™ systems than  
it originally expected and, whilst these provide a useful source of 
revenue, they are sold at lower margins. The substantial growth in 
Food Detective™ volumes has also driven revenue growth but the 
mix between these sales and those from the laboratory services 
division is weighted towards a lower margin than otherwise would  
be the case.
Administration costs
Administration costs, excluding exceptional costs, have increased  
by £382,686 to £2,508,608 (2009: £2,125,922). A relatively small 
foreign exchange loss on trading activities in the year of £28,146 
(2009: £94,652 gain) represents an increased charge of £122,798 
over the previous year. Share-based payments charges have 
increased by £100,427 representing the larger one-year vesting 
period for options granted in December 2008 that falls within the 
current year. Other administrative increases of £159,461 reflect 
increased headcount, general increases to salaries across the  
Group and the acquisition of the Co-Tek business during the year.
There were no exceptional costs during the year (2009: £80,301) 
as there were in the previous year relating to an aborted acquisition 
opportunity. Costs of £80,978 related to the acquisition of Co-Tek 
were treated as an acquisition cost in line with IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations. It should be noted that this Standard has since  
been revised so that future acquisition costs will be accounted  
for through the statement of comprehensive income.
Selling and marketing
The increase in expenditure of £235,009 reflects the investment in 
sales and marketing targeted activities including the appointment of 
two senior positions to support the expanded distribution network. 
Research and development
Included within administration costs is expenditure on research 
and development activities which in the year amounted to £209,747 
(2009: £226,068). It was disappointing to terminate the project to 
upgrade the manufacturing procedure for printing Genarrayt™ 
array slides, but we have taken steps to ensure sufficient production 
and development capacity exists with the proven contact printing 
method. The technical issues encountered with the intended upgrade 
to non-contact printing meant reduced resources being allocated  
to other product development activities. Nevertheless, progress has 
been achieved towards providing alternative versions of the Food 
Detective™ kit, tailored for specific diets in other parts of the world.
Operating profit
The Group generated an operating profit of £307,480 (2009: 
£572,968) and the reasons for the reduction in this measure are 
highlighted above under Administration costs and Selling and 
marketing costs.
Profit before tax
The profit before tax was £210,008 (2009: £266,893). However,  
as highlighted in the Chairman’s Statement, the Group also reports 
adjusted profit before tax to provide shareholders with the measure 
of profit for a better comparison with external market forecasts. The 
adjusted profit before tax for the year was £589,511 (2009: £540,439) 
after adding back share-based payment charges of £178,375 (2009: 
£77,948), intangible asset amortisation of £108,750 (2009: £98,750), 
IFRS-related discount factors of £92,378 (2009: £16,547) and 
exceptional costs of £nil (2009: £80,301). 17
Business Review Annual Report and Accounts 2010
www.omegadiagnostics.com
Finance costs reduced significantly in the year to £97,909 (2009: 
£312,232) with the reduction principally being due to lower interest 
charges where the UK base rate has remained at 0.5% throughout 
the year and a currency gain of £41,978 (2009: £188,295 loss) on  
US dollar borrowings due to the relative strengthening of sterling 
against the US dollar.
Taxation
There is a tax charge of £22,909 (2009: £45,852) in the year, 
comprising a charge for current tax of £33,177 (2009: £51,160) and  
a deferred tax credit of £10,268 (2009: £5,308 credit) equating to an 
effective tax rate of 10.9% (2009: 17.2%). Prior year adjustments to 
the tax charge arise when there are differences between estimated 
figures chargeable to tax and final tax computations.
Earnings per share
There was a basic earnings per share (EPS) after exceptional costs  
of 1.0p (2009: 1.4p) reflecting the higher average number of shares  
in issue throughout the year. Basic EPS before exceptional costs  
was 1.0p (2008: 2.0p).
Acquisitions
Acquisition of Co-Tek (South West) Limited
On 28 September 2009, the Group completed the acquisition of 
Co-Tek, a company supplying bacterial infection tests, for a cash 
consideration of £400,000 plus related acquisition costs of £80,978. 
There was a small cash balance of £1,554 in Co-Tek at completion 
giving a net cash outlay of £479,424.
Deferred consideration payments
On 10 March 2010, the Company made a final payment of £101,275 in 
settlement of the agreed earn-out targets in respect of the acquisition 
of Genesis and CNS. This sum, together with the net outlay on the 
acquisition of Co-Tek has been included on the consolidated cash  
flow statement under outflow on acquisition of subsidiary.
Treasury operations
Currency management
The Group conducts its operations in three main currencies being 
sterling, euros and US dollars. In the case of transactions in euros  
and US dollars, the Group may be exposed to fluctuations in the  
rates of exchange against sterling. Where possible, the Group  
operates a natural hedge by entering into transactions of both a  
buying and selling nature that limits the risk of adverse exchange rate 
losses. The Company continues to hold a portion of its borrowings  
in US dollars where this loan can be serviced from a net surplus  
of US dollars generated from its trading activities. The relative 
strengthening of sterling against the US dollar throughout the  
year has given rise to a foreign exchange translation gain of £41,978  
on these borrowings (2009: £188,295 loss). In part, this has been  
offset by the loss of £28,146 (2009: £94,652 gain) referred to above 
under Administrations costs.
Interest rate management
Following conversion of a part of the sterling loan into US dollars, 
the Group limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations by 
entering into certain derivative financial instruments. In the case  
of the remaining sterling loan, the Group entered into an agreement  
with Bank of Scotland whereby the base rate element of the interest 
charge has been capped at 5.5% for the entire remaining term. 
In the case of the US dollar loan, the Group entered into two 
agreements with Bank of Scotland, one to cap the interest rate 
based on US Libor at 5% and one to operate a floor rate on US 
Libor of 2.25%. Under IFRS, these derivative financial instruments 
are required to be disclosed at their fair values as either assets  
or liabilities and there has been a fair value adjustment gain  
through the income statement of £2,580 (2009: £9,871 charge). 
Accordingly, at the balance sheet date, the Group had assets of 
derivative financial instruments of £196 (2009: £599) and liabilities  
of derivative financial instruments of £7,717 (2009: £10,700).
Financing
The Group successfully raised £1 million of new equity in September 
2009 to fund the acquisition of Co-Tek and to provide additional 
working capital. The issue was oversubscribed which provided the 
opportunity for Dr Mike Walker, the vendor of Genesis and CNS,  
to have his shares placed with new institutional shareholders. After 
expenses incurred with the share issue of £80,807 the net funds 
raised amounted to £919,193.
Cash flow
Net cash inflow for the year was £66,246 (2009: £100,043) which 
meant that at the year end, the Group had cash and cash equivalents 
of £678,800 (2009: £612,554). Cash generated from operations of 
£212,283 (2009: £668,276) is lower than last year due mainly to the 
record high sales figure achieved in March 2010. As such, the reported 
increase in trade receivables has reversed itself following the end of the 
year as cash has been collected.
Capital management
The Group funds its operations with a mixture of short and long term 
borrowings or equity as appropriate with a view to maximising returns 
for shareholders whilst safeguarding the ability to continue to operate 
as a going concern. Acquisition payments and financing have been 
referred to in the Cash flow section so that in total, the Group’s net 
debt position has decreased to £1,258,375 (2009: £1,635,013). The 
Group monitors its net debt position on a regular basis and produces 
an annual budget to help ensure it has adequate facilities with 
appropriate maturity profiles for its operational needs.
Capital expenditure
The Group incurred £90,665 (2009: £134,433) on plant and machinery 
fixed assets. Most of the expenditure was incurred at Genesis where  
all the laboratories underwent a refurbishment and an extension to the 
kitting facility was built.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board meets regularly to review operations and to discuss risk areas. The Corporate Governance Report contains details of the Group’s 
system of internal control. Note 23 to the accounts contains details of financial risks faced by the Group.
The Board is also aware of non-financial risk areas including:
General economic conditions
The Group may be faced with changes in the general economic climate in each territory in which it operates that may adversely affect the 
financial performance of the Group. Factors which may contribute include the level of direct and indirect competition against the Group, 
industrial disruption, rate of growth of the Group’s sectors and interest rates. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by conducting operations 
on a broad geographic basis and by introducing new technologies to remain innovative.
Regulatory risk
The manufacturing, marketing and use of the Group’s products are subject to regulation by government and regulatory agencies in many 
countries. Of particular importance is the requirement to obtain and maintain approval for a product from the applicable regulatory agencies 
to enable the Group’s products to be marketed. Approvals can require clinical evaluation of data relating to safety, quality and efficacy of  
a product. The Group seeks to mitigate regulatory risk by conducting its operations within recognised quality assurance systems and 
undergoes external assessment to ensure compliance with these systems.
Acquisition risk
The success of the Group depends upon the ability of the Directors to assimilate and integrate the operations, personnel, technologies and 
products of acquired companies. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by selecting companies which meet certain selection criteria and by 
conducting a detailed due diligence review.
Donations
The Company made no charitable donations in the year (2009: £130) nor any political donations (2009: £nil).
Auditors
The auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution for their reappointment will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of approving the Directors’ Report are listed on page 20. Having made enquiries  
of fellow Directors and of the Company’s auditors, each of these Directors confirms that:
to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no information (that is, information needed by the Group’s auditors in •	
connection with preparing their report) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
each Director has taken all the steps a director might reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information  •	
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

with the external auditors including approval of remuneration levels, approval of terms of engagement and assessment of their independence 
and objectivity. In so doing, they take into account relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements and the relationship with the 
auditors as a whole, including the provision of any non-audit services. Ernst & Young LLP have been auditors to Omega Diagnostics Limited 
(‘ODL ’) since 2000 and were appointed as Auditors to the Company following completion of the reverse takeover of ODL in September 2006.
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls and has considered the need for an internal 
audit function. At this stage of the Company’s size and development, the Committee has decided that an internal audit function is not 
required, as the Company’s internal controls system in place is appropriate for its size. The Committee will review this position on an  
annual basis.
The Committee also reviews the Company’s arrangements for its employees raising concerns, in confidence, about possible wrongdoing  
in financial reporting or other matters. The Committee ensures that such arrangements allow for independent investigation and follow-up action.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has met on one occasion during the year. The Committee is comprised of Michael Gurner, as Chairman, and 
David Evans and has primary responsibility for determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration of the Company’s Chief Executive, 
the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and such other members of the Executive management as it is designated to consider.  
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors shall be a matter for the Chairman and the Executive Directors of the Board. No Director  
or manager shall be involved in any decisions regarding their own remuneration.  25

Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness throughout the year. Such a system 
can only provide reasonable assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Board monitors financial controls through the setting and approval of an annual budget and the regular review of monthly management 
accounts. Management accounts contain a number of indicators that are designed to reduce the possibility of misstatement in financial 
statements.
Where the management of operational risk requires outside advice, this is sought from expert consultants, and the Company receives this  
in the areas of employment law and health and safety management.
The Company is compliant with industry standard quality assurance measures and undergoes regular external audits to ensure that 
accreditation is maintained.
Communication with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of communication with its shareholders. The Company maintains informative websites for Genesis, 
ODL and CNS containing information likely to be of interest to existing and new investors. In addition, the Company retains the services of 
financial PR consultants, providing an additional contact point for investors. The Board encourages shareholder participation at its Annual 
General Meeting, where shareholders can be updated on the Company’s activities and plans.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Business Review, which runs from page 12 to page 17 . The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 16 to 17 . In addition, note 23 to the financial statements include the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group has adequate financial resources together with long-term relationships 
with a number of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well-placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current 
uncertain economic outlook. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
The Directors are required to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year. Under Company Law, the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they present fairly the financial position of the Group and Company 
and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing those Group and Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then •	
apply them consistently;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; •	
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the •	
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial performance;
 state that the Group and Company has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial •	
statements; and
make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent. •	
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s transactions and 
disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time, the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the Group 
and Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding assets of the Group 
and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 27

Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, Company Balance Sheet, Company Statement of Changes in Equity, Company Cash Flow Statement 
and the related notes 1 to 23. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in  
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 26, the directors are responsible for the preparation of  
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with  
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2010 and of •	
the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as •	
adopted by the European Union; 
the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and •	
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. •	
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from •	
branches not visited by us; or
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or •	
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or •	
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. •

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2010
1 AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The financial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2010 were authorised for issue by the Board  
of Directors on 15 July 2010, and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by David Evans and Kieron Harbinson. Omega 
Diagnostics Group PLC is a Public Limited Company incorporated in England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the 
AIM Market.
2 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (‘IFRS’)
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial 
statements of the Group and Company for the year ended 31 March 2010 respectively.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial 
statements. These financial statements are presented in sterling.
Changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for IAS 1 (Revised) where the Consolidated 
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense has been replaced with the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The revised 
standard requires this statement to present all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked 
statements. The Group has elected to present one statement.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC and the entities it controls (its 
subsidiaries). Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its 
activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, 
being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial 
statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are based on consistent accounting policies. 
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated. 
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application 
of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  
in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The significant areas of estimation and uncertainty and critical judgements in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial information are discussed below. Further judgements, assumptions and estimates are set 
out in the Group financial statements.
Valuation of intangible assets
Management judgement is required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets having reference to future economic benefits expected  
to be derived from use of the asset. Economic benefits are based on the fair values of estimated future cash flows.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The test considers future cash flow projections of cash generating units that give rise to the 
goodwill. Where the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recognised for the 
difference. Further analysis of the estimates and judgements are disclosed in Note 9.
Deferred tax assets
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and 
level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. The carrying value of the deferred 
tax asset at 31 March 2010 is £96,074 (2009: £107,530). Further details are contained in Note 15.
Earn-out valuation
Management judgement is required to determine the financial liability to be recognised in respect of the earn-out. Management bases their 
estimation on the sales levels expected over the relevant period on historic data, current market conditions and the likelihood of future budgets 
being achieved. At 31 March 2010 the Genesis Earn-out had a carrying value of £nil (2009: £131,580) having been paid out in full in March 2010. 
As the earn-out was based on 7% of sales of certain products, the earn-out amount varied due to the level of sales achieved. 36

Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued)
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Presentation currency and foreign currencies
The financial statements are presented in UK pounds sterling. Transactions in currencies other than sterling are recorded at the prevailing 
rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included  
in the net profit or loss for the year.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and net of discounts and sales-related taxes. Sales of 
goods are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. This will be when goods have 
been dispatched and the collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue relates to the sale of medical diagnostic kits.
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the purchase method. Any excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet  
as goodwill and is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for 
impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash generating units monitored by management, usually at 
business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is  
less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from 
contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Following initial recognition at fair value at the acquisition 
date, the historic cost model is applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight line basis over the expected 
useful lives, with charges included in administration costs, as follows:
Technology assets  – 20 years
Customer relationship  –  5 years
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value 
may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation  
is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives, on a straight line basis 
as follows:
Leasehold improvements – 10 years, straight line with no residual value
Plant and machinery – 8-10 years, straight line with no residual value
Motor vehicles – 5 years, straight line with no residual value
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives are reviewed annually  
and where adjustments are required, these are made prospectively.
Impairment of assets
The Group and Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists, the Group and Company makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, and is determined for an individual asset, unless 
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.  
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their net present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to that asset. Impairment losses on continuing operations are 
recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. 37

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Government grants
Government grants are recognised when it is reasonable to expect that the grants will be received and that all related conditions will be met, 
usually on submission of a valid claim for payment. Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income 
account and are released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets by equal annual instalments.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred, except in the case of arrangement  
fees for long-term borrowings, where the fee is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is defined as standard cost or purchase price and includes all direct 
costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any 
further costs expected to be incurred prior to completion and disposal. 
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the shorter 
of their lease period and useful life. The corresponding lease or hire purchase obligation is capitalised in the balance sheet as a liability.  
The interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals applicable to operating leases, where substantially all the benefits and risks remain with the lessor, are charged against profits  
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Research and development costs
Expenditure on research, which is incurred up to the point of manufacturing validation, is written off as incurred. Thereafter, expenditure  
on product development which meets certain criteria is capitalised and amortised over its useful life. The manufacturing validation stage  
is when it is probable that the product will generate future economic benefits, and the following criteria have been met: technical feasibility; 
intention and ability to sell the product; availability of resources to complete the development of the product; and the ability to measure  
the expenditure attributable to the product. The useful life of the intangible asset is determined on a product by product basis, taking  
into consideration a number of factors. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a 
subsequent period.
Exceptional items
The group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because 
of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit special presentation to allow shareholders to understand 
better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in 
financial performance.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity  
of three months or less.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of original invoice amount and recoverable amount. A provision for doubtful 
amounts is made when there is objective evidence that collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Balances are written off when  
the probability of recovery is assessed as remote. Payment terms vary from payment in advance to 90 days.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled transactions
For equity-settled transactions, the group measures the award by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and it  
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to  
the award. Fair value is determined using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
service and performance (vesting conditions), other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions).  
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be 
non-vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining grant date fair 
value. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided 
that all other performance conditions are satisfied. 38

Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued)
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period  
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of vesting conditions and of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market or non-vesting condition, be treated as vesting as described 
above. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of the Group or the employee are not met. The movement  
in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost 
based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over  
the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value  
of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised  
if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in  
the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation  
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Pension contributions
Contributions to personal pension plans of employees on a defined contribution basis are charged to the income statement in the year  
in which they are payable.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based  
on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business •	
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing  •	
of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future; and
deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the •	
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax and deferred tax is charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited 
or charged in other comprehensive income or directly to equity. Otherwise, income tax and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss.
Financial instruments
Financial assets, liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, less any repayments. Accrued interest is presented as part  
of the loans and overdrafts balances.
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and recognition  
of the new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised.
Financial liabilities have been recognised at the present value of the consideration expected to be payable by discounting the  
expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates. At initial recognition, the quantum of liability to be recognised will depend upon 
management’s expectation, at that date, of the amount that would ultimately be payable. Where there is a change to the expectation  
of an amount of deferred financial liability, the change is reflected through the income statement. Any changes to contingent financial 
liabilities are reflected through goodwill. 39
Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2010

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, both in sterling and US dollars.  
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets 
and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of interest rate contracts is determined by reference to 
market values for similar instruments that have similar maturities. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement included in 
finance costs, due to the fact that hedge accounting has not been applied. Under IAS 39, these derivatives are classified as financial assets 
and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. 
Financial assets and liabilities that are held for trading and other assets and liabilities designated as such on inception are included in this 
category. Financial assets and liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short-term. Derivatives are also 
classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedge instruments. Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with  
gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Company’s investments in subsidiaries 
The Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost. The carrying value of investments is reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

* The effective dates stated here are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations. As the Group prepares its financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU), the application of new standards and interpretations will be 
subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism. In the majority of cases this will result in an 
effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Group’s 
discretion to adopt standards early.
The Group has not adopted IFRS 3 (revised) early and so will apply it prospectively to all business combinations on or after 1 April 2010. Whilst it 
is not possible to estimate the outcome of adoption, the key features of revised IFRS 3 include a requirement for acquisition-related costs to be 
expensed and not included in the purchase price; and for contingent consideration to be recognised at fair value on the acquisition date (with 
subsequent changes recognised in the income statement and not as a change to goodwill).
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements in the period of initial application. 40

4 SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Group’s activities are in one business segment: diagnostic testing kits which the directors consider to be its one operating segment. 
There are no other significant classes of business, either singularly or in aggregate. Accordingly, the Group’s segment reporting is by 
business segment. This structure has been adopted as it is consistent with the Group’s internal organisational and management structure, 
and with its system of internal financial reporting to the chief operating decision maker (CODM), the purposes of evaluating performance,  
and making decisions about future allocations of resources.

Equity-settled share-based payments
Consolidated and Company
The share-based payment plans are described below. 
EMI Option Scheme and Unapproved Option Scheme:
The plans are equity-settled plans and the fair value is measured at the grant date. Under the above plans, share options are granted to
Directors and employees of the Company. The exercise price of the option is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
The options vest one year after the date of grant and are not subject to any performance criteria.
The fair value of the options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model taking into account the terms and
conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years and there is no cash settlement alternative.
Second Unapproved Option Scheme (SUOS)
The plan is an equity-settled plan and the fair value is measured at the grant date. Under the above plan, share options may be granted to 
third parties for provision of services to the company. The exercise price of the option is equal to the market price of the shares on the date 
of grant. The options vest three years after the date of grant and are not subject to any performance criteria.
The fair value of the options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years and there is no cash settlement alternative.
Under the EMI Option Scheme 35,000 options lapsed during the year and a further 35,000 were granted. Under the SUOS, 70,000 options 
were granted in the year.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options during the year:

The expected life of the options is based on management’s assumption of the options’ life due to the lack of any historical data on the 
exercise period of these options. The assumption takes into account the experience of employees and directors and is not necessarily 
indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the option is indicative of future trends, 
which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

8 ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES (continued)
Goodwill
The acquisition of Co-Tek resulted in goodwill of £332,986. This goodwill represents the advantages and synergies which are expected  
to be derived from combining the Co-Tek business with the following elements of the Omega business:
the additional economic benefit that is expected to be derived from additional revenues of Omega-branded products from its existing •	
distribution network.
the Omega customer relationships which already exist for its Micropath range. •	
Strength of existing Omega management team in diagnostic-related acquisitions. •	
Existing sales & marketing personnel within Omega. •	
From the date of acquisition, Co-Tek has contributed a loss of £1,183 to the Group profit for the year. Following the acquisition, negotiations 
with Co-Tek’s one main customer continued for a period of time which eventually resulted in securing a three-year supply agreement in May 
2010. During the period from acquisition to 31 March 2010, supplies to the customer were lower than normal during the negotiation phase 
but the signed agreement now guarantees minimum revenue over the full three-year period of not less than £480,000. The loss of £1,183 is 
before internal management charges which are reallocated to subsidiaries to reflect their share of Group Costs and management time spent 
on specific projects. The combined revenue and profit before tax for the Group, assuming Co-Tek had been acquired at the start of the 
period would have been £6,303,993 and £242,026 respectively.
The contingent consideration payment amounting to £101,275 (2009: £105,837) was the final earn-out payment with respect to the 
acquisition of Genesis-CNS. The earn-out accrued at 7% of sales of relevant products over a three-year period from 1 November 2006  
to 31 October 2009.

Impairment testing of goodwill     
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. The carrying amount of goodwill  
is indicated in the table above. The net book value of goodwill above for Genesis-CNS amounts to £3,016,892 (2009: £3,061,054) and for 
Co-Tek to £332,986 (2009: £nil).
The recoverable amount of Genesis-CNS and Co-Tek has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections 
based on the financial budget approved by the Board covering the period to 31 March 2011. The key assumptions used in the budget for 
Genesis-CNS are the sales projections which are predicated on the continued success of the Genarrayt™ and Food Detective™ assays  47
Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2010
www.omegadiagnostics.com
9 INTANGIBLES (continued)
being commercialised on an international basis and the gross margins which can be achieved from the sales of these products. The key 
assumption used in the budget for Co-Tek is the growth in sales of the Company’s Micropath™ range of products where increased volumes 
are dependent upon having accessed a lower manufacturing cost through the acquisition of Co-Tek itself.  In both cases, the Company also 
makes assumptions in regard to having sufficient production personnel to cope with increased volumes. The discount rate applied to cash 
flows is 11% reflecting the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the group which takes account of other risks specific to the 
business such as currency risk and price risk. The WACC is the weighted average cost of pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost 
of equity financing. Cash flows beyond the budget period are extrapolated for Genesis-CNS over the next 4 years and Co-Tek over the next 
6 years using a growth rate of 7% that equates to the current growth rate in the IVD industry. Thereafter, a nil growth rate has been assumed 
for prudence. As a result, there has been no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill.
Sensitivity analysis
Base forecasts show headroom of £1.16m above carrying value for Genesis-CNS and headroom of £48,000 above carrying value for 
Co-Tek. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken to assess the impact of any reasonably possible change in key assumptions. If the growth 
rate were to drop from 7% to 6% this would have the effect of reducing the headroom in Genesis-CNS by £105,000 over 5 years and in 
Co-Tek by £15,000 over 7 years.
For Genesis-CNS, the WACC would have to increase to 19.9% or the growth rate would have to be a decline of 5.3% for the headroom to 
reduce to nil.
For Co-Tek, the WACC would have to increase to 15.9% or the growth rate would have to reduce to 3.8% for the headroom to reduce to nil.
The adjustment relating to the contingent consideration amounting to £44,162 results from a reassessment of the Genesis/CNS earnout. 
This is further analysed in note 20. Other than the adjustment above there has been no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill.

earn-out (see Note 16), two of the Directors were issued with 420,567 ordinary shares in the Company with a market value of £127,222 at  
the time of issue.
19 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional administration costs
During the year to 31 March 2010, there were no exceptional administration costs. During the year to 31 March 2009, the Company  
was involved in the planned acquisition of another company which required the Company to raise new funds to complete the acquisition.  
The funding environment deteriorated throughout the process, due to the turmoil in worldwide financial markets and, in early November,  
the Company concluded that due to these challenging circumstances it was not possible to raise sufficient funds to complete the transaction. 
The Company incurred costs of £265,920 in connection with the aborted transaction but it was able to significantly reduce the impact of these 
costs to 30% of the total by obtaining indemnities from third parties for 70% of these costs. Among these third parties were Dr Mike Walker and 
David Evans who agreed to cover 30% and 10% of the costs respectively under an agreement entered into on 3 September 2008. As a result 
the financial impact of the aborted transaction to the Company was limited to £80,301. Due to the one-off nature and value of these costs, they 
are separately disclosed and treated as an exceptional item in the income statement so that they do not impact on the results from normal 
trading operations. 55

22 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued 
on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. Diluting events are excluded from the calculation when the 
average market price of ordinary shares is lower than the exercise price.

Earnings per share before exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because 
of the nature and the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand 
better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in 
financial performance.
To this end, basic and diluted earnings per share are also presented on this basis using both the basic and diluted weighted average number 
of ordinary shares.
Net profit before exceptional items attributable to equity holders of the Group is derived as follows:

23 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise loans, finance leases and cash. The main purpose of these financial instruments is  
to manage the Group’s funding and liquidity requirements. The Group has other financial instruments, such as trade receivables and trade 
payables, which arise directly from its operations. The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign 
currency, credit, liquidity and interest rate. These risks are managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
Foreign currency risk
The Group buys and sells goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of its operations. The Group has US dollar 
and euro denominated bank accounts. Where possible, the Group will offset currency exposure where purchases and sales can be made 
from these foreign currency bank accounts. The Group’s non-sterling revenues, profits, assets, liabilities and cash flows can be affected by 
movements in exchange rates. It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind. At 31 March 2010 (and 31 March 
2009) the Group has not entered into any hedge transactions. 57

23 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in currency rates on the Group’s profit before tax through the impact  
of sterling weakening against the US dollar, the euro and the Canadian dollar.

Bank loans     5% (31,447)
An increase in currency rate of 5% would have a similar opposite effect. The sensitivity around bank loans above represents the entire impact 
on the Company’s profit before tax and equity.
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The Group conducts its operations in many countries, so there is no 
concentration of risk in any one area. In most cases, the Group grants credit without security to its customers. Credit worthiness checks  
are undertaken before entering into contracts with new customers, and credit limits are set as appropriate. The amounts presented in the 
balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identifiable loss event 
which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
Capital management
An explanation of the Group’s capital management process and objectives is set out in the Capital management section on page 17 of the 
Financial Review.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility of working capital arrangements through the use 
of bank loans. The Group also maintains its available financial assets to ensure continued liquidity. 58

Interest rate risk
All of the Group’s borrowings are at variable rates of interest. The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk on changes in US dollar and 
sterling interest rates. To manage the interest rate risk, the Group has taken out interest rate hedge instruments relative to the two bank loans 
which will be repaid by September 2012. The change in fair value of these interest rate hedge instruments has been taken to the income 
statement in full. 59

Explanatory note to the Companies Act 2006 aspects of the changes to the 
proposed new articles of association 
1 Resolution 7 is a special resolution to adopt amended articles of association of the Company (“Articles”). A copy of the proposed 
amended Articles, showing all the changes to the current Articles, is available on request from the Company Secretary and will be 
available at the meeting.
2 Background to the changes
2.1 Company law has recently been overhauled by the Companies Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”).  The 2006 Act has been coming into 
force in stages and the final provisions came into force on 1 October 2009. A number of provisions of the current Articles are 
inconsistent with the 2006 Act or are redundant because of the changes made by the 2006 Act.  The board is recommending 
that the opportunity is taken for a resolution to be put to the AGM to adopt amended Articles to bring them into line with the 
2006 Act and to update statutory references. 
2.2 The principal changes proposed to be introduced by the amended Articles are summarised in paragraphs 3 to 15 below.   
Minor changes which merely reflect changes made by the 2006 Act have not been noted. 
3 Authorised share capital 
3.1 The 2006 Act abolishes the requirement for a company to have an authorised share capital.  Directors will still be limited as  
to the number of shares they can at any time allot because allotment authority continues to be required under the 2006 Act, 
save in respect of employee share schemes. 
3.2 The effect of this resolution will be to remove the Company’s authorised share capital and the proposed amended Articles 
reflect this.  
4 Redeemable shares 
 Under the Companies Act 1985, if a company wished to issue redeemable shares, it had to include in its Articles the terms and 
manner of redemption. The 2006 Act enables directors to determine such matters instead provided they are so authorised by the 
Articles. The proposed new article 5 contains such an authorisation. The Company has no plans to issue redeemable shares but,  
if it did so, the directors would need shareholders’ authority to issue new shares in the usual way. 
5 Suspension of registration of share transfers 
 The current Articles permit the directors to suspend the registration of transfers. Under the 2006 Act, share transfers must be 
registered as soon as practicable. The power in the Articles to suspend the registration of transfers is inconsistent with this 
requirement. Accordingly, this power does not appear in the proposed amended Articles. 
6 Authority to purchase own shares, consolidate and sub-divide shares, and reduce share capital 
 Under the Companies Act 1985, a company required specific enabling provisions in its Articles to purchase its own shares, to 
consolidate or sub-divide its shares and to reduce its share capital or other undistributable reserves as well as shareholder authority  
to undertake the relevant action. The Articles in their current form include these enabling provisions. Under the 2006 Act, a company 
will only require shareholder authority to do any of these things and it will no longer be necessary for Articles to contain enabling 
provisions. Accordingly, the proposed amended Articles do not contain the relevant enabling provisions. 
7 Meetings and resolutions
7.1 Meetings other than annual general meetings are termed “general meetings” under the 2006 Act rather than extraordinary 
general meetings. The 2006 Act does not provide for extraordinary resolutions or elective resolutions.  
7.2 The proposed amended Articles contain updated references accordingly and, where applicable, will replace references to 
extraordinary resolutions with references to special resolutions.
8 Voting by proxies on a show of hands 
 The Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 amended the 2006 Act so that it now provides that each proxy appointed by 
a member has one vote on a show of hands unless the proxy is appointed by more than one member in which case the proxy has one 
vote for and one vote against if the proxy has been instructed by one or more members to vote for the resolution and by one or more 
members to vote against the resolution. The proposed amended Articles reflect these changes.
9 Voting by corporate representatives 
 The Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 amended the 2006 Act to enable multiple representatives appointed by the 
same corporate member to vote in different ways on a show of hands and on a poll. The proposed amended Articles reflect this position.
10 Memorandum of association
10.1 The 2006 Act significantly reduces the constitutional significance of a company’s memorandum. It provides that a memorandum 
will record only the names of subscribers and the number of shares each subscriber has agreed to take in the company.  
Under the 2006 Act, the objects clause and all other provisions which are contained in a company’s memorandum, for existing 
companies at 1 October 2009, are deemed to be contained in the company’s articles of association.
10.2 The effect of this resolution will be to remove all the provisions of the Company’s memorandum of association which are 
deemed to be contained in the Articles.  References to the Company’s memorandum of association have been removed from 
the proposed amended Articles where appropriate. 64

11 Vacation of office by directors 
11.1  There is no longer a requirement for a director of a public company to retire when reaching the age of 70.  The proposed 
amended Articles do not contain a reference to retirement by reason of age. 
11.2  The Articles specify the circumstances in which a director must vacate office. The changes in the proposed amended Articles 
update these provisions to reflect the approach taken on mental and physical incapacity in the model Articles for public 
companies produced by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. 
12 Directors’ conflicts of interest
12.1 The proposed amended Articles contain updated provisions dealing with directors’ conflicts of interest in line with the 2006 Act.
12.2  The 2006 Act distinguishes between the interest of a director in a transaction or arrangement with the company (“Transactional 
Conflict”) and an interest or duty of the director which conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with his duty to the company 
(“Situational Conflict”).
12.3 Transactional Conflicts
12.3.1 The 2006 Act requires the director to declare the nature and extent of his interest to the rest of the board.  Whether or 
not the director can count towards the quorum and vote on the transaction or arrangement depends on the company’s 
articles of association.
12.3.2 The current Articles provide that a director with a Transactional Conflict – if the director’s interest is “material” – cannot 
count towards the quorum or vote on the matter except in certain limited circumstances.  
12.3.3 The proposed amended Articles update the 2006 Act’s requirement to declare the nature and extent of the interest but 
continue to exclude the director from the quorum and voting on the relevant resolution except in specified circumstances.
12.4 Situational Conflicts
 Directors are under a duty to avoid Situational Conflicts.  The 2006 Act provides that the board of directors can authorise 
Situational Conflicts provided certain conditions and safeguards are met.  For example, the director seeking authorisation of  
the conflict cannot count towards the quorum or vote when the board decides whether or not to authorise it. The proposed 
amended Articles expressly provide that the board of the Company will have the power under the 2006 Act to authorise 
directors’ situational conflicts.
13 Use of seals 
 The 2006 Act includes a more flexible regime for execution of documents. Companies are no longer required to have a common seal 
and share certificates can be executed other than under seal.  The proposed amended Articles reflect this.   
14 Electronic communications
 The 2006 Act makes it easier for companies and their shareholders to communicate with each other by electronic communication. 
The proposed amendments to the Articles would enable the Company to send notices and other communications by e-mail to 
shareholders who have agreed to receive such communications in this manner. 
15  Indemnity
 The 2006 Act does not provide for auditors to be indemnified out of the Company’s assets.  The proposed amended Articles reflect this. Overview

Food intolerance P2
Food intolerance is an adverse reaction to some sort of food or 
ingredient that occurs every time the food is eaten, but particularly  
if larger quantities are consumed. Common offenders include milk 
products, wheat and other grains that contain gluten.
Autoimmune disease P4
Autoimmune diseases arise from an overactive immune response  
of the body against substances and tissues normally present in  
the body – i.e. the body attacks its own cells. 
Infectious disease P6
Infectious diseases are clinically evident diseases that result  
from the presence of infectious agents such as microbial agents, 
including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, multicellular parasites, 
and aberrant proteins known as prions.

Underlying operating profit is calculated by the addition of operating
profit on continuing activities before special items to the operating profit
of discontinued operations for the period until disposal. Underlying profit
before tax is calculated by the addition of profit before taxation on
continuing activities before special items to the profit before taxation of
discontinued operations for the period until disposal.

Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the operating
profit/(loss) for the period, before special items, profit/losses on disposal
of discontinued operations, fair value gains/losses on financial
instruments and exchange gains/losses included within net finance
costs and income and taxation related to those items by the weighted
average number of shares in issue during the period. A full reconciliation
between the profit and loss used in the calculation of basic earnings per
share and adjusted earnings per share is included in note 16 to the

04 FKI plc 
I am pleased to report a year of sound progress for the Group with strong
growth in operating performance, a material improvement in the Group’s
net debt position and further steps taken in the strategic realignment of 
the business portfolio.
The general economic environment remained robust in the year with
strong demand from extractive industries, energy generation, US housing
starts and expenditure on housing underpinning improved performance 
for the Group.The translation effect of foreign currency had a minor
impact on reported results; considerably less than in previous years.
Significantly increased commodity prices, especially copper, zinc and
energy costs, did, however, adversely affect operating margins and returns.
Overall turnover from continuing businesses grew by 13.8% to 
£1,273.4 million (2005: £1,118.8 million) with underlying profits up 
by 14.2% to £108.0 million (2005: £94.6 million). Underlying profit
before tax also increased by 14.2% to £79.0 million (2005: £69.2 million)
and adjusted earnings per share by 9% to 9.7p (2005: 8.9p).
Group businesses continued to produce strong cash flows despite the
pressure on working capital of rising turnover and increased input 
costs. Reported net debt at the end of the period was £304.7 million,
a reduction in the year of £46.0 million.This represented a gross reduction
of £110.6 million offset by increases of £40.3 million resulting from the
adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 and £24.3 million from the effect of
adverse exchange rates.
The sale of Bristol Babcock represents the largest disposal to date as part 
of the active portfolio management being followed by the Group to
concentrate on fewer, larger and more competitive businesses. Since the
start of the process in 2003, five businesses have been closed, 12 businesses
sold and five businesses acquired.This is a continuous process as evidenced
by the acquisition of Harrington Generators in April 2006.
As we enter the new year the six major operating units within the Group:
Bridon, Crosby,Truth, Hickory, FKI Generators and FKI Logistex utilise
over 90% of Group assets and generate a similar percentage of the Group’s
continuing operating profit. Further changes in the business portfolio are
expected in the coming year.
Reflecting the Group’s underlying performance, the Board has proposed 
to pay a final dividend of 3.0p per share, bringing the total for the year to
4.5p per share the same level as last year.
“The general economic
environment remained
robust in the year with
strong demand from
extractive industries,
energy generation,
US housing starts 
and expenditure on
housing underpinning
improved performance 
for the Group.” The Board itself is undergoing change in a planned succession. In January,
Chris Clark left after six years on the Board.We thank him for his valuable
contribution over that period and his chairmanship of the Remuneration
Committee.We wish him well in his new appointments. In August of 
this year, at the AGM, Russell Edey will step down after ten years’ service.
We have all valued Russell’s contribution and chairmanship of the Audit
Committee and wish him success in his other business commitments.
In September 2005 David Pearl was appointed non-executive director and
will take over as chairman of the Audit Committee. David brings a wealth
of financial and operational experience to the Board. In February 2006
Richard Case was appointed non-executive director and has since assumed
chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee. Richard’s engineering and
senior management experience will be a valuable addition to the Board.
As in previous years, the Board has reviewed best practice Corporate
Governance policies and procedures and made changes where appropriate
to ensure the Group remains compliant with the Combined Code.
Y our Board looks forward to further improvement in operating
performance of the Group and continued reshaping of the portfolio 
of businesses. Demand in the energy and extractive industries looks set to
remain particularly strong and opportunities for organic and acquisitive
growth exist in all groups.The continued strength and volatility of
commodity prices and the recent weakening of the US dollar do,
however, provide a degree of uncertainty.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our employees 
for their efforts and contribution to another year of improvement 
for the Group.
Gordon Page Chairman
05 FKI plc Chairman’s statement Chief Executive’s introduction
This was a year of many positives for FKI. Robust market demand in 
many sectors in which the Group operates, together with improvements 
in market positioning and operational efficiencies, resulted in strong 
sales and profit growth.This was despite significant increases in raw
material and energy costs. In addition, the overall risks to Group activities
were decreased materially.Active business portfolio management has
concentrated business activities into fewer, larger operations, whilst
operating cash flows and proceeds from business disposals have significantly
reduced net debt.The lessening of the UK Pension Scheme’s deficit,
with discussions underway to reduce it further by the transfer of surplus
property, also lowers uncertainty regarding its future funding requirements.
The Group’s strong trading performance for the year reflects good top-line
growth of over £150 million or nearly 14% combined with an underlying
operating profit improvement of 14.2%.This was achieved despite a
backdrop of materially increased and volatile input prices.
The balance sheet continued to be strengthened with a significant
reduction in net debt to £305 million from the adjusted
*
net debt 
of £391 million in 2005, in spite of adverse currency translation of 
£24.3 million.
FKI Logistex continued its recovery with increases in sales and margin
performance whilst Lifting Products and Services businesses returned
excellent results on the back of buoyant demand in extractive industries.
As predicted, the Hardware group produced a stable performance 
following the completion of the majority of the outsourcing strategy for
non-window hardware which had impacted results over the previous 
two years. Underlying performance in Energy Technology showed strong
top-line growth and good profit growth despite being the group hardest
hit by commodity price increases and incurring some restructuring costs.
Bristol Babcock, which was disposed of in March 2006, was the major
contributor to this improved performance.
Active portfolio management to concentrate activities was reflected in 
six disposals and four acquisitions, one completed just after the year-end.
Following these actions, FKI’s six major businesses utilise 90% of Group
assets and are expected to generate a similar percentage of Group profit.
This improved focus has been achieved whilst strengthening the balance
sheet, having a neutral impact on earnings and increasing Return on
Invested Capital (ROIC) from 7.1% to 8.4%.
Overall, despite an environment of volatile commodity prices and
fluctuations in exchange and interest rates, the Group is well positioned 
to strengthen the market position of its major businesses and improve its
underlying operating performance again in 2006/07.
06 FKI plc 
Operating and financial review
*Net Debt after adoption of IAS32 and IAS39 in 2005 figures. Strategic progress
The Group’s strategy involves the reshaping of the business portfolio to
focus on its major businesses with strong market positions.To that end,
six disposal transactions were completed in the period, including Laurence,
Scott & Electromotors, the European operations of Certex, the wind
turbine business and, towards the end of the year, Bristol Babcock.
In addition, the acquisitions of three small companies were completed 
with a fourth finalised just after the year-end.
Each of these companies’ operations complement the activities of one of
the six major businesses.These major businesses now utilise 90% of the
assets of the Group and generate a similar percentage of Group profits,
a situation that has been achieved over the past three years through strong
performance improvements in continuing businesses, a £201 million
reduction in net debt
*
, and a significant improvement in ROIC.
The implementation of the strategies of the six major businesses 
continued to gain momentum during the period.
FKI Logistex – investing in operating efficiencies, improving capabilities 
and products and building market position both in traditional markets 
and the Far East
Crosby – increasing product range and geographical coverage outside 
US markets
Bridon – consolidating wire rope activities and moving into 
synthetics with acquisition of Marlow Ropes
Truth Hardware – improved customer care and new product introduction 
- increasing market share
Hickory Hardware – improved sector focus and operating efficiency 
in outsourced hardware
FKI Generators leveraging its capabilities and market position with 
new product offerings and acquisition of Harrington Generators
Active portfolio management will continue with further acquisitions 
and disposals anticipated in the coming year.
Property disposals generated sales proceeds of £12.4 million during 
the year.A number of surplus properties still remain to be disposed of.
Group property assets continue to be reviewed with the intention of
aligning ownership with future business requirements and releasing further
assets for disposal.As mentioned earlier, some existing surplus properties
may be transferred to the UK pension scheme as part of the Company’s
ongoing strategy to reduce the pensions deficit.

the strategies of the six

The turnover of FKI Logistex increased by 15.8% due to a £45.1 million
increase in underlying sales assisted by a £10.1 million favourable impact 
on currency translation. Order intake during the year amounted to 
£394.9 million and was 12.1% up on the previous year resulting in a
closing order book of £230.0 million (2005: £216.4 million). In constant
currency terms, underlying operating profit increased by £2.7 million
(23.3%) after charging restructuring costs of £1 million. Margins improved
from 3.3% to 3.9% before restructuring.
Order intake by the European based businesses improved by over 50%
compared to the previous year. In the Post & Parcel sector, orders were
secured across Europe as customers increased activity.An improvement 
in order intake was also seen in the Warehouse and Distribution sector
where contracts were secured for a number of integrated solution based
automated warehouses. Major projects included a leading European 
fashion retailer in Spain and Wolseley in the UK at a combined value 
of approximately £55 million.
The business also continued to build its market position in the Far East.
In the Airports sector, FKI Logistex secured a contract worth
approximately £22 million for the supply of a complete baggage handling
system at the new Shanghai Pudong Airport terminal.
The new linear belt sorter
achieved the milestone of
being approved for use by
both the US Postal Service
and FedEx.
The recently introduced
Library-Mate solution 
is generating significant
interest and has generated
orders in Denmark,
Germany and the USA. In North America the Warehouse and Distribution business increased order
intake by 20% over the corresponding period last year, achieving increased
market presence.This has been driven by sustained growth in small to
medium sized orders as well as notable successes with some new larger
customers in the retail sector.
The US market for Airports Post & Parcel proved challenging in the
second half of the year. Some project difficulties were encountered on 
a few contracts which, although resolved, did impact trading. In addition,
market conditions in the Airports sector deteriorated with unattractive
contractual terms and lower pricing resulting in a number of contracts
being lost as the company declined to chase low margin projects with
onerous terms. However, the business did secure its first major North
American airport service and maintenance contract at Las Vegas.
During the period the Group increased its focus and spend on core
product development for use in all sectors.The objective is to strengthen
market leadership positions in sortation and high-performance materials
handling product lines.The new linear belt sorter achieved the milestone
of being approved for use by both the US Postal Service and FedEx while
the recently introduced Library-Mate solution is generating significant
interest and has generated orders in Denmark, Germany and the USA.
Further opportunities to rationalise operations were identified during the
year resulting in £1 million of costs being charged.The short payback on
these activities will generate net benefits in 2006/07.

Turnover in the period increased by 24.5% reflecting a 21.1% 
(£66.8 million) improvement in underlying trading and a £10.5 million
favourable currency translation impact. Operating profit also benefited
from currency translation in addition to an improvement of £6.0 million
(16.0%) in underlying operating profit.
The continuation of the healthy growth of underlying profitability 
and turnover seen last year was underpinned by the very positive
macroeconomic environment.
– High global oil and gas prices driven by uncertainties over supply have
continued to drive demand for both Bridon and Crosby products
– A period of sustained price escalation in “traded” metals has resulted 
in increased activity in the mining industry
– Strong steel prices continue to benefit the Group’s Harris operations,
which supply scrap-processing equipment
Crosby continues to develop and grow its business through increasing 
its distribution base and its product range. During the year full service
distribution has been added in Latin America and South East Asia and 
two major oil field product lines have been added to the portfolio to 
capitalise on the opportunities presented by the buoyant energy market.
Bridon saw particularly strong demand for oilfield mooring and anchor
lines following the storms in the Gulf of Mexico.The year-end order 
book for these products is equivalent to 40 weeks of production with 
the consequent long lead times for new product impacting further order
intake.The market dynamics for construction wire are, however, very
different with cheap imports into Europe affecting pricing and volumes.
The Group benefited from better than planned performance from the first
year of contributions from the two recent acquisitions: IP Clamps and a
52.85% stake in Tianjin No 1 Steel Wire Rope Company. On 10 January
the Group announced the acquisition of the marine and offshore ropes
business of Marlow Ropes for £1.2 million.The acquired business is a
market leader in high performance fibre ropes for offshore and single point
mooring applications. It is highly complementary to the Group’s steel wire
rope operations and will extend Bridon’s product offering in specialised
mooring systems to include both steel wire rope and fibre rope solutions.
The year saw continued pressure on commodity prices and materially 
higher energy costs, especially in UK operations.The Group was largely
successful in passing on increases in raw materials to customers but in a
global market it is not possible to pass on local energy based cost rises.
Significant activity is underway in the businesses to offset these inflationary
pressures through manufacturing efficiencies.

Despite a £6.0 million decline in trading, turnover in Hardware rose
slightly due to a £7.9 million favourable exchange impact. Operating
profit declined by £1.0 million in constant currency terms. Zinc is a key
raw material in this group and the inability to fully recover significantly
increased input costs has impacted performance during the period.
Housing starts and refurbishment activity in North America remained
strong with North American housing starts growing by 2.6% in the year 
to December 2005. Consequently,Truth Hardware enjoyed another strong
year with the increased commitment to customer care supported by an
active new product introduction programme growing market share for 
the first time for several years.
As expected, market demand for the non-window Hardware businesses
remained relatively stable as the business continued its evolutionary path
from product manufacturer to procurer.The closure of the last remaining
dedicated manufacturing facility at the Keeler Furniture site in Grand
Rapids was announced in the second half and an impairment charge of
£4.3 million has been included in the results for 2005/06. Following the
closure over 95% of products sold will be based on an outsourced model.
At its interim results presentation on 1 December 2005, the Group
announced that it was intending to consolidate the activities of the 
non-window Hardware companies in North America in a single business
which is known as Hickory Hardware.Whilst the full details have 
yet to be finalised, special reorganisation costs of circa £5 million are
expected to be incurred to fully consolidate activities in the current year.
The consolidation will lead to opportunities for property rationalisation,
overhead efficiencies and coordinated procurement, logistics and
distribution.The reorganisation will result in an improved cost base and 
a combined company that will be better positioned for profitable growth 
as it will be able to:
- maintain historical strength as a market leader in design
- become lowest delivered cost option for customers
- focus on driving superior returns for retail customers through 
assortment planning and merchandising improvements
- build on a strengthened core business with strategic moves into 
adjacent markets
- attract new leadership talent

Underlying performance for Energy Technology includes results for 
Bristol Babcock until its disposal on 17 March. Under IFRS accounting
regulations its results are now shown in discontinued businesses.
All comments below are based on Energy Technology continuing
businesses only.
Turnover in Energy Technology grew by 7.9% in the period which was
due to a £19.9 million improvement in underlying trading assisted by 
a £0.3 million favourable currency translation impact. Order intake of 
£286.0 million (2005: £228.8 million) was up 25% and the order book 
at 31 March stood at £179.5 million (2005: £168.4 million).
Power generation continues to provide excellent opportunities for 
FKI generator businesses as long-term growth in global electricity
consumption continues.
The market for large generators from Brush continues to show steady
recovery with gas turbine manufacturers becoming increasingly confident
of medium-term demand. Order intake reflected this position resulting in 
a strong closing order book.There has also been significant investment by
utilities and operators towards upgrading their installed equipment base
which has given rise to growth in aftermarket activity.
A buoyant oil and gas market has increased demand for product to support
exploration activities. Contracts for supply were secured in the North Sea,
Caspian Sea and Africa.
13 FKI plc Operating and financial review
Power generation
continues to provide
excellent opportunities 
for FKI generator
businesses as long-term
growth in global electricity
consumption continues. Marelli’s smaller generator range saw good demand throughout its 
markets with standby generation capacity requirements being a key driver.
Sales grew by 7.9% but were not matched by increased margins as the
increasing prices of copper and other commodities more than offset 
any volume benefits.
Increases in input prices had a significant impact on the whole of 
the Energy Technology group in the period. Input costs increased by 
£9 million, owing to limited market capacity for large forged steel
components, significantly increased copper and electrical steel prices and
rising UK energy costs. Because of the long-term nature of the Brush
Turbogenerator contracts it was not possible to recover the majority of
these increases in sales prices during the year. Other group businesses,
although with shorter lead times between order and delivery, were
nevertheless adversely affected by the rapidly changing raw material 
market prices.
Demand for FKI Switchgear products has improved following the 
difficulties of last year and order intake improved by 27%, with particular
strength in the light rail and UK utility markets. In addition, a number 
of significant export successes have been achieved including an order 
for Beijing Power Supply Systems representing the first breakthrough 
into the rapidly expanding Chinese market. During the second half of 
the year a decision was taken to improve the competitive position of the
business by rationalising manufacturing activities at a cost of £1.4 million.
The combination of increased order books and a more effective cost base 
leaves the business well positioned for the future.
Following the year end, the Group announced on 18 April the acquisition 
of Harrington Generators, a leading designer and supplier of specialist
generators used in providing innovative solutions for power supplies where
access to mains power is unavailable or reliable standby power is required.
The acquisition, at a cost of £6.0 million, complements the Group’s
broader generator activities and is consistent with Group strategy of
concentrating its focus on the major businesses.
A buoyant oil and gas
market assisted by the high
oil price has increased
demand for product 
to support exploration
activities. Contracts for
supply were secured in the
North Sea, Caspian Sea
and Africa.
14 FKI plc Operating and financial review Outlook
The Group enters the new year in a good position to continue to 
deliver improvements in underlying performance.As in previous years,
however, reported performance will be impacted by currency translation
of overseas activities.
In FKI Logistex, order intake and turnover are forecast to be relatively
stable with higher activity levels in warehousing and distribution offsetting
a reduction in US airport activity. Operating margins are expected to
continue to grow reflecting the ongoing improvement in project execution
and delivery processes and further reductions in cost.
Market demand in Lifting Products and Services is predicted to remain
buoyant and another year of strong performance is forecast although
growth rates are expected to be below last year’s exceptional levels.
In Hardware, external forecasts for US housing starts in 2006 suggest a 
6%-7% decline although the first quarter of the calendar year has not
reflected this. Based on this forecast decline,Truth’s performance is
expected to be stable as market share gains and operating efficiencies 
offset the potential volume declines. Underlying Hickory Hardware
performance should benefit from operating efficiencies and some sales
improvements.As mentioned above, special reorganisation costs to fully
consolidate activities are forecast at £5 million and will provide additional
operational improvements in future periods.
Performance in Energy Technology should improve based on a good order
entry position, opportunities for product range extension and good market
growth forecasts. The year-on-year net effect of commodity prices is
expected to decrease allowing volume driven margin improvements.
Overall, despite an environment of volatile commodity prices and
fluctuations in exchange and interest rates, the Group is well positioned 
to strengthen the market position of its major businesses and improve its
underlying operating performance again in 2006/07.

Overview
Group turnover from continuing activities during the period was 
£1,273.4 million (2005: £1,118.8 million).This increase in turnover
comprised a sales increase from trading of £125.8 million assisted by 
a favourable currency translation effect of £28.8 million.
Operating profit before special items increased to £100.0 million (2005:
£91.6 million).After adjusting for the favourable foreign exchange impact
of £3.0 million, operating profit before special items grew by 5.9%.
Special items amounting to a loss of £0.4 million (2005: a loss of 
£8.5 million) included a £4.1 million profit, before taxation and 
finance costs, on the sale of a number of surplus properties, offset by 
a £4.3 million loss on the sale of White Systems, a small unintegrated 
part of North American FKI Logistex activities. Profit from continuing
operations before taxation increased by 19.9% to £99.6 million 
(2005: £83.1 million).
Net finance costs were £29.4 million (2005: £25.1 million).The increase
over the corresponding period last year is principally a result of a rise in
short-term US interest rates.The effect of these increases was partially
offset by a reduction of £0.6 million in net finance costs on pension
schemes and fair value gains on financial instruments of £0.9 million.
For comparative purposes, underlying operating profit, based on operating
profit before special items after adjusting for the pre-tax trading impact 
of discontinued operations, rose by 14.2% from £94.6 million to 
£108.0 million.
The profit for the year from discontinued operations of £41.3 million 
(2005 loss: £84.2 million) comprised a £36.9 million net profit on the 
sale of businesses plus profits after taxation of £4.4 million generated 
up to the dates each disposal occurred.The principal contributory
transaction was the sale of Bristol Babcock with figures of £39.9 million
and £5.6 million respectively.

Impact of exchange rates
With 74% of FKI’s continuing turnover originating from outside the UK,
the Group’s results are sensitive to changes in exchange rates.Trading
results and cash flow of overseas operations have been converted into
sterling at average rates of exchange whilst balance sheets are converted at
year end rates.
The most significant rates for the Group were as follows:
2006 2005
At Average At Average
31 March rates of 31 March rates of
2006 exchange 2005 exchange
to £1 to £1 to £1 to £1

Euro 1.43 1.46 1.45 1.46
Danish krone 10.70 10.91 10.83 10.90
The average exchange rate of the US dollar to sterling strengthened by 
3.8% compared with last year which primarily affected the Hardware
division, whose operations are in the US, and Lifting Products and Services
whose US operations are particularly successful and have a significant
exposure to energy markets.

Turnover (2005: £1,118.8m) Interest
The Group’s net finance cost increased to £29.4 million (2005:
£25.1 million) as a result of higher interest rates on the floating rate 
portion of the Group’s debt and currency translation effects.These net 
finance costs primarily consist of £29.1 million (2005: £23.3 million) of 
net interest costs arising on the Group’s net debt.The remaining cost of 
£0.3 million (2005: £1.8 million) consists of net pension scheme interest 
of £1.2 million (2005: £1.8 million) offset by other financing net 
gains of £0.9 million (2005: £nil) being mainly net gains and losses 
on foreign exchange and fair values of financial instruments.
On a pre-IFRS basis consistent with the Group’s loan covenants, the 
net interest expense was 3.8 times covered (2005: 4.1 times) by profit
before interest, exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, and
represented a rate of 6.6% (2005: 5.2%) on the year’s average weekly 
net debt, measured before IFRS adjustments, of £443 million (2005:
£448 million). IFRS reporting adjustments increased the year’s average 
net debt from £443 million to £481 million.
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax charge on profits from continuing operations
after net finance costs was 25.2% (2005: 24.8%).A reconciliation of the
actual total tax charge to the standard rate of corporation tax in the 
UK of 30% is set out in note 13 to the financial statements.
Return on invested capital
The Return on Invested Capital, rebased for the introduction of 
International Financial Reporting Standards and calculated as profit after
tax from continuing and discontinued operations before exceptional items,
interest and finance charges, divided by the average of opening and closing
shareholders’ equity, net debt and previously written off goodwill, was 8.4%
(2005 restated: 7.1%).
Earnings per share and dividends
The profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company amounted 
to £93.8 million (2005: loss of £40.6 million), and basic profit per share
was 16.1p (2005: basic loss per share 7.0p).Adjusted earnings per share of
9.7p (2005: 8.9p) is calculated by dividing the operating profit/(loss) for
the period, before special items, profit/loss on disposal of discontinued
operations, fair value gains/losses on financial instruments and exchange
gains/losses included within net finance costs and income and taxation
related to those items by the weighted average number of shares in issue
during the period.
Reflecting the Group’s underlying performance, the Board has proposed to
pay a final dividend for the year of 3.0p per share which, with the interim
dividend of 1.5 pence per share paid on 24 February 2006, brings the 
total dividends for the year to 4.5p per share, the same level as last year.
The total paid out to shareholders in respect of these dividends will
amount to £26.3 million.
18 FKI plc Operating and financial review
9.7p 
Adjusted earnings per share (2005: 8.9p) Net debt and cash flow
Reported net debt at 31 March 2006 was £304.7 million, a reduction 
since March 2005 of £46.0 million.This represented a gross reduction 
of £110.6 million offset by increases of £40.3 million resulting from the
adoption of IAS 32 and 39 and £24.3 million from the effect of adverse
exchange translation.
Net operating cash flow in the period after interest and taxation payments
was £69.3 million (2005: £26.0 million) which included a £10.0 million
outflow in respect of the run down of the Wind Turbine business prior 
to sale.
Capital expenditure was £26.2 million representing 84% of depreciation
and amortisation charges.There was a cash outflow of £12.5 million
relating to termination and closure costs of businesses.
Disposals
During the year the Group disposed of 5 businesses, the proceeds of which
amounted to £83.1 million net of cash disposed of with the operations.
The principal transactions in the year were:
– Sale of Laurence Scott and Electromotors on 25 April 2005
– Sale of Certex European operations on 14 June 2005
– Sale of Wind Turbine business on 5 July 2005
– Sale of Bristol Babcock on 17 March 2006
Financing
The Group is financed by a mix of equity, retained earnings, a eurobond,
US private placement loan notes and a syndicated bank facility. Funding
for operating subsidiaries, apart from small local overdraft facilities, is raised
centrally and lent internally on commercial terms.
Gross debt, inclusive of derivative financial assets and liabilities, at the 
year end amounted to £541.8 million and 78% of the Group’s committed
borrowing facilities of £692 million were drawn.These committed
borrowing facilities are available for 3.4 years on average.
19 FKI plc Operating and financial review
£69.3m 
Net operating cash flow
(2005: £26.0m) The Group’s net debt included £1.4 million of debt (2005: £6.5 million
of net cash) in respect of businesses classified as held for sale.
The N600 million eurobond, which matures in February 2010, is carried 
at a value of £442.2 million (2005: £354.7million).The reason for the
increased carrying value of the eurobond is primarily due to the
recognition of £25.8 million (2005: £nil) of IFRS valuation adjustments
and the 2006 transition to reporting cross-currency swaps as derivative
financial instruments rather than netting against the value of the eurobond.
US$173.5 million is drawn under a series of US private placements issued
in 1994, 1996 and 1997 with maturities ranging between 2006 and 2016.
Surplus cash was applied to redeeming US$10 million of US private
placements that matured during the year and a further US$66 million that
matured immediately after the year end.At the year-end the £150 million
syndicated bank facility, which matures in July 2007 and is primarily 
used to fund working capital requirements, was undrawn (2005:
£47.7 million drawn).
The fixed rate eurobond and US private placements are substantially 
swapped into floating rate obligations and other currencies.These swaps
maintain approximately three-quarters of gross borrowings at floating rates
and one-quarter at fixed rates.The cross-currency swaps provide a partial
hedge of the foreign exchange exposures described below under Financial
risk management. Floating rate borrowings are principally linked to
LIBOR for periods of between one and six months.
Y ear-end cash and marketable securities and deposits totalled 
£237.1 million (2005: £155.9 million). £41.1 million (2005:
£39.8 million) of cash and deposits are held and managed by the 
Group’s captive insurance company in Guernsey.
The adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 April 2005, without the
requirement to restate the year to 31 March 2005, means that it is more
meaningful to compare the net debt shown in the balance sheet at 
31 March 2006 with that at 1 April 2005 rather than 31 March 2005.

Derivative financial instruments comprise instruments relating to net
borrowings (eg cross-currency and interest rate swaps) and those related 
to other business transactions (eg forward foreign exchange deals).All these
instruments are required, with effect from 1 April 2005, under IAS 32 and
IAS 39, to be reflected on the balance sheet, as illustrated above.The
reduction in cross-currency swaps can be mainly attributed to the
strengthening US dollar and resetting the exchange rate on a swap.
Financial risk management
FKI’s financial risk management is based upon sound economic objectives
and good corporate practice. Derivative and other financial instruments 
are used to manage trading exposures, liabilities and assets under parameters
laid down by the Board.The Group’s major hedging activities are to
mitigate the following risks:
(i) Currency transaction risks for trading exposures denominated 
in other currencies.
(ii) Fair value and cash flow interest rate risks associated 
with the Eurobond.
(iii)Currency translation risks of net assets in overseas subsidiaries.
The Group has not used derivative financial instruments for purposes 
other than for hedging its exposures.
21 FKI plc Operating and financial review The Group adopted accounting standard IAS 39 on 1 April 2005,
resulting in the recognition at fair value of all derivative financial
instruments previously held off balance sheet under UK GAAP .To avoid
income statement volatility, and where such benefits outweigh the costs 
of compliance, the Group has designated many of its economic hedges 
as hedging instruments under IAS 39. However, for certain effective
economic hedging relationships such hedge accounting treatment is not
permitted under IFRS.Where hedge accounting is not achieved, fair value
movements on derivatives are recorded in the consolidated income
statement which could give rise to earnings volatility. In 2006, this resulted
in a net gain of under £1 million.
It is the Group’s policy to maintain a range of maturity dates for its
borrowings, and to refinance them at the appropriate time so as to 
reduce refinancing risk.
The treasury function provides the Group with cash and risk management
services by investing surplus funds and managing and reducing financial
risks purely in relation to underlying trading transactions. It does not
operate as a profit centre and no speculative transactions are permitted.
Counterparty credit limits are established for all banks used by the Group,
taking account of the credit standing of each bank.
A large proportion of the Group’s trading is carried out within the
domestic territory of each business unit. Consequently, foreign exchange
transaction exposures, which arise when sales and purchases are made by 
a business unit in a currency other than its own functional currency, are
generally not significant.The Group’s policy is to hedge using forward
foreign exchange contracts as soon as commitment has been given to the
underlying transaction.
The results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the average
rates of exchange for the period concerned.As this translation has no
impact on cash flow, the Group chooses not to hedge its foreign
subsidiaries’ earnings, other than any dividends which are dealt with as
transaction exposures.
The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at 
the closing exchange rates.Any gains or losses on the translation of these
balance sheets into sterling are recorded in reserves against the gains and
losses arising on foreign currency borrowings that are effective as net
investment hedges.

Pensions
The Group’s IAS 19 aggregate pensions deficit in respect of all 
pension and post retirement plans decreased to £156.0 million as of 
31 March 2006 from £177.2 million a year earlier.The most significant
element of this deficit relates to the Group’s main UK scheme which has
decreased from £130.3 million to £110.7 million as of 31 March 2006.
The valuation of this deficit is based on the full actuarial valuation as of 
31 December 2002, updated at 31 March 2006 by independent actuaries,
and is consistent with the preliminary valuation results of the full actuarial
valuation as of 31 December 2005.The aggregate deficit net of associated
deferred tax assets has reduced from £121.9 million to £107.0 million.
As part of the triennial funding review and in line with the ongoing
strategy of reducing the pensions deficit, the Company is in active
discussions with the trustees regarding contributing surplus properties to
the fund as part of its ongoing strategy of reducing the pension deficit.
23 FKI plc Operating and financial review International Financial Reporting Standards
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were adopted by 
FKI with effect from 1 April 2004.Adoption included the restatement 
of the 2004/05 results, the balance sheet at 1 April 2004, the balance sheet
at 30 September 2004, the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 and further
adjustments to the balance sheet at 1 April 2005 to reflect the adoption 
of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 increased the valuation of reported 
net debt at 1 April 2005 by £40.3 million. In accordance with IFRS, the
carrying value of the fixed-rate Eurobond was increased by £35.7 million,
representing the gain realised in closing out interest rate hedging
instruments; this gain was previously recorded under UK GAAP as 
part of creditors.The remaining £4.6 million relates to other adjustments
arising from the recognition of the fair value of the underlying Eurobond
debt and other financial instruments.There is no cash impact in
connection with this restatement.The £40.3 million is substantially 
a fair value adjustment that reverses fully by 31 March 2010.
Risks and Uncertainties 
The Group has adopted a standard process for the identification,
assessment, treatment, monitoring and reporting of risk.This process 
helps support business objectives by linking into business strategy,
identifying and reacting to emerging risks and developing cost effective
solutions to risk exposures.A detailed description of the Group’s risk
management process is included within the Corporate Governance Report
on pages 37 to 39 of the Annual Report.The Group’s financial risk
management practices are discussed earlier in the report on pages 21 and
22 and in note 28 to the accounts.
Some 56% of continuing sales are to customers in North America and the
Group is therefore particularly affected by economic conditions in North
America. However, the diverse nature of the Group’s products, services and
customers help mitigate the effects of changes in political and economic
risk on the demand that the Group experiences.
24 FKI plc Operating and financial review The Group’s products and manufacturing processes require a variety of raw
materials including steel, copper and zinc.Any increase or volatility in the
price of these commodities and energy together with shortages in supply
can affect the Group’s performance.The diversity of operations both in
terms of product area and geography reduces the dependence on any single
item and supplier. Purchasing policies and practices take into account and
seek to mitigate such risks where practicable.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes as detailed in 
note 33 to the accounts, the most significant of which is the main UK
scheme which had a pre-tax deficit of £110.7 million at 31 March 2006.
The funding of that scheme is 65% by long dated bonds and 35% by
equities.The Group is exposed to various funding risks principally
increased longevity of members and poor performance of equity
investments which could result in increased cash contributions by the
Group to the schemes.
In addition to the above the Group’s involvement and operating in 
global markets creates an exposure to other risk factors that are both
external and internal to the Group.These risks include but are not 
limited to failure to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements
including environmental and litigation risk, equipment failures, business
continuity and the actions of customers and competitors.The Group has,
as previously described, implemented risk controls and loss mitigation 
plans but cannot give absolute assurance that such procedures will be
effective in identifying or controlling each of the operational risks faced by
the Group.

of employees to membership of trade unions”: 37% of its workforce is
unionised and 55% are covered by collective agreements. In early 2000,
the Energy Technology European Works Council was set up to represent
European-based businesses within the Energy Technology group.
The Council meets formally once a year: it first met on 24 May 2005 
with its second annual meeting planned for 12 July this year.
As part of social and ethical practice, FKI recognises the need to encourage
the development of its staff, with around 70% of business units offering 
an employee personal development and review programme, which covers
84% of the workforce. On average, this year, the number of training days
per employee was two days.
Companies recruited into 1,381 positions this year, 22% of which were
internal recruitments.As well as direct recruitment opportunities, FKI also
operates an engineering graduate recruitment programme, which is fully
accredited by the relevant professional bodies.
Charity and community
FKI businesses are encouraged to support the local communities in which
they operate. FKI also supports charitable activities and donations to both
local and international good causes through its corporate donations policy,
updated in 2004 to include the potential for funds raised by employees
towards charitable causes to be matched by donations from the Group.
This year 68% [48%] of FKI’s businesses, representing 85% of employees,
participated in local community activities, charitable events or made
charitable donations to good causes. A large number of these businesses
supported development of the local community, donating time and money
to local charities, schools, hospitals and sports teams etc.A number of 
US-based companies also regularly participate in workplace American 
Red Cross blood donation programmes.
A large percentage of FKI’s US-based businesses also support United Way,
a charity which includes around 1,350 community-based organisations 
run by local volunteers.This support includes voluntary deductions from
employee wages and locally organised fundraising events.
FKI also makes annual contributions to the Headstart scheme, part of 
The Engineering Development Trust which in turn is a component 
of The Royal Academy of Engineering’s Best programme.The Headstart
scheme promotes careers in science and engineering to 16-17 year olds
through university-based, residential courses.The Group is also becoming
more directly involved with Headstart through its graduate scheme,
providing volunteer graduates to speak at a number of the residential
courses. FKI embraces opportunities like this to re-invest in the
engineering graduates of the future.

Independent audits 
ensure FKI remains
progressive in Health and
Safety policy and practice
Social and ethical compliance
This year, there were four [three] complaints made against FKI 
companies, one of which involved 15 individual complaints: ten of these
have been dismissed with the other five pending further investigation.
Of the remaining three cases, one was dismissed as unfounded following 
a thorough investigation; the other two are currently active pending
mediation.There were five [three] cases of disciplinary action against
employees. Four resulted from a breach of social and ethical policy 
leading to one written discipline, one suspension and two dismissals.
The fifth case was a breach of contract also resulting in dismissal.
Auditing for compliance
FKI implemented a policy of peer auditing in 2004 to facilitate accelerated
continuous improvement in social and ethical policy and practice, whereby
business units are audited by their peers to assess the compliance with
Group policy at operating business level. No major non-compliance 
issues were identified in those businesses audited in 2005.All minor 
non-compliance issues were resolved within the agreed timescales.
The FKI human resources network
A Group-wide network of people involved in human resource operations
was established during 2004/05.This network has continued to be active
in 2005/06 as a vehicle for more effective and consistent implementation
of Group policies and continues to uphold FKI’s commitment to CSR.
Health and Safety policy and practice
FKI maintains its commitment to progression towards an accident-free
Health and Safety culture, believing that almost all are preventable.
The diagram on page 30 illustrates that Health and Safety commitment
starts at the highest level of management, with a structure put in place 
to drive improvement throughout the Group’s worldwide operations.
FKI is committed to full compliance with Health and Safety regulations 
in the workplace for all of its employees worldwide. Businesses are
requested to record all unsafe acts, near misses and injuries during
operations.These are then analysed to enable continuous improvement
through shared knowledge, new initiatives and improved working practices.
This year a UK Health and Safety audit programme was launched in
conjunction with the Group’s insurance brokers,AON, which resulted in 
a number of local practice changes.This audit programme will now be
rolled out to most Group companies worldwide. Independent audits such
as this ensure FKI remains progressive in this area and that Health and
Safety systems are improved and maintained in line with best practice. 30 FKI plc 
Health and Safety policy 
In order to ensure that its workplaces are safe and to provide 
a sustainable healthy working environment FKI pledges to:
– Consider Health and Safety in all transactions
– Meet or exceed current Health and Safety legislation
– Introduce and maintain good working practices
– Develop effective Health and Safety procedures including identifying 
and assigning responsibilities within each organisation
– Make employees aware of potential risks, hazards, safe systems 
of working, operating procedures and their responsibilities and 
statutory obligations;
– Provide appropriate training
– Continually improve systems for recording, reporting and analysing
accidents and incidents
– Set and publish objectives and targets and monitor progress and assess
performance in relation to these targets
This policy is in operation in all FKI companies globally.A dedicated
Health and Safety committee is set up in a large proportion of FKI
companies, representing 99% of the workforce.These committees are
tasked with driving down accident rates and ensuring that the working
environment remains safe for all personnel. Detailed performance is
measured in 89% [73%] of FKI businesses, covering 99% of employees 
and 66% [54%] (90% of employees) currently practice the setting of
improvement targets.
Health and Safety performance
FKI follows the UK classification of incidents for Group reporting.
Health and Safety reporting guidelines are communicated to every
company to assist them in reporting their performances each year.
All businesses are also aware of local legislation and reporting 
mechanisms and often report under both sets of procedures.
The graph on page 31 plots the total number of recorded incidents and 
occurrences and the Group Accident Frequency Rate respectively.
The Accident Frequency Rate (AFR), previously calculated to include
dangerous occurrences, has been re-stated this year for clarity of reporting.
Defined as the average number of incidents per 100,000 man hours
worked, the AFR now excludes dangerous occurrences, also known as
“near misses” or “close calls”. These occurrences will continue to be
recorded by companies and the data utilised internally.All historic AFR
values have been adjusted as necessary to allow a direct comparison.
This year has seen a continued decrease in the total number of actual
incidents, that is, major incidents, work related illnesses and other
reportable incidents.There has also been a marginal improvement in the
Group’s AFR, however, due to arithmetic rounding this improvement is
not indicated in the final figure.There have been positive improvements 
in Group Health and Safety, however, further work is required in this area
to further reduce the AFR.

This year, there has been a significant rise in the number of dangerous
occurrences, the magnitude of which warranted further investigation.
Following discussions with the individual companies, it is believed that the
majority of the increase can be attributed to a greater employee awareness
of Health and Safety and what classifies as an “accident risk” and therefore
improved reporting. In all cases, reported dangerous occurrences are
investigated and preventative measures applied. It is in the recording 
of dangerous occurrences and their subsequent resolution that FKI aims
to reduce the number of future incidents and injuries and hence continue
to move towards its goal of an accident-free culture.
Regrettably, there was a fatality this year of an FKI Logistex employee
working on a customer site in North America.The investigation into 
this incident is currently ongoing.
Within the Group, three units received fines in relation to Health and
Safety regulations but there were no Health and Safety related convictions.
The fines were all incurred by businesses in the US. One of the fines
resulted from a Health and Safety audit following an accident at work 
the previous year.The company in question has implemented the required
changes in line with the audit recommendations and these have been
accepted.The other two fines were for relatively minor breaches, neither
of which resulted in injury. Both policy and practice have been reviewed
by the units in order to prevent recurrence.
Relative performance standards 
As part of FKI’s drive towards an accident-free culture, all business units
have been encouraged to identify a comparative industry sector accident
frequency rate (AFR) as an external benchmark for Health and Safety
performance. Currently just under half of the business units have identified 
a target AFR, 7% more than last year, and of these 80% have successfully
achieved or bettered this target. FKI will continue to encourage external
benchmarking with the aim of accelerating improvements in all areas 
of Health and Safety.

The environment
FKI remains committed to minimising any adverse impact its businesses
have on the environment. Local business management is responsible for
enforcing standards in line with legal responsibilities and obligations 
and managing risks associated with environmental matters. Supporting this
commitment, 72% [70%] of FKI companies, representing 86% of Group
turnover, have an environmental coordinator and nearly 38%, representing
54% of turnover, have an environmental committee. The importance of
environmental issues is emphasised to employees with 30% [30%] of FKI
companies, representing 44% of the workforce, providing environmental
training as part of new employee orientation programmes.
The Group’s main areas of impact on the environment are in the 
use of energy and water and the production of solid and liquid waste.
Where appropriate, companies have been encouraged to implement
environmental management systems compatible with ISO14001.
19% of Group sales are made by companies maintaining this standard.
11% of businesses are accredited by other environmental standards,
contributing 13% of Group sales. Continuous improvement in
environmental performance is facilitated through implementation 
of the Group environmental policy, monitoring of environmental
performance and internal and external auditing.
Environmental policy 
FKI is committed to the protection and conservation of the environment
in all of its operations.The Group’s environmental policy involves the
implementation of an operational management system within each business
unit enforcing standards in line with legal responsibilities and obligations.
FKI’s environmental policy aims to:
– Develop, install and maintain environmental management systems
– Meet or exceed current environmental legal requirements
– Focus on product stewardship, identifying ways of improving efficiency
throughout the supply chain and manufacturing processes to reduce
consumption
– Use environmentally responsible suppliers and subcontractors
– Give preference to alternatives for scarce and non-renewable resources
– Develop and market products and services meeting environmental
standards and target each product to be produced more efficiently 
than its predecessors
– Maintain control of discharges and emissions
– Raise awareness of environmental issues
– Identify and communicate best practice throughout the Group
– Set and revise environmental targets and policies
– Pursue sustainable practices and processes in all operations
32 FKI plc Corporate social responsibility review
72%
of FKI companies have an
environmental coordinator 33 FKI plc 
All Group businesses have adopted the corporate environmental policy.
One example of how businesses are applying policy in practice is the
implementation of lean operations. Most FKI companies have adopted,
or are planning to adopt Lean in order to streamline processes and improve
efficiency through elimination of waste and non-value adding activities.
Environmental performance
Assessment of environmental risks occurs during day-to-day business
operations as part of FKI’s risk management process. In addition to 
this practice, 26% [21%] of businesses, accounting for 47% of Group
turnover, reported completion of a local environmental risk assessment 
in 2005/06. In order to ensure environmental conformity, 45% of
companies, representing 64% of turnover, carried out a combination of
internal, governmental and independent environmental audits this year
including assessment of air quality, waste water quality, noise, ergonomics,
oil storage and spillage control and legislative and environmental
certification compliance.
Seven [six] formal, environmental complaints were received during the
year, one of which resulted in a prosecution and fine.This complaint
concerned water pollution resulting from the unsafe discharge of waste
water into a local stream by a China-based company.The company is
currently installing a sewage treatment and disposal facility to rectify 
the situation, which should be completed by the end of July 2006.
Of the remaining six, one complaint regarding noise was dismissed after
investigation from the Ministry of the Environment (US) found levels 
to be within legal limits. In all cases, the companies acted responsibly,
thoroughly investigating the complaint and communicating with the
necessary environmental bodies.Where responsibility for the fault lay 
with the companies, each took the required steps to resolve the issue 
and prevent future occurrences.
Environmental improvements
This year, 23% of FKI companies, accounting for 18% of Group turnover,
have introduced environmentally friendly initiatives, in many cases with the
focus directed towards the customer.These initiatives include: encouraging
customers to use biodegradable lubricant, increased use of electronic 
means for distribution of information to customers, recommending a bulk
packaging programme to eliminate excess consumer packaging, more fuel
efficient and lower emission engines for a major High Speed Train (HST)
programme, replacement of hazardous substances with environmentally
friendly alternatives, waste segregation, re-design of products to meet
environmental standards, use of returnable packaging, reduction in
consumables, quality review documentation being made available to
customers on request, eliminating thoriated welding rods and
decommissioning an acid line.
One FKI company based in Denmark reported that 50% of its supplied
electricity is sourced from renewable energy: 20% from wind turbines,
30% from biomass.Another UK-based company is currently undertaking 
a study into the possible use of wind turbines.
33 FKI plc Corporate social responsibility review
Recycling not only offers
a solution to reduce net
waste output but is also
commercially beneficial 34 FKI plc 
Energy consumption
FKI’s energy consumption is based on individual consumption of
electricity, natural gas, diesel etc which is then converted to an equivalent
of carbon dioxide (CO2) in kilograms.This allows a year-on-year direct
comparison, where the term “carbon dioxide emissions” represents the 
best estimate of overall energy consumption.
The bar chart opposite shows a continuing reduction in absolute CO2
emissions.Total CO2 emissions for this year have reduced by 5% compared
to last year, exceeding the Group’s target of 1% reduction.This year’s
emissions are also 19% less than those recorded in 2001.
The line graph represents absolute CO2 emissions adjusted for business
activity levels by dividing by Group turnover in £000s.The resultant
figures indicate that business unit actions reduced CO2 emissions by 
8.7% compared to the prior year.
Such trends demonstrate FKI’s commitment to the environment 
and its continuing drive towards sustainability.
Water consumption
The bar chart opposite shows that Group absolute water consumption 
has increased this year by 4.3%, which is due to the acquisition of a
Chinese company with a high water usage. Excluding this acquisition,
the data reveals an overall reduction in Group water consumption of 
2%, the result of improved water conservation by the remaining businesses,
58% of whom reported a reduction in water consumption in 2005/06.
Pro rata water consumption (m3/£000 turnover) increased this year by
just 0.29% but again excluding the Chinese company’s data reveals pro 
rata water consumption actually reduced by 5.4%.The changing nature 
of FKI’s business portfolio means that absolute values are not directly
comparable year-on-year.Accounting for Group turnover allows for a
much more accurate picture and gives a better indication of environmental
performance.The Group’s fresh water consumption is considered by 
FKI to have a great impact on the environment.Waste control measures
and reviews are therefore in constant effect in the day to day operation 
of businesses globally.
Waste disposal and recycling
FKI businesses are required to report on both liquid and solid waste 
within the CSR review process.The disposal costs are reported within the
CSR report – along with the disposal cost per £000 turnover – to allow 
a year-on-year comparative figure.These figures are presented below.
Each unit which produces solid or liquid waste is responsible for disposing
of that waste through cost effective and environmentally acceptable
methods. No environmental permits were revoked in 2005/06.

Liquid waste disposal
FKI produces waste liquid mainly from water used for cooling purposes,
surface treatments, washing down products during the production process
and sanitary purposes. Some businesses which produce relatively large
quantities of waste water and liquid as a result of manufacturing processes
have water treatment plants that are monitored regularly by local water
authorities.Where water meets strict standards, discharge into rivers is
permitted. Permitted discharge into sewers is also regulated and occurs
only with approval. Liquid waste may also be removed by registered
disposal companies.Where petroleum, bulk hazardous chemicals or acid
wastes are required to be stored on site, appropriate permits are held by 
the relevant businesses.Where companies cannot treat liquid waste they
have permits in place for the removal and treatment of the waste off site.
Consistent and suitable monitoring and reporting of liquid waste
processing procedure is in place in all businesses.
The graph opposite shows a continuing downward trend in liquid waste
disposal costs in 2005/06.The spike representing 2004/05 is largely
attributable to high costs experienced by a Lifting Products and Services
company following improved environmental reporting. However, the costs
for 2005/06 show a return to the expected trend of year-on-year
reductions. Improvements in environmental reporting are believed to 
be key in controlling waste levels and associated costs.
Solid waste disposal
The Group’s expenditure on processing solid waste reduced this year by
16% on last year’s costs. Comparison with the rest of the graph shows that
the disposal costs for 2006 are marginally higher than those of 2004 but are
slightly lower after adjusting for activity levels (data plotted on line graph).
The total solid waste disposal costs in 2006 have reduced by 34% since
2001. It is the aim of FKI to continue to reduce solid waste levels and
hence disposal costs across the Group.
Where there is an opportunity to recycle solid waste produced during
operations, FKI businesses take great advantage of this. 74% of companies,
producing 97% of Group turnover, recycle part or all of the solid waste
they produce, the overall income from which is substantially higher than
the disposal costs of the remaining solid waste and liquid waste together.
Recycling therefore not only offers a solution to reduce net waste output
levels but is also commercially beneficial if fully embraced.
Summary
The Group remains committed to driving continuous improvement 
in all areas of CSR performance. In a diversified Company such as FKI,
a balance must be maintained between application of policy by the
corporate centre and delegation of responsibility to the local businesses.
The growth of Group wide communications continues to have a 
positive influence on CSR performance in all businesses.This is displayed
through improved target setting, benchmarking, company reporting and
performance.As businesses share best practice examples and communicate
their local strategies, experiences and performance levels, further
improvements can be expected.

highest possible standards of corporate governance and during
the year followed the principles set out in Section 1 of the
Combined Code.
The directors consider that, throughout the year ended 
31 March 2006 the Company complied fully with the
provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code.
This statement on corporate governance, together with the
Remuneration report, provides a commentary on how the
Company complied with the principles included in Section 
1 of the Combined Code.
The Board 
The directors supervise the management of the business and
the affairs of the Company and see their prime responsibility 
as being to determine the broad strategy of the Group and to
ensure its implementation with a view to enhancing the
prosperity of the Group and its shareholders over time.
The Board currently comprises three executive and six 
non-executive directors, and their names are listed on page 36.
The Board has reviewed the position of its non-executive
directors and has determined that they are all independent in
character and judgement in accordance with the guidance as
set out in the Combined Code. Mr R P Edey has been the
senior independent director throughout the year.
The Board meets at least six times each year with additional
meetings as required.All directors receive regular information
on the Group’s operational and financial performance and the
Board has reserved certain items for its review and approval,
including the annual and interim results, the strategy of the
Company, the annual profit plan, corporate governance and
internal control. It also makes high level decisions regarding
acquisitions and divestments, and sets policies on, amongst
other things, remuneration, health and safety, and the
environment.
During the financial year the Board has undertaken a 
rigorous evaluation of its performance and of its and its
Committees’ processes by means of an independent assessment.
This assessment consisted of third party review of all Board
papers and the papers of Board Committees as well as 
in-depth interviews with individual Board members.
A detailed report on the Board and its Committees, together
with processes, has been produced together with a number of
detailed recommendations for future actions.This has been 
the subject of a preliminary discussion within the Board and
will be discussed further between the Chairman and 
individual Directors. Following these discussions, agreed
recommendations will be adopted and implemented as
appropriate.
The Company Secretary is appointed by and responsible to
the Board and all directors have access to his advice and
services. Directors may obtain independent professional advice
if necessary, at the Company’s expense. Formal agendae, papers
and reports are supplied to directors in a timely manner, prior
to Board meetings. Briefings are also provided at other times,
for example, through operational visits and business
presentations.
The Company has a Chairman and a Chief Executive each
having their own separate responsibilities. Essentially, the
Chairman is responsible for the effective working of the 
Board and the Chief Executive is responsible for all
operational matters.
The directors may at any time appoint an additional director.
A formal selection process is carried out, making use of
external agencies in the selection of suitable candidates where
it appears necessary or appropriate. Upon the appointment of
a new director, relevant training is provided as required.
Any director so appointed shall hold office until the next
annual general meeting and shall be eligible for reappointment
at that meeting. Following such appointment, the Articles of
Association require each director to retire by rotation and seek
re-election at least every three years.
Board Committees
The Board has appointed the following principal Committees:
Audit Committee – The Audit Committee is chaired by
Mr R P Edey and its membership comprises non-executive
directors. It meets at least three times a year and its primary
tasks are to receive regular reports from the Group’s external
auditors and the internal audit function, and to review the
preliminary results, interim information and annual financial
statements before they are presented to the Board,
concentrating particularly on accounting policies and
compliance, areas of management judgement and estimates,
and the monitoring of the controls which are in place to
ensure the integrity of the financial information to be
reported to shareholders.The Board concluded that the
Members of the Audit Committee collectively have sufficient
financial experience to undertake their tasks. The Committee
also discusses internal control issues, and conducts a review of
the remit of the internal audit function, including its authority,
resources and scope of work.Advice is given to the Board
concerning the appointment and remuneration of external
auditors and the Committee also undertakes an annual review
of Auditor effectiveness in line with the requirements of the
Combined Code.The Committee sets the policy on their
engagement and remuneration for non-audit work which is
work that they are best suited to perform, will not involve the
audit of their own firm’s work and will not involve them
making management decisions for or acting as advocate for 
Corporate governance
37 FKI plc 
  the Company. The Auditors have been involved in various
completion balance sheet reviews and if there was a major
disposal or acquisition, the auditors would perform Class 1
work. Any non-audit services are limited to those areas where
the company believes the auditors are best placed to provide
such services effectively.All such services must be approved by
the Finance Director in advance.The Committee monitors the
cost of non-audit work throughout the year and so is in a
position to take action at any time if it believes that there is a
risk of the auditors’ independence being undermined through
the award of non-audit work.
Remuneration Committee – This Committee meets at 
least twice a year, and consists of non-executive directors with
Mr C R N Clark as Chairman until his retirement in
February 2006. Sir Michael Hodgkinson assumed the role of
Chairman on an interim basis with Mr R I Case being
appointed Chairman with effect from 1April 2006. Its key
role is to make recommendations to the Board on the
Company’s framework of executive remuneration and its cost,
and to determine specific remuneration packages for each of
the executive directors, including pension rights and
compensation payments.The objective of the Remuneration
Committee is to ensure that the executive directors are both
highly motivated and fairly rewarded for their contributions 
to the Group’s overall performance. Further details of the
Committee’s work and of the directors’ emoluments and
interests are set out in the report of the Remuneration
Committee on pages 43 to 53.
Nominations Committee – The Nominations Committee
consists of the Chairman of the Board and all the remaining
non-executive directors. It meets when necessary to make
recommendations to the Board on all new Board
appointments and also to advise generally on issues relating 
to Board composition and balance.
The number of full scheduled Board meetings and Committee
meetings attended by each Director during the year was as

Communications with
shareholders
In addition to ensuring that sufficient information is
disseminated in order to maintain an orderly market in the
ordinary shares of the Company, the Company maintains a
regular dialogue with major institutional shareholders and
analysts, particularly following trading updates and results
announcements, which are posted on the Company’s website,
which provides additional Company information and is

The Board members attend the annual general meeting and, in
particular, the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and
Nominations Committees are available to answer questions.
At annual general meetings, separate resolutions are proposed
on each substantially separate issue and the number of proxy
votes received for and against each resolution is announced
together with the number of abstentions. Notices of annual
general meetings are sent to shareholders at least 21 days
before the meeting.
38 FKI plc Corporate governance Financial reporting
The directors, who have sole responsibility for the preparation
and presentation of this report and accounts and other price
sensitive public reports, seek to prepare those reports in a way
that represents a balanced and understandable assessment of the
Group’s position and prospects.
Internal control and risk
management system 
The Board acknowledges its overall responsibility to 
safeguard the Company’s assets and shareholders’ investment.
In accordance with “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors
on the Combined Code” (“the T urnbull Guidance”), the
Board of FKI has established a risk management policy and
system which are an integral part of the management’s
approach to delivery of the strategic and business objectives.
The risk management system is a systematic process designed
to identify, assess, treat, manage and communicate business
risks. It also provides a process for the escalation and
delegation of risks to the appropriate level in the operations
and ensures that actions are properly defined, resourced and
effected to give confidence in achievement of business
objectives.The system operates throughout FKI and is applied
equally to the operating units and corporate function and
report on significant areas of risk and the appropriate controls.
Risks arise from a wide variety of internal and external
sources and can be associated with customer requirements,
competitor actions, regulations and political actions.They may
also arise from the products and services sold by the Group
and the processes used by operations as part of their normal
activities. Management regularly carries out risk assessments
covering risks in strategy, risks to achieving commitments
contained in contracts with customers, risks in organisational
change, risks associated with major projects and risks involving
potential acquisitions.
The output from each assessment is a list of prioritised risks,
the probability of them happening and their impact together
with the associated action plans to mitigate them. Operating
unit and corporate function managers are responsible for these
action plans and their progress is reported at least twice a year
to the FKI Risk Committee as part of their performance
review.The Risk Committee is accountable for the risk
management system and for reporting key risks and associated
mitigating actions to the Board through the Audit Committee
and meets at least twice a year. It is chaired by the Chief
Executive and the other members are the senior executive
management.The Finance Director is responsible for the
implementation of the risk management process throughout
the Group and the compilation of the Group risk register
which records all risks which management consider to be
significant, together with all appropriate mitigating actions.
The risk registers are reviewed with the three year business
plans in August/September and with the annual budget in
February/March.These reviews cover actions completed and
the status of ongoing actions.
An independent review of the risk process was completed in
October 2003 and concluded that the risk process was in
compliance with the Turnbull guidelines. However it was
decided that a number of improvements could be made to the
process to help meet business objectives.These recommendations
for improving the system have now been implemented and are
being embedded into the normal business processes, including
approval of tenders, capital expenditure and business projects.
Lessons learnt from the implementation and operation of the
risk process are being fed back and will be further reviewed in
future to ensure continuous improvement.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems 
of internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness.
The Board has reviewed the key risks inherent in the Group,
together with the operating, financial and compliance controls
that have been implemented to mitigate those key risks.
However, any system of internal control can only provide
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The Company has an organisation structure with clearly
defined lines of responsibility, accountability and delegated
authority and with clear local operating autonomy within a
framework of central management, stated corporate aims and
objectives.The operating performance of each business is
regularly reviewed by the executive directors, and progress is
monitored against business plans, utilising established
procedures for business planning, budgeting, capital
expenditure approval and treasury management.

business in which the employee works. It is the policy of the
Group to give full and fair consideration to applications made
by disabled persons for job vacancies, where particular job
requirements are within their ability and, where possible,

Environmental policy
The Group is committed to adopting a responsible approach
to environmental matters.The Group’s overall policy forms

Management seeks to minimise any adverse impact on the
environment of all aspects of the Group’s operations by means
of environmentally sound disciplines, which take practical 
steps to control effectively or eliminate any known pollution
risks. Specifically, capital expenditure is directed towards the
replacement of hazardous materials with environmentally
friendly alternatives and methods of minimising the costs 
of disposal of toxic waste, the recycling of wood, the reuse 
of cardboard and paper products, and the reduction of 
energy consumption.
Further details of the Group’s environmental policies are

41 FKI plc Directors’ report Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and Group and parent Company financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and
parent Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the directors are required to prepare the
Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare the parent
Company financial statements in accordance with UK
Accounting Standards.
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs
as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position
and performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985
provides in relation to such financial statements that references
in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving 
a true and fair view are references to their achieving a 
fair presentation.
The parent Company financial statements are required by 
law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
parent Company.
In preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU;
• for the parent Company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the parent Company financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and of the Group 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation.They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Remuneration
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply
with that law and those regulations.The directors are
responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate
and financial information included on the Company’s

addressed in this Report and the preceding Operating and
Financial Review.
Going concern

Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for formulating executive remuneration policy and for determining the
remuneration of the executive directors and certain senior executives.
Its members are the non-executive directors as shown in Table 1 together with their attendance at meetings of the
Remuneration Committee during 2005/06.

(1) Mr C R N Clark resigned his post as non-executive director on 7 February 2006. Sir Michael Hodgkinson chaired the Committee meeting in March 2006. Mr R I Case became
Chairman of the Committee from 1 April 2006.
(2) Mr D J Pearl attended the Committee for the first occasion in November 2005 following his appointment as a non-executive director in September 2005.
(3) Mr R I Case attended the Committee for the first occasion in March 2006 following his appointment as a non-executive director in February 2006.
The Company Chairman attended the Committee by invitation.
All of the above served on the Remuneration Committee throughout the year, or as indicated, in Table 1.All of the non-executive
directors including the Company Chairman are considered by the Company to be independent.
Mr Heiden is normally invited to attend meetings as an adviser to the Committee. He was not present when his own
remuneration was being determined. During 2005/06 the Committee received information from Mercer Human Resources
(TSR monitoring), and Hewitt Associates (remuneration policy and market data). Hewitt also provided administration services
to the Group pension scheme and plan. Mr Heiden appointed Hewitt Associates as advisers in 2004/05. Mercer Human
Resources was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 1998.
In accordance with the requirements of the revised Companies Act, an ordinary resolution seeking shareholders’ approval for
the Remuneration report will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
Executive remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee’s objectives are to ensure that the Company is able to:
• attract, retain and motivate high calibre people; and
• align the interests of the executive directors and senior executives with those of shareholders by rewarding executive directors
and certain senior executives according to the overall performance of the individual businesses and Group.
In July 2005 shareholders voted in favour of proposals arising from a review of executive remuneration.The major changes to
policy and practice are summarised below:
• a policy of setting base salaries at the appropriate market median;
• 50% of total remuneration to be variable, for on-target performance;
• a more appropriate balance between short and long-term variable remuneration;
• one-third of annual incentives paid as restricted shares that can be matched if ROIC
(1)
target is achieved;
• long-term incentives to be a combination of option grants and/or performance shares.
Under the new policy, on-target performance is capable of delivering around 50% of total remuneration in the form of variable
remuneration.This is achieved through the annual performance related bonus scheme and long-term incentives.
(1) ROIC is defined as operating profit adjusted for exceptional items divided by total capital invested in the business. 44 FKI plc Remuneration report
IFRS and consistent measurement
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that following the introduction of international accounting standards the Company
has introduced procedures to ensure consistent measurement of any aspect of business performance that may impact on
executive remuneration.
United States Job Creation Act 2005
The Remuneration Committee has taken advice and has amended the rules of the 2005 LTIP and Deferred Bonus Plan to
ensure compliance with the Act.
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salary is reviewed annually having regard to market practices for similar executive positions in a comparable group of
companies mainly in the engineering sector and supported by information and advice from independent external consultants.
Salaries are set around the median of the distribution from an appropriate peer group of comparators. For most roles this peer
group was the engineering and machinery sector. However, for the roles of Chief Executive and Group Finance Director a
broader range of comparators, including some outside of the engineering and machinery sector, are used to help determine
competitive base salaries. Comparative data and information was provided by Hewitt Associates.
Executive directors also receive additional taxable benefits, namely the provision of a fully expensed company car 
(or an allowance in lieu thereof), medical insurance and disability insurance.
Performance appraisal
The Company has a structured performance appraisal process for its executive directors and executive management.
The outcome from appraisal influences decisions on salary progression and helps to identify individual and collective 
training and development needs.
Annual performance related bonus scheme
The Company operates an annual performance related bonus scheme for executive directors and other schemes for certain
senior executives.The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director participate in a bonus scheme based upon budgeted pre-tax
profits of the Group. Mr Gott, Group Engineering Director/MD FKI Logistex participates in a scheme based partly upon
budgeted pre-tax profit of the Group and partly on the profit and operating cash flow of FKI Logistex. Other senior executives
participate in a bonus scheme based upon business unit profit, operating cash flow and achievement of personal objectives, or
Group profit and personal objectives.
For executive directors a performance related bonus of 25% of salary is payable for achieving a trigger point of Target profit 
less 10% budgeted operating profit, after interest but before exceptional items, amortisation and tax.The bonus increases on a
straight-line pro rata basis from 25% to 50% for achieving between the trigger point and 100% of Target profit.The bonus may
increase further on a straight-line pro rata basis from 50% to 100% for achieving 100% of Target profit plus 10% of budgeted
operating profit.
Subject to approval by the Board of reasonable adjustments to Target Profit, the Company’s external auditors confirm that 
the calculation of bonuses for the Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director adheres to the scheme rules governing 
such calculations.
From 1 April 2006, one-third of any post-tax cash bonus for executive directors will be exchanged for deferred shares.
If the Company’s level of ROIC reaches an average of 10% over the following three years the deferred shares will be matched
one-for-one. Dividends are paid on deferred shares.This plan is designed to align executive director’s interests more closely 
with the long-term interests of shareholders and provide a mechanism that encourages executive directors to grow their
personal shareholding in the Company.A similar scheme exists for a small number of senior executives but with reduced 
levels of matching. Executive directors are now encouraged to accumulate a shareholding of one times basic salary over a 
four year period. The new long-term incentive plan
In 2005, following shareholders approval, new long-term incentive arrangements were introduced. In the first year of the new
arrangements, long-term incentives were provided through a combination of executive share options and performance shares.
Each element of the long-term incentive may vest independently of the other. Executive directors can be awarded up to 
two times annual salary in options and up to one times annual salary in performance shares, determined on an individual 
basis by the Remuneration Committee. Details of actual grants can be found in tables on pages 51 and 52.
Share options
The practice is to grant options within a period of six weeks following the announcement of the Company’s preliminary
and/or interim results.
The share option element is granted at the average price of FKI plc ordinary shares over five dealing days before the grant date
and are normally required to be held for a minimum of three years before they are capable of exercise. If options fail to vest at
the third anniversary they lapse. Options that vest at the third anniversary remain live until the tenth anniversary of granting.
Options vest against the level of Earnings Per Share (EPS). No options vest for an EPS less than RPI + 9% over the three-year
measurement period. For EPS at or greater than RPI + 9%, options vest on a straight-line basis as illustrated in the table below:
RPI + EPS growth over a three year period Percentage of the option grant that vests
Below RPI + 9% Nil
RPI + 9% 25
RPI + 12% 50
RPI + 15% 75
RPI + 18% 100
Earnings per share growth is considered to be an appropriate measure of the Company’s underlying performance, as it requires
that there should be a demanding improvement in the Company’s performance before scheme participants can benefit from an
increase in the share price.The assessment as to whether performance conditions have been met is calculated by the Secretary
to the Remuneration Committee and independently verified by the Remuneration Committee, and, where appropriate, advice
is obtained from an external independent firm of Chartered Accountants.
Earnings per share is defined as the Company’s headline earnings per share, as calculated in accordance with the principles set
out in the Statement of Investment Practice No. 1 “The Definition of IIMR Headline Earnings” issued by the Institute of
Investment Management and Research. IIMR Headline earnings are calculated by excluding from the reported results any
income statement items of a non-trading or capital nature.
Option grants made in 2006/07 onwards
No options will vest for an EPS less than RPI + 12% over the three-year measurement period. For EPS at or greater than 
RPI + 12%, options will vest on a straight-line basis as illustrated in the table below:
RPI + EPS growth over a three year period Percentage of the option grant that vests
Below RPI + 12% Nil
RPI + 12% 25
RPI + 15% 50
RPI + 18% 75
RPI + 21% 100
45 FKI plc Remuneration report 46 FKI plc Remuneration report
The new long-term incentives plan (continued)
Performance shares
Performance shares are held in trust for three years.There are two performance conditions for each grant of performance
shares. Fifty per cent of a grant may vest against Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and the remaining 50% may vest against
return on invested capital (ROIC). Performance shares that fail to vest at the third anniversary of grant automatically lapse.
Accrued dividends are paid on any performance shares that vest.
For performance shares linked to TSR, no shares vest for a TSR performance below the 50th percentile. For a TSR
performance above the 50th percentile performance shares vest on a straight-line basis as illustrated in the table below:
FKI plc TSR performance Percentage of the TSR-related performance shares that vest
Below median Nil
Equal to the median 30
Equal to or above the 80th percentile 100
For performance shares linked to ROIC, no shares vest for a three-year average ROIC of less than 8%. For a three-year average
ROIC performance above 8%, performance shares vest on a straight-line basis as illustrated in the table below:
Averaged ROIC over a three year performance period Percentage of the ROIC-related performance shares that vest
Below 8% Nil
At 8% 40
At 9% 60
At 10% 80
At 11% and above 100
Former long-term incentive plan
All executive options granted from July 1996 onwards may only be exercised subject to a performance condition that the
Group’s growth in earnings per share, as defined above, must exceed the UK retail price index by 9% or more over a three year
period, subject to retesting in subsequent years from a rolling base. Retesting was removed from the former executive option
scheme for options granted after April 2004.
The level of vesting of awards under the former LTIP is determined by the performance of the Company’s Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) against a comparator group of all companies which on the date of grant are constituent companies of the
former Engineering and Machinery sector as determined by the FTSE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee.The graph
opposite shows the Company’s TSR performance compared with that of the comparator group.
No awards vest for below median performance and 50% of an award will vest for median performance. Full vesting occurs 
only at upper quartile performance, and 75% of an award will vest for performance above the median but below upper 
quartile.Accrued dividends on vested awards are paid to the executives pending transfer of the shares into the name of the
respective participant.The performance condition is based upon Total Shareholder Return, as illustrated in the graph opposite,
as this was considered to be the best means of aligning the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior 
total shareholder return.
A table giving full details of the directors’ options, LTIP shares and performances shares granted under the new and former
plans and exercised during the year under review is shown on pages 51 and 52. The new long-term incentives plan (continued)

Inland Revenue Approved Save-As-You-Earn share option scheme
This scheme was approved by shareholders in 1997 and is open to all UK employees who have completed six months’ service
and who enter into an approved savings contract for a term of three or five years.The maximum amount that can be saved is
£250 per month, and the total savings (including interest) at the end of the term are available to purchase shares at 80% of their
market value shortly before the start of the savings contract. Executive directors may participate in this scheme on the same
terms as all other employees.
In 2005/06 the Company evaluated the feasibility of extending a similar offer of participation in savings-related share 
ownership schemes to its employees in mainland Europe and North America.The study concluded that it would not be
economic or administratively practical to introduce such schemes after taking account of the likely level of participation 
by eligible employees.

It is the Company’s policy that all executive directors have one-year rolling service contracts with a one-year notice period.
However, in order to attract high calibre recruits, the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to offer newly
recruited executive directors an initial two-year notice period which reduces to one year. Save as listed below, there are no
express provisions for compensation payable upon early termination of the executive directors’ contracts and at the date of
termination, other than payments due during the notice period.
In the case of Mr Heiden, in the event of termination of his service contract by an acquiring company after a change of
control, there is provision in his service contract for a payment of liquidated damages equivalent to one year’s pay and
contractual benefits without deduction for mitigation and/or accelerated receipt.
The contract dates and notice periods for the executive directors during the year were as follows:
Name of director Date of contract Notice period
P Heiden 16 December 2002 One year
R L Gott 7 April 2005 One year
N Bamford 2 June 2004 One year
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.The dates of the current non-executive directors’ appointments are
as follows:
Non-executive director Appointment date Date of last re-election Date of next re-election
Mr C R N Clark 1 January 2000 23 July 2003 Retired February 2006
Mr R P Edey 6 November 1996 23 July 2003 Retires August 2006

Mr G F Page CBE 1 August 2004 20 July 2005 July 2008
Mr D J Pearl 27 September 2005 n/a 1 August 2006
Mr R I Case CBE 7 February 2006 n/a 1 August 2006 Succession planning
During 2004, the Company introduced a succession planning process for its executive directors and senior executive
management as part of its risk management process.The Remuneration Committee reviewed the 2004 executive succession
plan at its meeting in November 2005 and recommended actions to address succession issues in a small number of Group
businesses.The Executive Committee has continued to manage the development of potential successors.A new executive
development programme was launched in 2005 with the help of Ashridge in the UK and Babson College, Boston MA,
in the USA.
Pensions
With the exception of Mr Heiden, executive directors are members of the FKI Group Pension Scheme, a defined benefit
scheme with a normal retirement age for directors of 60 years.
Its main features, in respect of executive directors, are:
(a) a cash benefit on death in service of four times annual rate of the highest average basic salary (restricted to the earnings cap
where it applies) during any three consecutive years within the ten years before the member’s date of death.Additional life
assurance cover is purchased where necessary to provide death in service benefits relating to salary above the earnings cap;
(b) pensions payable in the event of ill health;
(c) pensions for dependants on a member’s death generally equal to half the member’s prospective retirement pension at 60 on
death in service, or half the member’s pension entitlement on death in retirement;
(d) member contributions are 7% of basic salary (restricted to the earnings cap where it applies).
There are funded unapproved pension arrangements to increase the pension benefits where, because of Inland Revenue
limitations (including those resulting from the earnings cap), these cannot be paid in total from the FKI Group Pension
Scheme. Such arrangements apply to Mr Gott.
During 2005, the former unfunded pension arrangement for Mr Gott was terminated and replaced by an unapproved funded
arrangement for future service.The unfunded, unapproved arrangement for previous qualifying service up to 31 March 2004
will also be funded by the Company making payment by four annual instalments each of £45,000.The first instalment was 
paid in November 2005. Remaining instalments will be paid in April 2006, 2007 and 2008.
In lieu of participation in the FKI Group Pension Scheme, Mr Heiden received contributions into a funded unapproved
retirement benefit scheme equivalent to 50% of his basic salary. Details of this are shown in the table headed “Directors’
emoluments” on page 50. For the purpose of clarity the amounts paid to Mr Heiden in 2005 and 2006 have been shown under
the column headed ’Pension contributions’ (see note 2 below the table).
Details of the directors’ pension benefits during the year under review are shown on page 51.
In 2005 the Remuneration Committee adopted a policy which assured that any changes in individual pension arrangements for
executives arising from the 2006 pension simplification legislation will be cost neutral for the Company.
Non-executive directorships
The Company believes that there are significant benefits to the individual and the Company from executive directors 
accepting non-executive directorships in other organisations.
Each executive director may normally accept one non-executive directorship provided that it does not conflict with 
the Company’s interests and is approved by the Board. Fees from any external directorship may be retained by the 
director concerned.
For parts of 2005/06 Mr Heiden temporarily held two non-executive positions but shortly after the year-end this had 
reduced to one position with United Utilities plc. Details of fees received by him in 2005/06 in respect of these positions are
shown below:
Bunzl plc (April – June 2005) £8,643 Resigned 6 June 2005
Filtrona plc (June 2005 – March 2006) £26,297 Resigned 26 April 2006

February 2006.The table above shows fees for only the relevant part of the year for Mr D J Pearl, Mr R I Case and Mr C R N Clark.
(2) In the previous year a payment equivalent to 50% basic salary made to Mr Heiden in respect of his retirement arrangements was shown in the emoluments table in a column
headed ’Other’. For the purpose of clarity the relevant amount for 2006 has been shown in a column headed ’Pension contributions’ and for comparison the amount paid 
in 2005 has been placed under the same heading.This has had the effect of reducing the amount shown under ’Total’ in 2005 by the same amount shown under Pension
contributions’ for 2005.
Non-executive directors’ fees
The fees paid to non-executive directors and the Chairman are determined by the Board after reviewing fee payments for
comparable positions within similar organisations, and are normally reviewed every two years.The last review was in March
2006 and increases implemented from 1 April 2006.
Fees for Mr R I Case are paid to Melchester Associates Ltd at his request.
Former executive director Mr John Biles
A payment of £78,000 was made by the Company to Mr Biles in full and final settlement of an outstanding claim for
guaranteed bonus for the period 2001/04. Directors’ pension benefits
The under noted directors were members of a defined benefit scheme provided by the Group during the year. Mr P Heiden 
is responsible for his own pension provision. Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values were as follows during 
the year:
Transfer value
of increase/

Name of director £000 £000 £000 £000 £000 £000 £000
Mr R L Gott (3.1) (45.5) 21.4 23.8 249.3 209.7 32.2
Mr N Bamford 10.3 124.1 56.4 44.8 594.4 358.0 221.9
Note: In addition to the accrued pension shown in the table, Mr Gott will receive a fixed pension of £24,400 from age 65 in respect of a transfer value paid into the Scheme.
The value of this pension is excluded from the transfer values shown.
(1) The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
(2) The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
(3) The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, although no adjustment has been made for any under
funding of the Scheme.The calculation of each transfer value includes an allowance for the cost of death before retirement benefits.
(4) The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year is impacted by the following elements:
a. the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension (net of inflation);
b. the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension (due to inflation);
c. the increase in the transfer value of accrued pension at the beginning of the year due to ageing;
d. the impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis;
e. the effect of a. to d. less the director’s own contributions over the year.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and
directors, such as stock market movements that are reflected in d. above.
(5) Directors have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions. However, neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the table.
(6) Mr Gott’s UK pension scheme benefits are subject to the Inland Revenue’s earnings cap.This includes the period of service prior to Mr Gott becoming a director. For service
prior to 1 April 2004 the Company had agreed to provide benefits in excess of the earnings cap and to augment pension benefits to 50% of his salary from normal retirement age
(but adjusted pro rata to reflect the ratio of his pre 1 April 2004 service to his total potential service). Under this arrangement as much of his benefits as possible would be
provided within the Scheme with the balance being paid through an Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme. However, during the year Mr Gott waived this
arrangement for his pre 1 April 2004 benefits in return for a series of pension contributions totalling £180,000 payable over the next four years.This is the reason why his accrued
pension shown in the table above has decreased. For service from 1 April 2004, Mr Gott is being paid a supplement of 37% pa of salary to provide further pension benefits on a
defined contribution basis.

Notes:
1. The Company’s Total Shareholder Return performance for the three-year performance period that ended in March 2006 ranked below median against its comparator group
and under the terms of the rules applicable to the 2002 awards and those made in January 2003, 100% of the awards lapsed.
2. The price of an ordinary share on 26 August 2005, being the date that awards were made during the year was 105.00p.The awards are subject to the performance conditions
for LTIP awards, as outlined in the policy section.
3. The market value of shares as yet unvested is stated at 126p per share, being the closing mid-market price on 31 March 2006. If the ranking position of the award made in
2003 were to be maintained until the end of the respective performance period, none of the awards granted in 2003 would vest.
4. Performance shares granted in 2005 vest on a different scale compared with shares granted in the former LTIP prior to 2005. Details of vesting scales can be found on

Auditable information
The information in the Remuneration report subject to audit is that included in the tables and related notes in the section on
directors’ emoluments, directors’ LTIPs, directors’ share options and directors’ pension benefits.
By order of the Board
R I Case CBE Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
23 June 2006
53 FKI plc Remuneration report W e have audited the Group’s financial statements of FKI plc for the
year ended 31 March 2006 which comprise the Consolidated
income statement, Consolidated balance sheet, Consolidated cash
flow statement, Consolidated statement of recognised income and
expense, the related notes 1 to 44, Company balance sheet and
related notes 1 to 17, and the Principal Subsidiary Undertakings on
page 140.These financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein.We have also audited the
information in the Remuneration report that is described as having
been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.
T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report 
and the group financial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and for
preparing the parent Company financial statements and the
Remuneration report in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) as set out in the statement
of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of
the Remuneration report to be audited in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
W e report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985 and whether, in addition, the Group financial statements have
been properly prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation.We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’
report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003
FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does
not.We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures
or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements.The other information comprises the Directors’ report,
the unaudited part of the Remuneration report, the Chairman’s
statement, the Corporate social responsibility review, the Operating
and financial review and the Corporate governance statement.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board.An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
and the part of the Remuneration report to be audited. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
Remuneration report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of
the presentation of information in the financial statements and the
part of the Remuneration report to be audited.
The maintenance and integrity of the FKI plc web site is the
responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors
does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the
auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have
occurred to the financial statements since they were initially
presented on the web site.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2006 and of its profit
for the year then ended;
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation;
– the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 March 2006; and 
– the parent Company financial statements and the part of the
Remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

59 FKI plc  Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1) General information
FKI plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.The Company’s ordinary shares are
traded on the London Stock Exchange.The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the “Group”).
The financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand pounds except
where otherwise indicated.
2) Statement of compliance
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as
adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, for the first time
and the comparatives have been restated from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) to comply with IFRS.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported financial position and financial performance of the
Group is provided in note 44. No material adjustments other than changes in presentation have been made to the consolidated
cash flow statement.
On 18 October 2005 the Group published detailed income statement, balance sheet and equity reconciliations of UK GAAP 
to IFRS.The information contained in note 44 is an abridged extract of this published document.The published document is
posted on the FKI plc website www.fkiplc.com.A copy of the document may also be obtained from the Company Secretary of
FKI plc at the registered office.
The disclosures of continuing operations and discontinued operations for the comparative period have been restated in these
financial statements to reflect all operations that have been discontinued at 31 March 2006.This is in accordance with IFRS 5.
Therefore, the comparative information disclosed in these financial statements does not agree to those figures issued on 
18 October 2005 or to the restatement information in note 44 to the accounts.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP and these are
presented in a separate section of this report on pages 123 to 137.
3) Significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The policies set out below have been consistently applied except for those relating to classification and measurement of
financial instruments.The Group has made use of the exemption under IFRS 1 to only apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 
1 April 2005.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005 have been prepared on the historic cost basis except for 
non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale which are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less
estimated costs to sell.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006 have been prepared on the historic cost basis except for derivative
financial instruments, financial instruments held for trading and available for sale financial assets which have been measured at
fair value.The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values
attributable to the risks that are being hedged. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of
carrying amount and fair value less estimated costs to sell.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of FKI plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March each year,
together with the Group’s share of the results of associates using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in
preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included from or up to the date on which control is
transferred to or out of the Group respectively.
60 FKI plc 
  3) Significant accounting policies (continued)
(c) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating
policies.The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on
an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and
recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations
or made payments on behalf of an associate.
(d) Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
that are stated at fair value are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were determined.
Exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign
entity are taken directly to reserves to the extent that they can be offset against the exchange differences arising on the equity
investments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, of overseas subsidiary and associated
undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.The income and cash flows 
of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange prevailing during 
the year, with the year end adjustment to closing rates being taken to reserves. Differences on exchange arising from the 
retranslation at year end rates of the net investment in overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings at the beginning of the
year are taken to reserves.All other exchange differences are dealt with in the determination of profit for the financial year.
Exchange adjustments arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations and of related hedges are taken 
to translation reserves in equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in reserves 
relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The Group has adopted the exemption allowing these cumulative translation differences to be reset to zero at the transition date
(1 April 2004) to IFRS.
(e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on all assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual
value, of each asset on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Long leasehold property 50 years
Short leasehold property over the lease term
Plant and machinery – heavy production 15 years
– other 10 years
Office equipment 5 to 10 years
Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of
property, plant and equipment.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds,
less costs of disposal, and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
61 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3) Significant accounting policies (continued)
(f) Goodwill
Goodwill on business acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the
acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition,
goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill on acquisitions after 31 March 2004 is not amortised and goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition
to IFRS (which is 1 April 2004), is not amortised after that date. Goodwill existing at the date of transition to IFRS has been
retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts as the Group has elected not to restate business combinations that occurred before
the date of transition to IFRS.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may be impaired.
Negative goodwill arising on any acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
(g) Intangible assets
(i) Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is capitalised when its
future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured. Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure,
the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated
impairment losses.Any expenditure capitalised is amortised over the lesser of the useful life of the project or three years.
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets including those arising from a business combination are amortised over their remaining useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, unless such
lives are indefinite.The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Computer software 3 years
(h) Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use.This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly
probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be
committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date 
of classification.
(i) Leases
Assets obtained under leases and hire purchase contracts which result in the transfer to the Group of substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership (finance leases) are capitalised as tangible fixed assets at the estimated present value of underlying 
lease payments and are depreciated over their expected useful lives.The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded
as liabilities whilst the finance elements of the rental payments are charged to the income statement over the period of the 
lease or hire purchase contract so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding balance of the net obligation in
each period.
Rentals paid under other leases (operating leases) are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the 
lease term.
62 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3) Significant accounting policies (continued)
(j) Impairment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).Where the asset does not generate cash
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which
the asset belongs.An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an
indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, less costs to sell, and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time
value of money, and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is
reduced to its recoverable amount.An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is
carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its
recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised
as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment
loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
(k) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, on a first-in first-out basis, and net realisable value after making due allowance for any
obsolete or slow moving inventory. Cost comprises direct materials and labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing
overheads, based on normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary
to make the sale.
(l) Construction contracts
Revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Stage of completion is determined by
the costs incurred to date to the extent that such costs represent progress made on the project. Cost comprises direct materials
and labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity.
The Group presents as an asset the gross amount due from construction contract customers, for all contracts in progress for
which costs incurred plus recognised profits less provisions for foreseeable losses exceeds progress billings. Progress billings not
yet paid by customers and retentions are included within trade and other receivables.
The Group presents as a liability the gross amount due to construction contract customers for all contracts in progress for
which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits, less recognised foreseeable losses.
(m) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that
an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of
the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
63 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3) Significant accounting policies (continued)
(n) Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
(i) Defined contribution pension schemes
Pension costs for the Group’s defined contribution pension schemes are recognised within operating profit at an amount equal
to the contributions payable to the scheme for the period.Any prepaid or outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date
are recognised respectively as assets or liabilities within prepayments or accruals.
(ii) Defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits
Pension liabilities are measured at their present value in accordance with actuarial assumptions that are updated at each balance
sheet date. Pension assets are measured at fair value.The pension liability or asset is recognised in the balance sheet.
Pension costs for the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits are recognised as follows:
(a) Within operating profit
• The current service cost arising from employee service in the current period;
• The prior service cost related to employee service in prior periods arising in the current period as a result of improvements
to benefits;
• Gains and losses arising on unanticipated settlements or curtailments where the item that gave rise to the settlement or
curtailment is recognised within operating profit.
(b) Within other finance cost or income
• The interest cost on the liabilities, calculated by reference to the scheme liabilities and discount rate at the beginning of 
the period.
• The expected return on assets, calculated by reference to the assets and their long-term expected rate of return at the
beginning of the period.
(c) Within the statement of recognised income and expense
• On the scheme assets – the difference between the expected and actual return on assets;
• On the scheme liabilities – (a) the differences between the actuarial assumptions and actual experience, and (b) the effect of
changes in actuarial assumptions.
(o) Share-based payment transactions
Certain employees (including directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions,
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (“equity-settled transactions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are
granted.The fair value is determined by an external valuation. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any
performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of FKI plc (“market conditions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which
the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the
award (“vesting date”).The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards at that date based on the best
available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other
performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been
modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification,
as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and
designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a
modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
64 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3) Significant accounting policies (continued)
(o) Share-based payment transactions (continued)
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
The Group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to
executives and senior employees. Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are presented in the balance sheet as a
deduction from equity.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied
IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 April 2004.
(p) Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts,VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer.
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on construction
contracts.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, by reference to
completion of the specific transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services 
to be provided. Revenue from services provided on a short-term basis is recognised when the service is complete.
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method that discounts estimated future cash
receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument) to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
(q) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
(i) Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2005
IAS 32 – “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation” and IAS 39 – “Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement” have been applied for the first time in the financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2006.
Therefore, the comparative information prepared under IFRS for the year ended 31 March 2005 applies UK GAAP 
to the treatment of derivative instruments. Set out below is the UK GAAP accounting policy:
Derivatives for hedging purposes are held off balance sheet with the exception of cross currency swaps, where the net exchange
gain/loss as a result of exchange rate movements is recorded on the balance sheet to reflect the substance of the transaction.
The movements in the balance sheet value are recorded in reserves since the borrowing is a hedge of the associated currency
net assets.
The net interest cost/income arising on interest rate swaps is charged/credited to the interest line in the profit and loss account
on an accruals basis. Monetary discounts or premiums arising on the disposal or other early termination of interest rate swaps
are amortised on a straight line basis over the original unexpired life of the swap against interest charges in the profit and 
loss account.
Finance costs are recognised in the income statement over the term of the instruments to which they relate at a constant rate
on the carrying amount.
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.The carrying amount is increased by the
finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by the payments made in the period.
(ii) Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2006
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from
operational, financial and investment activities.The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition they are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. However, where derivatives qualify
for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts
with similar maturity profiles.The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to the present value of
the estimated future cash flows.
65 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3) Significant accounting policies (continued)
(q) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (continued)
(ii) Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2006 (continued)
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges where they hedge the exposure to changes
in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that
is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
In relation to fair value hedges (eg: interest rate swaps) which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from
remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.Any gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and
recognised in the income statement.Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial
instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the net profit and loss such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
In relation to cash flow hedges (eg: forward foreign currency contracts including cross currency swap contracts) to hedge firm
commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that
is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly to equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in net profit 
or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is
recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement
of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For cash flow hedges that do not result in the
recognition of an asset or a liability, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement 
in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit and loss, for example when the future sale
actually occurs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer
qualifies for hedge accounting.At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in
equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the year.
(r) Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on all temporary differences, subject to the exceptions noted below, at the
balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax in respect of taxable or deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not
recognised where the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse
in the foreseeable future or in the case of assets, taxable profit will be unavailable against which the temporary differences,
can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences,
and carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which it is anticipated that the asset will
be realised or the liability will be settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.
66 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3) Significant accounting policies (continued)
(s) Investments
(i) Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2005
Investments are stated at cost, less provision for any impairment in value.
(ii) Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2006
All investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and the costs of acquisition.
After initial recognition, investments which are classified as held for trading or available for sale, are measured at fair value.
Gains or losses on investments held for trading are recognised in income. Gains or losses on available for sale investments are
recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is sold or is determined to be impaired, at which time the
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement.
Investments classified as held to maturity are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition, over the period to maturity.
For investments carried at amortised cost, gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are
derecognised or impaired.
The fair values of quoted investments are determined by reference to current bid prices. For investments for which there is no
quoted market price, fair value is determined by reference either to the current market value of another instrument which is
substantially the same or is calculated based on the expected cash flows of the underlying net asset base of the investment.
(t) Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with
the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on
settlement.
Where, prior to the Group’s adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 April 2005, an effective fair value hedging relationship existed
between a cross currency swap contract and a qualifying loan/borrowing, the carrying value of the loan/borrowing is adjusted
by an amount to offset the value of the related fair value hedge to the extent that such value has not been recognised through
the income statement.
Gains and losses are recognised in net profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the
amortisation process.
(u) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a major qualifying asset, are
capitalised as part of the cost of the asset if the costs are significant and a significant period of time is required to complete the
asset. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying
assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
67 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3) Significant accounting policies (continued)
(v) Adopted standards and interpretations not yet applied
During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the
date of these financial statements.The effective date quoted below relates to the annual period beginning on or after:
International Accounting Standards Board (IAS/IFRSs)
Effective date
Amendment to IAS 39: Financial Instruments – The fair value option 1 January 2006
Amendment to IAS 39: Cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intragroup transactions 1 January 2006
Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 (Insurance Contracts): Financial Instruments: Financial guarantee contracts 1 January 2006
Amendment to IAS 1: Presentation of financial statements – capital disclosures 1 January 2007
IFRS 6: Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources 1 January 2006
IFRS 7: Financial Instruments – disclosures 1 January 2007
Amendment to IAS 21: Net investment in a foreign operation 1 January 2006
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
IFRIC 4: Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 1 January 2006
IFRIC 5: Rights to interests arising from de-commissioning, restoration and 
environmental rehabilitation funds 1 January 2006
IFRIC 6: Liabilities arising from participation in a specific market – waste, electrical 
and electronic equipment 1 December 2005
The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the
Group’s financial statements in the periods of initial application commencing on or after 1 April 2006.
With respect to the financial guarantee contracts, where the Group enters into such contracts to guarantee the indebtedness 
of other companies within the Group, the Group considers these to be insurance arrangements and as such in this respect the
Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be
required to make payment under the guarantee.
(w) Key sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the above accounting policies, management has made appropriate estimates and judgements in a number of areas.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are:
Post-retirement benefits
The determination of the pension and other post retirement benefits cost and obligation is based on assumptions determined
with independent actuarial advice.The assumptions include discount rate, inflation, pension and salary increases, expected return
on scheme assets, mortality and other demographic assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which
goodwill has been allocated.The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the
cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Deferred income tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised. In particular,
significant judgement is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised which is dependent
on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits.The Group recognises deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not
that the benefit will be realised.

5) Segment information
The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the Group’s risks and rates of return 
are affected predominantly by differences in the products and services provided. Secondary segment information is 
reported geographically.
For management purposes the Group is organised into four operating groups:
FKI Logistex is a supplier of automated material handling systems to the warehouse and retail distribution, freight and parcel,
airport baggage handling and manufacturing sectors around the world.

hardware, ergonomic equipment and castors for original equipment manufacturers, distributors and retailers.
Energy T echnology is a supplier of electrical plant and systems to a wide variety of customers in industry, power generation and
oil and gas supply.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Segment revenue and operating profit includes trading between business segments which are eliminated on consolidation.
Inter segment sales are not material in relation to total Group revenue.

The impairment loss during the year of £4.3 million arises on reducing the carrying value of assets of a business operation
within the Hardware Group.The impairment review was performed as a result of changes in the competitive environment.
The recoverable amount of the business operation is based on its value in use and a discount rate of 9.2% was applied in the
calculation.
The impairment loss was allocated to reduce the carrying amount of assets of the business operation pro rata on the basis of 
the carrying amount of each asset as follows:

Basic earnings per ordinary share and diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the
equity holders of the Company for the year by respectively the basic weighted ordinary shares in issue during the year or the
diluted weighted average ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Adjusted earnings per share, which provides a better understanding of the underlying performance of the Group, is calculated
by dividing the operating profit/(loss) for the year before special items (loss on sale of businesses, reorganisations, closures and
impairments and profit on property sales), profit/(loss) on disposal of discontinued operations, fair value gains/losses on financial
instruments and exchange gains/losses included within finance costs and income and taxation related to those items by the
weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.The profit/loss for the period until disposal of discontinued
operations is included as part of the profit for the year. Profit attributable to minority interest is excluded from this calculation.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations.The key assumptions for
the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and
direct costs. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value 
of money.The discount rate applied was 9.2%.The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling
prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market and inflation.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the management for the
next three years and extrapolates cash flows thereafter using a growth rate applicable to the relevant market.This rate does not
exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets.

87 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 27) Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (continued)
The Euro 600 million guaranteed Eurobond matures on 22 February 2010 and bears interest at 6.625%. Costs incurred in
issuing these bonds are amortised over the ten year life of the bond.The remaining unamortised issue costs at 31 March 2006
are £2.2 million (2005: £2.3 million).The Company has transacted a number of cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps 
to synthetically alter the currency and interest rate obligations of Euro 576 million out of the Euro 600 million obligation.
These cross-currency and interest rate swaps are reported as derivative financial instruments.
The guaranteed bank borrowings are drawn under the Company’s syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility.
Drawdowns under this facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin ranging between 0.5% and 0.7% depending upon the level
of the Company’s debt.This facility matures on 26 July 2007 and is guaranteed by the Company’s subsidiaries FKI Engineering
Limited and FKI Industries Inc.
The US Dollar 173.5 million (2005: US Dollar 183.5 million) guaranteed US private placement loan notes are issued by the
Company’s subsidiary FKI Industries Inc. and guaranteed by the Company.The interest rates and maturities on these loan notes
are shown below. US Dollar 10 million (2005: US Dollar 20 million) of this debt obligation has been swapped into floating rate
interest and US Dollar 17.5 million (2005: US Dollar 17.5 million) into other currencies.These cross-currency and interest rate
swaps are reported as derivative financial instruments.

On 13 June 2006 the Company increased its liability under one of the US Dollar swaps (semi-annual) by US Dollar 
35.6 million.This swap, which was originally transacted at a US Dollar : Sterling exchange rate of US Dollar 1.3768, was reset
to the prevailing market exchange rate of 1.7464.This transaction was undertaken to reduce the Company’s credit exposure to
the swap counterparty.The resulting £23.6 million net cash settlement in favour of the Company has no impact on the Group’s
reported overall net debt.
There have been no further changes in the above swaps during the course of the year.
Financial risk management
(a) Fair value of financial instruments
Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction 
between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market prices discounted to current value.Where market
values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing rates translated at year end
exchange rates.

Following the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 April 2006, for financial reporting purposes cross-currency swaps, interest
rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts are shown on the face of the balance sheet as derivative financial instruments
within derivative financial assets or liabilities as appropriate.
(b) Foreign currency risk
The Group operates globally with the majority of its profits earned outside the UK. It has significant investments outside the 
UK with the largest investments being in North America followed by Europe. In order to protect the Group’s balance sheet 
and reduce cash flow risk the Group has financed most of its investments in the USA, Canada and Europe by borrowing in US
dollars, Canadian dollars, euros and Danish krone. Some of this funding is achieved by directly borrowing the relevant currency
whilst some is achieved through cross-currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs and credit exposure.
The main currencies of net debt, after taking into account the effects of cross-currency swaps, are set out below. The Group
uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures on committed, and occasionally forecast, receipts
and payments in foreign currencies.

(c) Interest rate risk
The interest rate profiles of the Group’s borrowings are set out below.The 2006 figures are shown after taking into account the
effect of cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps which are used to manage the Group’s net debt and which are shown
separately from borrowings in the Group balance sheet.The 2005 figures are shown in accordance with 
UK GAAP and exclude a £3.2 million fair value asset arising on interest rate swaps.

(d) Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on funding capacity is to ensure sufficient long-term funding and committed borrowing facilities are in
place to meet foreseeble peak borrowing requirements.The Group’s borrowings exhibit some seasonal variations during the
year and for that reason the board requires long-term funding and committed borrowing facilities to always exceed actual and
projected debt figures by at least 10%.At the year end 78% (2005: 84%) of the Group’s committed facilities were drawn.
Of the £692 million (2005: £651 million) committed borrowing facilities available to the Group, the undrawn committed
facilities were as follows:
2006 2005
£m £m
Expiring in more than one year but no more than two years 150.0 –
Expiring in more than two years but no more than three years – 102.3

The Group also has a number of uncommitted loan and overdraft facilities at is disposal. These facilities are lightly used.

The costs associated with the restructuring provisions for various reorganisations within the Group are supported by detailed
plans and based on previous experience as well as other known factors.With the exception of amounts related to vacant
leasehold properties the provisions are generally incurred within one to two years.The vacant leasehold property provisions 
will be utilised in between one and seven years.
The insurance and litigation provisions represents management’s best estimate of the likely outcome. Due to the inherent
uncertainty of the nature of such liabilities it is difficult to give an indication of the timing of their settlement but generally 
this would be between one and ten years.

At the balance sheet date no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of certain trading and capital losses as based on
currently available evidence it is considered unlikely that sufficient taxable profits or gains will be generated.The unrecognised
deferred tax asset is £47.7 million (2005: £40.6 million).
Deferred taxation is not provided in respect of liabilities that might arise on the distribution of available overseas reserves of
subsidiary undertakings, except to the extent that the decision to remit such profits has been taken.
Where a liability has not been recognised, it is because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the
temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.At the balance sheet 
date the aggregate amount of such temporary differences for which deferred tax has not been recognised was £18.3 million
(2005: £18.1 million).
32) Finance and operating leases
Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts
The Group leases certain of its property, plant and equipment under finance leases.These leases have an average duration of
between three and ten years.The majority of the leases are on a fixed repayment basis and where escalation clauses exist they
are linked to LIBOR. No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.

33) Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
(a) Defined contribution pension schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held externally to the Group in
separate trustee administered funds. Contributions to these defined contribution pension schemes in the year, which were the
same as the amount charged to the profit and loss account, amounted to £7.8 million (2005: £7.4 million).
(b) Defined benefit and other post-retirement benefits
The main pension schemes operated by the Group are in the United Kingdom and North America and are defined benefit in
type.These are funded schemes, where the future liabilities for benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held
externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
The cost of these schemes is determined in accordance with IAS 19 with the advice of independent professionally qualified
actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit method. In line with normal business practice,
these valuations are undertaken triennially in the United Kingdom and annually in the United States.
These valuations are based on the full actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2002, updated at 31 March 2006 by independent
actuaries, and are consistent with preliminary valuation results of the full actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2005.
The dates of the most recent full actuarial valuations, on which the amounts in the financial statements are based, were 
as follows:
Name of the Scheme Location Date of valuation
FKI Group Pension Scheme UK 31 December 2002
FKI Industries Inc. Group Pension Plan US 31 December 2004
The Group also operates a number of unfunded post-retirement medical and welfare benefit schemes, principally in the 
United States.

The cost of these schemes is determined in accordance with IAS 19 with the advice of independent professionally qualified
actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations, using the projected unit method. In line with normal business practice,
these valuations are undertaken triennially in the United Kingdom and annually in the United States.
Both the FKI Group Pension Scheme and the main FKI Industries Inc. Group Pension Plan are now closed to new members
and therefore under the projected unit method the current service costs would be expected to increase as the members of the
Scheme approach retirement.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are
established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of scheme.

From the date of acquisition, the business contributed £1.5 million revenue and £nil to the Group’s profit before taxation 
and finance costs/income.
The aggregate book and fair values of the net assets of the acquisitions at the relevant date of acquisition were as follows:
Book Fair value Fair value
values adjustments to Group
£m £m £m
Property, plant and equipment 1.8 1.1 2.9
Inventories 1.5 – 1.5
Receivables 1.5 – 1.5
Cash and short-term deposits 0.6 – 0.6
Payables (2.2) – (2.2)
Finance leases obligations – (0.9) (0.9)
Equity minority interest (0.7) – (0.7)
Net assets acquired at fair value 2.5 0.2 2.7
Goodwill arising on acquisition 2.8
Total consideration 5.5
Satisfied by:
Cash paid net of costs 5.1
Deferred consideration 0.4
5.5
Goodwill arose on the acquisitions as the criteria for the recognition of intangible assets were not met at the date of acquisition
and goodwill represents the anticipated future operating synergies from the combinations.
No acquisitions of businesses were made during the year ended 31 March 2005.
The fair value adjustments relate to the recognition of a finance lease for certain property, plant and equipment of IP Clamps
(including the related finance lease obligations) and the valuation of property by external valuers.

Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve arose when the Company redeemed shares wholly out of distributed profits.
Own shares
Own shares relate to shares of the Company held by the FKI plc Employee Benefit Trust which are transferred to employee
option scheme holders on exercise of their options.The costs of funding and administering the scheme are charged to the
income statement of the Company.
Exchange reserve
The exchange reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign
operations. It also includes the effect of translation of liabilities that hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
104 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 36) Reconciliation of movement in equity (continued)
Share-based payments accrual
IFRS 2 requires that an expense for share-based payments be recognised in the income statement based on the fair value at the
date of grant.This expense is recognised over the vesting period of the options.A share-based payment accrual is recognised as
part of equity.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging
instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge.
37) Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39
As noted in the basis of preparation on page 60 the Group adopted IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: recognition and
measurement” and IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: presentation and disclosure” from 1 April 2005 and the Group took the
exemption not to restate comparatives.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from
operational, financial and investment activities.The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Under IAS 39 financial instruments are recognised initially at cost and subsequent to initial recognition are stated at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with
similar maturity profiles.The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to the present value of the estimated
future cash flows.
In relation to fair value hedges (eg: interest rate swaps) which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from
remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.Any gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and
recognised in the income statement.Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial
instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the net profit and loss such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
In relation to cash flow hedges (eg: forward foreign currency contracts including cross currency swap contracts) to hedge firm
commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that
is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly to equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in net profit 
or loss.
Further details of the accounting treatment adopted under IFRS and under UK GAAP are included within the Group
accounting policies.
The impact on the balance sheet at 1 April 2005 of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 was as follows:

105 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 38) Share-based payments
Disclosures of the share-based payments offered to employees are set out below. In accordance with the transitional provisions of
IFRS 2, the Group has recognised an expense in respect of all equity settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had
not vested on or before 1 April 2004.
The charge to the income statement in respect of share-based payments for the year ended 31 March 2006 was £1.4 million
(2005: £1.1 million).
(a) Share option scheme
The Group operates an executive share option scheme.All executive options granted up to and including 31 March 2006 
may only be exercised subject to a performance condition that the Group’s growth in earnings per share must exceed the 
UK retail price index by 9% or more over a three year period, subject to re-testing in subsequent years from a rolling base.
The re-testing condition was removed for options granted after April 2004.The contractual lifetime of the options is ten years.
For options granted from 1 April 2006 none will vest for an earnings per share less than the retail price index plus 12% over
the three years movement period. For earnings per share at or greater than retail price index plus 12%, awards will vest on a
straight line basis. Details of the vesting levels are included in the remuneration report.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at 31 March 2006 is 87p to 116.5p (2005: 87p to 116.5p).
The options exercised during the year relate to options exercised by employees of disposed of companies and employees 
made redundant.
The fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period and is estimated on the date of the grant by Hewitt,
Bacon & Woodrow Limited using the binomial pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions.Assumptions are
made for each separate grant but weighted averages have been disclosed because share options were granted at different dates
within certain years.

(b) Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Participants receive annual conditional awards of shares in the Company which may vest only after the achievement of certain
long term performance conditions. Participants may receive these shares, three years after the award, provided the performance
conditions are met.
Details of the performance conditions of the award granted in August 2005 and for awards granted prior to that date are
provided in the Remuneration Report.
The fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period and is estimated on the date of the grant by

(c) Save As You Earn scheme
This scheme is open to all UK employees who have completed six months service and who enter into an approved savings
contract for a term of three or five years.The maximum amount which can be saved is £250 per month and the total savings
(including interest) at the end of the term are available to purchase shares at 80% of their market value shortly before the start
of the savings contract.
The fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period and is estimated on the date of the grant by 
Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow Limited, using the binomial pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions.

42) Contingent liabilities
The Group has contingent liabilities amounting to £125.0 million (2005: £168.9 million), principally representing the
guarantees given in the ordinary course of business on behalf of the trading subsidiaries on which no losses are anticipated.
In addition, there are contingent liabilities in the ordinary course of business in connection with the completion of contracts
within specification, including responsibilities for maintenance.
The Group is also the subject of various pending legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business,
including claims on contracts, product liability, environmental claims and others.The claims giving rise to such proceedings are
likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance and third party indemnities.While the outcome of some of these matters
cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not believe that these claims, after allowing for provisions already made, will have
a material adverse effect upon the Group’s financial results.
43) Related party transactions
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and 
are not disclosed in this note.
The Group’s associate is Mediterranean Power Electric Company Limited and no transactions were made between the Group
and its associate during the years ended 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005.
The remuneration of the directors, who are considered to be the key management personnel, is provided in the Remuneration
report on pages 43 to 53.
44) Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
(i) Introduction
As stated in note 2, these are the Group’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The comparatives have been restated from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP). On 18 October 2005 the
Group published detailed income statement and balance sheet reconciliations of UK GAAP to IFRS.The following is an
abridged extract of the published document.
(ii) Transitional arrangements
IFRS 1 permits those companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take certain exemptions from the full requirements of
IFRS in the transition period.
FKI plc has elected to apply the following key exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS:
(a) Business combinations
The Group has applied the exemption in IFRS 1 and has not restated business combinations prior to the transition date (1
April 2004).As a result, in the opening balance sheet goodwill arising from past business combinations remains as stated under
UK GAAP at 31 March 2004.
110 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44) Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) (continued)
(ii) Transitional arrangements (continued)
(b) Financial instruments
The Group has taken the exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 – “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
Presentation” and IAS 39 – “Financial Instruments “Recognition and Measurement”. The Group is applying these standards
from 1 April 2005.
(c) Pensions and other employee benefits
The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes at the date
of transition.The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of
recognised income and expense in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 issued in December 2004.
(d) Share-based payments
The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 from 1 April 2004 to those share-based payment transactions that were issued after 
7 November 2002 that have not fully vested by 1 April 2004.
(e) Cumulative translation differences
A requirement of IAS 21 is that on disposal of an operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences previously
recognised directly to equity for that foreign operation is to be transferred to the income statement as part of the profit or loss
on disposal.The Group has adopted the exemption allowing these cumulative translation differences to be reset to zero at the
transition date of 1 April 2004.
FKI plc has elected not to adopt the following exemptions:
(a) Property, plant and equipment
The Group has not adopted the exemption to restate items of property, plant and equipment to fair value at the transition date
(1 April 2004). Such items have been maintained at the depreciated historical cost under UK GAAP .
(b) Assets held for sale and discontinued operations
The Group has not adopted the exemption of applying IFRS 5 prospectively from 1 April 2005. IFRS 5 has been applied from
the date of transition (1 April 2004).
(iii) Notes and explanation of IFRS adjustments to the income statements and balance sheets
A summary of the principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS as they apply to FKI plc are set out below.
The reconciling items set out in the UK GAAP/IFRS reconciliations are cross-referenced to the relevant explanation in 
this section.
The reconciliations of UK GAAP to IFRS include a starting point of UK GAAP in IFRS format.This discloses certain items
on the face of the balance sheet such as taxation and deferred taxation which under UK GAAP were included in debtors or
creditors and reclassifies pension assets/liabilities and provisions into the appropriate category. In the income statement the 
UK GAAP non-operating loss on sale and closure of businesses has been included as a starting point under IFRS as the line
item “loss for the year from discontinued operations”.
The disclosures of continuing operations and discontinued operations for the year ended 31 March 2005 have been restated 
in the financial statements to reflect all operations that have been discontinued at 31 March 2006 in accordance with IFRS 5.
The restatement included within the restatement document issued on 18 October 2005 and included within this note does
not therefore agree with the comparative figures included in the financial statements.
111 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44) Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) (continued)
A. Share-based payments
Principal difference
The Group operates a range of share-based incentive schemes including share options, SAYE schemes and long-term incentive
plans (“LTIP”). Under UK GAAP an expense was recognised for all LTIP schemes in accordance with UITF 17 with a
corresponding credit to equity.
IFRS 2: Share-based payments requires that an expense be recognised in the income statement for all share-based payments
(both awards of options and awards of shares).This expense has been calculated based on the fair value at the date of the award.
The balance sheet entry is either a credit to liabilities, for cash settled awards, or a credit to equity for equity settled awards.
All existing FKI plc schemes are currently equity settled.
Impact on income statement
This has resulted in a net increase to the cost of sales and net operating costs of £1.1 million for the year ended 31 March
2005.The related tax credit is £0.5 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Impact on balance sheet
The opening UK GAAP accrual included within the profit and loss account within equity has been reclassified to the 
share-based payment accrual reserve and the increase in the accrual for each period has been recorded in the share-based
payment accrual reserve.
The related deferred tax credit has been adjusted against the deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability as appropriate.
B. Goodwill
Principal difference
UK GAAP requires goodwill to be amortised over its expected useful economic life. Under IFRS goodwill is no longer
amortised but held at amortised value at the transition date on the balance sheet and tested for impairment at the date of
transition to IFRS and annually thereafter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might 
be impaired.
No additional impairments were necessary as at the transition date or at 31 March 2005.
The goodwill amortisation charged under UK GAAP of £26.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been reversed.
The profit/loss on sale of businesses (disclosed as discontinued under IFRS) also changes as the value of the goodwill asset
included in the calculation of loss on disposal is higher under IFRS due to no goodwill amortisation.This resulted in an
increase in the loss on discontinued operations of £1.3 million in the year ended 31 March 2005.
Impact on balance sheet
At the date of transition the UK GAAP carrying value of goodwill was included for IFRS.
The UK GAAP amortisation charge and the discontinued operations element has been reversed resulting in a corresponding
increase in the value of goodwill of £25.4 million at 31 March 2005.
112 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44) Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) (continued)
C. Foreign exchange
Principal difference
Under UK GAAP a foreign currency transaction recorded in the balance sheet can be translated at the contracted rate or
forward rate of a related or matching forward contract. Under IFRS (IAS 21), only the spot exchange rate can be used and 
IAS 21 does not permit the use of a contracted rate.
Impact on income statement
This has resulted in a net increase to the operating costs of £0.1 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.There was no tax
impact related to this adjustment primarily due to tax losses brought forward in the relevant businesses.
Impact on balance sheet
The carrying value of trade receivables and trade payables changed as a result of adopting IAS 21 as disclosed by the adjustments
recorded on the analysis of IFRS adjustments.
D. Dividends
Principal difference
Under UK GAAP the practice is to recognise dividends in the period to which they relate. Under IFRS – IAS 10:“Events after
the Balance Sheet Date” requires that dividends authorised/declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a
liability at the balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37:“Provisions,
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” .Therefore, the dividend liability needs to be adjusted where appropriate.
Under UK GAAP the dividend charge is recognised in the income statement whereas under IFRS the dividend charge is
recognised directly in reserves and not in the income statement.
Impact on the income statement
Dividends totalling £26.2 million for the year ended 31 March 2005 have been reversed from the income statement.
Impact on balance sheet
The final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2004 of £17.4 million has been removed from liabilities in the
opening balance sheet as at 1 April 2004.This will be an adjustment through equity in the year ended 31 March 2005.
At 31 March 2005 the 2004/05 final dividends of £17.5 million included as a liability under UK GAAP is reversed and 
this will be recognised directly in equity in the financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2005.
The total dividend charged directly to reserves for the year ended 31 March 2005 is £26.1 million representing the 
final 2003/04 dividends of £17.4 million and the interim 2004/05 dividends of £8.7 million.
113 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44) Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) (continued)
E. Valuation of pension fund assets
Principal difference
Under UK GAAP quoted securities are valued at mid market value in obtaining fair values whereas under IFRS the current
bid price should be used.
Impact
At the date of transition the value of the scheme pension assets reduces by £0.8 million and this is recorded as an increase in
the pension obligations liability.A deferred tax asset of £0.2 million has also been recognised on transition.The net impact on
reserves is £0.6 million and this adjustment to the actuarial gain/(loss) net of deferred tax is disclosed separately as a reserve
movement and will be included in the statement of recognised income and expense.
At 31 March 2005 the value of pension assets reduces by £0.9 million and an increase in the deferred tax asset of £0.3 million
is also recognised.
F. Provisions
Principal difference
Under IFRS, provisions for future trading losses are not allowed as part of a reorganisation/closure costs provision unless they
relate to onerous contracts.
Impact on income statement
There was no impact for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Impact on balance sheet
This resulted in a reduction, net of taxation, in liabilities of £0.1 million at the date of transition, and nil at 31 March 2005.
G. Recycled goodwill and exchange differences
Principal difference
In calculating the profit/loss on disposal of businesses under UK GAAP , goodwill that was previously held in reserves is recycled
and included within the profit/loss on disposal calculation. Under IFRS any goodwill held in reserves is not recycled on
disposal of a business.
On disposal of a business, under IFRS the cumulative amount of exchange differences previously recognised in equity is taken
to the income statement as part of the calculation of profit/loss on disposal. Under UK GAAP cumulative exchange differences
remained in reserves.
The Group has adopted the exemption allowing the cumulative exchange differences to be reset to zero at the transition date of
1 April 2004.

G. Recycled goodwill and exchange differences (continued)
Impact on income statement
The loss on disposal of businesses (loss for the year on discontinued operations) decreased by £14.6 million for the year ended
31 March 2005.
The exclusion of goodwill held in reserves as part of the calculation reduced the loss on disposal by £13.6 million for the year
ended 31 March 2005 and the inclusion of the cumulative amount of exchange differences previously recognised in reserves
reduced the loss on disposal by £1.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Impact on balance sheet
There is no change to the balance sheet other than a reclassification within equity.
H. Assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Principal differences
There are two principal differences:
Firstly, under IFRS 5 a single amount should be included on the face of the income statement relating to discontinued
operations.This shall comprise the total of:
• the post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations;
• the post-tax loss or gain on the disposal of the discontinued operations.
Therefore, adjustments are required, where appropriate, to each line item in the income statement including revenue, finance
costs and taxation. Under UK GAAP separate disclosure as one line in the income statement of post-tax profit or loss is 
not required.
Secondly, under IFRS 5 a non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be
recovered principally through a sale transaction. For this to be the case the asset or disposal group must be available for
immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable.
The non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are
under IFRS presented separately on the balance sheet.Assets and liabilities should be disclosed separately.
Under UK GAAP separate disclosure in the balance sheet of non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups is 
not required.
Impact on income statement
In the year ended 31 March 2005 £91.8 million of sales and a net profit after taxation of £3.5 million was transferred to the
line item discontinued operations.
Impact on balance sheet
At the transition date of 1 April 2004 there were no non-current assets or disposal groups which met the classification/
definition of held for sale.
At 31 March 2005 £0.5 million was transferred from property plant and equipment to assets held for sale relating to certain
properties.Also, total assets of £38.7 million and total liabilities of £13.3 million were transferred from various balance sheet
classifications and disclosed separately as assets held for sale or liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale.

(IFRS) (continued)
I. Reclassifications
Impact on income statement
Under UK GAAP the tax impact of exceptional items, including profit/loss on disposal of operations is included within the 
tax charge. Under IFRS the tax impact on the profit/loss on sale of businesses which meet the definition of discontinued
operations is included within the line item profit/loss on discontinued operations.The impact of this adjustment was 
£0.3 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
For the year ended 31 March 2005, under UK GAAP the non-operating loss on sale and closure of businesses included a 
£90.0 million charge relating to DeWind following the announcement of the closure of this operation on 8 November 2004.
Also, under UK GAAP the turnover and operating profit were disclosed as discontinued operations for the year ended 
31 March 2005.
Under IFRS 5, DeWind is treated as a continuing operation because the assets continue to be used at 31 March 2005.
DeWind was sold on 5 July 2005.
Impact on balance sheet
(a) IFRS requires computer software that is not an integral part of the hardware to be treated as an intangible asset. Under UK
GAAP all capitalised software was included as property, plant and equipment.This has resulted in a reclassification from
property, plant and equipment to intangible assets of the following values:
£3.8 million at date of transition;
£3.1 million at 31 March 2005.
(b) IFRS requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be disclosed separately. Under UK GAAP the deferred tax assets and
liabilities relating to pension and other post retirement benefit assets and liabilities were netted off those pension balances.
This has resulted in the following reclassifications:
1 April 31 March
2004 2005
£m £m
Non-current assets:
Deferred tax asset 62.6 57.1
Pension and other post-retirement benefit assets 4.5 2.6
Non-current liabilities:
Deferred tax liabilities (4.5) (2.6)
Pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations (62.6) (57.1)
––
(c) IFRS also requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed as non-current assets and liabilities and there 
are differences under IFRS relating to the netting off of deferred tax assets and liabilities.This has resulted in a number of
reclassifications affecting the deferred tax and corporation tax and overseas tax balances in each of the balance sheets.
116 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44) Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) (continued)
Impact on balance sheet (continued)
(d) IFRS states that provisions expected to be settled within one year of the balance sheet date should be classified as current
liabilities.This has resulted in the reclassification from non-current liability provisions to current liability provisions of the
following values:
£17.3 million at date of transition (1 April 2004);
£22.0 million at 31 March 2005.
(e) Other minor balance sheet reclassifications are:
(i) reclassification of trade debtors and trade creditors classified under UK GAAP as over one year old to current assets/liabilities
as IFRS states all trade debtors should be classified as current.
(ii) reclassification of balance sheet values relating to IAS 11: Construction Contracts.This has resulted in reclassifications
between inventory and trade and other receivables. In addition the classification of the trade and other receivables note to the
accounts will change.
(iii) reclassification of certain spare parts from inventory to property, plant and equipment in accordance with IAS 16 
(“Property, plant and equipment”).This adjustment was only required in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2005 and the value 
was £0.3 million.
(f) The following reclassifications of the components of equity have been made:
1 April 31 March
2004 2005
£m £m
Retained earnings (1.4) 0.2
Exchange reserve – (1.6)
Share-based payment accrual 1.4 1.4
– –
The adjustments relate to the following:
• reclassification of cumulative exchange differences from retained earnings to a separate component of equity called exchange
reserve. FKI plc has adopted the exemption allowing these cumulative exchange differences to be reset to zero at the
transition date.
• reclassification of the UK GAAP accrual relating to the Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) from profit and loss account to a
separate component of equity called the share-based payment accrual.

  Notes to the Company financial statements
1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of FKI plc are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.As permitted by the Act, the separate
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Standards 
(“UK GAAP”) using the historical cost convention, except for in the year ended 31 March 2006 where certain financial
instruments have been measured at fair value.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account is not presented. Under Financial
Reporting Standard 1, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the
cash flows of the Company are included within the published consolidated financial statements.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the
financial statements, except as noted below.
In these financial statements the following new standards have been adopted for the first time:
– FRS 20:“Share based payments”
– FRS 21:“Events after the balance sheet date”
– FRS 23:“The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates”
– FRS 25:“Financial Instruments : presentation and disclosure”
– FRS 26:“Financial Instruments : measurement”
The accounting policies under these new standards are set out below.The effects of adopting these new standards are set out in
note 10.The comparative figures have been restated accordingly.As permitted, FRS 25 and FRS 26 have been adopted from 
1 April 2005 with no restatement of comparative figures.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange
rate ruling at that date.All profits and losses on exchange are credited or charged to the profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for any impairment in value. Depreciation is
calculated on all assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each
asset on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Plant and machinery – heavy production 15 years
– other 10 years
Office equipment 5 to 10 years
Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds, less
costs of disposal, and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
124 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Leases
Assets obtained under leases and hire purchase contracts which result in the transfer to the Company of substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership (finance leases) are capitalised as tangible fixed assets at the estimated present value of underlying
lease payments and are depreciated over their expected useful lives.The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded
as liabilities whilst the finance elements of the rental payments are charged to the income statement over the period of the 
lease or hire purchase contract so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding balance of the net obligation 
in each period.
Rentals paid under other leases (operating leases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
Investments
The Company’s investment in shares in Group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on all temporary differences, subject to the exceptions noted below, at the
balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax in respect of taxable or deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not
recognised where the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse
in the foreseeable future or in the case of assets, taxable profit will be unavailable against which the temporary differences, can
be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences,
and carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which it is anticipated that the asset will
be realised or the liability will be settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately
authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed
in the notes to the financial statements.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
(i) Defined contribution pension schemes
Pension costs for the Company’s defined contribution pension schemes are recognised within operating profit at an amount
equal to the contributions payable to the scheme for the period.Any prepaid or outstanding contributions at the balance sheet
date are recognised respectively as assets or liabilities within prepayments or accruals.
(ii) Defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits
Pension liabilities are measured at their present value in accordance with actuarial assumptions that are updated at each balance
sheet date. Pension assets are measured at fair value.The pension liability or asset is recognised in the balance sheet.
Pension costs for the Company’s defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits are recognised as follows:
(a) Within operating profit
• The current service cost arising from employee service in the current period;
• The prior service cost related to employee service in prior periods arising in the current period as a result of improvements
to benefits;
• Gains and losses arising on unanticipated settlements or curtailments where the item that gave rise to the settlement or
curtailment is recognised within operating profit.
(b) Within other finance cost or income
• The interest cost on the liabilities, calculated by reference to the scheme liabilities and discount rate at the beginning of 
the period.
• The expected return on assets, calculated by reference to the assets and their long-term expected rate of return at the
beginning of the period.
(c) Within the statement of recognised income and expense
• On the scheme assets – the difference between the expected and actual return on assets;
• On the scheme liabilities – (a) the differences between the actuarial assumptions and actual experience, and (b) the effect of
changes in actuarial assumptions.
Derivative financial instruments of hedge accounting
(i) Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2005
As permitted, FRS 25 and FRS 26 have been adopted from 1 April 2005 with no restatement of comparative figures.
Derivatives for hedging purposes are held off balance sheet with the exception of cross-currency swaps, where the net exchange
gain/loss as a result of exchange rate movements is recorded on the balance sheet to reflect the substance of the transaction.
The net interest cost/income arising on interest rate swaps is charged/credited to the interest line in the profit and loss 
account on an accruals basis. Monetary discounts or premiums arising on the disposal or other early termination of interest 
rate swaps are amortised on a straight-line basis over the original unexpired life of the swap against interest charges in the 
profit and loss account.
126 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Finance costs are recognised in the income statement over the term of the instruments to which they relate at a constant rate
on the carrying amount.
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.The carrying amount is increased by the
finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by the payments made in the period.
(ii) Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2006
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising
from operational, financial and investment activities.The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes.
As the Company accounts for its investments in subsidiaries and associates at cost in its separate books, certain derivative
instruments could not be designated as the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge in the Company accounts.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition they are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. However, where derivatives qualify
for hedge accounting recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts
with similar maturity profiles.The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to the present value of
the estimated future cash flows.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges, where they hedge the exposure to
changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or cash flow hedges, where they hedge exposure to variability in cash
flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
In relation to fair value hedges (eg: interest rate swaps) which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from
remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.Any gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and
recognised in the income statement.Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial
instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the net profit and loss such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
In relation to cash flow hedges (eg: forward foreign currency contracts including cross-currency swap contracts) to hedge 
firm commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument
that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly to equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in net profit
or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability 
is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement
of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For cash flow hedges that do not result in the
recognition of an asset or a liability, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement 
in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit and loss, for example when the future sale
actually occurs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer
qualifies for hedge accounting.At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in
equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the year.
Share-based payments
Certain employees (including directors) receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (“equity-settled transactions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are
granted.The fair value is determined by an external valuation. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any
performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of FKI plc (“market conditions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which
the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the
award (“vesting date”).The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards at that date based on the best
available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
127 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other
performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been
modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as 
measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and
designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a
modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to
executives and senior employees. Shares in the Company held by the employee share trust are presented in the balance sheet as
a deduction from equity.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 20 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied
FRS 20 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 April 2004.

1 April 2005 hedge designation had been made one day earlier.
Cash flow hedges
At 31 March 2006 the Company held two cross-currency swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges.These swaps hedge
the cash flow variability arising on movements in the Euro: Sterling exchange rate and protect Euro 30 million of the 
Euro 600 million Eurobond.The terms of the contracts are:

to the prevailing market exchange rate of 1.7464.This transaction was undertaken to reduce the Company’s credit exposure 
to the swap counterparty. The resulting £23.6 million net cash settlement in favour of the Company has no impact on the
Company’s reported overall net debt.

11. Financial instruments
The Company adopted FRS 26:“Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement” and FRS 25:“Financial Instruments:
presentation and disclosure” from 1 April 2005.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising
from operational, financial and investment activities.The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes.
Under FRS 26, financial instruments are recognised initially at cost and subsequent to initial recognition are stated at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with
similar maturity profiles.The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to the present value of the estimated
future cash flow.
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging
instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to
the hedged risk is recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income
statement.Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument, the adjustment is
amortised to the net profit and loss such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
135 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 11. Financial instruments (continued)
In relation to cash flow hedges, to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of
the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly to equity and the
ineffective portion is recognised in net profit or loss.
Further details of the accounting treatment adopted are included within the Company accounting policies.
The impact on the balance sheet at 1 April 2005 of adopting FRS 26 and FRS 25 is as follows:
£m £m
Increase in derivative financial assets 64.5
Increase in derivative financial liabilities (6.6)

12. Prior year adjustments
The adoption of FRS 20 resulted in an increase in staff costs as FRS 20 requires that an expense be recognised in the income
statement for all share-based payments.The accounting policy provides more background information.
FRS 21 requires that dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that
they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.Therefore, the final proposed dividend
each year is not recognised as a liability and only included in equity after approval by the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting.
13. Dividends

The directors are remunerated by FKI plc for their services to the Group as a whole. Information covering directors’
remuneration is given in the Remuneration Report of the Group.
15. Contingent liabilities
The Company has contingent liabilities of £16.7 million (2005: £ 41.8 million) in respect of guarantees of subsidiary
undertakings banking obligations. In addition, the Company has guaranteed £100.0 million (2005: £ 98.1 million) of US dollar
fixed rate guaranteed senior notes issued on behalf of FKI Industries Inc.
The Company is also the subject of various pending legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business,
including claims on contracts, product liability, environmental claims and others.The claims giving rise to such proceedings are
likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance and third party indemnities.While the outcome of some of these matters
cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not believe that these claims, after allowing for provisions already made, will have
a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial results.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its
group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability
until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make payments under the guarantee.

Underlying operating profit is calculated by the addition of operating
profit on continuing activities before special items to the operating profit
of discontinued operations for the period until disposal. Underlying profit
before tax is calculated by the addition of profit before taxation on
continuing activities before special items to the profit before taxation of
discontinued operations for the period until disposal.
3
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the operating
profit/(loss) for the period, before special items, profit/losses on disposal
of discontinued operations, fair value gains/losses on financial
instruments and exchange gains/losses included within net finance
costs and income and taxation related to those items by the weighted
average number of shares in issue during the period. A full reconciliation
between the profit and loss used in the calculation of basic earnings per
share and adjusted earnings per share is included in note 16 to the
Financial Statements.

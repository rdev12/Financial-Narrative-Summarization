Chairman’s Letter
Through the ‘ups and bumps’, the Group has made progress 
in key areas during the year, including the successful integration 
of the businesses we acquired during 2010, development of 
advanced technologies such as the set-top box for the “X1” 
platform for Comcast and the Home Media Centre for DirecTV 
and the strong growth we continue to see in developing 
markets, particularly Latin America.
Pace’s core is its engineering excellence, complemented by 
strong customer-focused skills and delivery capabilities.
Following the appointment of Mike Pulli as Chief Executive 
Offi cer in December 2011, we have the right leader to deliver 
on the opportunities to grow shareholder value identifi ed by 
our Strategic Review. It confi rmed that Pace operates in large, 
growing and profi table markets with differentiated capabilities, 
and established as the Group’s primary objectives:
•	 	To	build	on	our	position	as	a	world	leading	set-top	box	and	
residential gateway company;
•	 To	impr ove	on	operational	excellence;	and
•	 	To	accelerate	‘widening	out’	by	pursuing	opportunities	to	
provide Software & Services assets.
Executing on these objectives will lead to a realistic medium 
term operating margin target of up to 9%, as well as increasing 
the Group’s ‘sticky profi ts’ – which translates to enhanced 
quality of earnings and therefore multiple.
Despite challenges experienced during 2011, operational focus 
undertaken since the Strategic Review and confi dence in the 
long-term earnings potential from our markets gives the Board 
confi dence to continue building on the progressive dividend 
policy that was introduced in 2009. Therefore the Board is 
recommending a fi nal dividend of 2.50c per share, giving a full 
year dividend of 3.75c per share, an 11.3% increase on 2010.
If you have any comments on my letter or any part of the Annual 
Report, I would be delighted to hear from you either by writing

Chief Executive
Officer’s Review
Key highlights of the year
Pace’s markets have remained resilient during the year, 
with PayTV continuing to show growth despite difficult 
global economic conditions. Overall digital PayTV 
subscribers are expected to grow at circa 10% CAGR 
between 2011 and 2015*. Over-the-top (OTT) delivery 
is expected to be complementary to continued PayTV 
growth. PayTV in advanced markets has embraced IP 
and internet delivery, with next generation ‘IP fluent’ 
devices having become a market reality. In addition, home 
networking technologies such as Wi-Fi are becoming 
increasingly important as is the emergence of TV 
Everywhere technology. Pace is at the forefront of enabling 
operators to address the opportunities presented by these 
advanced technologies. Further opportunities exist for 
Pace in emerging markets as these continue greenfield 
growth and their conversion to digital.
2011 has been a challenging year operationally for Pace, 
with the Company addressing inventory management 
issues and reduced profitability in Pace Europe as well as 
the impact of two major natural disasters. The disruption 
to Hard Disk Drive (HDD) supply resulting from flooding in 
Thailand was a major challenge in the final quarter of 2011 
and will continue to impact results during 2012, with the 
impact to be predominantly felt during the first half of the 
year. Through keen operational focus, working closely with 
suppliers and customers, the impact of this issue was 
contained to $36m of revenue and $9m of operating 
profit in 2011.
Pace generated 2011 revenues of $2,309.3m, 
up 11.9% on 2010 due to the full-year effect 
of 2010 acquisitions, and adjusted EBITA of 
$141.4m, equivalent to 6.1% of revenues, 
down 1.7ppt on 2010. Our Strategic Review 
highlighted opportunities for improving both 
the level and quality of our earnings; we are 
actively delivering to this plan.
I am pleased to be able to report the 2011 annual results for Pace, the first since my 
appointment as Chief Executive Officer on 14 December 2011. Whilst Pace has faced a 
number of operational challenges in 2011, our Strategic Review identified a number of 
opportunities which, if well executed, will deliver significant value for shareholders over the 
coming years.
All of the businesses acquired by Pace in 2010 have 
been successfully integrated, with the related synergies 
realised ahead of and in excess of our expectations. In 
particular, the acquisition of 2Wire continues to deliver 
benefits to the Group, both through increased revenue 
and profitability, and through the technology assets which 
enable us to offer operators the additional applications 
and services that consumers are demanding. In the more 
developed markets in which Pace operates, there is a shift 
towards the use of internet delivery technology for the 
distribution and viewing of content. The combination of 
Gateway expertise acquired with 2Wire and Bewan, and 
the existing set-top box (STB) technology within Pace, 
provides a strong platform from which to capitalise on 
these opportunities.
North America
The PayTV market in North America is the most 
technologically advanced, characterised by the increasing 
emergence of whole home STBs and VDSL triple-play 
gateways, as services demand higher speeds. We believe 
the digital PayTV market in North America will continue to 
see low single digit annual growth in subscribers for the 
foreseeable future.
Total revenues in North America increased by 27% to 
$1,065m in 2011, driven by the full year impact of the 
2Wire acquisition in October 2010. Organic revenues, 
comprising STB sales in the Cable and Satellite markets, 
decreased by 17.7% to $595m reflecting lower sales 
of Personal Video Recorder (PVR) products and a 
normalisation of our leadership position achieved in 2010 
on certain customer specific products. Volumes of STBs 
in North America increased by 3.3% reflecting a higher 
number of lower-value Digital Television Adapter (DTA) 
shipments in the year. Whilst other STB volumes declined, 
Pace did introduce a number of advanced products in the 
developed North America market, including the STB for 
the “X1” platform for Comcast and a whole home solution 
for DirecTV. These confirmed Pace’s continued position 
of technological leadership in our sector and we remain 
optimistic about the long-term strength of the market for 
our products in North America.
Gateway revenues increased by $294m to $392m 
reflecting the full year of trading from 2Wire; on a like-
for-like basis revenue decreased 8% as a result of a pull 
forward of ADSL product into 2010 (underlying growth 
adjusted for this was 10%). 
Software & Services revenues in North America increased 
by $60m to $78m (up 11% on a like-for-like basis). This 
revenue is primarily comprised of customer care, system 
management products and professional services.
Latin America 
The Latin America market displays strong subscriber growth 
and ongoing conversion to digital and is heavily influenced by 
the US market showing a strong appetite for High Definition 
(HD) products.
Total revenues in Latin America increased by 25% to $469m 
in 2011, with strong underlying growth from both Satellite 
and Cable operators as Pace continued to experience very 
high market share in these expanding markets, particularly in 
Brazil.
Growth was entirely from the organic business and mirrored 
growth in our customers’ subscriber bases. Volume growth 
was ahead of revenue growth at 77% reflecting a higher 
proportion of lower value, Standard Definition (SD) boxes. 
The businesses acquired during 2010 had relatively little 
activity in this region, however there are opportunities in 
these markets to deliver integrated solutions comprising 
Pace hardware and software.
Over the last two years Pace’s performance has been 
particularly strong in Latin America as we have been first to 
market with new products during digital conversion, such 
as HD boxes and PVRs, again demonstrating technological 
leadership in the sector. However, this has resulted in an 
unsustainably high market share in these territories which 
we expect to normalise in the next 12 – 24 months as 
competition in the market for the supply of these products 
increases.
Europe
The market in Europe is characterised by high levels of 
HD and PVR penetration, addition of hybrid services and 
increasing levels of home networking.
Revenues in Europe declined by 19% to $458m in 2011, 
driven by a decline in the STB business as Pace ceased retail 
sales and exited from low margin business in Italy.
The well-developed Western European market is primarily 
focused on HD-conversion with over 90% of revenues 
relating to HD products. Furthermore, over 35% of European 
STB sales included a PVR functionality.
Residential gateways remain a small proportion of the 
overall European business with revenue of $29m. Software 
& Services revenue of $18m includes the Latens content 
protection systems, device software and maintenance 
services in support of STB sales. The Strategic Review 
identified significant opportunities among mid-tier operators 
in Europe for integrated solutions incorporating our software 
assets, and we are focused on developing opportunities in 
this segment of the market.

Chief Executive
Officer’s Review continued
Our Strategic Review identified that 
significant value would be delivered 
through operational excellence and 
widening out our customer offering.  
In 2012 we will be focused on 
executing against these goals.
A consistent trend we are seeing is that customers in 
the more developed European markets are showing an 
increased interest in more complex products, for example 
those incorporating home networking and Customer 
Management Systems. This trend is directly aligned with 
the widening out objective identified in our Strategic Review 
and provides an opportunity for increased product margins 
and greater quality of earnings.
Rest of World
Revenues in the Rest of the World increased by 13% 
to $318m, driven by growth in the STB business. Pace 
operates in a mixture of developed (notably Australia and 
New Zealand) and developing markets (including India and 
sub-Saharan Africa).
Growth in developed markets has been driven by moves 
towards more technologically advanced products 
reflecting similar trends as in Europe, with operators 
wanting products with increased functionality such as 
WiFi. Widening out our offering in these areas is key to the 
delivery of our Strategic Review.
In developing markets growth to date has been at the high 
end of the market with HD and PVR products comprising 
the majority of sales. We do see significant opportunities 
in these markets for further growth as the uptake of PayTV 
and digitisation continues and greenfield opportunities 
allow Pace to build its footprint with new customers.
In Summary
Our Strategic Review confirmed that Pace operates in 
large, profitable and growing markets. It also identified 
that significant value to shareholders would be delivered 
through increasing operational excellence and widening out 
the customer offering to leverage our software and services 
assets. 2012 will be the year in which our progress towards 
these goals is dependent on our ability to execute on these 
focuses.

Chief Financial
Officer’s Review
2011 proved a challenging year operationally for Pace, due to two natural disasters, 
Group inventory management issues and reduced profitability within Pace Europe. 
Despite this, $2,309.3m of revenue and $141.4m of adjusted EBITA were delivered.
The first natural disaster was the Japanese Tsunami 
in March which impacted the supply chain. Mitigating 
actions were taken and the situation is now resolved.  
The second was the severe flooding in Thailand in 
October, which impacted the supply of HDD. This affected 
revenue by $36.3m and profits by $8.9m in 2011 and is 
expected to be felt throughout 2012. Our revised estimate 
of the impact on 2012 operating profit is $25m-$35m of 
which the majority will fall in the first half.
The Group inventory management issues gave rise to 
excess inventory build-up in the first half of 2011 and 
actions to resolve this matter were implemented. Year-end 
inventory of $150m was low due to the HDD shortage and 
we anticipate normal levels of inventory at circa $180m in 
2012.
Profitability issues identified within Pace Europe are being 
addressed and a reorganisation, as part of our Strategic 
Review, is underway. Annualised savings of circa $7m are 
targeted with an exceptional charge of $11.1m taken in 
2011. Integration of the 2010 acquisitions was successful, 
with the targeted $30m annual synergies delivered both 
sooner and larger than originally anticipated.
With a broader product base, encompassing STBs, 
residential gateways and software & services, the Group  
is well positioned for 2012 and beyond. 
Currency
Following the full integration of the 2010 acquisitions into 
the Group, the business incurs and sources a significant 
majority of revenues and costs in US Dollars.
The strategic decision was made to reduce the foreign 
exchange risk within the business and change both the 
functional and presentational currency of the Group 
and Company to US Dollars from 1 January 2011. This 
decision allows the Financial Statements to be presented 
in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates. Comparative information has been re-
stated in US Dollars to reflect this change.

Revenues of $2,309.3m (2010 restated: $2,062.9m) 
increased by 11.9% due to the full year effect of the 2010 
acquisitions, which contributed $521.3m to revenue. Our 
organic business, saw a 7.1% decrease in revenues, of 
which 1.9ppt related to HDD supply shortages in Q4; 5.2ppt 
of the decline reflects ceasing retail sales and exiting low 
margin business in Europe. Adjusted EBITA of $141.4m 
(2010 restated: $160.6m) which, at 6.1% of sales revenue 
was down 1.7ppt on 2010.
Gross profit of $443.3m (2010 restated: $395.1m) was 
consistent as a percentage of revenue at 19.2% (2010: 
19.2%). Gross margin in the organic business was down 
2.3ppt from 2010 at 16.3%, impacted by the profitability 
issues disclosed in our May Interim Management Statement 
and the HDD impact in Q4. Gross margin in the acquired 
businesses improved 1.9ppt to 29.1% which was partly 
attributable to a non-recurring release of deferred revenue.
Overheads increased by $67.4m to $301.9m (2010 restated: 
$234.5m) driven by the full year effect of 2010 acquisitions 
at $92.4m; these were lower than the comparative full year 
charge in 2010 due to the operational synergies delivered 
ahead of plan in the first half. Overheads in the organic 
business at $209.4m were 0.7% lower year on year.

Chief Executive
Officer’s Review continued
Our Strategic Review identified that 
significant value would be delivered 
through operational excellence and 
widening out our customer offering.  
In 2012 we will be focused on 
executing against these goals.
A consistent trend we are seeing is that customers in 
the more developed European markets are showing an 
increased interest in more complex products, for example 
those incorporating home networking and Customer 
Management Systems. This trend is directly aligned with 
the widening out objective identified in our Strategic Review 
and provides an opportunity for increased product margins 
and greater quality of earnings.
Rest of World
Revenues in the Rest of the World increased by 13% 
to $318m, driven by growth in the STB business. Pace 
operates in a mixture of developed (notably Australia and 
New Zealand) and developing markets (including India and 
sub-Saharan Africa).
Growth in developed markets has been driven by moves 
towards more technologically advanced products 
reflecting similar trends as in Europe, with operators 
wanting products with increased functionality such as 
WiFi. Widening out our offering in these areas is key to the 
delivery of our Strategic Review.
In developing markets growth to date has been at the high 
end of the market with HD and PVR products comprising 
the majority of sales. We do see significant opportunities 
in these markets for further growth as the uptake of PayTV 
and digitisation continues and greenfield opportunities 
allow Pace to build its footprint with new customers.
In Summary
Our Strategic Review confirmed that Pace operates in 
large, profitable and growing markets. It also identified 
that significant value to shareholders would be delivered 
through increasing operational excellence and widening out 
the customer offering to leverage our software and services 
assets. 2012 will be the year in which our progress towards 
these goals is dependent on our ability to execute on these 
focuses.

Chief Financial
Officer’s Review
2011 proved a challenging year operationally for Pace, due to two natural disasters, 
Group inventory management issues and reduced profitability within Pace Europe. 
Despite this, $2,309.3m of revenue and $141.4m of adjusted EBITA were delivered.
The first natural disaster was the Japanese Tsunami 
in March which impacted the supply chain. Mitigating 
actions were taken and the situation is now resolved.  
The second was the severe flooding in Thailand in 
October, which impacted the supply of HDD. This affected 
revenue by $36.3m and profits by $8.9m in 2011 and is 
expected to be felt throughout 2012. Our revised estimate 
of the impact on 2012 operating profit is $25m-$35m of 
which the majority will fall in the first half.
The Group inventory management issues gave rise to 
excess inventory build-up in the first half of 2011 and 
actions to resolve this matter were implemented. Year-end 
inventory of $150m was low due to the HDD shortage and 
we anticipate normal levels of inventory at circa $180m in 
2012.
Profitability issues identified within Pace Europe are being 
addressed and a reorganisation, as part of our Strategic 
Review, is underway. Annualised savings of circa $7m are 
targeted with an exceptional charge of $11.1m taken in 
2011. Integration of the 2010 acquisitions was successful, 
with the targeted $30m annual synergies delivered both 
sooner and larger than originally anticipated.
With a broader product base, encompassing STBs, 
residential gateways and software & services, the Group  
is well positioned for 2012 and beyond. 
Currency
Following the full integration of the 2010 acquisitions into 
the Group, the business incurs and sources a significant 
majority of revenues and costs in US Dollars.
The strategic decision was made to reduce the foreign 
exchange risk within the business and change both the 
functional and presentational currency of the Group 
and Company to US Dollars from 1 January 2011. This 
decision allows the Financial Statements to be presented 
in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates. Comparative information has been re-
stated in US Dollars to reflect this change.

Amortisation of other intangibles, reflecting a full year charge 
of assets arising from acquisitions, increased to $55.7m 
(2010 restated: $18.1m). Net financing charges of $18.3m 
(2010 restated: $2.8m) reflects a full year charge from debt 
raised in 2010 to fund acquisitions. Tax was $15.9m (2010

(2010: 29.9%). 
Adjusted basic earnings per share was 29.7c (2010 restated:

Segmental Analysis
Following the integration of the 2010 acquisitions into the 
Group, coupled with a restructuring of the business, the 
Group now operates through Strategic Business Units 
(SBUs), which comprise Pace Americas, Pace Europe, Pace 
Enterprise and Pace India.
The SBUs, are deemed by the Board to represent operating 
segments under IFRS 8, with revenues and adjusted EBITA 
as follows:
    Restated
    2011  2010  
    $m  $m
Revenue:

Pace Enterprise  (12.1) (7.4)
Unallocated   (72.7) (64.4)
Total adjusted EBITA  141.4 160.6
Although not wholly consistent, revenues in North America 
belong primarily to the Americas SBU, revenues in Europe 
and Rest of World belong largely to the Europe SBU, 
revenues in Latin America belong to both the Americas and 
Europe SBUs and Pace Enterprise revenues are derived from 
North America, Europe and Rest of World.
Pace Americas’ revenue increased by 20.5% to $1,350.6m 
and includes the impact on the US business from the 
2Wire acquisition which completed in October 2010. Pace 
Enterprise revenue increased by 157.1% to $54.0m and 
includes the non-US 2Wire business, Bewan, acquired in 
April 2010, and Latens, acquired in November 2010.
Pace Europe revenue decreased by 5.1% to $871.8m as a 
result of exiting low margin business. The reportable result 
for each of the SBUs is consistent with the impact on our 
organic business and acquisitions described throughout  
this report.
Unallocated revenues increased $30.4m to $32.9m of which 
the majority relates to Pace India and, due to immateriality, 
does not warrant separate disclosure. Unallocated adjusted 
EBITA includes the profit impact from such revenues, 
in addition to head office costs and other unallocated 
overheads.
Financial Position
Balance Sheet
Goodwill decreased by $2.8m from the previously stated 
Sterling equivalent at 31 December 2010 to $335.6m as 
adjustments were made to the provisional fair values of prior 
year acquisitions within the measurement period. Details 
of the adjustments made are shown within note 11 to the 
Financial Statements.
Intangible development expenditure assets increased by 
$9.3m primarily as a result of the capitalisation of project 
costs within the former 2Wire business.
Tangible fixed assets increased by $10.3m as the Group 
invested $41.5m in additions (2010 restated: $31.5m). The 
increase from the previous year was mainly due to planned 
non-recurring capital expenditure on existing and new 
facilities throughout the Group of $12.1m.
Provisions of $87.0m (2010 restated: $86.8m) include 
$10.5m in respect of the restructuring plan in France which 
was announced in November.
Liquidity and cash flows
Working capital was $178.8m (2010 restated: $115.0m). 
The increase was due to the lower level of trade and other 
payables in 2011 compared to 2010, which was partly 
offset by reductions in both inventory and trade and other 
receivables.
Year end net debt was $321.7m (2010 restated: $311.8m). 
During the year two scheduled facility re-payment 
instalments were paid of $37.5m each at June and 
December 2011. The remaining facility continues to be 
repaid through payments of $37.5m every six months, with 
a final payment of $75m due in 2014.
The directors are confident that the Company will be 
strongly cash flow positive in 2012. Plans and processes are 
in place to achieve this end.
The Company’s committed bank facilities are more than 
sufficient to meet our short to medium term funding needs 
and visibility of our forward orders for 2012 is good.
Chief Financial
Officer’s Review continued
The Board recommends a final 
dividend of 2.50c per ordinary share. 
The full year proposed dividend 
increases 11.3% to 3.75c per 
ordinary share.
Critical accounting policies
The directors consider that the Group has the following 
critical accounting policies, as they require the use of 
estimates and are subjective in their nature.
•	 Revenue	r ecognition
•	 Impairment
•	 T axation
•	 Pr ovisions
•	 Intangible	assets
•	 Hedge	accounting
Details of accounting policies and estimates can be found 
within the notes to the Financial Statements.
Dividend
In line with the progressive dividend policy, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of 2.50c per ordinary share 
(2010 restated: 2.25c). The full year proposed dividend 
increases 11.3% to 3.75c per share (2010 restated: 3.37c).
Outlook
We enter 2012 in a strong financial position which will 
allow us to manage the impact of HDD supply disruption 
and deliver on the opportunities identified in the Strategic 
Review.

Report of
the Directors
Principal Activities
The Group’s principal activities are the development, design and distribution of technologies and products for 
managed subscription television, telephony and broadband services and the provision of engineering design, 
and software applications to its STB and gateway customers. The Group also provides related support services 
including systems integration and customer care centres. 
Business and Financial Results
The information that fulfils the requirements of the Business Review and Management Report, including a review 
of the Group’s activities, developments and the financial results for the year, and the key financial performance 
indicators relevant to the business of the Company (principally revenue, gross margin %, EBITA, profit before tax, 
return on sales and net debt), can be found in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review and the Chief Financial Officer’s 
Review on pages 5 to 10. The aforementioned information is incorporated in this report by reference. There is no 
information which falls to be disclosed pursuant to s. 417 (5) of the Companies Act 2006, other than as noted in 
the risks and uncertainties section below.
Risks and Uncertainties
The following are the key risks and uncertainties relevant to the business of the Group:
Customers and Markets
Orders placed by the Group’s PayTV and telecoms customers are typically large one-off orders for delivery over 
a number of months with supplemental orders for additional volumes. As the eventual deployment of the STBs 
or gateways can be unpredictable, revenues can be volatile. The difficulty in predicting the Group’s business flow 
and its risks can be exacerbated by a number of other factors including, for example, the development process 
for an advanced STB, which can take over 12 months. The Group works on long lead times (e.g. 4 months or 
more) for component supply and manufacture, typical of the industry. In the US market, in particular, customers’ 
firm order lead times may be less than the component lead times. There are third party delivery risks, for example, 
difficulties in the delivery of components or software code, and the final order for manufacture and firm contractual 
commitment is usually dependent on product approvals and acceptance both from the operator and sometimes 
from third parties. The Group is also exposed to the industry wide inherent risk of supply chain failure. The Group 
has put in place procedures to monitor the financial and operating strength of key suppliers. In addition, it utilises 
dual or multi source suppliers where appropriate to mitigate this risk.
Product Liability Claims
In common with many companies in the industry, the Group is exposed to the risk of product liability claims made 
by customers or affected third parties, should the Group’s products not fulfil the terms of the contracts under which 
they are sold. The Group has in place quality control and other operational procedures to mitigate this risk.
Credit Risk
The finance function of the Group obtains reports from third party sources in respect of the credit worthiness of key 
customers and suppliers and sets individual credit limits as appropriate. A credit insurance policy is maintained, 
which provides cover over certain debtors where it is economically viable, subject to excesses, and the exposure to 
credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Deposit investments are generally undertaken only in liquid securities 
and with counterparties that have appropriate credit ratings.
Royalties
The Group’s products incorporate third party technology, usually under licence. Inadvertent actions may expose the 
Group to the risk of infringing third party intellectual property rights. Potential claims can be submitted many years 
after a product has been deployed.
Regulatory
The Group is subject to a broad range of laws, regulations and standards and remains exposed to changes in the 
regulatory environment, including potential modifications to import duty regimes, and legislation relevant to the 
Group’s products and services. It is Pace’s policy to require that all its subsidiaries comply with applicable laws, 
regulations and standards. 
Currency Risks
The standard ‘industry currency’ is the US Dollar, with the majority of components and manufacturing capacity 
purchased in this currency. However, due to part of the Group’s revenues being in Sterling and Euros, the Group is 
exposed to the risk of foreign currency movements. To manage this risk, the Group’s treasury policy is progressively 
to cover cash flows when these are sufficiently certain and to seek price variations through contractual mechanisms 
where significant currency movements occur.
Financial Results
The consolidated income statement for the year is set out on page 35. The profit before tax was $54.7m (2010 
restated: $110.2m) and the profit before tax, interest, exceptional items and amortisation of other intangibles was 
$141.4m (2010 restated: $160.6m).
Foreign Currency
During the year the Board determined to change the Company’s functional and Group’s presentational currency to 
US Dollars (USD) given that the significant majority of revenues and costs are generated and incurred in USD.
Dividend
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 2.50c per ordinary share (2010 restated: 2.25c) to be 
paid on 4 July 2012 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 8 June 2012. An interim dividend of 
1.25c per ordinary share was paid during the year (2010 restated: 1.12c).
Dividends will be paid in sterling equivalent to 1.575 pence per ordinary share. This is based on an exchange rate 
of £ = $1.587, being the rate applicable on 5 March 2012.
Share Capital
Details of the Company’s share capital including changes for the year and the rights attaching to the ordinary 
shares are contained in Note 21, and are incorporated in this report by reference.

Report of
the Directors
Principal Activities
The Group’s principal activities are the development, design and distribution of technologies and products for 
managed subscription television, telephony and broadband services and the provision of engineering design, 
and software applications to its STB and gateway customers. The Group also provides related support services 
including systems integration and customer care centres. 
Business and Financial Results
The information that fulfils the requirements of the Business Review and Management Report, including a review 
of the Group’s activities, developments and the financial results for the year, and the key financial performance 
indicators relevant to the business of the Company (principally revenue, gross margin %, EBITA, profit before tax, 
return on sales and net debt), can be found in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review and the Chief Financial Officer’s 
Review on pages 5 to 10. The aforementioned information is incorporated in this report by reference. There is no 
information which falls to be disclosed pursuant to s. 417 (5) of the Companies Act 2006, other than as noted in 
the risks and uncertainties section below.
Risks and Uncertainties
The following are the key risks and uncertainties relevant to the business of the Group:
Customers and Markets
Orders placed by the Group’s PayTV and telecoms customers are typically large one-off orders for delivery over 
a number of months with supplemental orders for additional volumes. As the eventual deployment of the STBs 
or gateways can be unpredictable, revenues can be volatile. The difficulty in predicting the Group’s business flow 
and its risks can be exacerbated by a number of other factors including, for example, the development process 
for an advanced STB, which can take over 12 months. The Group works on long lead times (e.g. 4 months or 
more) for component supply and manufacture, typical of the industry. In the US market, in particular, customers’ 
firm order lead times may be less than the component lead times. There are third party delivery risks, for example, 
difficulties in the delivery of components or software code, and the final order for manufacture and firm contractual 
commitment is usually dependent on product approvals and acceptance both from the operator and sometimes 
from third parties. The Group is also exposed to the industry wide inherent risk of supply chain failure. The Group 
has put in place procedures to monitor the financial and operating strength of key suppliers. In addition, it utilises 
dual or multi source suppliers where appropriate to mitigate this risk.
Product Liability Claims
In common with many companies in the industry, the Group is exposed to the risk of product liability claims made 
by customers or affected third parties, should the Group’s products not fulfil the terms of the contracts under which 
they are sold. The Group has in place quality control and other operational procedures to mitigate this risk.
Credit Risk
The finance function of the Group obtains reports from third party sources in respect of the credit worthiness of key 
customers and suppliers and sets individual credit limits as appropriate. A credit insurance policy is maintained, 
which provides cover over certain debtors where it is economically viable, subject to excesses, and the exposure to 
credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Deposit investments are generally undertaken only in liquid securities 
and with counterparties that have appropriate credit ratings.
Royalties
The Group’s products incorporate third party technology, usually under licence. Inadvertent actions may expose the 
Group to the risk of infringing third party intellectual property rights. Potential claims can be submitted many years 
after a product has been deployed.
Regulatory
The Group is subject to a broad range of laws, regulations and standards and remains exposed to changes in the 
regulatory environment, including potential modifications to import duty regimes, and legislation relevant to the 
Group’s products and services. It is Pace’s policy to require that all its subsidiaries comply with applicable laws, 
regulations and standards. 
Currency Risks
The standard ‘industry currency’ is the US Dollar, with the majority of components and manufacturing capacity 
purchased in this currency. However, due to part of the Group’s revenues being in Sterling and Euros, the Group is 
exposed to the risk of foreign currency movements. To manage this risk, the Group’s treasury policy is progressively 
to cover cash flows when these are sufficiently certain and to seek price variations through contractual mechanisms 
where significant currency movements occur.
Financial Results
The consolidated income statement for the year is set out on page 35. The profit before tax was $54.7m (2010 
restated: $110.2m) and the profit before tax, interest, exceptional items and amortisation of other intangibles was 
$141.4m (2010 restated: $160.6m).
Foreign Currency
During the year the Board determined to change the Company’s functional and Group’s presentational currency to 
US Dollars (USD) given that the significant majority of revenues and costs are generated and incurred in USD.
Dividend
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 2.50c per ordinary share (2010 restated: 2.25c) to be 
paid on 4 July 2012 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 8 June 2012. An interim dividend of 
1.25c per ordinary share was paid during the year (2010 restated: 1.12c).
Dividends will be paid in sterling equivalent to 1.575 pence per ordinary share. This is based on an exchange rate 
of £ = $1.587, being the rate applicable on 5 March 2012.
Share Capital
Details of the Company’s share capital including changes for the year and the rights attaching to the ordinary 
shares are contained in Note 21, and are incorporated in this report by reference.
Significant Shareholdings 
The Company has been notified of the following significant shareholdings as at 5 March 2012.

Creditor days at the end of the period for the Group were 73 days (31 December 2010: 69 days).
Research and Development

programme of research and development of new products, spending $169.7m in the year (2010 restated: 
$124.9m) and charging $160.6m (2010 restated: $120.0m) to the income statement during the year following the

Corporate Governance

designed to maintain a sound system of internal control and that there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Company.

Directors’ Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of the executive directors and other members of the 
Executive Committee as a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and award of share 
options to the Board. The final determinations are made by the Board as a whole but no director plays a part in any 
discussions concerning their own remuneration. There are no agreements between the Company and its directors 
or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs as a result of a takeover bid.
The Remuneration Report of the Directors to shareholders is set out on pages 22 to 30 and includes the 
remuneration policy of the Company and details of directors’ incentive payments and the related performance 
criteria.
Authority to Purchase Own Shares
At the Annual General Meeting in 2011 the Company was authorised by shareholders to purchase up to 
45,681,000 of its own ordinary shares, representing 15 per cent of its issued share capital as at March 2011. The 
Company did not utilise this authority during the year. The authority for the Company to purchase its own shares 
expires at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2012 and a resolution to renew it will be proposed at 
that meeting.
Accountability and Audit
A detailed review of the performance of the Group’s business is contained in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review 
and the Chief Financial Officer’s Review. These statements, together with the Letter from the Chairman and the 
Report of the Directors, are intended to present a balanced assessment of the Group’s position and prospects. The 
directors’ responsibility for the financial statements is described on page 31 and the responsibilities of the auditors 
are described on page 32.
Audit & Risk Committee
During the year the Committee undertook the annual review of its terms of reference. The review focused primarily 
on extending the Committee’s role in relation to assurance and oversight of risk management within the Group. 
Following this review the Committee was re-named the Audit & Risk Committee to emphasise its strengthened role 
in relation to risk.
The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for:

auditing professionals.
The Audit & Risk Committee reviews annually the arrangements for internal audit and during the year the 
Committee re-appointed BDO LLP (BDO) to act as internal auditors, performing an agreed programme of internal 
audits in collaboration with the Company’s Head of Risk Assurance and management. BDO attended and

Group and conducts formal strategy reviews together with other senior executives within the Group at least once 
a year. The Chairman holds meetings with the non-executive directors without the executive directors being 
present at least twice during the year. It is the policy of the Board to undertake a formal review and evaluation of 
its performance including the performance of its committees, the Chairman and individual directors on an annual 
basis. This is generally concluded by written feedback in standardised form from each director to the Chairman or 
the Senior Independent Director in the case of appraisal of the Chairman. The Board will consider appointing an 
independent facilitator for the evaluation process at least once every three years and last did so in 2009 with the 
review concluding in 2010.
Board Committees
The Board has established the following committees, each of which has written terms of reference specifying its 
authority and duties and copies of which are publicly available on the Company’s website: www.pace.com.
The Audit & Risk Committee is comprised of independent designated non-executive directors, Pat Chapman-
Pincher, Mike Inglis and John Grant, who is the Chairman of the Committee. John Grant was previously Group 
Finance Director of a listed business and is considered by the Board to have the necessary recent and relevant 
financial experience for his role as Chairman. Details of the role and of the primary responsibilities of the Audit & 
Risk Committee are explained on page 16. 
The Executive Committee is chaired by Mike Pulli as Chief Executive Officer. The Committee generally meets 
once a month and ensures that the strategy, plans and policies previously agreed or delegated by the Board are 
implemented.
The Executive Committee comprises the executive directors together with the following senior executives:
Anthony Dixon General Counsel

responsible for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and other members of the Executive Committee 
including making recommendations regarding the grant of share incentive awards. The members of the Committee 
have no personal interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest 
arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in the running of the business.

Directors’ Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of the executive directors and other members of the 
Executive Committee as a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and award of share 
options to the Board. The final determinations are made by the Board as a whole but no director plays a part in any 
discussions concerning their own remuneration. There are no agreements between the Company and its directors 
or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs as a result of a takeover bid.
The Remuneration Report of the Directors to shareholders is set out on pages 22 to 30 and includes the 
remuneration policy of the Company and details of directors’ incentive payments and the related performance 
criteria.
Authority to Purchase Own Shares
At the Annual General Meeting in 2011 the Company was authorised by shareholders to purchase up to 
45,681,000 of its own ordinary shares, representing 15 per cent of its issued share capital as at March 2011. The 
Company did not utilise this authority during the year. The authority for the Company to purchase its own shares 
expires at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2012 and a resolution to renew it will be proposed at 
that meeting.
Accountability and Audit
A detailed review of the performance of the Group’s business is contained in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review 
and the Chief Financial Officer’s Review. These statements, together with the Letter from the Chairman and the 
Report of the Directors, are intended to present a balanced assessment of the Group’s position and prospects. The 
directors’ responsibility for the financial statements is described on page 31 and the responsibilities of the auditors 
are described on page 32.
Audit & Risk Committee
During the year the Committee undertook the annual review of its terms of reference. The review focused primarily 
on extending the Committee’s role in relation to assurance and oversight of risk management within the Group. 
Following this review the Committee was re-named the Audit & Risk Committee to emphasise its strengthened role 
in relation to risk.
The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for:
•	 Monitoring	the	integrity	of	the	financial	statements	of	the	Company	and	formal	announcements	r elating	to	the		
 Company’s financial performance and reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements contained therein;
•	 Reviewing	the	Company’ s	inter nal	financial	and	operational	contr ol	and	risk	management	systems;
•	 Monitoring	the	ef fectiveness 	of	the	Company’ s	inter nal	audit	function	and	r eviewing	its	material	findings;
•	 	 Reviewing	accounting	policies,	accounting	tr eatments	and	disclosur es	in	the	financial	statements	to	ensur e	
clarity and completeness;
•	 	 Overseeing	the	Company’ s	r elationship	with	its	exter nal	auditors,	including	making	r ecommendations	as	to	the	
appointment or re-appointment of the external auditors, reviewing their terms of engagement and monitoring 
their independence and ensuring that policy surrounding their engagement to provide non-audit services is 
appropriately applied; and
•	 Reviewing	the	ef fectiveness	of	the	Company’ s	whistleblowing	pr ocedur es.
Internal Audit
The Company’s Head of Risk Assurance, Damien Wilkinson, who has direct access to the Audit & Risk Committee 
primarily through the Chairman of the Committee, manages an internal audit function provided by external qualified 
auditing professionals.
The Audit & Risk Committee reviews annually the arrangements for internal audit and during the year the 
Committee re-appointed BDO LLP (BDO) to act as internal auditors, performing an agreed programme of internal 
audits in collaboration with the Company’s Head of Risk Assurance and management. BDO attended and 
presented their reports to each of the Audit & Risk Committee meetings during the year.

The Committee has, amongst other things, considered the quality of reporting to the Committee and impartiality of 
the internal auditors, and has concluded that the effectiveness of Internal Audit during the year was satisfactory.
External Audit
The Audit & Risk Committee has satisfied itself that the external auditor, KPMG Audit Plc (KPMG) acted 
independent of the Group. Previous appointments of KPMG and the extent of other work undertaken by it were 
considered inter-alia in this regard.
It is the Audit & Risk Committee’s opinion that there were no limitations imposed by management on KPMG whilst 
performing their duties during the review period.
The Audit & Risk Committee, in consultation with the Group’s executive management, agreed to the terms of the 
KPMG engagement letter, audit plan and budgeted audit fees for the 2011 financial year.
A formal framework governs the process through which the Group’s auditor is considered to render non-audit 
services. The Audit & Risk Committee has approved a policy in relation to the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor and the nature and extent of non-audit services that the external auditor could provide within the 
scope of the policy during the financial year.
It was the Audit & Risk Committee’s recommendation that KPMG defer the rotation of engagement partner by 
one year in order to ensure that the acquisition and integration work in respect of previous year acquisitions was 
appropriately seen through to completion. The Audit & Risk Committee note the involvement of an additional 
partner in the 2011 audit and confirms its opinion that this constituted both a benefit to audit quality and an 
appropriate safeguard against the perceived independence risk which could have arisen from the engagement 
partner, Chris Hearld, signing a sixth audit opinion.
Internal Controls
Overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control rests with the Board. The Board has delegated 
certain of its powers to the Audit & Risk Committee to review the effectiveness of the systems of control and to 
receive reports from the auditors (internal and external) and from the management relating to the interim and annual 
accounts and the control systems in use throughout the Group.
During the year and up to the date of this report, the Board carried out reviews of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls. The reviews were undertaken in accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s guidance 
under the following headings and were aimed at clearly identifying the systems already in place and the action 
plans necessary to improve areas of control weakness.
The Control Environment
Subject to those powers and limits of authority reserved by the Board, and to the Group policies and guidelines 
they have established, the conduct of the business of the Group is delegated within a clearly defined organisational 
structure and approved level of authority. The Board has also adopted a Code of Business Ethics, which has been 
incorporated into the Employee Handbook issued to all employees.
Risk Assessment
The directors and senior managers are responsible for identifying and monitoring sources of potential business risk 
and financial risk, and for taking such preventative and protective actions as they consider necessary to manage 
such risks effectively. During the year a risk assessment review of the Group’s business has been conducted by 
the Head of Risk Assurance and BDO acting as internal auditors in conjunction with members of the Executive 
Committee. The Board has received and considered this review as part of an annual risk and control assessment.
The Group’s systems are designed to identify and manage, rather than eliminate, significant business risks, 
including the risk of failure to achieve business objectives but can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. Business risks are identified, evaluated and managed through functional line 
management reporting to divisional meetings, Executive Committee meetings and Board meetings as appropriate. 
Each member of the Executive Committee is required to highlight and report on any significant business risks 
identified within their sphere of responsibility.
The key business risks associated with the timely completion of long-term development projects and ongoing 
business risks, including alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights and supply chain interruption, 
are managed by cross-functional teams of senior employees. Business continuity plans addressing physical risks to 
the Group’s development sites and maintenance of IT services are maintained. The Group has adopted Customer 
Account Teams (CATs) grouped within SBUs so as to focus the business on customer needs. The senior managers 
within the CATs also monitor the financial and business risks, including competitor risks, associated with the 
delivery of agreed plans, reviewing such matters at Business Review Meetings held on a regular basis and attended 
by members of the Executive Committee. During the year particular focus of these risk management systems was 
required in respect of the consequences of the Japanese Tsunami and floods in Thailand.
Financial Control and Information Systems
The Group’s strategic direction is reviewed regularly by the Board and plans, budgets and performance targets are 
reviewed and approved at least annually. Directors receive monthly summaries of financial results which compare 
actual performance with targets, together with detailed management reports that identify the reasons for variances 
and the progress achieved. Business planning documents are revised on a regular basis in line with actual and 
expected performance. A review of the consolidated financial statements is completed by the centralised Group 
Finance Function to ensure that the financial position and results of the Group are appropriately reflected in the 
consolidated accounts.
Control Procedures
Financial control procedures have been developed for all of the main business functions and in relation to the 
Company’s financial reporting process and the Group’s process for the preparation of consolidated accounts, and 
have been documented in a procedures manual. Authorisation limits for purchases and capital expenditure are 
specified and procedures are in place for minimising exposure to potential weaknesses in the receipt, handling and 
despatch of goods. The Group’s main premises have received accreditation for BSI ISO 9001: 2000.
Monitoring Systems
Monitoring of the internal control systems is carried out by Head of Risk Assurance in conjunction with the internal 
auditors, BDO.
Although no system of internal financial control can provide absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss, the Group’s systems are designed to provide the directors with reasonable assurance that transactions 
are authorised and completely and accurately recorded, that assets are safeguarded and that material errors, 
irregularities and actions contrary to Group policies and directions are either prevented or promptly discovered.
Going Concern
The Group has borrowing facilities in place until March 2014. At 31 December 2011 these are in the form of 
a $225m term loan which is subject to repayment through instalments of $37.5m each due every six months, 
plus a final bullet payment of $75m, and a $150m revolver credit facility. These facilities are subject to financial 
performance covenants which the Group currently complies with.
The Board’s assessment of the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern has taken into 
account the effect of the current economic climate, current market position and the level of borrowings in the year. 
The principal risks that the Group is challenged with have been set out in the Risks and Uncertainties section of this 
report along with how the directors intend to mitigate those risks.
The Board has prepared a financial and working capital forecast upon trading assumptions and other medium term 
plans and has concluded that the Group will continue to meet its financial performance covenants and will have 
adequate working capital available to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Employment Policies
The directors recognise the importance of the Group’s employees to its success and future development and are 
committed to providing an environment that will attract, motivate and reward high quality employees. The Group 
continues to invest in a range of internal and external initiatives to promote employee development.

Group through regular employee meetings/briefings and a Company newsletter.
The Group welcomes applications for employment from all sectors of the community and promotes equality of 
opportunity in employment regardless of age, sex, sexual orientation, disability or ethnic origin. It is the Group’s 
policy that training, career development and promotion opportunities should be available to all employees. In 
the event that an employee becomes disabled, the Group makes reasonable adjustments where any aspect of 
premises or working practices puts such a disabled employee at a substantial disadvantage compared with a non-
disabled employee.
Health and Safety
Each SBU in the Group has an established Health and Safety Committee made up of health and safety 
representatives, the designated health and safety officer and other persons with expert knowledge who review 
health and safety issues relevant to the Group’s business. Other safety-related committees also conduct periodic 
reviews of specific work practices. These actions complement the UK Government’s “Health, Work, Wellbeing” 
(HWW) initiative which has been adopted and implemented by the Company.
Part of the HWW incorporates return to work programmes and the Group’s operations in Saltaire and Americas 
West and Americas East have adopted similar policies. Each division incorporates, where appropriate, their 
ergonomic risk assessments. The Group’s businesses in India, the UK, Americas West and Americas East provide 
training for First Aid, Fire Evacuation and Fire Wardens. Americas West undertakes earthquake training and 
Americas East undertakes hurricane training. All of these initiatives are backed up by appropriate risk assessments. 
“Tool-box talks”, short presentations on specific aspects of health and safety, are also published on the Group’s 
intranet and shared between different parts of the Group.
The number of workplace accidents during the year for Saltaire was 4. Outside the UK, there were 14 accidents 
in the Americas West and Americas East operations and none in India. None of these accidents was regarded 
by the relevant local Health and Safety Committee as serious. A report concerning health and safety aspects of 
the Group’s business and copies of specific Group safety policy documents can be obtained from the Company 
Secretary.
Charitable and Community Support
The Group has an established Charitable Donations Committee comprising employees based at the Group’s 
premises in the UK and the USA. The committee, considers all requests for charitable and community project 
assistance from employees and external charities within a financial budget and criteria approved by the Board on 
an annual basis.
The Group’s support through the committee is focused on the local geographical area of Pace’s premises in 
the UK, France, India and the USA as well as the charitable and community initiatives of Group employees. The 
corporate charity policy focus is to support local charities of benefit to the local area and people living close to each 
Group site.
During the year, a number of requests for support were considered by the committee, of which 107 satisfied the 
criteria and received financial support amounting to $106,675 in total. The participation of employees of the Group 
in community and charitable activities outside work hours has been encouraged by the provision of funds to match 
individual sponsorship raised. Donations amounting to $44,071 were made to local charitable causes pursuant to 
the CEO’s discretion or prior Board approval.
Pace has continued as lead sponsor of the Leeds Ahead education strand of business engagement in the UK’s 
West Yorkshire region following its acceptance of this role for a two year period in 2010. This has enabled Leeds 
Ahead to develop and roll-out their Make the Grade business education partnership model in the West Yorkshire 
region. 
In addition, Pace has partnered with Teach First to support the Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths 
(STEM) teachers in Yorkshire and the Humber. Pace will fund the provision of personal development coaches to 
Teach First participants in their second year of teaching. Teach First recruits, trains and supports teachers working 
in schools in low income communities to raise the achievement, aspirations and access to opportunity of children 
from low socio-economic backgrounds.
Supply Chain
Pace is a member of the Electronic Industry Citizen Coalition (EICC) and applies to the EICC Code of Conduct in 
its business. A programme of assessment and auditing is maintained at the regular business review meetings held 
with the Group’s principal suppliers. During the year, two members of the Pace Quality Team undertook training and 
were certified as EICC-GeSI Labour and Ethics Lead Auditors.
Accreditation
Pace is a member of Business in the Community (BITC), which operates in the UK and internationally through a 
network of partners world-wide. Membership allows Pace to further develop and promote responsibility in business 
through access to the expertise and experience of the BITC team and their membership base.
In the second half of the year, the Company participated in the BITC CR Index. The BITC CR Index is an 
internationally recognised index of how effectively businesses identify, address and integrates the management of 
their environmental and social impacts. Participation provides the Group with a benchmark and gap analysis with 
best practice. We are pleased to report that we achieved a Silver ranking for our CSR programme.

During the year, a number of requests for support were considered by the committee, of which 107 satisfied the 
criteria and received financial support amounting to $106,675 in total. The participation of employees of the Group 
in community and charitable activities outside work hours has been encouraged by the provision of funds to match 
individual sponsorship raised. Donations amounting to $44,071 were made to local charitable causes pursuant to 
the CEO’s discretion or prior Board approval.
Pace has continued as lead sponsor of the Leeds Ahead education strand of business engagement in the UK’s 
West Yorkshire region following its acceptance of this role for a two year period in 2010. This has enabled Leeds 
Ahead to develop and roll-out their Make the Grade business education partnership model in the West Yorkshire 
region. 
In addition, Pace has partnered with Teach First to support the Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths 
(STEM) teachers in Yorkshire and the Humber. Pace will fund the provision of personal development coaches to 
Teach First participants in their second year of teaching. Teach First recruits, trains and supports teachers working 
in schools in low income communities to raise the achievement, aspirations and access to opportunity of children 
from low socio-economic backgrounds.
Supply Chain
Pace is a member of the Electronic Industry Citizen Coalition (EICC) and applies to the EICC Code of Conduct in 
its business. A programme of assessment and auditing is maintained at the regular business review meetings held 
with the Group’s principal suppliers. During the year, two members of the Pace Quality Team undertook training and 
were certified as EICC-GeSI Labour and Ethics Lead Auditors.
Accreditation
Pace is a member of Business in the Community (BITC), which operates in the UK and internationally through a 
network of partners world-wide. Membership allows Pace to further develop and promote responsibility in business 
through access to the expertise and experience of the BITC team and their membership base.
In the second half of the year, the Company participated in the BITC CR Index. The BITC CR Index is an 
internationally recognised index of how effectively businesses identify, address and integrates the management of 
their environmental and social impacts. Participation provides the Group with a benchmark and gap analysis with 
best practice. We are pleased to report that we achieved a Silver ranking for our CSR programme.

Auditors
KPMG held office as auditors during the year. The Audit Committee reviews the independence and objectivity 
of the auditors, considering whether, taken as a whole, the various relationships (if any) between the Group and 
the auditors impair, or appear to impair, the auditors’ judgement or independence. The Committee was satisfied 
throughout the year that the objectivity and independence of KPMG was not in any way impaired by either the 
nature of the non-audit related services undertaken during the year, the level of the non-audit fees charged or any 
other fact or circumstances.
Having considered the results of the Committee’s work, the Board is recommending the re-appointment of KPMG 
as auditors. A resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting.
Each of the directors who held office at the date of approval of this Report of the Directors confirms that, so far 
as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and the 
directors have each taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board has continued to establish and maintain relationships with institutional shareholders and communicates 
with investors through the Group’s web site (www.pace.com). A programme of meetings with institutional 
shareholders is in place (at which institutional shareholders are offered the opportunity to meet with non-executive 
directors) and analyst presentations are made following announcement of the interim and annual results. 
Shareholders are welcome to participate at the Annual General Meeting at which the Board will be available for 
questions.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held on 16 April 2012 at the offices of the Company at Salts 
Mill, Victoria Road, Saltaire, West Yorkshire, BD18 3LF. Full details of the business to be transacted at the meeting 
will be set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.

The directors present their report to shareholders on pages 22 to 30 regarding remuneration matters in respect of 
the year ended 31 December 2011.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible for setting the individual remuneration of the 
executive directors and other members of the Executive Committee within the framework of the remuneration 
policy described below, which is set by the Board.
The directors who were members of the Committee during the year were Pat Chapman-Pincher (Chairman of 
the Committee), Allan Leighton (from June 2011), Mike McTighe (until resignation) and John Grant. For guidance, 
the Committee makes use of surveys of executive pay and knowledge of market rates. The CEO and Director 
of HR also attended Remuneration Committee meetings during the year by invitation and provided advice to the 
Committee to enable it to reach informed decisions. No director was present when their remuneration was being 
discussed. The Committee was assisted in its consideration of remuneration matters by Kepler Associates who 
were appointed by the Committee. Kepler Associates provided no other services to the Group in the year. Pinsent 
Masons, legal advisers to the Company, also advised the Committee regarding certain equity incentive related 
issues.
Remuneration Policy
The Board believes that it is necessary to ensure that the remuneration packages of the executive directors remain 
competitive in order to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and senior managers of a high calibre and 
to reward them for performance. The policy is for a significant proportion of executive directors’ total remuneration 
to be capable of being earned from variable, performance-based incentives, through annual bonuses and share 
based incentives. The objective of this policy is to provide rewards and incentives that reflect corporate and 
individual performance and align management’s objectives directly with those of the shareholders. More than half of 
an executive director’s remuneration is variable and is linked to corporate performance.
The Board’s policy in relation to non-executive directors continues to be to pay fees that are competitive with the 
fees paid by comparable quoted companies. Non-executive directors’ fees are determined by the Board as a 
whole within the limits set out in the Company’s Articles of Association. Non-executive directors are not eligible 
for performance bonuses or pension contributions and do not participate in the equity incentive plans, save in 
respect of Allan Leighton’s Appointment Share Award which was a one-off exception to the policy. Non-executive 
remuneration is reviewed annually.
Salary
Basic salary for each executive director is determined by the Committee, taking into account the performance of 
the individual and information from independent sources on external market salary levels for comparable jobs with 
a view to salaries being set around the median to upper quartile level for comparable companies. In setting senior 
executives’ salaries, the Committee also takes into account pay and employment conditions in the Group as a 
whole. Salary is generally reviewed at the commencement of each financial year. As a result of the review in January 
2012, there were no increases in salaries of the executive directors for 2012 in line with Group salaries. The salary 
of Mike Pulli was fixed at $750,000 per annum upon his appointment as CEO in December 2011, and the salary of 
Roddy Murray was fixed at $503,750 upon his appointment in February 2012.
Performance Bonus
The Company established a non-pensionable performance-related bonus plan for the executive directors and 
other key members of management for the year, which was based on the successful achievement of corporate 
and individual objectives. The corporate objectives were linked to the key drivers of value creation for shareholders 
and the key measure therefore was the profitability of the Group for the full financial year. Achievement of the 2011 
bonus was dependent on the Group’s pre-tax profits (before certain exceptional items) exceeding $176m with the 
capacity to earn additional bonus increments upon achievement of higher profit targets up to a ceiling of $196m. 
In addition, a number of individual personal objectives were set for each director and manager, which were aligned 
with the objectives of the Group for the year. The maximum bonus achievable by the executive directors in the 
event that all corporate and individual targets were met was 150% of basic annual salary with one third of any 
bonus outcome achieved being deferred into shares in the Company for a period of two years under the Group 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan. The Committee retained a discretion to reduce the bonus otherwise payable by up 
to 20% based on their assessment of the management of the Company’s cash position during the year. The

Committee, having regard to the performance of the business during the period, determined to award no bonus to 
any of Neil Gaydon, Stuart Hall and David McKinney.
Mike Pulli (who was appointed a director on 14 December 2011) had a similarly structured bonus opportunity but 
primarily based on the performance of the Pace Americas SBU during the year but also dependent as to a portion 
(15%) on the Group’s pre-tax profits. Having regard to the performance of the Pace Americas SBU during the 
year, which exceeded its 2011 budget targets, the Committee determined to award maximum bonus to Mike Pulli 
referable to the performance of Pace Americas but no portion of the bonus was payable referable to the Group’s 
pre-tax profits.
Prior to 2011 the Committee had offered members of the Executive Committee the opportunity to earn an 
“exceptional” bonus up to 100% of salary. In respect of the 2011 financial year, the Committee reviewed the 
executive bonus structure with its remuneration advisers. The outcome of this review was a revised bonus structure 
which no longer had an opportunity for executives to earn a discretionary “exceptional” bonus and replaced this 
feature by a specific additional performance objective which could boost normal bonus outcomes achieved under 
the Group pre-tax profit targets and individual objectives described above by up to two-thirds, but only if a positive 
bonus outcome is first achieved under the normal Group pre-tax profits target and individual objectives. Potential 
maximum bonus outcomes are capped at 225% of base salary and one-third of all bonus outcomes achieved 
up to 150% of base salary deferred into shares for two years, with deferral also applying on these terms to any 
bonus outcomes achieved between 150% and 225% of base salary. This outline structure has been maintained 
in respect of the 2012 financial year except that earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of other intangibles 
(EBITA) will be used as the corporate target instead of PBT recognising the short term impact of acquisition-related 
items including amortisation of intangibles and interest. The Committee retains a discretion to reduce the bonus 
otherwise payable by up to 50% based on their assessment of the management of inventory levels during the year 
and achievement of targets on debtor days. 
Benefits in Kind
Each UK based executive director is entitled to benefits such as the provision of a fully expensed company car 
plus fuel (or cash alternative), private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, life insurance and where 
applicable relocation assistance. Mike Pulli has equivalent benefits to the extent consistent with US labor market 
practice.
Pension Contributions
In the year ending 31 December 2011, contributions were paid into the executive directors’ pension schemes at 
rates determined by the Board. Contributions have continued to be paid during the current year at the rate of 15% 
of each director’s basic salary. The Group does not operate any defined benefit schemes.
Performance Share Plans
Following the approval of shareholders at the 2009 AGM, a new Performance Share Plan (PSP) was introduced, 
with all Group employees (including executive directors) eligible to participate. Under the PSP , employees receive 
a conditional right to receive shares for no cost, which will normally vest after 3 years subject to continued 
employment and the achievement of stretching performance conditions.
PSP awards granted prior to 2012 will vest subject to the achievement of 3-year targets based on cumulative 
profit before tax (PBT) for the Group. During the year awards made to all employees across the Group including 
executive directors were based on 3-year Group PBT. The cumulative Group PBT targets that apply to the awards 
made in 2011 are set out in Note 4 to the directors’ share options table on page 29.
The Company’s policy is that PSP awards will generally be satisfied using shares purchased in the market via the 
Pace Employee Benefits Share Trust. During the year the executive directors received PSP awards over shares 
worth 100% of their basic salary.
Cumulative EBITA targets are proposed for 2012 awards rather than cumulative PBT targets with cumulative EBITA 
being measured over the three financial years 2012–2014. For these purposes EBITA and previous PBT targets will 
be adjusted to exclude the amortisation of other intangibles, exceptional items and other items that the Committee 
determines to be appropriate to ensure it reflects underlying long-term performance. These PBT / EBITA target 
figures have been re-stated to reflect the switch to US Dollar reporting. The use of EBITA targets for 2012 PSP 
awards was considered to be appropriate as it aligns the focus of Pace senior executives on a key measure of 
financial performance which is highly visible internally and externally and which is regularly monitored and reported. 
Following the General Meeting of the Company held on 18 October 2010 shareholders approved the adoption of a 
new performance share plan, the International Performance Share Plan (IPSP). The IPSP follows closely the terms 
of the PSP; however Executive directors may not participate.
Share Option Plans
At present, the executive directors may participate in two share option plans:
•	 a	standar d	HMRC	appr oved	all-employee	shar esave	plan;	
•	 the	Company’ s	2005	discr etionary	shar e	option	plans	(HMRC	Appr oved	and	Unappr oved	plans).	
In 2011, executive directors were granted sharesave options and also received option grants under the 2005 
discretionary share option plans. Details of the performance conditions applying to all outstanding share options 
held by the executive directors, including options granted in 2011, are set out in the footnotes to the directors’ 
share options table on page 29.
The maximum award of options to any employee pursuant to the HMRC Approved plan is $46,500. The maximum 
award of options under the Unapproved plan to any employee in each year is 200% of salary or, in exceptional 
circumstances, as determined by the Committee, 400% of salary. Option awards are targeted at the Company’s 
most senior executives and are based on a fixed number of options (subject always to the discretion of the 
Committee to utilise other award criteria in exceptional circumstances). Option awards vest subject to real EPS 
growth (as noted on page 29). The Committee believes EPS targets to be appropriate to enhance alignment of the 
senior executives with shareholder interests whilst still maintaining focus on profitability.
Share Award Contracts
The following information is given pursuant to Listing Rule 9.4.3.
As part of the terms on which Allan Leighton was appointed, he agreed to purchase $310,000 of Pace shares 
and the Company agreed to match this personal investment on a two-for-one basis that will vest on the third 
anniversary of his appointment which occurred on 31 May 2011. An additional award over 600,000 Pace shares 
was made at the same time and will vest dependent on share price performance over a four year period: 25% of 
this award will vest at a share price of 145p with full vesting at 190p. Both awards are subject to the shares being 
retained until at least the fifth anniversary of appointment. The awards will normally lapse on cessation of the office 
within three years. On a change of control the awards will vest, with vesting of the share-price related awards 
dependent on share price performance. Vesting may also occur on certain other corporate events. The maximum 
number of shares awarded under this arrangement is 938,810 shares. The Remuneration Committee considered 
the circumstances relating to this appointment unusual because of the significant personal financial investment 
that Allan Leighton was prepared to make in the Company and the need to secure his unique experience at a time 
when the business was facing a number of challenges. 
In March 2010 the Remuneration Committee agreed to make an individual award of contingent shares (the “2010 
Share Award”) to Mike Pulli equivalent to 1 x annual salary (171,480 ordinary shares). Vesting of the 2010 Share 
Award was dependent on achievement of budget by Pace Americas in each of 2010 and 2011 financial years. 
Vesting is expected to be achieved in full on 15 March 2012 and particulars of this award are contained in the table 
on page 29.
Minimum Shareholding
Following the review of the Group’s remuneration policies completed in February 2009 the Committee introduced 
individual shareholding target requirements for members of the Executive Committee (including executive directors) 
with a requirement (subject to a discretion of the Remuneration Committee) for such executives to retain a 
portion of any net awards (ie. after tax and exercise cost) of newly vested share-based incentives until the target 
shareholding level is reached. The target shareholding is approximately 100% of the executive’s annual salary 
and up to 50% of shares earned but held under the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan are deemed to count 
towards the ownership target. Each executive is required to achieve target ownership level within a period of five 
years.

PSP awards granted prior to 2012 will vest subject to the achievement of 3-year targets based on cumulative 
profit before tax (PBT) for the Group. During the year awards made to all employees across the Group including 
executive directors were based on 3-year Group PBT. The cumulative Group PBT targets that apply to the awards 
made in 2011 are set out in Note 4 to the directors’ share options table on page 29.
The Company’s policy is that PSP awards will generally be satisfied using shares purchased in the market via the 
Pace Employee Benefits Share Trust. During the year the executive directors received PSP awards over shares 
worth 100% of their basic salary.
Cumulative EBITA targets are proposed for 2012 awards rather than cumulative PBT targets with cumulative EBITA 
being measured over the three financial years 2012–2014. For these purposes EBITA and previous PBT targets will 
be adjusted to exclude the amortisation of other intangibles, exceptional items and other items that the Committee 
determines to be appropriate to ensure it reflects underlying long-term performance. These PBT / EBITA target 
figures have been re-stated to reflect the switch to US Dollar reporting. The use of EBITA targets for 2012 PSP 
awards was considered to be appropriate as it aligns the focus of Pace senior executives on a key measure of 
financial performance which is highly visible internally and externally and which is regularly monitored and reported. 
Following the General Meeting of the Company held on 18 October 2010 shareholders approved the adoption of a 
new performance share plan, the International Performance Share Plan (IPSP). The IPSP follows closely the terms 
of the PSP; however Executive directors may not participate.
Share Option Plans
At present, the executive directors may participate in two share option plans:
•	a	standar d	HMRC	appr oved	all-employee	shar esave	plan;	
•	 the	Company’ s	2005	discr etionary	shar e	option	plans	(HMRC	Appr oved	and	Unappr oved	plans).	
In 2011, executive directors were granted sharesave options and also received option grants under the 2005 
discretionary share option plans. Details of the performance conditions applying to all outstanding share options 
held by the executive directors, including options granted in 2011, are set out in the footnotes to the directors’ 
share options table on page 29.
The maximum award of options to any employee pursuant to the HMRC Approved plan is $46,500. The maximum 
award of options under the Unapproved plan to any employee in each year is 200% of salary or, in exceptional 
circumstances, as determined by the Committee, 400% of salary. Option awards are targeted at the Company’s 
most senior executives and are based on a fixed number of options (subject always to the discretion of the 
Committee to utilise other award criteria in exceptional circumstances). Option awards vest subject to real EPS 
growth (as noted on page 29). The Committee believes EPS targets to be appropriate to enhance alignment of the 
senior executives with shareholder interests whilst still maintaining focus on profitability.
Share Award Contracts
The following information is given pursuant to Listing Rule 9.4.3.
As part of the terms on which Allan Leighton was appointed, he agreed to purchase $310,000 of Pace shares 
and the Company agreed to match this personal investment on a two-for-one basis that will vest on the third 
anniversary of his appointment which occurred on 31 May 2011. An additional award over 600,000 Pace shares 
was made at the same time and will vest dependent on share price performance over a four year period: 25% of 
this award will vest at a share price of 145p with full vesting at 190p. Both awards are subject to the shares being 
retained until at least the fifth anniversary of appointment. The awards will normally lapse on cessation of the office 
within three years. On a change of control the awards will vest, with vesting of the share-price related awards 
dependent on share price performance. Vesting may also occur on certain other corporate events. The maximum 
number of shares awarded under this arrangement is 938,810 shares. The Remuneration Committee considered 
the circumstances relating to this appointment unusual because of the significant personal financial investment 
that Allan Leighton was prepared to make in the Company and the need to secure his unique experience at a time 
when the business was facing a number of challenges. 
In March 2010 the Remuneration Committee agreed to make an individual award of contingent shares (the “2010 
Share Award”) to Mike Pulli equivalent to 1 x annual salary (171,480 ordinary shares). Vesting of the 2010 Share 
Award was dependent on achievement of budget by Pace Americas in each of 2010 and 2011 financial years. 
Vesting is expected to be achieved in full on 15 March 2012 and particulars of this award are contained in the table 
on page 29.
Minimum Shareholding
Following the review of the Group’s remuneration policies completed in February 2009 the Committee introduced 
individual shareholding target requirements for members of the Executive Committee (including executive directors) 
with a requirement (subject to a discretion of the Remuneration Committee) for such executives to retain a 
portion of any net awards (ie. after tax and exercise cost) of newly vested share-based incentives until the target 
shareholding level is reached. The target shareholding is approximately 100% of the executive’s annual salary 
and up to 50% of shares earned but held under the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan are deemed to count 
towards the ownership target. Each executive is required to achieve target ownership level within a period of five 
years.

Service Contracts
Company policy is that executive directors’ notice periods should not exceed 1 year. Each of the executive 
directors has a service contract with the Company. Each of these agreements is terminable by the Company on 12 
months’ prior written notice or by the relevant director on not less than 6 months’ prior written notice. At the option 
of the Company, each agreement may be terminated forthwith subject to the Company paying a sum equivalent to 
12 months’ salary, benefits and pension contributions. 
It is the Company’s policy to honour its obligations with regard to directors’ service agreements and where the 
employment of a director is terminated in accordance with the aforementioned contractual process the Company 
will pay the sum specified in the relevant service agreement as payable or otherwise pay fair and reasonable 
compensation.
The service agreement of Mike Pulli with Pace Americas, Inc. became effective on 13 November 2003, was 
amended on 26 October 2004 and was most recently amended by decision of the Remuneration Committee to 
reflect his appointment as CEO and new terms as outlined above (but varied to reflect US practice and custom) on 
14 December 2011. The service agreement of Stuart Hall became effective on 2 April 2007 and was most recently 
amended on 26 January 2011. The service agreement of Roddy Murray became effective on 23 February 2012. 
Save for the notice periods referred to in the above paragraph, these contracts have no unexpired term.
Each of the non-executive directors is appointed under a letter of appointment which is terminable at any time by 
the Company without contractual notice where notice is not given, termination is generally subject to payment of 
an amount equal to three months’ directors’ fees. Each of the directors (and certain officers of subsidiaries of the 
Company) has a letter of indemnity issued by the Company which provides an indemnity in respect of liabilities 
incurred in the course of their office to the extent permitted by the Company’s Articles of Association and the 
provisions of the Companies Act.
Copies of the service contracts of the executive directors and the letters of appointment of the non-executive 
directors, together with the share award contracts and letters of indemnity referred to above, are available for 
inspection during normal business hours (Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays excepted) at the registered 
office of the Company.
The Company maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of senior employees and officers of the 
Group including the directors. The consent of the Board is required in the event that an executive director wishes 
to accept an external appointment. It has been the practice of the Company to permit a director to retain non-
executive fees arising from any such appointment but during the year none of the current executive directors held 
such external appointments.
The auditors are required to report on the information disclosed on pages 26 to 29.

Notes: Performance Conditions
1.  Under the 2000 Unapproved Scheme performance conditions of 6% per annum compound above RPI were 
applied to the grant of options. 
2.  Options subject to performance conditions based on growth in the pre-tax profits of the Group (PBT) over a 
period of three financial years with 25% of options vesting at $10.7 million PBT in the third financial year and 
100% of options vesting at $26.7 million PBT in the third financial year, with vesting on a sliding scale between 
these two target thresholds. 
3.  Options granted in FY 2008 are subject to performance conditions based on cumulative growth in EPS requiring 
a minimum growth in EPS of 4% per annum above inflation over a three-year period at which level there is 25% 
vesting. Cumulative growth of 8% per annum above inflation is required for 100% vesting. Options granted in FY 
2009, FY 2010, FY 2011 and FY 2012 are subject to performance conditions based on similar cumulative EPS 
growth but with increased EPS growth required for maximum vesting from RPI + 8% to RPI + 15% per annum. 
In order to assess whether the performance conditions have been met, the Committee will utilize the earnings 
figures derived from the audited Financial Statements of the Group adjusted to exclude exceptional or other 
items that the Committee determines appropriate to ensure they reflect underlying long term performance. 
4.  PSP awards will vest subject to the achievement of 3-year targets based on cumulative PBT for the Group prior 
to 2012 and awards granted in 2012 will vest subject to achievement of three year targets based on cumulative 
EBITA for the Group.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company Financial Statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•	 make	judgements	and	accounting	estimates	that	ar e	r easonable	and	prudent;
•	 state	whether	they	have	been	pr epar ed	in	accor dance	with	IFRSs	as	adopted	by	the	EU;	and
•	 	 pr epar e	the	Financial	Statements	on	the	going	concer n	basis	unless	it	is	inappr opriate	to	pr esume	that	the	Gr oup	
and Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company Financial Statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•	 make	judgements	and	accounting	estimates	that	ar e	r easonable	and	prudent;
•	 state	whether	they	have	been	pr epar ed	in	accor dance	with	IFRSs	as	adopted	by	the	EU;	and
•	 	 pr epar e	the	Financial	Statements	on	the	going	concer n	basis	unless	it	is	inappr opriate	to	pr esume	that	the	Gr oup	
and Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

endorsed by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations and with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company’s Financial Statements have 
been prepared on the same basis and as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is presented 
for the Company. The result of the Company for the year is shown in note 25.
Financial year end
The current year’s ﬁ nancial statements are for the year ended 31 December 2011 and the previous year’s ﬁ nancial statements are 
for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁ nancial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings (note 13) drawn up to 31 
December 2011. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or 
indirectly, to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁ ts from its activities. In assessing control, 
potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. Intra-group transactions, including sales, 
proﬁ ts, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on the Group consolidation. Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost 
less any impairment loss in the ﬁ nancial statements of the Company.
Change in functional currency
IAS 21, ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’, describes functional currency as “the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which an entity operates”. The Group and Company incur and source a signiﬁ cant majority of revenues 
and costs in US dollars.
A change in functional currency reﬂ ects the accumulation over time of those factors which are the main determinants of functional 
currency. Having considered the aggregate effect of all relevant factors, the Directors concluded that this point was reached in 
the ﬁ rst quarter of 2011, following the integration of 2Wire Inc into the Pace Group. Accordingly, the Directors determined that the 
functional currency of Pace plc had changed to USD from 1 January 2011.
In accordance with IAS 21 this change has been accounted for prospectively from this date.
Change in presentation currency
From 1 January 2011 the Group also changed its presentation currency to USD. Comparative information has been restated in USD 
in accordance with the guidance deﬁ ned in IAS 21. The 2010 ﬁ nancial statements and associated notes have been retranslated 
from Sterling to USD using the procedures outlined below:
• Assets and liabilities were translated into USD at closing rates of exchange at 31 December 2010 and opening rates of 
exchange at 1 January 2010.
• T rading results were translated into USD at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of transaction, or average rates where 
they are a suitable proxy.
• Share capital, share premium and other capital reserves were translated at the historic rates prevailing at the dates of 
transactions.
• Differences resulting from the retranslation of the opening net assets and the results for the year have been taken to reserves.
Signiﬁ cant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty
The Group’s main accounting policies affecting its results of operations and ﬁ nancial condition are set out on pages 43 to 49. 
Judgements and assumptions have been required by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies in many areas. 
Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions. Key areas of estimation 
uncertainty and critical accounting judgements are as follows:

Warranties
Pace provides product warranties for its products. Although it is difﬁ cult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the 
possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must be calculated at the outset of a product before ﬁ eld deployment data 
is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the product in the ﬁ eld.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data 
and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty provision required is reviewed 
on a product by product basis and provisions adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
Royalties
Pace’s products incorporate third party technology, usually under licence. Inadvertent actions may expose Pace to the risk of 
infringing third party intellectual property rights. Potential claims can still be submitted many years after a product has been 
deployed. Any such claims are always vigorously defended.
A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated 
claims for royalties relating to the Group’s use (including past usage) of that technology. Having taken legal advice, the board 
considers that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought. The Group will vigorously negotiate or 
defend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which the 
potential liabilities are ﬁ nally settled. The provision is based on the latest information available.
Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identiﬁ ed as the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has determined that, based on its current internal 
reporting framework and management structure, it has three reportable segments. 
Such determination is necessarily judgmental in its nature and has been determined for the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements. 
The level of disclosure of segmental and other information is determined by such assessment. Further details of the considerations 
made and the resulting disclosures are provided in note 3 to the ﬁ nancial statements.
Intangible assets
The Group’s business includes a signiﬁ cant element of research and development activity.  Under accounting standards, principally 
IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, there is a requirement to capitalise and amortise development spend to match costs to expected beneﬁ ts 
from projects deemed to be commercially viable.  The application of this policy involves the ongoing consideration by management 
of the forecasted economic beneﬁ t from such projects compared to the level of capitalised costs, together with the selection of 
amortisation periods appropriate to the life of the associated revenues from the product. 
Going concern
The Group has borrowing facilities in place until March 2014. At 31 December 2011 these are in the form of a $225m term loan, 
which is subject to repayment through instalments of $37.5m each, due every six months plus a ﬁ nal payment of $75m, and a 
$150m revolver credit facility. These facilities are subject to ﬁ nancial performance covenants which the Group currently complies 
with.
The Group has prepared a ﬁ nancial and working capital forecast based upon trading assumptions and other short term and medium 
term plans. The Group has sensitised these plans for a number of potential scenarios, including working capital management 
and revenue reduction and has concluded that the Group will continue to meet its ﬁ nancial performance covenants and will have 
adequate working capital available to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
2   Accounting policies
Business combinations
Control is the power to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁ ts from its activities. In assessing 
control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable. The acquisition date is the date 
on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether 
control is transferred from one party to another.
Goodwill
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Notes

Pace R&A 2012.indd 43 12/03/2012 14:55 Pace plc  2011 Annual Report  |  44
2   Accounting policies (continued) 
Initial measurement
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognised amount of any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identiﬁ able assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets 
transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, and equity interests issued by the Group. 
Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based payment awards of 
the acquiree that are replaced mandatorily in the business combination. If a business combination results in the termination of 
pre-existing relationships between the Group and the acquiree, then the lower of the termination amount, as contained in the 
agreement, and the value of the off-market element is deducted from the consideration transferred and recognised in other 
expenses.
A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and 
arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The Group measures any non-controlling interest at its proportionate interest in the identiﬁ able net assets of the acquiree. 
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as ﬁ nder’ s fees, legal fees, due diligence 
fees, and other professional and consulting fees are expensed as incurred.
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of 
goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any 
asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee.
As permitted by IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRS’, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 29 May 2004 (date of transition to 
Adopted IFRS) has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment annually. The Group performs its 
annual impairment review at the cash-generating unit level.
Other intangibles
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have ﬁ nite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of other intangibles is done on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the particular asset 
categories as follows:
 Customer contracts and relationships 3-10 years
 Technology and patents 1-10 years
 Other 3 years
 
Research and development expenditure
All on-going research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred. Where a product is technically feasible, 
production and sales are intended, a market exists, and sufﬁ cient resources are available to complete the project, development 
costs are capitalised and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the product concerned 
from commercial launch. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion 
of overheads. Where these conditions are not met development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which 
it is incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The 
estimated useful lives for development expenditure are estimated to be in a range of between 6 and 18 months.
Capitalised development expenditure is not treated as a realised loss for the purpose of determining the Company’s distributable 
proﬁ ts as the costs meet the conditions required to be treated as an asset in accordance with IAS 38.
The amortisation of capitalised development expenditure is charged to the Income Statement in research and development 
expenditure within the Administrative expenses category. 
Impairment charges
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-ﬁ nancial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indeﬁ nite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the 
recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or 
its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Notes
Continued
Pace R&A 2012.indd 44 12/03/2012 14:55 45  |  Pace plc  2011 Annual Report
2   Accounting policies (continued) 
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂ ects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, CGUs to 
which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reﬂ ects the lowest level 
at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of 
CGUs that are expected to beneﬁ t from the synergies of the combination.
The Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inﬂ ows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets 
are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which 
the corporate asset is allocated. Impairment losses are recognised in proﬁ t or loss. Any impairment losses recognised in respect 
of CGUs are allocated ﬁ rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods 
are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is 
reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed 
only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Exceptional items
Items which are signiﬁ cant by virtue of their size or nature and which are considered non-recurring are classiﬁ ed as exceptional 
operating items. Such items, which include for instance the costs of opening or closing premises, costs of signiﬁ cant restructurings 
and proﬁ ts and losses made on the disposal of properties are included within the appropriate consolidated income statement 
category, albeit analysed as a separate line within that category, and are highlighted separately in the notes to the ﬁ nancial statements. 
Exceptional operating items are excluded from the proﬁ t measures used by the Board to monitor underlying performance.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the value of sales of goods and services to third party customers occurring in the period, stated exclusive of 
value added tax and net of trade discounts and rebates.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards in the product have passed to the 
customer, and substantially all of the Group’s work is completed which is usually upon delivery to the customer, or his agent.
Revenue in respect of services rendered, including engineering consultancy and support and software services, is recognised over 
the period over which they are performed, in relation to the level of work undertaken, project milestones achieved and any future 
obligations remaining.
When a single sales transaction requires the delivery of more than one product or service (multiple components), the revenue 
recognition criteria are applied to the separately identiﬁ able components. A component is considered to be separately identiﬁ able if 
the product or service delivered has standalone value to that customer and the fair value associated with the product or service can 
be measured reliably. The amount recognised as revenue for each component is the fair value of the element in relation to the fair 
value of the arrangement as a whole. This requires a degree of management judgement, and the fair value allocations are, by their 
nature, best estimates. The timing and amount of revenue recognition can vary depending on what assessments have been made. 
Where there is no separate selling price of an element management determine fair value based on equivalent available products.
The Group does not recognise revenue before delivery has occurred, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the customer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. 
The determination of whether the amount of revenue can be measured reliably or whether receivables are collectible is inherently 
judgemental.
Finance income and ﬁ nance costs
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and dividend income. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in 
proﬁ t or loss, using the effective interest method.
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and impairment losses recognised on ﬁ nancial assets. Borrowing costs that 
are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in proﬁ t or loss using 
the effective interest method.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

2   Accounting policies (continued) 
Government grants
Grants in respect of speciﬁ c research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income 
statement or against the capitalised development expenditure as appropriate to match to the project’s related expenditure.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with 
original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management system are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of 
the statement of cash ﬂ ows.
Allowance for doubtful debts
Trade receivables are assessed individually for impairment, or collectively where the receivables are not individually signiﬁ cant. Where 
necessary, provisions for doubtful debts are recorded in the income statement. 
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a ﬁ rst-in-ﬁ rst-out basis and includes 
appropriate transport and handling costs but excludes royalties due only on ultimate sale. Where necessary, provision is made for 
obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property, plant and equipment
The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.  
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the asset concerned, 
the cost of property, plant and equipment, less any estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance 
sheet date. The principal economic lives used for this purpose are:
 Long Leasehold properties Period of lease
 Short Leasehold properties Period of lease
 Plant and machinery 1-10 years
 Motor vehicles 4 years
Provision is made against the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to 
have occurred. 
Leased assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nance leases. 
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their 
expected useful lives. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding 
and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated 
to the Group’s presentational currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to

the translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation 
reserve is reclassiﬁ ed to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments
The Group uses derivative ﬁ nancial instruments, usually forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge its exposure to foreign 
exchange risks arising from operational, ﬁ nancing and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does 
not hold or issue derivative ﬁ nancial instruments for trading purposes. The directors have determined that the instruments qualify for 
cash ﬂ ow hedge accounting.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are classiﬁ ed as cash-ﬂ ow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash ﬂ ows 
that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Derivatives are reviewed quarterly for effectiveness. Where a derivative ﬁ nancial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability 
in cash ﬂ ows of a recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the 
movement in fair value of the derivative ﬁ nancial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The gain or loss on any ineffective part of the hedge is immediately recognised in the income statement within ﬁ nance income/costs. 
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a ﬁ nancial asset or liability, the associated cumulative 
gains or losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassiﬁ ed into the income statement when the transaction occurs.
Taxes
Current tax, including UK Corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing where relevant for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁ nancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax 
is measured using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled. 
A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is probable that sufﬁ cient taxable proﬁ ts will be available in the foreseeable future 
from which the reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted.
Share-based payments
The grant-date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂ ect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting 
conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards 
that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with 
non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reﬂ ect such conditions and there is no 
true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised 
as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to 
payment. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are 
recognised as personnel expenses in proﬁ t or loss.
Employee share ownership plans
The material assets, liabilities, income and costs of the Pace plc Employee Beneﬁ ts Trust are treated as being those of the 
Company. Until such time as the Company’s own shares vest unconditionally with employees, the consideration paid for the shares 
is deducted in arriving at equity.
Employee beneﬁ ts
Obligations for contributions to deﬁ ned contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as 
incurred. The Group has no deﬁ ned beneﬁ t arrangements in place.

2  Accounting policies (continued) 
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  
Dividends payable
Distributions to equity holders are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders’ equity. A liability is recorded for a 
ﬁ nal dividend when the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders, and, for an interim dividend, when the dividend is 
paid.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and it is probable that an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation.
(a) Royalties
A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated 
claims for royalties relating to the Group’s use (including past usage) of that technology. The provision is based on the latest 
information available. 
(b) Warranties
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on historical 
warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty provision 
required is reviewed on a product by product basis and provisions adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
(c) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the 
restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
(d) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected beneﬁ ts to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower 
than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
(e) Deferred consideration
A provision is recognised for deferred consideration relating to acquisitions, based on the expected fair value of the outﬂ ow.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
There are no new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the ﬁ rst time for the ﬁ nancial year beginning on or after 1 
January 2011 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group
b) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the ﬁ nancial year beginning 1 January 2011 and not 
early adopted
IAS 19, ‘Employee beneﬁ ts’ was amended in June 2011. The amendment does not impact the Group.
IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’, addresses the classiﬁ cation, measurement and recognition of ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities. 
IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classiﬁ cation and 
measurement of ﬁ nancial instruments. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the 
accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2015, subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining 
factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the parent company. The Group is yet 
to assess IFRS 10’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 10 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 
2013, subject to endorsement by the EU.

2  Accounting policies (continued) 
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities’, includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other entities, 
including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. The Group is yet to assess 
IFRS 12’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 12 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013, 
subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 13, ‘Fair Value Measurement’, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise deﬁ nition of fair value 
and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 
13’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 13 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2012, subject to 
endorsement by the EU.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the 
Group.
3  Segmental analysis
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) has been identiﬁ ed as the Board of 
Directors which reviews internal monthly management reports, budget and forecast information to evaluate the performance of the 
business and make decisions.
During the year the Group changed how it determines operating segments following the continued integration of prior year 
acquisitions. Segmental information is now provided on the basis of Strategic Business Unit (“SBU”) areas, being the basis on which 
the Group manages its worldwide interests. This assessment was made based on the current internal reporting framework and 
management structure, following the conclusion of the Strategic Review announced by the Chairman in 2011.
The Group has the following reportable segments:
• Pace Americas
• Pace Europe
• Pace Enterprise
• Unallocated
Unallocated amounts include central and unallocated revenue, costs and other immaterial SBUs, which are operating segments that 
are allowed to be aggregated under IFRS 8.
Reconciliations between Pace Americas, Pace Europe, Pace Enterprise and the geographical revenue disclosure given are not 
possible, due to the different revenue streams which sit under each reportable segment. 
Performance is measured based on segmental adjusted EBITA, as included in the internal management information which is 
reviewed by the CODM. EBITA before exceptional items is used to measure performance as management believes that such 
information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments, relative to other entities that operate within these 
industries. 
Revenues disclosed below materially represent revenues to external customers and where appropriate, pricing is determined on an 
arm’s length basis. There are no material Inter-segment transactions. 
The tables below present segmental information on the revised basis, with prior periods amended to conform to the current period 
presentation.

3  Segmental analysis (continued) 
Segment assets are based on the geographical location of the assets. The split of non-current assets by location is as follows:

 670.5 706.6
Non-current assets relate to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and, as required under IFRS 8, exclude deferred 
tax assets, ﬁ nancial instruments and post-employment beneﬁ t assets.
The Group has three main revenue streams, being STB, Gateways and Software & Services. These revenue streams arise in each 
operating segment and are not deﬁ ned by geographical locations. The following table provides an analysis of the Group’s revenue 
streams according to those classiﬁ cations.
In 2010 the majority of revenues were derived from the provision of STB, and disclosure of other revenue streams was not 
considered necessary based on their nature.
Following the acquisitions in 2010, further disclosure is now considered appropriate.

During the year, as a result of the change in the Corporation tax rate from 28% to 25%, that was substantively enacted on 5 July 
2011 and that will be effective from 1 April 2012, the relevant deferred tax balances have been re-measured. 
Deferred tax expected to reverse in the future has been measured using the effective rate that will apply for the period (25%). Further 
reductions to the Corporation tax rate have been announced. The changes, which are expected to be enacted separately each year, 
propose to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014. These changes had not been substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date and, therefore, are not recognised in these ﬁ nancial statements.

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on a proﬁ t after tax of $38.8m (2010 restated: $77.3m) divided by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue of 294,189,977 (2010: 293,700,084), excluding shares held by the Employee Beneﬁ ts

Diluted earnings per ordinary share varies from basic earnings per ordinary share due to the effect of the notional exercise of 
outstanding share options.

Goodwill
All goodwill has arisen from business combinations and relates to the following acquisitions:
• XCom Multimedia Communications SA (now Pace France SAS) in February 2001;
• The set-top box and connectivity solutions business of Royal Philips Electronics (Pace France) in April 2008;
• Bewan Systems SA (Bewan) in April 2010;
• 2Wire, Inc (2Wire) in October 2010; and
• Latens Systems Limited (Latens) in November 2010.

11  Intangible assets (continued) 
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across Cash Generating Units (CGUs) as follows:
• $101.8m within Pace Europe;
• $181.6m within Pace Americas; and
• $52.2m within Pace Enterprise.
These CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated 
goodwill is monitored for management purposes. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are 
indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined from value in use calculations using cash ﬂ ow projections based on a combination 
of individual ﬁ nancial forecasts of varying time periods, which have been approved by management, and an appropriate long term 
growth rate of 1% (2010: between 1% and 2%).
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash ﬂ ow forecasts are discounted back to present value using an appropriate market-
based discount rate. The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value in use was 9.55% (2010: between 10% and 14%). 
The Directors have reviewed the recoverable amounts of the CGUs and have also considered reasonable changes in the 
assumptions, being increases in the pre-tax discount rate of up to an additional 10%. The Directors consider that there is sufﬁ cient 
headroom within the value in use calculations at 31 December 2011. 
Adjustments to the carrying value of Goodwill made in the adjustment period have been presented as prior year adjustments and 
relate to the following:
• $3.2m reduction in respect of adjustments to the provisional fair value of deferred revenue in 2Wire;
• $6.9m reduction in respect of tax losses brought forward in 2Wire which were found to be recognisable;
• $6.9m addition in respect of an adjustment to the deferred tax calculation on other timing differences; and
• $0.4m addition in respect of Trade Receivables within Latens which were found to be unrecoverable.
Other intangibles
Other intangibles relate to trademarks and licence agreements, customer contracts and relationships recognised as part of the 
acquisition of the Pace France business.

During the year the Company converted $94.1m of debt owed by Pace Distribution (Overseas) Limited into additional equity in that 
entity. An impairment of $89.3m, which had previously been charged against the loan through the income statement, was reversed 
as the conversion meant that the impairment was no longer required.

18  Interest bearing loans and borrowings
The Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost.  For more information about the Group’s 
exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk, see note 19.
The Company has a facility underwritten by RBS and HSBC incorporating Lloyds TSB, Barclays, Santander and Yorkshire Bank in a 
syndicated deal.
The main facilities at 31 December 2011, which are all denominated in US Dollars, consist of a $225m term loan facility together 
with a $150m revolving credit facility.
The facilities have a termination date of 31 March 2014.  Amortisation of the original $300m term loan commenced on 20 June 
2011 with repayments of $37.5m made every six months until 20 December 2013.  A ﬁ nal bullet repayment of $75m is due to be 
made on 31 March 2014.

18  Interest bearing loans and borrowings (continued)
Interest is payable on the facilities at LIBOR plus a speciﬁ ed margin.  The margin is subject to a ratchet linked to overall leverage 
conditions of the Group.
Facility arrangement and associated fees of $9m were capitalised and are being amortised over the life of the facilities and included 
within the overall interest costs.
There are certain ﬁ nancial covenants with regard to the facilities.  These are principally linked to interest cover and net leverage.
In addition to the main facilities, a Bi-lateral Bonding Facility with RBS was also entered into and covers bank guarantees, principally 
in respect of Duty and Deferment requirements ($155,000).
The carrying value of the year end borrowings position is as follows.

(c) Gains and losses on currency derivatives
The majority of the Group’s production costs are denominated in US Dollars. The Group endeavours to obtain as much of its income 
as possible in US Dollars. The Group’s policy is to hedge forward progressively against movements in the value of foreign currencies, 
in respect of cash receipts and payments expected from transactions over the next 12 months.

At 31 December 2011 US Dollar GBP $101.9m 0.64 Jan 12 - Dec 12

At 31 December 2010 (restated) Euro US Dollar $239.5m 1.35 Jan 11 – Mar 12
The Group’s derivatives contracts qualify for hedge accounting and have a fair value at the balance sheet date of $4.5m (2010 
restated: $2.3m).
(d) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade debtors. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and 
duration of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit rating. The Group does not require collateral in respect of 
ﬁ nancial assets. There were no signiﬁ cant impairments in the periods under review.

19  Derivatives and other ﬁ nancial instruments (continued) 
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because counterparties are banks with high credit ratings. At each balance sheet date there 
was no signiﬁ cant concentration of credit risk, other than those customers with revenues in excess of 10% of the Group’s total 
revenues, as explained in note 3.
Of the trade receivables at 31 December 2011 94% were within terms (2010: 91%). Of the balance 4% were less than 30 days past 
due, with the remaining amounts over 30 days due (2010: 100% less than 30 days past due). There were no material bad debts 
provisions deemed necessary against such balances, in the current or preceding years.
(e) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast 
and actual cash ﬂ ows and matching the maturity proﬁ les of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk
The following are the contractual maturities of ﬁ nancial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of

It is not expected that the cash ﬂ ows included in the maturity analysis could occur signiﬁ cantly earlier, or at signiﬁ cantly different 
amounts.
The directors have considered the periods in which the cash ﬂ ows associated with derivatives that are cash ﬂ ow hedges are 
expected to occur, together with the timing of impact on proﬁ t or loss, and have determined that the timings are as disclosed in the 
above table.
(f) Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term ﬂ uctuations on the Group’s earnings. 
The Directors consider that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates during a twelve month period would have a $0.9m impact 
on cash ﬂ ows (2010 restated: $2.8m).

19  Derivatives and other ﬁ nancial instruments (continued) 
The Group’s key foreign exchange exposures are in respect of the Euro and Sterling. A 1% strengthening in the US Dollar against 
these would have an adverse impact of $0.9m on the proﬁ t reported in the year ended 31 December 2011 and an adverse impact 
of $4.4m on equity. In the year ended 31 December 2010, prior to the change in the Group’s functional and presentational currency, 
the Group’s key foreign exchange exposures were in respect of the Euro and US Dollar.
(g) Capital management
Capital risk management
The Group and Company manage their capital being the net assets base, to ensure their ability to continue as a going concern and 
to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The capital structure of the Group and Company comprises 
equity attributable to equity holders of Pace plc, consisting of issued ordinary share capital, reserves and retained earnings as 
disclosed in notes 21, 22 and 24 and cash and cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in note 18.
The Group and Company maintain or adjust their capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, issue of new 
shares and buy-back of existing shares and issuing new borrowings or repaying existing borrowings.
Note 21 to the Financial Statements provides details regarding the Company’s share capital and movements in the period. There 
were no breaches of any requirements with regard to any relevant conditions imposed by either the UKLA or the Company’s Articles 
of Association during the periods under review.
Details of the Company’s facilities are given in note 18. Such facilities are subject to certain ﬁ nancial performance covenants. There 
have been no breaches of these covenants in the period under review.
(h) Fair value
Fair value versus carrying amounts
The directors have considered the fair values of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities and have determined that these are not materially 
different from the carrying amounts shown in the Group balance sheet.
Fair value hierarchy
The Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments, namely forward exchange contracts, have been determined to represent Level 1 instruments 
(characterised by the existence of quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities). 
(i) Exchange rates
The following signiﬁ cant exchange rates applied during the year:
                      Average rate                    Spot rate
 2011 2010 2011 2010
    
Euro 1.39 1.16 1.31 1.18
US Dollar - 1.55 - 1.55
Sterling 0.62 - 0.64 -
The 2010 rates above reﬂ ect those presented in the prior year ﬁ nancial statements when the functional and presentational currency 
of the Group was Sterling.

Royalties under negotiation
The owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated claims for royalties relating to the Group’s 
use (including past usage) of that technology. Negotiations over these liabilities continue for long periods of time. The directors have 
made provision for the potential royalties payable based on the latest information available. Having taken legal advice, the Board 
considers that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought. The Group will vigorously negotiate or 
defend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which the 
potential liabilities are ﬁ nally settled.
Given the nature of the claims it is not possible to be more speciﬁ c with regard to the timing of outﬂ ows.
The directors consider that to disclose the amounts unused following the negotiation of royalty claims during the year would be 
seriously prejudicial to other royalty claims under negotiation, in litigation or dispute. Accordingly the directors have aggregated 
amounts released unused with additional provisions made in order to arrive at the net charge for the year shown above.
Other provisions
Other provisions relate to retirement and exceptional restructuring provisions within Pace Europe and deferred consideration in 
relation to the Latens acquisition.

20   Provisions (continued)
Warranties
Pace provides product warranties for its set-top boxes from the point of sale and a provision for warranties is recognised when the 
underlying products are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data, principally historical failure rates and related cost 
of repair information, and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty provision 
required is reviewed on a product by product basis and provisions adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
Although it is difﬁ cult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty 
estimate must be calculated at the outset of product shipment before ﬁ eld deployment data is available, these estimates improve 
during the lifetime of the product in the ﬁ eld.
The directors consider that to disclose the amounts unused following the settlement of warranty claims during the year would be 
seriously prejudicial to other claims under negotiation. Accordingly the directors have aggregated amounts released unused with 
additional provisions made in order to arrive at the net charge for the year shown above.
It is expected that the expenditure with regard to warranties will be incurred within ﬁ ve years of the balance sheet date.

There are no special rights or obligations attaching to the ordinary shares, and there are no shares in the Company with special 
rights with regard to control of the Company. The articles of association of the Company may be amended by special resolution of 
the Company’s shareholders.
The Company’s articles of association provide that the Company may refuse to transfer shares in the following customary 
circumstances: where the share is not a fully paid share; where the Company has a lien; where the share transfer has not been duly 
stamped with correct amount of stamp duty; where the transfer is in favour of more than four joint transferees; where the share is 
a certiﬁ ed share and is not accompanied by the relevant share certiﬁ cate(s) and such other evidence as the Board of Directors may 
reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor; or where the instrument of transfer is in respect of more than one class of 
share. These restrictions are in addition to any which are applicable to all UK listed companies imposed by law or regulation.
The notice of the Annual General Meeting speciﬁ es deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote in 
relation to resolutions to be passed at the Annual General Meeting. All proxy votes are counted and numbers for, against or withheld in 
relation to each resolution are announced at the Annual General Meeting and published on the Company’s website after the meeting.
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 16 April 2012, shareholders will be asked to renew the directors’ power to allot shares 
and buy back shares in the Company and to renew the disapplication of pre-emption rights.

21   Share capital (continued)
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
and/or on voting rights.
There are no signiﬁ cant agreements to which the Company is a party that may take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
controls following a takeover bid other than in relation to (i) employee share plans and (ii) the Company’s borrowings, which would 
become repayable on a takeover being completed.
The Company’s articles of association provide that (i) all directors must stand for election at the ﬁ rst annual general meeting after 
having been appointed to the Board and (ii) at each annual general meeting, one third of the directors who are subject to retirement 
by rotation must retire from ofﬁ ce and may seek re-election. The articles set out the procedure for determining the identity of the 
directors to retire at a particular annual general meeting.
Shares in the Company are held in the Pace plc Employee Beneﬁ t Trust (“Trust”) for the purpose of satisfying awards made under 
the Company’s employees’ share plans. The Trustees of the Trust may exercise the voting rights attaching to shares held in the Trust 
in respect of which the beneﬁ cial interest has not vested in any beneﬁ ciary provided that they are satisﬁ ed that to do so is in the

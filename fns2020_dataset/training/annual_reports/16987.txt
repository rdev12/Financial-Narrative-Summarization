The drivers of growth
The Group has a strong operating platform to drive growth 
both through organic development and value enhancing 
acquisitions. We also have a clear and focused strategy 
to build our functional capabilities and prioritise product 
innovation, collaboration and global capabilities as key 
enablers of growth in our chosen end markets, along with 
an increased commitment to research and development 
and investment in sales and engineering resources.

InnovatIve  
solutIons
Innovation is at the heart of our processes. Our global engineering 
teams work to ensure that products continually deliver longer plant 
life, extend maintenance cycles, reduce downtime and lower whole-life 
operating costs. As well as increasing our research and development 
spend, we strongly believe that innovation goes beyond technological 
aspects. Innovation is also about being proactive and creative in 
delivering operational improvement and increasing customer focus.

CollaboratIve  
MIndset
We believe we can achieve much more when we work together  
across businesses, divisions, markets and regions to solve problems 
and exploit market opportunities. Weir people are willing and able to 
work in partnership with each other, as well as with our customers and 
partners and during 2010 we further optimised our ability to operate 
to best effect across divisions and regions.

Global  
CaPabIlItY
We remain committed to going where our customers are, from the  
most challenging oil production environment, to the emerging 
power and energy markets and this commitment brings extensive 
opportunities for us to further internationalise our products and 
services. In 2010 we made considerable progress in leveraging our 
presence in some of the fastest growing emerging markets.

The Weir Group is well established in all three of our  
chosen markets: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Power & Industrial. 
Throughout 2010, we have used our superb manufacturing 
platform and resilient business model to deliver a perform-
ance that demonstrates our agility to respond quickly and 
benefit from changing market conditions. 
Customer focus is a precondition for sustainable growth. Recognising this we will 
continue to extend our position in the minerals, oil and gas and power sectors, 
all of which are high growth, long cycle markets with positive fundamentals. This 
strategy is underpinned by our three principal drivers of growth - Innovation, 
Collaboration and Global Capability - and will be delivered through organic 
growth supplemented by skillfully integrated, targeted acquisitions with continued 
investment in technology, infrastructure and people to grow our market share 
and our installed base of original equipment.

Market overview 
Market conditions improved in 2010 
underpinned by strong demand for com-
modities, particularly from emerging mar-
kets and a growing sector confidence. 
Most mothballed mines were re-started 
and increased activity was evident in the 
Canadian oil sands. Increases in capital 
expenditure were announced by some 
customers with a number of “mega-
projects” likely to get underway in 2011/12 
principally across South America and the 
Asia-Pacific region.
Weir Minerals is the global leader in the 
provision of slurry handling equipment 
and associated spare parts for abrasive 
high wear applications. Mining and min-
erals is the division’s largest sector but 
it has aligned product sales into niche 
markets, including oil sands and flue gas 
desulphurisation equipment. Products 
include pumps, hydrocyclones, valves, 
dewatering equipment and wear resistant 
linings and following the Linatex acqui-
sition – rubber products and screen-
ing machines. The partnership with KHD 
Humboldt extends the reach into high 
pressure grinding rollers, a new break-
through in milling technology.

Market overview 
The North American upstream mar-
ket experienced a substantial rebound 
in on-shore horizontal drilling with sig-
nificant investment in existing and new 
shale fields, requiring more intensive 
fracturing techniques. Average horizon-
tal rig counts increased 81% on 2009. 
International shale opportunities started 
to gain momentum in China, Europe and 
Australia. Downstream customer activity 
remained low while Middle East services 
market rebounded off 2009 lows in the 
second half.
Weir Oil & Gas designs and manufac-
tures pumps and ancillary equipment for 
the global upstream and downstream 
oil and gas markets and provides sub-
stantial aftermarket service and support. 
The upstream operation specialises in 
high-pressure well service pumps and 
related flow control equipment along 
with repairs, parts and service of pres-
sure control and upstream rotating equip-
ment. Downstream focuses on design 
and manufacture of centrifugal pumps, 
mainly for the refining industry. Principal 
operations are in North America, Europe 
and the Middle East, with an expanding 
geographic footprint in Asia Pacific and 
South America.

Market overview 
Demand for original equipment for the con-
ventional power market was strong in Asia 
but weak in Europe and North America. 
The Chinese nuclear market represented 
the majority of global nuclear new build, 
although procurement began for the first two 
new US nuclear plants in 25 years. Hydro 
and wind markets grew as demand for 
renewable power increased. Existing fossil 
and nuclear plants postponed non-essential 
maintenance, although new build delays will 
increase potential for life extension projects. 
Industrial markets remained weak.
Weir Power & Industrial designs, manufac-
tures and provides aftermarket support for 
specialist and critical-service rotating and 
flow control equipment mainly to the global 
power sector. The division includes valve 
operations; specialist pump, hydro and 
steam turbine businesses and aftermar-
ket operations in Europe, North America, 
Asia Pacific, Middle East, and South Africa. 
Three facilities hold nuclear certification 
making the business one of a few globally, 
capable of providing safety critical valves 
into the nuclear islands of the 3rd and 4th 
generation nuclear power stations. The 
BDK acquisition expanded the valve port-
folio, while American Hydro and Ynfiniti 
Engineering Services added to the renewa-
bles market position.

United States Government 02 The Weir Group PLC
I am delighted to report that 2010 was a 
highly successful and busy year for the Group 
against the background of a still uncertain 
global economic environment. We delivered 
another record financial performance and 
enter 2011 with our largest ever order book, 
a clear strategy and ambitious plans to drive 
future growth.
The results reflect the benefit of our exposure to three growing sectors 
with positive medium term fundamentals and an emerging markets bias, 
as well as a business model that focuses on the sale of original equipment 
products to provide a growing installed base for more profitable and  
resilient aftermarket sales. 
Revenues were up 18% and we are able to report an increase in Group 
pre-tax profit from continuing operations before intangibles amortisation 
of 58% to a record £294.7m with free cashflow generation of £79.9m.
We are proposing a final payment to shareholders of 21p per share,  
making 27p for the full year, an increase of 29%, reflecting the Board’s 
continuing confidence in the Group’s prospects.
Our financial performance translated into a rising share price and our entry 
into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK listed companies in September, 
as investors recognised the strength of our business model and positive  
outlook for each of our end markets.
The Group has a strong operating platform to drive growth both through 
organic development and value enhancing acquisitions. We also have a 
clear and focused strategy to build our functional capabilities and prioritise 
product innovation, collaboration and global capabilities as key enablers 
of growth in our chosen end markets. I have been pleased at the progress 
made by Keith and his team in driving these initiatives across the Group, 
most notably with an increased commitment to research and development 
and investment in sales and engineering resources. 
Structured for growth
Chairman’s statement by
Lord Smith of Kelvin
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report  03
On a less positive note, in December 2010, the Group was charged  
with, and pleaded guilty to, two charges of breaching UN sanctions in  
connection with a number of Iraq Oil for Food programme contracts 
awarded between 2000 and 2002. What happened at that time was 
wrong and as I said in 2004, when the Board first became aware of this 
matter, I am bitterly disappointed that this went on within the Weir Group. 
The Board is determined to achieve and maintain best practice in all  
areas of corporate responsibility and is committed to doing business at  
all times in an ethical manner.
Building on this commitment we have established our corporate sustaina-
bility priorities and report for the first time our carbon emissions footprint 
and revenues from low carbon sectors. During 2011 we will extend this 
and set carbon reduction targets for each business. 
I would like to acknowledge the contribution made by all employees 
to the success of the Group over what has been a very busy year. The 
heart of any business is its people and I am constantly impressed by the  
calibre of the men and women I encounter at every level of the Group. We 
are committed to providing them with a safe working environment and to 
developing their skills through a range of training programmes as well as 
attracting and retaining the best talent. I would also like to thank my fellow 
directors for their continued hard work and support. After 11 years serv-
ice, Alan Mitchelson has indicated his intention to retire from the Board 
prior to the 2012 annual general meeting.
The Group celebrates its 140th anniversary in 2011 and we are proud  
to recognise and celebrate our rich engineering heritage. From its founda-
tion in Glasgow during the Industrial Revolution, the Group is represented 
in over 70 countries and will continue to provide innovative engineering 
solutions to its chosen end markets in the years ahead. 
I am confident that the Group is well positioned to make further good 
progress in the year ahead.

Driving growth The Weir Way
Overview by Chief Executive 
Keith Cochrane
Last year I said that the Weir Group had a 
superb manufacturing platform, resilient busi-
ness model and enviable market position. 
This remains as true today as it was then and 
our performance in 2010 demonstrates our 
ability to respond quickly and benefit from 
changing market conditions.
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report  05
The Weir Group has been repositioned as a leading global engineering 
solutions provider focused on the mining, oil and gas and power markets. 
This focus together with a growing emerging market presence and  
continued commitment to operational excellence has contributed to these 
record results. We made good progress against the strategic priorities set 
last year, positioning Weir to continue to deliver above market growth. 
This success is underpinned by our people and I want to recognise the 
excellent work being done across the Group. 
I ended last year’s report pointing to an uncertain year ahead. Visibility of 
the pace and timing of a potential recovery was limited and I highlighted 
the proactive action taken in 2009 to manage the impact of the economic 
downturn, ensuring the Group had the flexibility to respond, no matter the 
demands of the economic climate. In fact, two of our three end markets 
saw a strong recovery in 2010, ahead of our expectations. The oil and gas 
shale markets in North America bounced back, benefiting from the 
increasing use of hydraulic fracturing, supplemented by a move to oil and 
liquids rich shale formations. Global mineral markets largely recovered, 
driven principally by China’s growing demand for commodities which  
in turn led to increased production volumes. In contrast, power and  
industrial markets remained subdued, with conventional generation new 
build activity in North America and Europe at low levels pending  
clarification of environmental legislation.
2010 performance
Overall order input, in constant currency, was up 39% while aftermarket 
input was up 27%. This reflected re-stocking in the first half of the year 
and increased activity levels in our main markets through the year.  
We experienced a significant pick up in original equipment orders in the  
second half as equipment utilisation levels improved and customers 
became more confident in the outlook for their end markets.
Group revenues were up 12% on a constant currency basis and the  
proportion of revenues from aftermarket sales increased to 58% (2009: 54%), 
as a result of the lower opening original equipment order book and the shorter 
cycle nature of aftermarket sales. This mix effect and a more than doubling  
of upstream Oil & Gas revenues had a positive impact on both operating  
margins and profits giving rise to a record financial performance.
We achieved some notable successes across all three divisions. In Minerals 
we saw strong progress across Asia-Pacific, Africa and South America with 
a number of significant contract awards and in Canada, we achieved  
our largest ever single contract award to supply equipment into the oil sands 
market. In upstream Oil & Gas, we gained market share in a rising North 
American market, driven by our responsiveness and the operational flexibil-
ity of the Weir Production System. Power & Industrial achieved good input 
from the nuclear market including a contract for the provision of specialist 
valves on the first US nuclear new build reactors to be built in 25 years. 
During 2010 we continued to make good 
progress against our key priorities:
•  Strong management focus on health and 
safety resulted in a 35% reduction in lost  
time accidents. 
•  Overall operating efficiency (the Weir 
Production System Lean score) continued  
to improve, this year by over five points.
•  Five value enhancing acquisitions were made 
through the year accelerating growth and 
extending our global presence. 
•  Continued investment in product research  
and development: 
• Minerals launched the next generation of  
 Warman WBH
®
 pump and developed   
 molten salt pumps for the solar market. 
• Weir SPM launched the new Destiny
™
  
 frac pump. 
• Power & Industrial developed safety valves  
 for the 4th generation nuclear reactor  
 technology and extended its renewable  
 energy offering.
•  Over £50m in capital expenditure to improve 
operating efficiency and extend the Group’s 
global presence including: 
• A new manufacturing facility in Queensland,  
 Australia. 
• New service centres in North and South  
 America, Russia, Indonesia and Africa,  
 including Weir SPM’s first centre in   
 Brasil.

We delivered another strong cash performance and generated free cashflow 
of £79.9m after investment to support the growth of the business. Our 
balance sheet has also been strengthened by the issue of long term debt 
and by the extension of our core banking facilities out to 2014. The Group 
has substantial financial headroom to support organic development and 
expand its presence across target markets.
These increased activity levels required us to invest across the Group:  
we added over 1100 employees through organic growth, research and 
development spend was increased 53% to £14.8m and we invested 
£50.9m in capital expenditure, including construction of the new Multiflo 
manufacturing facility in Queensland, Australia.
Group strategy
We will continue to extend the Group’s position in the minerals, oil and 
gas and power sectors, all of which are high growth, long cycle markets 
with positive fundamentals. This strategy is underpinned by our three  
pillars of Innovation, Collaboration and Global Capability and will be  
delivered through sustainable organic growth supplemented by skillfully 
integrated, targeted acquisitions. We will continue to invest in technology, 
infrastructure and people to grow market share and our installed base of 
original equipment. This in turn provides recurring aftermarket opportunities 
and exposure to both customers capital and operating expenditure.  
We will broaden our competitive portfolio of products and added-value 
services, with the emphasis on those products that will provide a strong 
stream of aftermarket opportunities.
Driving growth
Good progress has been made in developing our three strategic pillars, 
new product initiatives are underway in each division and the benefits of 
greater cross divisional collaboration are already evident. Over the past 
two years around 40% of our revenue has been generated from emerging 
markets and we expect to see this continue to grow in 2011.
These actions are underpinned by our ongoing focus on operational  
excellence and the development of functional initiatives. Examples include 
the full roll out of the Net Promoter Score customer survey methodology, 
increased engineering resources and the development of Group-wide IT 
and procurement strategies. We have also renewed our focus on talent 
management establishing a broad based 300-strong Senior Management 
Group, a consolidated and refreshed graduate recruitment programme 
and a new learning and development framework.
Our growth plans have also been supported by a number of complemen-
tary acquisitions and alliances which broaden our product portfolio and 
strengthen our global footprint and growth prospects, particularly in 
emerging markets. During the year, PCS (Australia), Linatex (Malaysia), 
BDK (India), American Hydro (US) and YES (Spain) joined the Group  
adding annualised revenues of £151m and operating profits of £15.5m 
and the integration of each is progressing well. We also established joint 
ventures and alliances with partners including KHD (Germany), MHI 
(Japan) and Shengli Highland (China).

Our priorities for 2011 are to continue to drive operational excellence  
and focus on our three strategic pillars for growth alongside key functional 
initiatives. We will strengthen our competitive position and grow faster 
than our markets by:
•  Continuing to drive growth through innovation and creativity with further 
investment in extending our product development capabilities. At the 
same time, we will look to take our product portfolio to new markets and 
customers as we seek to build market presence.
•  Building on growing cross divisional collaboration to extend best practice 
and sell our full portfolio of products in all markets as well as extend our 
service footprint to achieve closer customer relationships. Our recently 
established joint ventures and third party alliances extend our capabilities 
and geographic presence and provide a platform for further growth.
•  Capitalising and extending the Group’s global reach and capabilities to 
support customer needs, reinforce our global competitiveness and open 
new markets for existing products and services. 
We will complete the integration of our recent acquisitions and add 
resources where necessary to secure growth. Specifically, we will signifi-
cantly increase manufacturing and service capacity at Weir SPM’s Fort 
Worth plant with a planned investment of US$40m over 18 months and 
develop Weir BDK’s manufacturing capabilities in India. This will enable 
each business to further benefit from opportunities in their fast growing 
markets.
Outlook 
The Group is well placed to benefit from the medium term growth pros-
pects of each of our principal end markets:
•  Growing demand for minerals, oil and gas and power is being driven by 
population growth and the industrialisation of developing economies 
such as India, China and Brasil. 
•  In North America, as conventional resources are exhausted, the propor-
tion of oil and gas sourced from unconventional sources continues to 
grow with a number of other international markets now also emerging. 
•  Ageing power plants and growing environmental concerns will accelerate 
the demand for new plant or alternative forms of energy, in both the 
developed and developing world.
The Group enters 2011 in excellent financial health, with a record order 
book, a clear strategy and plans to drive future growth. We are confident 
we will deliver further good progress.
Over the medium term, the Group is well placed. It has strong positions in 
three growing sectors with positive medium term fundamentals and an 
emerging markets bias. It also has a resilient business model that focuses 
on the sale of original equipment products to provide a growing installed 
base for more profitable and resilient aftermarket sales. The Group is well 
on track to deliver on its ambition to double 2009 profits by 2014.

Innovation is at the heart of our processes at Weir. A major  
differentiator for Weir is the superiority of our materials and products 
with our Pump Technology Centre in Sydney, Australia focused 
solely on the research and development of improved materials 
and designs. Key objectives for our engineering teams globally is 
to ensure that products continually deliver longer plant life, extend 
maintenance cycles, reduce downtime and lower whole-life operat-
ing costs. During 2010, our Engineering Excellence Committee was  
re-energised with cross divisional working at its core to drive  
engineering best practice throughout the Group.
While we have increased our spend in research and development, we 
strongly believe that innovation is not restricted to the technological aspects. 
Innovation is also about being proactive and creative in delivering operational 
improvement and increasing customer focus, introducing new products to 
existing customers and taking existing products to new markets.
During 2010, Minerals Multiflo and Hazleton companies found just such  
markets with their respective specialist pumps forming part of barge pack-
ages developed by Weir Minerals Canada for the Canadian Oil Sands.
Meanwhile, Weir Minerals Lewis Pumps, already a world leader in vertical 
pumps for the sulphur chemicals industry, is now applying its expertise toward 
solar power. A historical drawback of solar power generation is the inability  
to generate electricity when the sun is not shining. One solution is to use  
molten salt which operates at up to 550°C, as a means of storing heat. 
Lewis Pumps
™
 vertical centrifugal pump technology is uniquely suited for the  
challenging application of pumping high temperature, high specific gravity 
molten salt, making them one of only a small handful of companies in the 
world capable of satisfying the high flow, high head requirements of a full 
scale solar power plant.
Along with continued capital investment in its facilities and service centres,  
Weir SPM has targeted technical differentiation as a strategic driver of growth. 
As a result, Weir SPM effectively doubled its engineering resources in 2010, 
and aligned itself strategically with the University of Strathclyde, a leading 
engineering faculty, with the intent of developing technically superior prod-
ucts to support its strong operational position in meeting the increasing 
demands of the market place. The relationship has given access to world class  
engineering talent and, combined with our increased internal resources, led to 
a number of new product initiatives currently being developed. 
The Weir Production System’s Lean methodology continues at the heart of 
our operational excellence. A new ‘pull’ system at Weir Valves & Controls UK 
saw lead time reduced by 78%, work in progress cut by 90% and an imme-
diate capacity increase of 50%. Power & Industrial Services Europe’s finance 
team has adopted Lean as operational excellence expands into support  
functions. Through a continuous improvement programme involving a series 
of small process changes, they identified annual savings of £600,000 and a 
working capital improvement of £7m.

“ Innovation is not restricted to the 
technological aspects. It is also 
about being proactive and creative in 
delivering operational improvement 
and increasing customer focus.” 10 The Weir Group PLC
At Weir we believe in developing a collaborative mindset and that we 
can achieve much more when we work together across businesses, 
divisions, markets and regions to solve problems and exploit market 
opportunities. Weir people are willing and able to work in partnership 
with each other, as well as with our customers and partners and 
during 2010 one of our aims was to further optimise our ability to 
operate to best effect across divisions and regions.
Towards the end of 2010, the Oil & Gas Forum was created with the aim  
of identifying opportunities to take products from all divisions to a wider 
customer and market base within the oil and gas sector, providing major 
potential for further organic growth within the business. 
Within this framework, Weir Floway, our Minerals speciality pumps business, 
has been working with the Oil & Gas Houston facility to bring their products 
and services to identified markets and together they are already delivering 
real benefits to maximise revenues in the upstream oil & gas sector.
Minerals has continued to develop its proven Total Care Centre offering to 
customers adding new on-site service facilities for customers in Russia and 
Africa to its already extensive global Total Care Centre footprint where  
the objective is to minimise the customer’s downtime while maximising the 
division’s share of aftermarket revenues.
In the growing wind energy market, Power & Industrial has developed a unique 
collaborative approach to windfarm support. As well as providing field and  
engineering services, Weir works closely with both windfarm owner/operators 
and turbine manufacturers to create a model that ensures the most compre-
hensive use of resources. The first contract under this model was from Alstom 
at ScottishPower Renewables’ Clachan Flats windfarm in western Scotland.
Power & Industrial strengthened its nuclear offering with a cooperation  
agreement with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). The agreement combines 
MHI’s considerable technical expertise in nuclear pumps with Weir’s  
engineered nuclear valves and aftermarket services. The initial and primary 
focus of the agreement is on the UK.
The agreement with KHD Humboldt Wedag International Ltd to make Minerals 
the exclusive worldwide agent for KHD and recommended service provider 
for their high pressure grinding rollers in minerals processing applications 
is already providing an excellent extension to our substantial offering in the  
mining mill circuit with orders received in Australia and South America.

Around 40% of the Group’s revenue comes from emerging markets 
in Asia-Pacific, South America, Middle East and Africa as the demand 
for resources continues. We have always been committed to going 
where our customers are, from the most challenging oil production 
environment, to the emerging power and energy markets of Asia 
and Africa and this commitment brings extensive opportunities for 
us to further internationalise our products and services. 
During 2010 we made considerable progress in leveraging our presence in 
some of the fastest growing emerging markets.
To capitalise on the growing investments in the rapidly expanding China shale 
gas industry, a 60% joint venture was signed with Shengli Oilfield Highland 
Petroleum Equipment Company Limited to produce Weir SPM frac and 
cement pumps. An agreement with Loftyman Engineering (HK) Ltd signed 
at the end of the year will strengthen our control valve offering with the 
introduction of eight sales offices throughout China with manufacturing and 
aftermarket support from our existing Suzhou plant. At the start of 2011 an 
assembly centre with test stand was opened in Taicang to build the GEHO
®
 
brand of pumps. This facility will also be a key element in supporting the 
already considerable installed base of GEHO pumps in China. Along with the 
Wuxi manufacturing facility from the Linatex acquisition, these developments 
add to Weir’s well established presence in China, substantially increasing our 
growth prospects in the region. 
Our existing Indian businesses saw good growth during the year and the 
opportunities in India have been extended with the acquisition of the BDK  
valves business. BDK’s range of industrial valves will also enhance our global  
customer offering of specialist valves including the nuclear products manu-
factured in the US and Europe. At the same time, BDK’s own extensive sales  
network in India and elsewhere will provide an additional route to market  
for many of our existing products.
Weir Oil & Gas also accelerated its regional expansion in the newer oil and 
gas producing areas of Australia and South East Asia during the year with the 
acquisition of PCS and in South America with the opening of its first service 
facility in Brasil, positioning the business for the expected rapid expansion of 
the oil and gas industry there.
Towards the end of 2010, the acquisition of American Hydro in Pennsylvania 
strengthened Weir’s global reach in hydro power, the largest source of  
renewable energy worldwide. American Hydro specialises in high-efficiency 
hydro-turbines and components. Combined with Weir’s existing engineering 
hydro service and rehabilitation know-how developed over many years in the 
UK and more recently in Canada, Weir American Hydro will look to develop its 
geographical presence beyond its traditional markets. The already consider-
able skills in the growing area of renewable power was further extended with 
the addition of Ynfiniti Engineering Services, based in Madrid, Spain.

Weir Minerals is the global leader in the provision of slurry handling 
equipment and associated spare parts for abrasive high wear 
applications. Mining and minerals is the division’s largest sector but 
it also has aligned product sales into several niche markets, including 
oil sands and flue gas equipment (FGD). Products include pumps, 
hydrocyclones, valves, dewatering equipment and wear resistant 
linings and, following the acquisition of Linatex in September 2010, 
rubber products and screening machines. The division’s partnership 
with KHD Humboldt signed in May 2010 extends its reach into  
high pressure grinding rollers, an exciting new breakthrough in 
milling technology. 
The division’s strong competitive position is underpinned by core 
competencies in materials technology and engineered hydraulics, 
which are naturally aligned with aggressive wear applications  
ensuring a sustainable business model with a large proportion of 
business coming from the aftermarket. This ongoing relationship 
brings the division closer to its customers, as trusted suppliers  
with the expertise to resolve issues in a number of critical applica-
tions central to determining operational success. Through these 
competencies the division’s market presence will continue to be 
extended into new applications, where a source of competitive 
advantage can be offered to customers. The division operates  
in all key mining markets with an extensive service and support foot-
print, including South America, Australia, Asia-Pacific, Africa and 
North America.
Market review 
Market conditions improved in 2010 underpinned by strong demand 
for commodities, particularly from emerging markets, with rising 
commodity prices through the year. Most mothballed mines were 
re-started to meet global ore production growth of around 10% - a 
key driver for the aftermarket business. Increased activity was also 
evident in the Canadian oil sands market where capital spend  
is mainly targeted at addressing environmental issues or improving 
production efficiencies. Increases in capital expenditure were 
announced by a number of customers driving increased project 
enquiries and engineering studies. As the year progressed and  
sector confidence grew, most previously deferred projects were  
re-activated and a number of brownfield expansions actioned trans-
lated into increased original equipment orders. The FGD market 
continued to be generally flat given a lack of new coal plant starts in 
the US and China.  17

significant increases in Africa (37%), Brasil (46%), Europe (55%), and Canada (88%).
•  Continued building long-term relationships with the major mining houses including 
receiving in principle commitments for five new major projects.
Operational performance 
The division delivered another record financial performance benefit-
ing from improving markets and a higher proportion of aftermarket 
revenues from a business model that provides exposure to both 
capital expenditure trends and commodity production volumes. 
Good progress was made in delivering on the division’s strategic 
growth initiatives of extending its market presence and product 
portfolio. The integration of Linatex is progressing well with synergy 
savings estimates increased by US$5m to US$10-US$15m by the 
end of 2012. This broad based performance continues to demon-
strate the resilience of the division’s business model.
Order input increased 26% to £984m (2009: £782m) reflecting a 
32% and 21% increase in original equipment and aftermarket orders 
respectively. Original equipment orders represented 43% of total 
order input (2009:41%). On a like-for-like basis, ignoring the impact 
of the Linatex acquisition which contributed £28m, order input was 
up 22%. All regions showed growth benefiting from a broader 
product portfolio and exposure to a wide range of commodities. 
Emerging markets accounted for 51% of input, up from 49% in 
2009. Notable slurry pump wins were achieved in the Philippines 
(nickel), Brasil (iron-ore) and Mongolia (copper) while ancillary  18 The Weir Group PLC
product orders were up 38% in the year. These included a CAD$50m 
award, for delivery in 2011, to supply barges and an integrated 
package of Weir products to a major oil sands project in Canada 
while in Chile the business was successful in extending its presence 
into the mill circuit spools market with a number of significant 
contract wins totalling US$18m. Aftermarket input benefited from a 
restocking effect in the early part of the year, higher activity levels in 
the mining and oil sands markets and growing service support 
revenues as the division extended its service footprint. 
Revenue increased by 3% to £901m (2009: £879m) including a 
£27m first contribution from Linatex. Like-for-like revenues remained 
flat reflecting a lower opening orderbook offset by strong growth in 
shorter cycle aftermarket revenues in Australia, Canada, South 
America and Africa and a pickup in the last quarter in original 
equipment sales which accounted for 39% (2009: 47%) of annual 
divisional revenue.
Operating profit increased by 24% to £174.5m (2009: £140.5m) 
and included £1.9m from Linatex offset by £8.3m of restructuring 
and acquisition costs. This strong underlying improvement reflects 
the increased aftermarket mix, improved operating efficiencies and 
raw material pricing benefits in the early part of the year.
Operating margin improved to 19.4% (2009: 16.0%) reflecting a 
higher proportion of aftermarket sales and, in the second half, the 
impact of the Linatex acquisition and associated restructuring 
costs.
Investment 
The division has continued to invest in materials and product technology as well as  
its operating facilities to meet the needs of a growing business. Capital expenditure was 
£30.2m (2009: £29.7m) with significant investment in South America and Asia while 
research and development spend rose 42% to £8.2m.
During the year, Multiflo moved to a AUD$9m purpose-built facility in Queensland, Australia, 
consolidating four sites into one. In addition to doubling capacity and the increased 
operational synergies of being in one location, the new complex was designed around 
state-of-the-art energy efficiency principles. In early 2011, an assembly centre and test 
stand for GEHO pump products was opened in Taicang, China. GEHO pumps are world 
market and technological leaders, handling a wide range of applications including long-
distance slurry pipeline transport and high density tailings disposal. The Taicang facility will 
be a key element in executing GEHO’s strategy to support the aftermarket of the already 
large installed base in China. A number of new service centres were also opened in the 
year including in Africa, Indonesia and Russia, extending the division’s emerging markets 
presence. Additional efforts are underway to expand the capabilities of our service centres 
to include servicing of KHD and Linatex products.

Weir in action 
Customer
When a new plant starts up, the last thing the 
operations team wants is equipment failure early 
on, which unfortunately happened at PanAust’s 
Phu Kham Copper-Gold Operation in Laos 
when one of the original valves became a big 
headache. After four to six months the complete 
valve needed replacing with a new one.
Brief
The site operations team at Southeast Asia’s 
leading copper and gold producer’s key asset 
had done a magnificent job working through  
the challenges of the new plant, achieving  
record production. They were determined to 
overcome the obstacle arising from the valve 
operations and carried out an in-house survey. 
They turned to Weir Minerals, trusting their long 
term experience and expertise in slurry lines.  
The PanAust team knew they would get an 
informed option. 
Solution
By taking a big picture perspective of the  
slurry line, Weir Minerals identified the problem, 
which embraced not only the original valves but 
the piping too. A trial of two different kinds of  
Weir Minerals Isogate
®
 valves seemed certain  
to lead to a far better solution, along with a  
cost-effective piping alternative. And it did. 
Result
The Isogate valves ran up 8 to 10 months without 
a hitch and maintenance only involved changing 
valve sleeves and re-installing the valve. Nick 
Opiti, PanAust’s Plant Reliability Engineer for 
Fixed Plant Maintenance said: “Expertise and 
experience is built over time and since Weir 
Minerals provided a practical solution for a real 
time issue we have maximised performance  
of the plant.” 
Phu Kham copper-gold operation in Laos
Weir Minerals continue to develop the Warman brand in the drive for a superior pump 
for heavy duty applications. By examining industry issues, leveraging the features that 
made the Warman AH pump the gold standard for a generation and modifying its design, 
the engineering team has created the Warman WBH slurry pump range with a range of 
improved features. A number of customer trials were launched in the year with positive 
feedback, confirming a material reduction in total life cycle costs through improvements in 
wear life, energy usage and flow rates. 
The acquisition of Linatex, a global provider of wear-resistant products to the mining 
and sand & aggregates industries based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was completed 
in September 2010, for a total consideration of £124.4m after taking account of net 
indebtedness acquired of £12.7m (at the exchange rate ruling at date of transaction). This 
acquisition represents an excellent opportunity for the division to grow its global capability, 
emerging market footprint and further strengthen its aftermarket presence. Linatex has a 
geographic footprint well-aligned to the division, together with an established emerging 
market base served from core manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and China. Its market 
leading rubber products are highly complementary to the existing portfolio with significant 
potential for expansion in the Canadian oil sands through newly developed Linatex product. 
This will enable the business to leverage off the division’s existing global sales network to 
grow product sales. 
Integration is progressing well with realised annualised synergy savings achieved to date 
of US$8.8m and total savings now expected to be around US$10-US$15m by the end of 
2012 against our earlier expectations of US$5-US$10m.
The division’s partnership with KHD Humboldt also brings further exciting opportunities 
to leverage the existing customer base and service infrastructure by offering customers 
innovative new technology in high pressure grinding. This break through in grinding 
technology creates the potential to significantly enhance customers’ productivity, as a 
highly efficient alternative to traditional mill set ups, whilst positioning the division for growth 
in this high potential market.
Employees remain at the heart of the business and it is their engineering and operatio-
nal skills which provide the basis of the division’s competitive advantage. The division 
recognises the importance of continuing to invest not only in technology, but also in 
strengthening the customers’ experience and the capability of employees to deliver 
this. In 2010, the Mill Circuit University was introduced for employees to learn about the 
entire minerals processing circuit. This training expands the breadth of expertise that the 
attendees possess, while also enhancing the professionalism with which the division can 
package products as solutions for customers’ process critical applications. 
Outlook
Weir Minerals is well positioned for future growth, with positive market conditions across 
the mining and oil sands markets expected to continue through 2011. Increases in capital 
expenditure have been announced by some customers which have resulted in increased 
project enquiries and engineering studies with a number of “mega-projects” likely to get 
underway in 2011/12 principally across South America and the Asia-Pacific regions. It 
is anticipated that this will translate into further original equipment order growth. A more 
modest growth in aftermarket orders is expected given the 2010 restocking effect and 
forecast commodity production volume trends. Together with a strong opening order book 
and a full year Linatex contribution, it is expected that 2011 revenue and operating profit 
will be higher than 2010 with operating margins reflecting a higher proportion of original 
equipment revenue compared to the prior year. The growing installed base provides future 
aftermarket opportunities while long term market fundamentals remain strong driven by 
urbanisation in emerging markets and high demand for raw materials. 20 The Weir Group PLC
Weir Oil & Gas designs and manufactures pumps and ancillary 
equipment for the global upstream and downstream oil and gas 
markets and provides substantial aftermarket service and support 
activities. The upstream operation specialises in the manufacture of 
high-pressure well service pumps and related flow control equipment 
along with repairs, parts and service of pressure control and 
upstream rotating equipment. The downstream business is focused 
on the design and manufacture to order of centrifugal pumps, mainly 
used in the refining industry. The division’s principal operations are 
located in North America, Europe and the Middle East, while its 
expanding geographic footprint now includes Asia-Pacific and 
South America.
Market review 
During 2010, the North American upstream market experienced a 
significant rebound in activity. A substantial increase in on-shore 
horizontal drilling was supported by a move to oil and liquid rich 
shale formations and significant additional investment into the 
development of existing and new shale fields utilising more intensive 
fracturing techniques. The average horizontal rig count, a key driver 
for the upstream pressure pumping market, increased over 80% on 
2009 with a growing proportion of onshore oil and gas production 
sourced from shale formations. A notable feature has been a 113% 
increase in oil and liquids rich shale drilling – now representing 
around 34% of the horizontal rig count - a 15 year high - reflecting 
the market’s adaptation of fracturing to enable cost effective oil and 
natural gas liquids production from shale formations across North 
America. In contrast, rigs targeted at gas production increased by 
only 18% reflecting generally weak gas prices with a flattening off in 
growth in the second half.
The globalisation of shale opportunities started to gain momentum 
in 2010 with China, Europe and Australia all signalling interest in 
developing shale opportunities in the next five years. 
As expected, customer activity in downstream markets remained 
at low levels while key Middle East services markets showed 
a rebound off 2009 lows in the second half of the year, with Iraq  
in particular presenting a number of good opportunities as significant 
investment is made in refurbishing existing oilfields to improve  
overall production levels.

Operational performance 
On the back of an excellent performance in the upstream business 
units, the division has been able to achieve a record financial 
performance. Further manufacturing and service capacity is being 
added to support current and future needs of upstream operations, 
while the restructuring of the downstream operations to reflect 
current market conditions is now underway.
Order input increased by 97% to £626m (2009: £318m). Upstream 
business units, Weir SPM and Weir Mesa, achieved input growth 
of 215% to a record £476m (US$736m), benefiting from improved 
market conditions, a move to harsher shale environments and 
market share gains. Growth accelerated in the second half driven 
by a surge in demand for original equipment as utilisation levels 
increased and customers expanded fleet capacity, placing forward 
orders for 2011 and 2012. The replacement cycle has also been 
shortened by the increasing operational intensity of longer cycle, 
higher pressure applications. Good progress was also made by the 
Middle East service operations with higher input principally due to 
opportunities arising in Iraq. These increases were partly offset by 
the downstream business, Weir Gabbioneta, which experienced a 
soft market and increased competition, causing input to fall 15% to 
£82m in 2010 (2009: £97m).

Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report
Pump assembly at Weir SPM, Fort Worth, Texas
Revenue increased 50% to £462m (2009: £308m). Upstream 
businesses achieved revenues of £303m (US$469m), up 116% on 
2009. In particular, they benefited from an ability to respond quickly 
to changing market conditions, investments in increased capacity 
and an expansion of their service centre footprint. 
Operating profit including joint ventures increased by 122% 
to £117.4m (2009: £53.0m). The positive market environment in 
upstream, along with strong operational leverage were the primary 
drivers of this record performance.
Operating margin was 25.4% in 2010 compared to 17.2% in 
2009, reflecting the operating leverage effect of higher volumes 
at the upstream business units and continued strong aftermarket  
revenues across the division.  23
Weir in action 
Customer
In late 2008 Weir SPM conducted a strate-
gic “voice of customer” frac pump survey and 
received feedback with a strong demand for a 
more durable and reliable frac pump for use in 
the harsh unconventional gas shale formations 
during multistage hydraulic fracturing processes. 
Brief
Original frac pump technologies were developed 
decades ago for applications vastly less intensive 
than those of today. Pumps were modified in 
the mid-2000’s to support the Barnett shale 
gas development in North Texas, but these 
only met the market needs for a short time. 
Multistage fracturing technologies continued to 
evolve through late 2008 into 2009 with higher 
horsepowers and pressures and caused frac 
pumps and related components to wear at rates 
faster than ever. 
Solution
Weir SPM developed a new functional frac pump 
specification and after verification by customers 
embarked on the Destiny product research and 
development project to design and deliver a new 
state-of-the-art frac pump range using the most 
modern analytical tools and materials to meet 
market demands. 
Result
In 2010, the first of the new range, the Destiny 
triplex frac pump, completed both shop and 
field testing to verify the original “voice of the 
customer” requirements outlined in late 2008. 
As customers began field testing, the Weir SPM 
Destiny frac pump demonstrated its superior 
performance. Customer response to date has 
been tremendous. Deliveries started in the last 
quarter of 2010 and a significant order book 
already exists. Research and trials continue to be 
conducted for improved life pump expendables 
with further launches of new technologies 
planned for 2011.
Investment 
Weir Oil & Gas continued to invest in support of future growth ambitions with capital 
expenditure of £17.2m (2009: £7.1m). During the year, Weir SPM added to its machining 
capacity at the Fort Worth facility and expanded its service network, including a new 
service centre in Macae, Brasil. Further investment was also made in the Houston and 
Mesa operations. In March 2010, the Australian business PCS was acquired for £3.9m 
providing a platform for growth in that market. Commitment has also been made to 
significantly increase manufacturing and service capacity at Weir SPM’s Fort Worth plant 
with a planned investment of US$40m (£26m) over 18 months. 
In November 2010, a joint venture was formed with Shengli Oilfield Highland Petroleum 
Equipment Co. Ltd. to provide high-pressure well service pumps and related flow control 
equipment to the developing shale gas industry in China. 
The joint venture is expected to commence operations in the first half of 2011. Owned 
60% by Weir and 40% by Highland and based in Dongying, Shandong Province, the joint 
venture will build on the success achieved by Weir SPM in providing specialised products 
for use in the development of shale oil and gas production in North America.
With Weir SPM’s expertise in well service pumps and flow control equipment and Highland’s 
extensive customer relationships and market knowledge, the joint venture is seen as a key 
enabler to securing business from China’s accelerating unconventional shale gas market.
A substantial investment has been also been made in product research and development. 
Engineering resources were doubled and overall spending on research and development 
increased by 65% to £4.8m. Towards the end of the year the Destiny triplex frac pump 
was launched providing a product with improved reliability, higher output and pressure 
loads to provide a longer uninterrupted service operation as required by these new shale 
applications. Further new product launches are planned for 2011. This pump has gained 
immediate acceptance, especially in Canada and will be a core product for Weir SPM in 
2011. Work also commenced in reviewing the downstream product portfolio to improve 
its cost competitiveness in the challenging market conditions.
Reflecting the growth of the business, over 500 employees joined the division with effective 
integration a key priority over the year. Management training and development initiatives 
continue to be developed across each operation in support of Group-wide plans.
Outlook
The upstream businesses enter 2011 with a record order book providing much greater 
forward visibility than in previous years. Current forecasts indicate that the average North 
American horizontal rig count will continue to grow in 2011 with a further shift towards 
oil drilling. As a result it is anticipated that 2011 upstream revenues and operating profits 
will grow ahead of previous expectations. However, given the surge in original equipment 
orders achieved in the last five months of 2010 for delivery in 2011 and 2012, a more 
normalised level of input is anticipated in 2011. Moderate growth is forecast in the 
Middle East in 2011 underpinned by improved operating conditions in Iraq. The division’s 
downstream operations will be impacted by a weaker opening order book, restructuring 
actions and an anticipated continued challenging environment for new orders. The medium 
term outlook for upstream remains positive as growth in the North American onshore oil 
and gas sector continues, operating intensity increases and interest in shale fracturing 
beyond North America develops.

Weir Power & Industrial designs, manufactures and provides after-
market support for specialist and critical-service rotating and 
flow control equipment for the global power generation, industrial  
and oil and gas sectors. The division includes the Group’s critical  
service valve operations, a specialist pump business, hydro and 
steam turbine businesses and substantial service and aftermarket  
operations with locations in Europe, Middle East, North America, 
India, China, Asia Pacific and South Africa. 
The valve portfolio was expanded during 2010 with the acquisition 
of BDK in India, while the acquisitions of American Hydro and Ynfiniti 
Engineering Services (YES) strengthen the division’s position in the 
renewables market. Three facilities have nuclear certification and the 
business is one of only a few companies globally with the capability 
to provide specialist safety critical valves into the nuclear islands  
of the 3rd and 4th generation of nuclear power stations. 
Market review 
Demand for original equipment for the conventional power market 
remained strong in Asia but was weak in Europe and North America, 
with most new coal power station projects postponed or cancelled 
due to funding issues and environmental legislation uncertainties. 
The nuclear market remained active with China continuing to repre- 
sent the majority of nuclear new build activity worldwide, although, 
in the US, procurement started for the first two new nuclear plants 
in 25 years with emerging opportunities elsewhere. The hydro and 
wind markets also continued to grow as the demand for power 
from renewable energy sources continued to increase worldwide. 
Customers postponed most non-essential maintenance of existing 
fossil and nuclear plants, although continuing new build delays  
will result in increased potential for refurbishment and life exten- 
sion projects. 
Weak market conditions continued across the industrial and 
downstream oil and gas markets, with reduced activity in the UK 
and Canada.

Operational performance 
The division has continued to focus on product innovation and 
development, expanding the supply chain and extending its product 
offering and sales route to market with a clear focus on the global 
power market and on growing oil and gas opportunities. A positive 
first contribution was made by the recent acquisitions of BDK and 
American Hydro and restructuring of the Canadian service operations 
was completed to improve market position and profitability.
Order input grew by 6% to £268m (2009: £254m), but fell 1% 
before the impact of current year acquisitions which contributed 
£18m of input in their part-year of ownership. Nuclear input at £83m 
(2009: £83m), benefited from new orders weighted to the second 
half from China, the US and Europe. However, this has been more 
than offset by the postponement of outages at a number of power 
stations in Europe and North America. In addition, poor market con-
ditions in the industrial sector have particularly affected product and

Weir strengthened its presence in the growing renewables market
service businesses in Canada and the UK. Positive input trends 
were evident at both Weir BDK and Weir American Hydro. Overall, 
the proportion of orders from the power sector increased to 61% 
(2009: 55%). 
Revenue increased by 6% to £246m (2009: £231m), growing 3% on 
a like-for-like basis. This reflects a strong opening order book, weak 
aftermarket and increased deliveries of original equipment products 
to the Chinese nuclear market. Weir American Hydro and Weir BDK 
contributed revenues of £8m in the part-year of ownership. 
Operating profit increased by £2.6m to £26.3m including a £1.0m 
contribution from the current year acquisitions and costs of £2.6m 
relating to the restructuring of the Canadian service operations and 
other integration and acquisition related costs.
Operating margin rose to 10.7% from 10.3% in 2009. This increase 
reflects positive manufacturing efficiencies, benefits from the low 
cost supply chain and the positive impact of higher margin acquisi-
tions offset by one-off costs.

Investment 
Capital investment of £3.4m (2009: £3.7m) was made in the division’s facilities to further 
improve operating efficiency and capability. During 2011, further investment is planned 
in Canada and China. A new Montreal service centre will complement the American 
Hydro acquisition and enhances its offering to the Canadian hydro power market  
while an extended Suzhou facility will enable control valves to be manufactured for the 
Chinese market.
In October 2010, the acquisition of BDK, an Indian valve manufacturer, was completed 
extending the emerging market footprint and product portfolio and providing a substantial 
low cost manufacturing capability. The division’s exposure to the fast growing renewables 
market was also increased with the acquisitions of American Hydro in the US and YES  
in Spain. Weir American Hydro manufactures turbine components which improve the  
efficiency of existing hydro-electric power generation plants and together with the existing 
service skills will accelerate development in established hydro markets. Weir YES provides 
operating and maintenance services to the growing installed base of wind turbines 
operating principally in Spain and Portugal. Further investment through the YES acquisition 
will strengthen the division’s presence in the fast-growing wind and solar markets by 
broadening its renewables offering and creating a global capability. 
Overall spending on research and development increased by 79% to £1.8m due to new 
product development initiatives aligned to target growth markets of nuclear power and 
renewable energy. The specialist pumps business in the US also invested in the develop-
ment of a range of pumps to improve its position in the municipal and industrial markets.
A number of other projects are also underway to expand routes to market and product 
offering across both the power and oil and gas markets. Sales and application engineering 
resources were increased to extend market coverage for control and safety valves 
while a new Singapore trading hub has been opened to access the wider South East  
Asia market. 
Outlook
An improved financial performance is expected in 2011 as the division benefits from a 
substantial nuclear workload, the now completed Canadian restructuring and a full year 
contribution from the 2010 acquisitions. Input trends will be impacted by the timing of 
new nuclear orders, with fewer prospects expected to come to market in 2011 before 
a pickup in 2012. Whilst the outlook for the global power markets remains positive, the  
division remains cautious as to recovery of general industrial markets. An active new build 
nuclear programme continues in China with a growing number of opportunities emerg-
ing elsewhere in the world. In addition, the lack of new build coal plants in Europe and 
North America will add impetus to other power sources, such as biomass conversions  
and new gas-fired plant. As the global push for low carbon power generation drives  
growth in renewable energy markets, this sector will become increasingly important for  
the division.
Weir in action 
Customer
Much of the global nuclear new build activity is 
focused on the so-called 3rd generation reac-
tor technology. Although no commercial 3rd 
generation reactors are currently operational, 
the development of 4th generation reactors 
is already underway. One project is the High 
Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor Pebble-Bed 
Module (HTR-PM) in China, being led by a con-
sortium of Chinese organisations to build the 
first HTR plant in Shidaowan, Rongcheng City in 
Shandong Province.
Brief
Weir’s facility in Châteauneuf-Les-Martigues, 
France, specialises in the design and manufacture 
of safety valves for nuclear applications. The 
facility was tasked with developing specifications 
for overpressure protection for the primary and 
secondary circuits of the Chinese HTR-PM 
reactor and was commissioned by main nuclear 
island contractor Chinergy to supply both primary 
safety valves and main steam safety valves. 
Solution
A team of eight from Weir have been working 
closely with engineers at Chinergy for over two 
years and designed a solution to ensure no leak-
age given the complexities of the smaller size of 
helium gas molecules and also material stress

a record performance
Finance Director’s review by
Jon Stanton
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report
A record performance in 2010 reflects our position in highly attractive 
end markets and ability to take advantage of the growth opportunities 
that they present. Positive trends in original equipment orders in the 
second half of the year built on continuing strength in aftermarket 
revenues. Our organic growth was complemented with five acqu-
isitions and our financial position remains strong following another 
year of good cash generation and the $800m re-financing of our 
committed bank facilities in September.
Order input at £1,904m was 39% higher than the prior year in 
constant currency and 36% higher on a like-for-like basis after 
adjusting for current year acquisitions. Original equipment orders 
were up 58% (54% like-for-like) reflecting significantly increased 
capital expenditure driven by demand in upstream oil and gas and 
mining markets. Aftermarket orders were up 27% (24% like-for-
like) as oil and gas and commodity production levels increased and 
represented 54% (2009: 59%) of total input. Each of the divisions 
reported higher input levels in 2010. Minerals order input increased 
26% to £984m (2009: £782m) and 22% on a like-for-like basis after 
excluding Linatex, while Oil & Gas input increased 97% to £626m  
(2009: £318m) with the like-for-like increase, excluding PCS, at 96%. 
Power & Industrial input increased 6% to £268m (2009: £254m),  
falling 1% on a like-for-like basis excluding the impact of BDK, 
American Hydro and YES.
Revenue grew by 18% from £1,390m in 2009 to £1,635m with a 
net currency benefit of £63.8m principally due to the weakening 
of sterling relative to the average Australian dollar, Canadian dollar 
and South African rand rates in the prior year. In constant currency 
terms, this represents a 12% increase in revenue, reflecting strong 
order input during the year, offset by the lower opening order 
book. Excluding the impact of current year acquisitions, like-for-
like revenues in constant currency were up 10%. Aftermarket sales 
represented 58% (2009: 54%) of revenue and due to the strength of 
our North American businesses, our exposure to emerging markets 
was 39% (2009: 43%) of revenues with stronger contributions from 
South America, Middle East and Africa offset by a decline in Asia 
Pacific mainly in non-core Weir LGE. Minerals revenues were up 3% 
to £901m (2009: £879m) with like-for-like revenue flat. Oil & Gas 
revenues increased 50% to £462m (2009: £308m) with like-for-
like revenues increasing by 49%. Power & Industrial revenues grew 
6% to £246m (2009: £231m) with like-for-like revenues increasing 
by 3%. Revenues from other Group companies fell from £36m  
to £26m.

Net finance costs
Net finance costs reduced to £15.0m (2009: 
£17.7m) due to prior year one-off costs of 
£3.7m on cancellation of floating-to-fixed 
rate interest rate swaps and reduced inter-
est rate differential benefits from our US 
dollar balance sheet hedging programme. 
Underlying interest has remained flat on 
increased levels of net debt due to the 
higher cost of fixed private placement bor-
rowings offset by reduced losses from inter-
est rate swap hedges and lower volume 
of forward currency contracts. Net inter-
est costs (excluding other finance costs / 
income) were covered 23.1 times by oper-
ating profits (2009: 12.6 times).
Profit before tax
Profit before tax from continuing operations 
before intangibles amortisation increased 
by 58% to £294.7m (2009: £187.0m). 
Reported profit before tax from continuing 
operations increased by 62% to £276.5m 
(2009: £170.4m) after intangibles amortisa-
tion of £18.2m (2009: £16.6m).
Taxation
The tax charge for the year of £82.8m 
(2009: £52.2m) on profits before tax from 
continuing operations before intangibles 
amortisation of £294.7m (2009: £187.0m) 
 
represents an underlying effective tax rate 
of 28.1% (2009: 27.9%) reflecting a higher 
proportion of US profits which are taxed at 
a higher rate. This differs from an expected 
rate of 31.0% (2009: 29.3%) as a conse-
quence of our efficient capital structure 
and the recognition of recoverable deferred 
tax assets in the year. The reported tax 
charge in respect of continuing operations 
was £77.4m (2009: £46.8m), reflecting  
the additional tax credit on intangibles 
amortisation.
Discontinued operations
In December 2010, the Group pleaded 
guilty to two charges of breaching UN sanc-
tions in connection with a number of Oil for 
Food contracts awarded between 2000 
and 2002. This resulted in a confiscation 
order of £13.9m and a fine of £3.0m. Since 
the business involved was sold in 2007, 
these costs, along with £1.7m of related 
legal and professional fees, offset by the 
release of £5.0m of provisions and accru-
als, are shown as a loss from discontinued 
operations. In 2009, a profit of £5.2m was 
recognised in respect of prior periods dis-
posals, which related to the release of an 
unutilised provision following the expiry of 
certain warranty periods. 
Earnings and dividends
Earnings per share from continuing opera-
tions before intangibles amortisation incre-
ased by 57% to 100.4p (2009: 64.1p). 
Reported earnings per share including 
intangibles amortisation, exceptional items 
and discontinued operations was 87.9p 
(2009: 61.2p) reflecting the intangibles 
amortisation of £12.8m net of tax and the 
exceptional loss on discontinued operations 
of £13.6m. The weighted average number 
of shares in issue increased to 210.6 million 
(2009: 210.3 million).
The Board is recommending a final divi-
dend of 21.0p per share, which together 
with the interim dividend of 6.0p per share 
paid on 5 November 2010, makes the total 
dividend for the year 27.0p, an increase of 
29% over last year’s total of 21.0p. This 
results in dividend cover (being the ratio of 
earnings per share from continuing oper-
ations before intangibles amortisation to  
dividend per share) of 3.7 times compared 
to 3.1 times in 2009.
Once approved, the final dividend will 
be payable on 2 June 2011 to ordinary 
shareholders whose names are on the 
Company’s register of members at close of 
business on 6 May 2011.
Operating profit from continuing operations before intangibles amortisation increased by 51% to 
£309.7m (2009: £204.7m) including a net foreign currency benefit of £8.6m. On a constant currency 
basis, operating profits increased by 45% to £309.7m (2009: £213.3m), driven by the growth in 
upstream Oil & Gas and Minerals aftermarket revenues offset by one-off restructuring and acquisition 
transaction costs of £11.0m (2009: £6.2m). 
Operating margin on the same basis increased from 14.7% to 18.9% reflecting the favourable impact 
of significant growth in aftermarket revenues and the benefit of operating leverage. On a constant 
currency basis, Minerals operating profits grew 24% to £174.5m (2009: £140.5m) giving a divisional 
operating margin of 19.4% (2009: 16.0%). Oil & Gas operating profits including joint ventures increased 
to £117.4m (2009: £53.0m) and operating margins were 25.4% compared to 17.2% for the prior 
year. Power & Industrial operating profits increased by 11% to £26.3m (2009: £23.7m), with operating 
margins of 10.7% (2009: 10.3%). The profit contribution from other Group companies was £3.5m 
(2009: £6.8m). 
Depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and investment property in the year was 
£34.3m (2009: £29.2m), giving rise to operating profits from continuing operations before depreciation 
and intangibles amortisation (“EBITDA”) of £344.0m (2009: £233.9m). 30 The Weir Group PLC
Cashflows
Cash generated from operations before 
working capital movements increased by 
45% to £342.3m (2009: £236.1m). Working 
capital performance was adversely affected 
by the unwind of the unusually high level 
of advance payments received on major 
contracts in 2009 which, together with 
underlying growth, resulted in a net work-
ing capital outflow of £67.4m compared to 
a net inflow of £66.2m in 2009. Net cash 
generated from operations reduced by 9% 
from £302.3m to £274.9m. This represents 
an EBITDA to cash conversion ratio of 80% 
(2009: 129%). Overall working capital on a 
constant currency basis and excluding cur-
rent year acquisitions is now 12.6% of rev-
enues (2009: 10.3%), debtor days have 
increased slightly from 47 to 51 and inven-
tory turns have improved from 3.6 times to 
3.7 times. 
Additional pension contributions of £9.3m 
(2009: £11.1m) were paid in the period in 
respect of agreed special contributions to 
the UK schemes.
Capital expenditure increased from £40.6m 
in 2009 to £50.9m, representing 1.5 times 
depreciation (2009: 1.4 times), reflecting an 
increase in attractive investment opportuni-
ties available across the Group. We expect 
capital expenditure to be significantly higher 
in 2011 reflecting further expansion of our 
upstream Oil & Gas facilities and invest-
ment in emerging markets. 
Settlement of derivative financial instruments 
resulted in cash outflows of £13.4m (2009: 
£16.5m). This principally represented the 
scheduled settlement of floating rate cross 
currency swaps which formed part of the 
hedge of our US dollar investment in SPM 
with the remainder of these derivatives roll-
ing-off over the next three years.
Free cashflow from continuing operations 
was £79.9m (2009: £141.1m). Combined 
with the net funding cost of acquisitions 
and disposals of £204.1m and the £18.6m 
exceptional payment made in respect of 
the Oil for Food settlement attributable to 
discontinued operations, this resulted in an 
increase in net debt from cashflows of 
£142.8m. These cashflows, taken together 
with debt acquired of £15.8m, the adverse 
impact of the translation of net overseas 
borrowings of £5.6m (2009: £18.9m) and 
other non-cash movements of £0.2m 
resulted in a year end net debt position of 
£283.6m (2009: £119.2m) reflecting a net 
debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.8 times (2009: 0.5 
times) demonstrating substantial financial 
headroom. 
Acquisitions
During 2010, the Group acquired five 
businesses for a total consideration of 
£217.5m. Total assets acquired amounted 
to £130.9m, including recognition of 
£107.2m of intangible assets, resulting in 
goodwill of £86.6m. Further information on 
these business combinations can be found 
in note 13 to the financial statements.
Treasury Management
The Group is financed through a combi-
nation of bank debt, fixed rate notes and 
equity. The capital structure is managed 
centrally with the objectives of optimising 
capital efficiency, diversifying the inves-
tor base, achieving an orderly maturity of 
funding while maintaining a good degree of 
financial headroom.
The principal financial risks faced by the 
Group are those relating to liquidity, for-
eign currency and credit risk. The Group’s 
treasury policies and procedures, which are 
reviewed and updated on a regular basis, 
seek to reduce these financial risks. Within 
this framework, the Group uses financial 
assets and liabilities including derivatives to 
hedge certain foreign exchange and inter-
est rate risks.
Funding & Liquidity
The Group’s objective is to maintain a 
balance between continuity of funding and 
flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, 
bank loans and long term fixed rate notes.
On 11 January 2010, the Group issued 
through a Private Placement to UK and US 
investors, the equivalent of US$250m of five 
year (US$110m) and eight year (US$140m) 
fixed rate notes in a combination of US 
dollars and sterling. Including the effect of 
swapping the sterling notes into US dol-
lars, the all-in average US dollar equivalent 
interest rate across these notes is 4.8%. 
The fixed rate notes further improved the 
Group’s financial flexibility by diversify-
ing our sources of finance and lengthen-
ing the maturity profile of borrowings. The 
proceeds from this placement were used 
to repay borrowings under our £625m 
bilateral facilities which were subsequently 
replaced with a new US$800m multi-cur-
rency revolving credit facility maturing in 
2014. As at 31 December 2010, £203.1m 
was drawn under the revolving credit facility 
and all covenants were met at 31 December 
2010. 
The Group also held net cash balances 
of £79.5m at 31 December 2010 (2009: 
£55.7m) representing operating balances 
held by the Group’s subsidiaries of which 
£5.4m (2009: £1.9m) was held in the UK. 
The Group has additional committed and 
uncommitted bank facilities under which 
guarantees are issued in order to support 
commercial activities.
Credit management
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attribut-
able to its trade receivables with risk spread 
over a large number of countries and cus-
tomers, with no significant concentration of 
risk. Credit worthiness checks are under-
taken before entering into contracts with 
new customers and credit limits are set as 
appropriate. Where appropriate, we will use 
trade finance instruments such as letters of 
credit and insurance to mitigate any identi-
fied risk. The Group’s exposure to the credit 
risk of financial institutions is limited by the 
adherence to counterparty limits and by 
only trading with counterparties that have a 
strong credit standing based upon ratings 
provided by the major agencies.
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s debt is denominated in a com-
bination of fixed and variable rates of inter-
est. It is our policy to maintain a proportion 
of debt at fixed rates of interest subject to 
the future outlook for the level of interest 
rates. Following the issuance of the equiv-
alent of US$250m fixed rate notes on 11 
January 2010, the proportion of fixed rate 
debt significantly increased to 44% as at 31 
December 2010 (2009: 18%). All interest 
rate swaps which had the economic effect 
of converting borrowings from floating to 
fixed rates matured in 2010.
Foreign exchange
The Group is exposed to movements in 
exchange rates for transactions undertaken 
in non-functional currencies of the operating 
companies concerned and the translation 
of foreign currency denominated net assets 
and profit and loss items.

Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report  31
All material transactional currency expo-
sures are hedged, usually by means of 
forward contracts thereby ensuring cer-
tainty over revenue and costs. Subject to 
local exchange controls, foreign exchange 
transactions are executed by the central 
treasury function. No speculative transac-
tions are undertaken. Although hedging is 
undertaken for all material exposures, only 
two subsidiary companies apply cashflow 
hedge accounting under IFRS.
The Group manages a proportion of the 
potential currency translation exposures 
from US dollar denominated net invest-
ments through a combination of US dol-
lar borrowing, forward foreign currency 
contracts and cross currency swaps. The 
weakening of sterling relative to a number 
of major currencies in the year, predomi-
nantly the US dollar and Australian dollar, 
resulted in a positive net asset translation 
effect of £39.6m, including the impact of 
the balance sheet hedging programme. 
The fair value of derivatives designated as 
net investment hedges at 31 December 
2010 was a liability of £38.8m (2009: 
£40.7m), reflecting the part settlement of 
floating rate cross currency swaps offset by 
the weakening of sterling relative to the US 
dollar during the year. These derivatives are 
due to cash settle on a broadly even annual 
basis through to 2013.
The Group does not hedge foreign cur-
rency translation exposures related to profit 
and loss items.
Further information on financial risk man-
agement objectives and policies can be 
found in note 30 to the Group financial 
statements.
Retirement benefits
The Group has five defined benefit plans  
in the UK and North America, the most sig-
nificant being in the UK.
The Group has continued to pro-actively 
manage its exposure to its pension plans. 
Reflecting equity/bond market performance 
and yield movements, the net Group deficit 
for retirement benefit obligations at the year 
end was £65.0m (2009: £71.0m deficit).
Net assets
Net assets increased by £179.3m in the year 
to £921.7m (2009: £742.4m), principally 
reflecting total net comprehensive income 
for the year of £222.9m less dividends paid 
of £46.9m.
This year we have reported return on capital 
employed (“ROCE”) for the first time, which 
at 32.4% represents an increase of eight 
percentage points over 2009.
Litigation
The Company and certain subsidiaries are 
from time to time, parties to legal proceed-
ings and claims which arise in the normal 
course of business.
There are 411 asbestos related claims in 
the US (2009: 308) outstanding against 
Group companies. There are 22 claims 
in the UK (2009: 21). All such actions are 
robustly defended.
The Company is subject to a claim relating 
to a civil action for damages arising from 
the UN Oil for Food programme which has 
been raised in the United States against 
just under 100 companies, including the 
Weir Group. This action will be robustly 
defended.
To the extent not already provided for, the 
Directors do not anticipate that the out-
come of these proceedings and claims 
either individually or in aggregate will have 
a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial position.
Critical accounting policies
The accounts have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS and the material 
accounting policies are set out on pages 
75 to 81 of this report. There have been 
no significant changes to the accounting  
policies adopted in 2009.
Applying accounting policies requires the 
use of certain judgements, assumptions 
and estimates. The most important of these 
are set out below. Further judgements, 
assumptions and estimates are set out in 
the accounts. 
Intangible assets
On the acquisition of a business it is neces-
sary to attribute fair values to any intangi-
ble assets acquired (provided they meet the 
criteria to be recognised). The fair values of 
these intangible assets are dependent on 
estimates of attributable future revenues, 
margins and cashflows, as well as appro-
priate discount rates. In addition, the allo-
cation of useful lives to acquired intangible 
assets requires the application of judge-
ment based on available information and 
management expectations at the time of 
recognition.
Impairment
IFRS requires companies to carry out 
impairment testing on any assets that show 
indications of impairment and annually 
on goodwill and intangibles that are not 
subject to amortisation. This testing involves 
exercising management judgement about 
future cashflows and other events which 
are, by their nature, uncertain.
Retirement benefits
The assumptions underlying the calculation 
of retirement benefits are important and 
based on independent advice. Changes in 
these assumptions could have a material 
impact on the measurement of the Group’s 
retirement benefit obligations.
Taxation
Uncertainties exist with respect to the inter-
pretation of complex tax regulations and 
the amount and timing of future taxable 
income. Given the wide range of interna-
tional business relationships and the long-
term nature and complexity of existing 
contractual agreements, differences arising 
between the actual results and the assump-
tions made or future changes to such 
assumptions could result in future adjust-
ments to tax income and expense already 
recorded. Provisions are established based 
on reasonable estimates for possible con-
sequences of audits by the tax authorities 
of the respective countries in which the 
Group operates. Management judgement 
is used to determine the amount of such 
provisions taking into account that differ-
ences of interpretation may arise on a wide 
variety of issues depending on the condi-
tions prevailing in the respective Group 
company’s domicile.

Principal risks  
& uncertainties
Risk is inherent in the Group’s business activities and, as a consequence of operating a comprehensive 
risk management process, the Group has identified the following principal risks and uncertainties which 
it believes could have a materially adverse effect on its business, revenues, profit, assets, liquidity, 
resources and reputation. The nature of risk is such that no list can be comprehensive and it is possible 
that other risks may arise, or that risks not currently considered material may become so in the future. 
Any forward-looking statements in the annual report or otherwise made by the Group should be 
considered in light of these risk factors. The Group operates the risk and control framework as  
described in the Corporate Governance report to identify these risks and has adopted a Sustainability 
Strategy as described in the Sustainability report to mitigate against these risks.
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Global and economic conditions
The Group operates in a number of regions where 
it may be exposed to economic, political, regula-
tory or business risks. 
The Group is also exposed to global growth  
trends and specific commodity price movements.
Any contraction in capital expenditure and 
production activity could lead to a reduction  
in demand for the Group’s products. 
Changes such as the introduction of new regu-
lations, expropriation of assets or the imposition 
of trade barriers could disrupt the Group’s busi-
ness activities or impact on the Group’s cus-
tomers, suppliers or other parties with which it  
does business.
Commodity prices for all products, and partic-
ularly for exchange-traded commodities, may  
fluctuate widely.
In some instances, this could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s financial position 
and prospects. 
The Group’s diversified geographic footprint 
mitigates against any exposure within any one 
country in which it operates.
Management monitor such risks and amend 
business procedures accordingly, while remain-
ing in compliance with local and international 
requirements.
In addition, strategic reviews are carried out by 
the Group prior to entry into a new country.
Commodity price fluctuations are monitored 
closely and action taken to mitigate against the 
risk as appropriate.   
The Group’s growing installed base plus the 
drive for operational excellence will enable  
the business to react to market changes as 
they arise.
Employees 
The future success of the Group depends on the 
skills and efforts of its employees across all of its 
businesses and the ability to retain and develop 
these individuals. 
In addition, the success of Group acquisitions will 
depend on the ability to retain management per-
sonnel of acquired companies.
If it is unable to attract and retain excellent talent, 
the Group may not be able to effectively imple-
ment its business strategies. 
The Group constantly reviews its remuneration 
packages to ensure they remain competitive 
and also maintains development and succes-
sion planning programmes.
The Group’s employee development pro-
grammes are explained in more detail on pages 
58 to 60.
Legal
Manufacturing companies are, from time to time, 
exposed to personal injury claims and class 
actions or other litigation resulting from inju-
ries sustained at work, including asbestosis or 
other health problems associated from working  
in industries that used asbestos.
The Group has insurance cover for certain claims 
but not for all the claims. The number and size 
of the claims is dependent on the number of 
third parties that are still in existence and can 
be included in such actions. Both of these can 
change over time and as a result the Group’s 
exposure can increase.
The Group has internal policies and proce-
dures for monitoring these risks, managing and 
mitigating against these liabilities and to ensure 
that there is regular reporting to the Board on 
any changes or developments.   35
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Regulatory, compliance and internal controls 
Many countries where the Group’s operations 
are located have increased their emphasis  
on enforcement of laws to which the Group is 
subject including safety, environmental, antitrust, 
fraud, anti-bribery and anti-corruption. 
A new UK Bribery Act is due to be introduced in 
the first half of 2011, with application across the 
entire Weir Group.
The Act applies not just in the UK but also to 
all subsidiaries and branches of a UK-listed 
company. 
Non-compliance with any of these laws or reg-
ulations could expose the Group to financial or 
reputational damage.
Failure by the Group’s employees, or agents 
acting on its behalf, to maintain the highest 
standards of ethics and integrity in dealing with 
customers or failure to comply with any laws 
and regulations could result in administrative, 
civil or criminal liabilities resulting in significant 
fines and penalties and/or debarment of the 
Group from government contracts for a period 
of time or affect the Group’s future operational 
performance, financial condition or reputation.
Companies must show that they have ade-
quate procedures in place to combat bribery. 
The Group has clearly set out the way it expects 
employees and stakeholders to behave in its 
Code of Conduct, which is available on the 
Group’s intranet and website. In addition, 
training is provided to all at-risk employees. 
Concerns regarding breaches in compliance 
matters or internal controls can be reported in 
confidence through the dedicated phoneline. 
Further details of the Code of Conduct are pro-
vided on pages 65 to 66. 
Environmental, safety and health
The Group’s activities require the continuous 
monitoring of environmental, safety and health 
(ESH) risks.
Failure to manage these risks could result in 
a serious deterioration of the Group’s safety 
performance or could result in an environmental 
regulatory breach which could lead to: 
• fines and penalties; 
• loss of key customers; 
•  exclusion from market sectors deemed impor-
tant for future growth; and 
• damage to reputation. 
The Group is committed to maintaining a safe 
working environment and a culture of zero 
tolerance to accidents. To support this, all our 
operations have to be ISO 14001 and OHSAS 
18001 compliant. This ensures that they not 
only meet with current requirements but also 
have the appropriate management systems 
in place to ensure continuous improvement 
in ESH performance. More detail on this and 
other environmental improvement initiatives 
and activities are set out in the Sustainability 
report on pages 52 to 66.
Competition and innovation
The Group competes against large and well 
established global companies, as well as local 
companies and low cost replicators of spare 
parts, on the basis of price, technical expertise, 
timeliness of delivery, previous installation history 
and reputation for quality and reliability. 
The developing competitive threat from low cost 
markets using total cost innovation in product 
design, supply chain and low labour costs is a 
challenge to the Group. 
The Group’s growth and success depends 
not only on its ability to innovate and ensure 
the continuous improvement of its existing 
product portfolio but its ability to develop and 
produce new and enhanced products in a cost 
effective and timely manner in accordance with  
customer demands.
All new or improved technologies and products 
involve risk, including the potential for abortive 
expenditure, reputational risk and potential cus-
tomer claims. 
In addition, the Group’s processes to bring a 
new product to market may not be fast enough 
to gain market share or the new product may not 
achieve market acceptance, thereby harming the 
Group’s reputation.
To remain competitive, the Group invests con-
tinuously in its research and development, 
manufacturing, marketing, customer service 
support and distribution networks. The Group 
also maintains the highest manufacturing and 
quality standards which include regular dia-
logue with customers to ensure that individ-
ual customer requirements are met through 
the Group’s key account management proc-
ess. It also takes appropriate action to ensure  
that its cost base remains competitive and 
margins protected through its global procure-
ment activities. 
The diversity of operations reduces the pos-
sible effect of action by a single competitor 
and combined with the application of the Weir 
Production System ensures the Group’s com-
petitive advantage is sustained. 36 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Business interruption
The loss of a significant manufacturing / oper-
ational site through fire, natural catastrophe  
or critical plant failure could potentially have a 
material impact on the Group. 
There are a number of key locations where a 
significant loss or sustained business interrup-
tion could give rise to a reduction in revenue  
and profit.
Whilst all of these operations are vulnerable to 
damage or interruption the Group maintains 
broad form insurance protection and business 
continuity plans to promote resilience in the 
business and mitigate the potential downtime. 
Acquisitions 
The Group has undertaken a number of acqui-
sitions in the recent past. With any acquisition 
there is the risk that any benefits or synergies 
may not be realised as a result of changing or 
incorrect assumptions or materially different  
market conditions. 
While the Group identifies expected synergies, 
cost savings and growth opportunities prior to 
completing any acquisition, these benefits may 
not always be achieved or be achieved within the 
anticipated timescale. Furthermore, the Group 
could find itself liable for past acts or omissions 
of the acquired business without any adequate 
right of redress. 
The Group operates a strategic planning proc-
ess to review its corporate strategy with market 
and competitive position assessments driving 
the acquisition agenda. In addition, the Group 
implements a rigorous due diligence process 
and ensures clear financial targets are in place. 
The Group implements an internal 100 day 
plan to ensure that the integration process is 
actioned with the minimum of disruption. 
Key suppliers and delivery
The Group’s ability to meet customer delivery 
schedules is dependent on a number of fac- 
tors including sufficient manufacturing capacity, 
access to raw materials, inventory control, suffi-
cient trained and equipped employees, engineer-
ing expertise and the appropriate planning and 
scheduling of the manufacturing process. Many 
of the contracts it enters into require long lead 
times and therefore contain clauses in relation to 
on-time delivery.
In addition, the Group is dependent on the con-
tinued availability and effective management of 
subcontractors and other service providers.
Failure to deliver in accordance with customer 
expectation could subject the Group to finan-
cial penalties, damage customer relationships  
and, as a result, impact on the Group’s  
financial performance.
In addition, failure of a supplier or availabil-
ity of scarce raw materials could result in the 
Group incurring additional costs in sourcing  
an alternative.
Manufacturing scheduling and planning is sub-
ject to stringent internal assurance processes 
to optimise each business unit’s order book. 
The effect of this is to maximise capacity and 
minimise reworking costs and delays in deliv-
ery times. This is complemented by the use of 
the Group’s Manufacturing Resource Planning 
systems, together with the slotting and sched-
uling achieved through the Weir Production 
System. 
The Group seeks to develop long-term 
relationships with its subcontractors and the 
Group’s procurement function is responsible 
for establishing robust supplier relationships.  
In addition, the procurement function conduct 
a regular review of strategically important 
suppliers.

Corporate governance 
report
Introduction
The Board remains committed to the principles of good govern-
ance. Using the Combined Code as a guide to the components 
of good practice, good corporate governance is an integral part 
of the Board’s stewardship obligations. The interpretation of good 
governance changes over time but the Group constantly aims  
for best practice in all matters and, by doing so, promotes the 
success of the business to the benefit of the shareholders. 
As part of the Board’s review into its effectiveness conducted 
during the period, the Board considered its composition and skills 
and concluded that it has the right experience to address and 
respond to the challenges it faces.
The Combined Code
This report explains how the Company applies the principles of 
the Financial Reporting Council Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the “Combined Code”) published in June 2008 and 
appended to the Listing Rules. The Combined Code is available 
on the Financial Reporting Council website. During the 52 weeks 
ended 31 December 2010, the Company complied with all 
provisions set out in the Combined Code. 
In May 2010, the Financial Reporting Council issued a new edition 
of the Combined Code, renamed the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “New Code”), effective from the Company’s next financial 
year, which outlines a number of changes that are designed to 
reinforce Board quality, focus on risk and improve accountability 
to shareholders. 
The Board of directors
The Board has a schedule of matters reserved to it for its decision. 
This schedule is reviewed regularly and includes approval of:
• environmental, safety and health and sustainability policies
•  annual and half-year financial results, interim management 
statements and trading updates
•  dividend policy
•  Board appointments
•  Group strategy and the annual operating budget
•  Group corporate governance policy
•  changes to the Group’s management and control structure
•  major capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals
•  treasury policies and
•  risk management strategy and the system of internal controls.
Board meetings
In the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010, the Board met nine 
times, with one meeting at Weir Minerals Netherlands in Venlo. 
The majority of meetings were held at the Company’s head office 
in Glasgow with two meetings held in London at the time of the 
Company’s annual and interim announcements. There is regular 
contact outside formal meetings between the chairman, chief 
executive and the other directors. 
The following table identifies the attendance record of individual 
directors at the nine board meetings held during 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Changes to the Board
Details of the current directors of the Company are set out on 
pages 32 to 33. Jon Stanton joined the Board on 19 April 2010 
and Professor Ian Percy retired as a director on 30 April 2010. 
Re-election of directors
The Company’s articles of association require that all directors 
appointed to the Board other than at an annual general meeting 
of the Company are required to retire at the following annual 
general meeting when they may offer themselves for election. 
In accordance with the provisions of the New Code, the Board 
has resolved that all directors will stand for re-election by the 
shareholders each year at the annual general meeting.
Details of the directors service agreements, remuneration and 
interests in share awards are set out in the Remuneration report 
on pages 44 to 51.
Board information and development
On joining the Board, directors are provided with documentation 
on the Group and its activities. New directors are provided with 
an appropriate induction programme and, where appropriate, site 
visits are arranged to major business units. Ongoing training is 
provided as necessary.

 Jon Stanton was appointed to the Board on 19 April 2010. 38 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report
All directors are provided with updates on corporate governance 
developments, legislative and regulatory changes and relevant 
industry and technical information.
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with the appropriate 
information to enable it to discharge its duties and any further 
back-up papers and information are readily available to all directors 
on request to the company secretary. The chairman ensures that 
non-executive directors are properly briefed on any issues arising 
at board meetings and non-executive directors have access to the 
chairman at any time.
Board evaluation
In line with the proposals in the New Code which provide that an 
external evaluation of the Board should be carried out at least 
once every three years, the Board instructed an external facilitator 
to conduct the evaluation in 2010. This facilitator had no other 
connection with the Company. 
The evaluation focused on the following key areas:
•  board structure, dynamics and relationships
•  board committees
•  executive and non-executive director succession
•  identification, management and reporting of risk including non 
financial risk
•  internal audit and
•  strategy.
The review concluded that there was an effective Board led by a 
strong chairman. A number of detailed recommendations will be 
followed up by the chairman. 
Any non-executive director who has served on the Board for more 
than six years is subject to a particularly rigorous review.
Board balance and independence
The Board currently comprises the chairman, chief executive, 
finance director, legal and commercial director and five non-exec-
utive directors, all of whom are independent. Michael Dearden is 
the senior independent director.
There is an agreed procedure for directors to take independent 
professional advice, where appropriate, on any matter at the 
Company’s expense. The company secretary is responsible for 
ensuring that board procedures are followed and all directors have 
direct access to the advice and services of the company secretary. 
The company secretary is also responsible for facilitating the 
induction and professional development of the board members 
and information flows within the Board, its committees and 
between the non-executive directors and senior management. 
All directors bring their own independent judgement to major mat-
ters affecting the Group. Each of the non-executive directors is 
considered by the Company to be independent. 
None of the non-executive directors has any material business 
or other relationship with the Company or its management. Each 
member of the Board has considerable experience at senior level 
in other companies, which allows for well informed and broadly 
based debate. The board structure ensures that no individual or 
group dominates the decision-making process. 
There is a division of responsibilities between the chairman, who 
is responsible for leading and running the Board and related 
matters, and the chief executive, who has executive responsibility 
for running the Group’s business and developing the appropriate 
organisational structure for a global organisation. The chief 
executive chairs the Group Executive Committee. 
The executive directors have contracts of service with one year’s 
notice, whilst non-executive directors are appointed on a rotational 
basis for periods of up to three years. The letters of appointment of 
the chairman and the non-executive directors, which are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office, set out the 
required commitment to the Company. 
Directors conflicts of interests
The statutory duties for directors relating to conflicts of interest, 
set out in the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”) came into 
force on 1 October 2008. Under the 2006 Act, a director must 
avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s 
interests. The Company has adopted a formal procedure for the 
disclosure, review, authorisation and management of directors 
conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest in accordance 
with these provisions. The procedure requires directors formally to 
notify the Board, via the company secretary, as soon as they 
become aware of any actual or potential conflict of interest with 
their duties to the Company or of any material change in existing 
or potential conflicts that may have been authorised by the Board. 
The Board continues to monitor and review potential conflicts of 
interest on a regular basis. A register is maintained of all such 
disclosures and the terms of any such authorisation.
Directors indemnities
The Company has granted indemnities to each of its directors  
in respect of all losses arising out of or in connection with the exe-
cution of their powers, duties and responsibilities as directors  
to the extent permitted by the 2006 Act and the Company’s  
articles of association. In addition, directors and officers of the 
Company and its subsidiaries and trustees of its pension schemes 
are covered by directors & officers liability insurance. 
Corporate governance

Shareholders
The Company is committed to a process of continual dialogue 
with its shareholders, including making appropriate contact with 
institutional investors and their representative bodies when there 
are specific matters to discuss. This dialogue with its institutional 
shareholders is in the form of the Group’s investor relations pro-
gramme. This includes regular update meetings and presenta-
tions with major shareholders and industry analysts. Feedback 
from these presentations, which is reported to the Board, gives 
investors an opportunity to comment on the quality of the commu-
nications they receive in their contact with the chief executive and 
finance director. Attendees at the results presentations include the 
chairman, the executive directors, the senior independent director 
and a number of the non-executive directors. The Company also 
encourages communication with private shareholders throughout 
the year and welcomes their participation at shareholder meet-
ings. In addition to the chairman’s statement at the annual gen-
eral meeting, a trading update to shareholders is given and details 
of the Company’s trading activities are on display. The direc-
tors attend the annual general meeting and the chairmen of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees are available to 
answer questions. The date of the key publications in 2011 can be 
found on the Company’s website. 
Notice of the annual general meeting is sent to shareholders at 
least 20 working days before the meeting. The Company con-
ducts the vote at the annual general meeting by electronic poll 
and the result of the votes (including proxies) is published on the 
Company’s website after the annual general meeting. Electronic 
proxy voting, details of which are included in the notice of the 
2011 annual general meeting, is available. Voting participation at 
the annual general meetings in 2008, 2009 and 2010 was 56%, 
64% and 63% respectively.
Communications
The Board considers that the annual report and financial statements 
and interim statements present a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s performance and prospects. In 
addition to information which any company is under a legal or 
regulatory requirement to publish, the Group frequently publicises 
other business developments through the specialised trade press 
and its own internal bulletins, which have wide circulation, and 
through the news section on both the divisional and Company 
websites. 
The Company’s website at www.weir.co.uk provides additional 
Company information, is regularly updated and includes the 
presentations to shareholders given at the announcements of the 
full year and interim results. The website also contains an online 
version of the notice of the annual general meeting, the annual 
report and financial statements and the interim report.
Board committees
Where appropriate, matters are delegated to board committees, 
all of which have written terms of reference which are available on 
the Company’s website. The company secretary acts as secretary 
to all these committees.

held a number of positions including marketing director, managing 
director of Britax Geco and latterly regional managing director for  
the Americas. 
In the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010, the Group Executive 
Committee met 12 times. 
The Group Executive Committee is responsible for ensuring that 
each of the Group’s businesses is managed effectively and that 
the key performance indicators of the Group, as approved by the 
Board, are achieved. 
The Committee’s role includes the preparation of the Group budget 
for approval by the Board, management of business performance 
to achieve the Group budget, establishing and maintaining 
reporting systems which provide clear and consistent information 
on all aspects of business performance, managing and minimising 
corporate risk and ensuring that the necessary mechanisms are 
in place to achieve effective inter-divisional coordination in areas 
such as purchasing, branding and career development planning. 
It also approves major items of capital expenditure within limits 
authorised by the Board. 40 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report

The Committee has the ability to call on Group employees to assist 
in its work and also has access to independent advice. 
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for 
overseeing the financial reporting and internal risk management 
control functions and for making recommendations to the Board 
in relation to the appointment of the Group’s external auditors.
The Committee is charged with responsibility to the Board for 
satisfying itself, on behalf of the Board as a whole, that the financial 
affairs of the Group are conducted with openness, integrity and 
accountability and in accordance with such existing statutory and 
regulatory provisions and codes as are applicable to the Group 
and to report on these matters to the Board. 
Its duties are to:
•   consider the appointment, resignation or dismissal of the audi-
tors and the level of audit fee
•   discuss with the auditors the nature and scope of the audit
•   review the draft interim and annual financial statements before 
submission to the Board for approval
•   discuss any problems and reservations arising from the annual 
audit and any matters the auditors may wish to raise
•   discuss with the auditors the Group’s system of internal finan-
cial controls and any recommendations for improvement

The Committee maintains a policy on the appointment and role of 
the auditors. This includes guidelines on their appointment which 
is subject to regular review and on their ongoing work to ensure 
that the independence of the Group’s auditors is not threatened, 
particularly by the provision of non-audit services. During the 
financial year, the Committee reviewed the auditors’ process for 
ensuring their independence and effectiveness and commented 
on their internal quality control procedures. The Committee is 
satisfied as to their continued independence. 
Prior approval of the Committee is required where the expected 
cost of non-audit services provided by the appointed external 
auditors is in excess of £75,000. 
The day-to-day implementation of the Committee’s policies is  
delegated to the finance director who in turn monitors each of the 
Group’s subsidiaries to ensure that all engagements fall within the 
Committee’s guidelines. Fees payable to Ernst & Young LLP in 
respect of audit and assurance services of £1.6m (2009: £1.2m) 
in respect of 2010 were approved by the Committee. 
Code of Conduct
The Weir Code of Conduct (“the Code”) was launched on the 
Global Intranet and Weir Group website at the end of December 
2010. The Code codified the Group’s commitment to doing  
business at all times in an ethical and transparent manner. It 
sets out in a practical way the behaviours and values expected 
from all Group employees and how they can raise concerns or  
ask questions. 
The Code is supported by:
•   A hotline which will be available to all employees to report  
any concerns or apparent breaches of the Code. This is a  
confidential service run by an independent provider
•   An on-line training module which will provide an introduction  
to the Code and practical scenarios that may be faced by 
employees in their day to day work. Further on-line training will 
be introduced on a regular basis
•   A mandatory training module which is required for all high risk 
employees on Anti Bribery and Corruption
•   Further training in the form of local ‘Town Hall’ meetings for 
individual business units. 
The Board and Group Executive Committee will regularly review 
performance against the Code. More information on the Code can 
be found in the Sustainability report on pages 65 to 66. 
Internal control 
In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance on internal control, 
the Board ensures that there is an ongoing process for identify-
ing, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by Group 
companies. This process has been in place throughout 2010 and 
up until the date of this report, except that it did not apply to the 
Group’s joint ventures. The directors have overall responsibil-
ity for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness. The Board delegates to executive management 
the responsibility for designing, operating and monitoring both the 
system and the maintenance of effective internal control in each of 
the businesses which comprise the Group. In addition, each oper-
ating company is responsible for the operation of key internal con-
trols and to formally assess the effectiveness of the internal control 
environment through the submission, twice yearly, of the Group 
compliance scorecard. 
An internal audit function is in place to review and challenge the 
effectiveness of key internal controls and to suggest relevant 
actions to address potential weaknesses. The internal audit review 
programme is based on a ‘risk based approach’ that helps to 
prioritise resource upon the areas of perceived greatest risk to 
the Group. This process is supplemented by a number of peer 
reviews that seek to further monitor and evaluate the process of 
internal control and share best practice around the Group. 
Internal audit and peer review reports are reviewed by the Audit 
Committee which considers and determines relevant action in 
respect of any control issues raised. 
As part of the control framework, each Group operating company 
and business prepares a Risk and Control Framework for their 
respective business. As part of this process, the operating 
companies prepare a report identifying the relative probability 
and severity of the risks identified, the process for managing and 
mitigating these risks and the means by which management might 
be assured that the processes are effective. 
These frameworks are considered and approved by the Group 
Executive Committee. 
In addition, a Group Risk and Control Framework is prepared, 
taking account of the significant risks identified by the individual 
units together with other Group-wide risks. The Group Risk and 
Control Framework is considered and adopted by the Board 
which is responsible for the risk management strategy. The system 
of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The principal risks and uncertainties identified by the Group Risk 
and Control Framework and how they are managed or mitigated 
are summarised on pages 34 to 36.
The Board has monitored the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control during the financial year. This is refined  
as necessary to meet changes in the Group’s business and  
associated risks. 
Regular performance reports are provided to the executive 
directors, the Audit Committee and the Board, as appropriate. 
Where weaknesses are identified, plans and timetables for 
addressing them are also reported.
Corporate governance
report (continued)  43
In addition to the Group Risk and Control Framework, other 
procedures which are fundamental to the Group’s system of 
internal control are as follows:
•   A clearly defined organisational structure within which individual 
responsibilities are identified and monitored
•   A Group compliance scorecard which records compliance with 
the policies and procedures
•   Policies and procedures manuals which are in place and com-
municated to all Group operating companies through the Global 
Intranet. The managing directors are responsible for ensuring 
that each company observes and implements these policies and 
procedures, which are continuously reviewed and updated
•   A comprehensive annual planning and financial reporting system 
incorporating consolidated management accounts, which com-
pares results with forecast and the previous year on a monthly 
and cumulative basis. Management information systems pro-
vide directors with relevant and timely reports that identify signif-
icant variations from approved forecasts, and revised forecasts 
for the financial year are produced four times a year.
The Group’s internal control procedures described in this section 
have not been extended to cover its interests in joint ventures. 
The Group has board representation on each of its joint venture 
companies where separate systems of internal control have  
been adopted.
Directors statement of responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, the directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union and the Company financial statements in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards and applicable law.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required 
to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently
•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent
•  state that the Group financial statements have complied with 
IFRS as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material 
departures being disclosed and explained and 
•  state for the Company financial statements whether the applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures being disclosed and explained.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
Each of the directors, as at the date of this report, confirms to the 
best of his knowledge that:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and 
•  the directors report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
Group financial statements comply with the 2006 Act and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. In forming this view, the directors have reviewed the 
Group’s budgets, plans and cash flow forecasts, including market 
downturn sensitivities. In addition, the directors have considered 
the potential impact of credit risk and liquidity risk detailed in note 
30 to the Group financial statements on pages 111 to 120. Each 
of these items has been considered in relation to the Group’s 
banking facilities described on page 30 of the Financial review. 
Audit and auditors
So far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (as defined by section 481 of the 2006 Act) of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware. 
Each of the directors has taken all of the steps that he ought to 
have taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information (as defined) and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

Remuneration 
report
Introduction
The Remuneration Committee’s main aim is to support the Group 
in its ability to attract, motivate and retain high calibre individuals 
to deliver the highest possible performance to our shareholders. 
During 2010, the Committee comprehensively reviewed the 
remuneration packages of the executive directors to ensure  
they continue to be appropriate and competitive. As a result of  
the review (details of which are set out below) and following 
consultation with the Company’s major shareholders, the ABI and 
RREV, certain changes were made to the salaries of the executive 
directors, the bonus potential of the chief executive and to the 
performance conditions for the 2011 awards to be made under 
the Group Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). 
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
The chairman of the Committee is Michael Dearden. The other 
members of the Committee who served during 2010 are Professor 
Ian Percy, up until his retirement on 30 April 2010, Lord Robertson 
and John Mogford, from 26 January 2010. The secretary to the 
Committee is Alan Mitchelson. 
Hewitt New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Corporation) 
(“HNBS”) continued to provide independent external advice in 
formulating remuneration policy and its implementation during 
2010. HNBS’s appointment was renewed by the Committee for 
the year 2011. HNBS do not undertake any other work for the 
Group other than remuneration work. In carrying out its business, 
the Committee consults with the chairman and the chief executive  
as appropriate.
No individual plays a part in the determination of their own 
remuneration.
Remuneration strategy and policy for executive directors
The Committee adopted the following policy for the remuneration 
of executive directors throughout 2010. It is intended that this 
policy will apply in 2011 and future years. 
•   The Group’s remuneration policy is to attract, motivate and 
retain executive directors with the necessary abilities to manage 
and develop the Group’s activities successfully for the benefit of 
shareholders
•   For all senior executives, the Group policy is to provide a 
significant part of their total potential reward through performance 
based incentive plans (annual bonus and long-term incentives) 
as described in this report 
•   To ensure the interests of management remain aligned with 
those of shareholders, executive directors are encouraged to 
build up a meaningful shareholding in the Company by both the 
purchase of shares and/or the retention of a proportion of their 
share awards. In addition, executive directors are obliged to 
convert part of their bonus into shares under the Group’s LTIP. 
Elements of remuneration
The following table provides a summary of the key elements of the executive directors remuneration package:
Element Objective
Performance 
period Policy
Salary To provide a competitive base sal-
ary to attract and retain talented 
leaders. 
— Reviewed annually by reference to companies of a broadly similar 
size and having regard to pay and employment conditions through-
out the Group. 
With the exception of Alan Mitchelson, executive directors are 
responsible for their own pension arrangements.
Annual bonus Bonus payments are intended to 
reflect the achievement of agreed 
business objectives and positive 
contribution to stretching the per-
formance of the Group. 
One year The Committee reviews the bonuses payable on an annual basis 
and sets the targets at the beginning of the financial year. The target 
used is normalised pre-tax profits. The maximum potential bonus 
receivable by the chief executive is 125% of salary and for the other 
executive directors is 100% of salary. In 2011, the chief executive’s 
maximum potential bonus will be increased to 150%. 
As part of the LTIP, 30% of all executive directors’ bonuses are 
deferred in the form of shares.
Long term share 
incentives
To incentivise executives to ach-
ieve superior long-term perform-
ance to align shareholder interests 
with the executives and the reten-
tion of key individuals.
Three years Vesting is based on an earnings per share growth target and the 
relative Group total shareholder return over the three year perform-
ance period.   45
Analysis of remuneration package
The following chart illustrates the proportions of the 2010 remu-
neration package for the executive directors comprising fixed and 
variable elements of pay. For 2010, it shows that 62% of executive 
directors total remuneration package was performance related.
Salary and benefits
Over the past few years, the Group’s revenue and profits have 
grown very significantly and the Group continues to grow. In addi-
tion, the Company’s share price has significantly out-performed 
the market and the Company entered the FTSE 100 in September 
2010. The Group has also become more complex and geographi-
cally diverse.
While the Committee is very conscious of the need to pay no more 
than is necessary, it considers that it is essential that remuneration 
packages are broadly competitive. It is also conscious that the 
chief executive’s salary was conservatively set on appointment on 
2 November 2009 (and not increased since) with the expectation 
that it would increase with experience.
Recognising all of the above factors, the Committee undertook 
a comprehensive review of the executive directors remunera-
tion packages, benchmarking against 20 UK-based international 
companies whose financial dimensions are broadly similar to the 
Company’s and separately, companies ranked between 76th and 
100th in the FTSE.
This exercise revealed that the chief executive’s base salary of 
£550,000 is significantly below the median of both groups and his 
fixed pay is significantly below the lower quartile (he provides his 
own pension). His total target remuneration is significantly below 
the lower quartile.
It also showed that the finance director’s salary is below the median 
of both groups and his fixed pay is below the lower quartile (he 
provides his own pension), with total target remuneration being 
below lower quartile. The legal & commercial director’s salary 
and fixed pay is at or below the lower quartile and total target 
remuneration is below the lower quartile.
As a result, the Committee has decided to increase the chief exec-
utive’s salary to £650,000 from April 2011, recognising that after 
this increase in salary (and the increased bonus potential referred 
to below) his fixed pay would be below lower quartile and total tar-
get remuneration would still remain significantly below median. The 
Committee also intends to increase his salary over two further years 
(in broadly equal steps) to the current target salary of £725,000, 
subject to individual and company performance including, in par-
ticular, the Company’s financial success and the maintenance of its 
ranking in the FTSE 100. In any event, further significant increases 
above £650,000 will only be made after prior consultation with the 
Company’s major investors, the ABI and RREV.
It is worth noting that if his salary were to rise to £725,000, then 
based on the current benchmarking, his fixed pay would remain 
below median with his total target remuneration being at or below 
median. 
The Group finance director’s salary will be increased by 8.1% 
to £400,000 and the legal & commercial director’s salary will be 
increased by 7.2% to £350,000. Both of these increases will take 
effect from 1 April 2011. After these changes, their total target 
remuneration will remain at or below lower quartile.
Executive directors also receive other benefits which are the 
provision of a car allowance, participation in a Group health 
care scheme, travel allowance, death in service insurance and 
relocation allowance, as appropriate. 
Bonus
Under the Group annual performance–related bonus, the 
payout for 2010 was based on normalised pre-tax profits and 
the maximum potential bonus receivable by the chief executive 
was 125% of salary and for the other executive directors 100% 
of salary. In the light of the very substantial increase in profits in 
2010 and the Group’s profits exceeding all bonus targets, this 
was paid out in full. To provide a more market competitive bonus, 
the maximum bonus potential in respect of the chief executive 
will be increased to 150%. The performance criteria will remain 
unchanged for 2011.
Demanding bonus targets are set by the Committee. For 2011, 
the entire vesting range will be above the result for 2010, with 
significantly more stretch above target than leeway below it. 
60% of maximum will be payable for achieving a demanding on- 
target performance. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
During 2010, the Company continued with its annual grant 
policy under the LTIP and made awards of performance shares, 
compulsory investment shares and matching shares.
Details of each award are as follows:
•   Performance shares are conditional awards to acquire free 
shares subject to Group performance (see below) and continued 
employment until the third anniversary of the award. In 2010, 
awards were made up to a maximum of 100% of salary. It is the 
Committee’s intention to make awards in 2011 of up to 100%  
of salary.
•   Executive directors are required to compulsorily defer an 
element of any Group bonus earned in exchange for which they 
are awarded investment shares. Up until 2011 the compulsory 
deferral was 25% for the chief executive and 20% for all the 
other executive directors. Following shareholder approval at the 
annual general meeting in 2010, the compulsory deferral was

30% 46 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report
increased to 30% from 2011 for all executive directors. In addition, 
executive directors are also allowed to voluntarily convert a 
further portion of their Group bonus (subject to any cap imposed 
by the Committee, until 2011 20%) into Weir Group shares. 
From 2011, the amount that the chief executive will be able to 
invest voluntarily will be increased to 25%. The cap in relation to 
the other executive directors will remain at 20%. 
•   Matching shares are conditional awards to acquire free shares, 
subject to Group performance (see below) and continued 
employment until the third anniversary of the award. In 2010, 
matching shares were awarded worth a maximum of 2.5 times 
the pre-tax value of the bonus “invested” both on a compulsory 
and voluntary basis under the LTIP. In 2011, this will be reduced to  
2 times. As a result, the overall maximum opportunity represented 
by the deferral and matching arrangement will not increase.
The awards are based on the Group’s share price, using the aver-
age published closing price for the three dealing days immediately 
preceding the date of award. 
The vesting of conditional awards of performance and matching 
shares is subject to the satisfaction of a highly demanding per-
formance condition.
During 2010, the 2007 LTIP Award vested in full as the Company’s 
TSR ranked in the upper quintile of the Comparator Group appli-
cable for the 2007 Award. 
Performance criteria
For awards made in 2010, the performance condition was 50% 
based on the growth in the Group’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) 
over a single three year performance period (three consecutive 
financial years, beginning with the year in which the award is 
made) relative to the growth in the TSR of a comparator group 
(“the 2010 Comparator Group”) and 50% based on earnings 
per share growth (adjusted to exclude intangibles amortisation 
and exceptional items). The Committee believes that a balance 
between earnings per share and TSR is appropriate and aligned 
to the Company’s long term strategic goals of driving sustained 
earnings performance and shareholder value creation.
The 2010 Comparator Group comprised:
 
 
Only if the Company’s TSR ranks in the upper quintile of the 2010 
Comparator Group will the full awards be receivable. This reduces 
on a sliding scale so that for median performance, 25% of the 
awards will be receivable. For below median performance, none 
of the awards will be receivable.
The earnings per share target for 2010 was as follows:
 % of the earnings per share portion 
Earnings per share growth  of the award which vests
 
11% per annum 100% 
4% per annum 25% 
Less than 4% per annum 0%
There is straight line vesting between each point.
Following a review of the performance condition, the Committee 
has decided to adopt a new group of peers for TSR comparison 
and to revise the earnings per share target for the awards in 2011. 
The Committee considers it would be more appropriate if a 
new, more international, group of peers was used (the “New 
Comparator Group”). Within the New Comparator Group, 40% 
are based in the UK, just over 40% are based in the US with the 
remainder being based in Europe. The market capitalisations 
of these companies range from approximately £2bn below the 
Group’s market capitalisation to approximately £3bn above. 
The New Comparator Group is set out below.
Only if the Company’s TSR ranks in the upper quintile of the New 
Comparator Group will the full awards be receivable. This reduces 
on a sliding scale so that for median performance, 25% of the 
awards will be receivable. For below median performance, none 
of the awards will be receivable.

The earnings per share target for 2011 will be as set out below:
 % of the earnings per share portion 
Earnings per share growth  of the award which vests
 
15% per annum 100% 
7% per annum 25% 
Less than 7% per annum 0%
There is straight line vesting between each point.
The Committee considers that this is a demanding range of 
targets.
The TSR calculation is performed by HNBS for the Committee at 
the time of vesting.
The Committee may, in its absolute discretion, vary, add, remove 
or alter the companies making up the New Comparator Group 
where events happen which cause the Committee to consider 
that such change is appropriate to ensure that the performance 
condition continues to represent a fair measure of performance.
Pensions
Keith Cochrane and Jon Stanton are responsible for their own 
pension arrangements.
Alan Mitchelson is an active member of the Company’s 1972 
pension and life assurance plan. The plan is a contributory defined 
benefit plan with the active members contributing 8% of salary. 
The balance of the cost of the plan is met by the Company having 
taken account of the trustee’s opinion arrived at by considering 
the funding recommendations of the plan’s independent actuary. 
The plan targets a pension of two thirds of final salary payable 
at normal retirement date, providing a member then has at least 
24 years pensionable service. Where a member has less than 24 
years pensionable service to normal retirement date their pension 
currently accrues at 1/36th of final salary per annum. 
For members, salary (both for contributions and for plan benefits) 
is subject to a plan specific earnings cap. This is currently 
£123,600. 
The plan provides for a surviving spouse’s pension of one half 
of the member’s pension (before any exchange for cash) and, in 
certain circumstances, for a dependent child’s pension until the 
child attains the age of 23 years. 
Pension built up prior to April 2006 increases in payment by the 
annual increase in the retail prices index up to a maximum of 5%. 
For pension built up after April 2006, the annual increase is limited 
to a maximum of 2.5%. Deferred pensions are revalued between 
the date of exit and normal retirement date in line with statute.
The plan provides a lump sum death benefit of five times salary for 
Alan Mitchelson.
Chairman and non-executive directors
The chairman and each of the non-executive directors have letters 
of appointment. The letters of appointment do not contain any 
contractual entitlement to a termination payment and the directors 
can be removed in accordance with the Company’s articles  
of association.
The details of the letters of appointment in relation to the non-ex-
ecutive directors who served during the year are:
Executive directors service contracts
All the executive directors who served during the year have service 
contracts with the Company that provide for a minimum period of 
notice of six months by the individual and twelve months by the 
Company. In the event that the Company terminated an executive 
director’s service contract other than in accordance with its terms, 
the Committee, when determining what compensation, if any, 
should properly be paid by the Company to the departing director, 
will give full consideration to the obligation of that director to 
mitigate any loss which he may suffer as a result of the termination 
of his contract. 
To recruit the best executives, the Committee may in the future 
agree contractual notice periods which initially exceed twelve 
months, particularly as it is often necessary for executives to 
relocate their families.

The details of the service contracts in relation to the executive 
directors who served during the year are:
Executive directors external appointments
The executive directors are permitted, with board agreement, 
to take up one non-executive appointment provided there is no 
conflict of interest and that the time spent would not impinge 
on their work for the Group. It is the Company’s policy that 
remuneration earned from such appointments may be kept by the 
individual executive director.
Remuneration of the chairman and non-executive directors
The remuneration of the chairman is agreed by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Committee. Fees for the non-executive 
directors are determined by the Board. In determining the fee levels, 
account is taken of the time commitment, scale of roles, market 
norms and comparison with companies of equivalent size based 
on information provided by HNBS. Neither the chairman nor any 
of the non-executive directors participate in any of the Company’s 
incentive plans or receive pension or other benefits, except that 
the chairman is entitled to participate in the Group health care 
scheme and an additional allowance is made available to non-
executive directors, where appropriate, to reflect the additional 
time commitment in attending intercontinental board meetings and 
operational visits. The chairman and the non-executive directors 
are not involved in any discussions or decisions about their  
own remuneration. 
The non-executive directors fees and chairman’s remuneration 
are reviewed annually by the Board. With effect from 1 April 2011, 
the chairman’s remuneration will be increased from £182,500 to 
a market rate of £250,000 and the basic fee for each of the non-
executive directors will be increased from £45,000 to £50,000. 
The additional fees paid to the deputy chairman and the chairmen 
of the Audit and Remuneration Committees will be increased from 
£7,500 to £10,000. The fee paid to Michael Dearden in respect of his 
role as senior non-executive director will be increased from £2,500  
to £5,000.
Total shareholder return
The graph below illustrates the performance of the Company 
against the FTSE 350 Industrial Engineering Sector Index, the 
FTSE 100 Index and the 2010 Comparator Group used in the 
LTIP. The Board has reported against three measures this year 
but in future years will measure the Group’s performance against 
the FTSE 100 Share Index and the New Comparator Group for 
the LTIP only, as they represent a more appropriate and fair 
benchmark upon which to measure the Group’s performance for  
this purpose.

Notes
1. The figures shown are maximum entitlements and the actual number of shares (if any) which vest will depend on the performance conditions being achieved as set out on pages 46 to 47.
2. Awards under the LTIP take the form of nil cost options and have no performance retesting facility.
3.  Awards under the LTIP can be exercised after the third anniversary of the award date, subject to the performance conditions. No expiry date is shown if the award was exercised or lapsed in the  
52 weeks ended 31 December 2010. 
4.  On 12 March 2010, the 2007 awards under the LTIP vested in full. As a result Keith Cochrane and Alan Mitchelson exercised their awards as set out above, selling 25,392 and 17,432 shares respectively 
to pay the relevant tax and national insurance and retaining the balance. The aggregate gains made on all award exercises by directors during the financial year totalled £961,474 (2009: £1,506,154).
5. The closing market price of the Company’s shares at 31 December 2010 was 1780p and the range for the year was 717.5p to 1861p.
6.  For awards made prior to 2010, the performance condition was based on the growth in the Group’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) over a single three year performance period (three consecutive financial 
years, beginning with the year in which the award is made) relative to the growth in the TSR of a comparator group (“the Comparator Group”). For the outstanding awards in 2008, 2009 and 2010 the 
Comparator Group comprises AGA Rangemaster Group, Bodycote, Cookson Group, Halma, IMI, Meggitt, Mitie Group, Morgan Crucible Company, Rolls-Royce, Rotork, Senior, Smiths Group, Spirax-
Sarco Engineering, Tomkins, Wood Group and WS Atkins. In addition to TSR performance, for any of the performance and matching share awards to vest, the growth in the Company’s earnings per 
share over the performance period must be equal to or greater than the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period.
Remuneration
report (continued)  51
Directors pension benefits
#
Alan Mitchelson was a member of a defined benefit scheme provided by the Group during the year 2010. Keith Cochrane and Jon 
Stanton are responsible for their own pension provision. Pension entitlement and the corresponding transfer values were as follows dur-
ing the year:
Notes
1. The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, prior to any cash commutation, based on pensionable service to the end of the financial period.
2.  With effect from 1 October 2008, Government legislation requires the trustees (having taken actuarial advice) to take responsibility for setting the assumptions underlying the calculation of voluntary 
transfer values to be paid from the plan. Prior to this date the scheme actuary had this responsibility. Consequently, the transfer value of the accrued pension at the period end has been calculated in 
accordance with this revised requirement.
3.  The change in the amount of the transfer value over the period is made up of the following elements: 
a. transfer value of the increase in accrued pension  
b. increase in the transfer value of accrued pension at period start due to ageing 
c. impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis – as referred to in note 2 above 
d. less the director’s ordinary contributions
4.  The change in the amount of the transfer value over the period includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Group and directors, such as stockmarket 
movements. The inflation measure for leavers during 2010 with at least one year to their normal retirement date was 3.1%. Consequently, the rate of inflation assumed in the above figures is 3.1%.
5. Directors have the option to pay voluntary contributions. Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
6.  The figures allow for the impact of the plan specific earnings cap and Alan Mitchelson's restricted salary for pension accrued from April 2010. Alan Mitchelson does not have an entitlement to an excepted 
(formerly known as unapproved) pension from the Group.
7. Payment of actual transfer values (from the defined benefit scheme of which Alan Mitchelson is a member) are not currently reduced below 100% of their full value.
8. The figures allow for the impact of inflation in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.

Sustainability 
is a key part 
of the Group’s 
strategy and is 
embedded in 
our approach 
to business 
through six  
key areas.
1: Environment
2: Health & Safety
3: Employees
4: Communities
5: Products and technology
6: Ethics  53
Environment
Reducing our impact on the environment has been a 
focus in each of our operating companies for some 
time – our facilities are ISO 14001 compliant and 
have individually made significant progress. For the 
first time in 2010, we report our greenhouse gas 
emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol scope 1 and 2 and the progress we are 
making is evident from those results. Our objective is 
now to set improvement targets on a company basis 
to drive further sustained improvement.
Health & safety
The health and safety of our employees continues to 
be a priority for the Group with strong processes in 
place to ensure the zero tolerance culture is enforced. 
This is evident from our lost time accident statistics 
which have again improved year on year. We are 
now looking to further improve communication of 
health issues and to focus more on health and well-
being activities in order to improve our employee 
engagement and performance. In addition, the 
development of health and safety processes in our 
supply chain which are less well developed and 
consistently applied will be enhanced. 
Employees
Our employees are critical to the continued success 
of the Group. Increased investment in employee 
development programmes within the Group, in 
particular the Weir Graduate Development Framework 
and improved communication through the creation  
of the Senior Management Group, will support the 
Group in its goal of driving innovation, collaboration 
and global capability whilst also improving  
employee retention.
Communities
Weir is a global company doing business in more 
than 70 countries and the impact we have on the 
local communities and economies is therefore of par-
amount importance to the Group. We respect the 
communities we operate in and we strive to make a 
positive impact by the responsible running of our 
operations and by investing in the communities in  
a way that benefits both the local community  
and Weir. 
Products and technology
Many of the Group’s products and services are used 
in low carbon applications such as nuclear power 
generation, hydro power generation, wind power 
generation and flue gas desulphurisation. We aim to 
expand the range of products supplied to such 
applications over time. In addition, through our 
Engineering Excellence Committee we are continually 
looking to enhance the energy efficiency of our 
products both through their manufacturing process 
and operation.
Ethics
Investors, customers and employees are increasingly 
focusing on environmental, social and governance 
matters in their decision-making. The Weir Group’s 
sustainability strategy will enable it to demonstrate 
good performance in these areas which will enhance 
the Group’s reputation amongst key stakeholders. 
The Group Code of Conduct, anti-bribery and corru-
ption training and ethics hotline ensure that the 
Group’s zero tolerance to any contravention of policy 
is upheld.
What does  
this mean?
The strategy for each of 
these areas is set by the 
Board and responsibility 
for implementation rests 
with the Group Executive 
Committee. Co-ordination 
and monitoring of 
performance is managed 
through the newly 
created Corporate 
Sustainability Steering 
Committee which is led 
by the Group Legal and 
Commercial Director 
with specialist 
representation from 
across the Group in 
each of the six  
key areas. 54 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report
We aim to continually improve our environmental 
performance in all our operations and through time 
enhance the energy efficiency of our products.
Whilst the Board is responsible for setting the 
Group’s environmental policy, its implementation is 
the responsibility of the Group Executive Committee. 
Monitoring of performance is managed through the 
Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee.
Our environmental impacts including greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions; material and solvent usage; 
waste products and emissions to atmosphere are 
identified and managed through our Environmental 
Management System (EMS) which are certified to ISO 
14001 standard. We monitor upcoming legislation 
and share best practice across our operations.
ISO 14001
The Group’s policy is that all its operations will be 
ISO 14001 accredited or, in the case of new acquisi-
tions, a plan is put in place to achieve accreditation. 
ISO 14001 is an internationally recognised specifica-
tion for an effective structured environmental man-
agement system which helps organisations achieve 
environmental and economic goals as well as assist-
ing in the implementation of environmental policy. 
An ISO 14001 accredited environmental manage-
ment system provides our customers, employees 
and shareholders with the assurance that our envi-
ronmental performance meets and will continue to 
meet legal and environmental policy requirements. 
Through the Group Environmental, Safety and Health 
Forums, all new businesses are brought into line with 
best practice in the implementation of ISO 14001. In 
addition, the Forums are a useful arena to allow local 
and international environmental legislative develop-
ments to be monitored before they become law. This 
proactive approach allows us to conform with future 
environmental legislation before laws are passed by 
voluntarily taking action on specific issues.
Environmental improvements
As part of the Group’s commitment to continual 
improvement, during 2010 the Minerals Division 
established an Environmental Improvement Team 
whose objective is to share best practice in environ-
mental management. The team aims to implement 
and maintain three active environmental improve-
ment projects at each participating site, adding new 
projects as each is completed. The regions repre-
sented by the team are Europe, North America, 
South America, Australia, Africa and China.
Initiatives to improve the environmental perform-
ance of our operations include energy and water effi-
ciency, raw material efficiency, waste minimisation 
and resource recovery projects. 
Improvement is focused on the areas that have the 
most environmental and financial impact.
Carbon footprint
During 2010 the Group decided to establish a cor-
porate greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory to facilitate 
consistent Group-wide reporting on the GHG impli-
cations of its global business activities. The GHG 
inventory was developed to cover all material GHG 
emissions under the Group’s direct control during 
the years 2009 and 2010. The primary focus of the 
GHG inventory was the collection of data in respect 
of our global energy use and emissions to atmos-
phere in accordance with scope 1 and 2 of the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 
The Group has engaged an independent consultant 
to assist in the calculation of our 2009 and 2010 
global carbon footprint and help standardise and 
improve our data collection methods. The results are 
set out below:

Our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associ-
ated with our foundry, manufacturing and assem-
bly operations show an upward trend in absolute 
terms but when normalised by turnover the Group’s 
GHG emissions are marginally down between 2009  
and 2010.
We will look to implement formal improvement  
targets across all our companies in 2011.

Team the five foundries have been working on a 
number of environmental initiatives to improve the 
reuse and recycling at their sites. Just under 20,000 
tonnes of metal have been recycled in our foundry 
operations in 2010. To put it in context this means 
that on average 75% of the metal poured at our 
foundries is recycled metal. The results of the foundry 
recycling can be seen in the following graph.

Carbon reduction commitment (CRC) energy 
efficiency scheme (the “CRC”)
The CRC is a UK emissions trading scheme (ETS) 
with the aim of cost-effectively reducing emissions 
in the service, public and other less energy-intensive 
sectors by 1.2m tonnes by 2020. The CRC will be 
a mandatory emissions trading scheme, targeting 
large organisations whose emissions are currently 
not included in the ETS or Climate Change 
Agreements of the European Union. Registration of 
the qualifying sites within the Group’s UK operations 
was completed, as scheduled, during 2010. The 
UK businesses affected by the CRC will be required 
to monitor their energy use and buy allowances 
accordingly in forthcoming years as the scheme  
rolls out. 
Recycling/reuse initiatives
Weir Minerals Peru, Lima
Our business in Lima, Peru has several initiatives 
involving local charities:
•  In the last fours years the paper recycled from 
the site paid for two scholarships for disabled 
children.
•  The company donates its wood to a local char-
ity which builds children’s furniture and in this way 
recycled 8.5 tonnes of wood in 2010.
Weir Floway, Fresno, USA
Weir Floway decided in 2010 that it could improve its 
environmental impact by installing a new self-circulat-
ing hydro station at its on-site machine shop instead 
of using the test laboratory several miles away from 
the site. The result is that the company now saves 
c.10,000 gallons of water per annum by re-using the 
test water coupled with a saving on the cost and envi-
ronmental impact of transporting parts to and from the 
test laboratory.
Weir Minerals Europe, Todmorden, UK
Our Todmorden facility has developed a new system 
whereby 95% of coolant water is re-used. This 
enables the site to re-use 20,000 litres of water 
per annum, with only 1,000 litres of oil now being 
disposed of as special waste.
Weir Minerals Australia, Sydney
During 2010, Weir Minerals Australia has had several 
waste reduction projects including:
•  Within its foundry, it has reduced the tonnage of 
used foundry sand per tonne cast sent to landfill 
by 25%.
•  In 2010 the recycling of timber at the site diverted 
430 tonnes from landfill to chipping into landscape 
mulch.
Weir Power & Industrial, Fort St. John, Canada
During 2010, the site changed its shop lighting from 
metal halide lights to T5 florescent lighting balancing 
the safety needs of the shop floor with the energy 
saving. This equates to a 43% energy use saving 
per annum.

2: Health & Safety
Managing safety
Maintaining a consistently safe and healthy work-
place for our people requires effective, proac-
tive management. We operate a global network of 
Environmental, Safety and Health Forums that share 
knowledge and experience between plants with the 
aim of ensuring consistently high standards of safety 
across the Group and eliminating work-related inju-
ries, preventing pollution, conserving resources, 
complying with regulatory requirements and improv-
ing performance.
The Group is committed to an accident-free health 
and safety environment based on the belief that  
all accidents are preventable. The Group Executive 
Committee drives this commitment through opera-
tions globally.
The Group’s policy is that all its operations will be 
OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety 
Assessment Series) accredited. OHSAS 18001 was 
developed by the British Standards Institute as a 
health and safety management framework allowing 
organisations to ensure that they are consistently 
and accurately identifying hazards and risks within 
their operations. Providing a platform for eliminat-
ing and managing these identified risks, the system 
supports the organisation to continually improve its 
products, people and processes.
OHSAS 18001 offers a proactive approach to reduc-
ing accidents, near misses and other incidents year 
on year. 
Our existing businesses have achieved accredita-
tion and all new acquisitions have detailed plans to 
achieve OHSAS 18001 within an agreed timescale.
Each business records all near misses and inju-
ries within their operations and these are analysed 
on a continuous basis to reduce the number of lost 
time accidents through improvement of the working 
environment. 
The Group’s policy on health and safety requires 
that all companies take a proactive attitude to the 
protection of their employees health and safety. 
All companies carefully evaluate risks to personnel 
wherever they are working and take appropriate 
steps to minimise such risks. These include 
ensuring that project design engineers consider 
design factors that minimise or eliminate the risk of 
accidents to personnel during site installation and 
commissioning. All Group companies are requ- 
ired to comply with local legislation governing 
health and safety at work and to conduct regular 
formal health and safety reviews at plant and site 
level. These reviews are undertaken by nominated 
managers and employees to ensure that risks are 
properly evaluated, events leading to accidents are 
examined and appropriate remedial or avoidance 
action initiated and subsequently monitored. Formal 
reporting procedures have been implemented so 
that the safety performance of individual companies 
is monitored and peer-to-peer audits are conducted 
in order to provide a critical assessment of each 
company’s performance. 
The increased focus on this important issue includes 
full investigations of all accidents with follow up 
reports to the Group Executive Committee on a 
monthly basis.
Safestart
The Group has adopted a behavioural system 
known as SAFESTART which has been rolled out 
to all operations and all new employees are given 
this training as part of their induction. The Group is 
committed to maintain the profile of this programme 
across all companies as the key to its success is 
the involvement and understanding at all levels of  
the organisation. 
The core elements of our approach to safety are:
—  emphasis on the importance of behaviour by encouraging 
a culture of safety at all locations
—  improving communications and sharing best practice 
throughout the Group
—  the active involvement of senior executives in  
promoting safety 
—  the auditing of safety and loss control programmes  57
Weir Minerals Africa
Weir Minerals Africa found that their initial attempts 
at SAFESTART implementation had been slow to 
embed. The company introduced a visual and per-
sonal format with a character and style that was 
more in line with situations and environments that 
employees can relate to. The programme was re-
named Umfowethu, meaning ‘my brother’s keeper.’ 
Lost Time Accidents
The Group’s key measure of safety performance  
is the number of lost time accidents (“LTAs”). 
The Group adopts a more stringent lost time 
measurement criterion than the industry norm of 3 
days. The recorded LTAs use the Group definition of 
“incidents resulting in lost time of more than 4 hours”. 
The results for 2008, 2009 and 2010 are as follows: 
Initiatives
Our safety committees focused on a 
number of activities this year, including:
—  Group-wide training and behavioural 
auditing
—  continued development of policies 
and procedures 
—  recognising and rewarding out-
standing safety performance 
through award schemes
Weir Minerals Africa
Weir Minerals Africa organises an annual Wellness 
Day which involves various health screening activities 
combined with general health promotion. 180 
employees were given blood pressure and prostate 
screening, cholesterol tests, advice on fitness 
routines and eye tests. In addition, the company also 
organises an annual medical survey of all employees 
who are in hazardous areas of the site such as the 
foundry or rubber shop and in December 2010 149 
employees were provided with an onsite Aids/HIV 
testing and counselling clinic.

3: Employees
We want to develop our people to their full potential.
We are committed to developing the best possible 
technical specialists and leaders and encouraging all 
employees to achieve their potential.
We aim to employ the best people for the roles we 
have and help those people to develop further, by 
giving them training, development opportunities and 
management support.
The principles we apply are to:
•  Never deny development or promotion on the basis 
of any form of discrimination
•  Encourage and support our employees to achieve 
their potential
•  Identify the training and development needs of 
ourselves and our teams and find ways to satisfy 
those needs
•  Use the Weir Group personal development plan 
(PDP) to identify and develop high potential 
individuals
•  Employ and retain people who share our values 
and behaviours
•  Work to maintain a business environment where 
individuals feel valued and respected
•  Support individuals in developing roles.
Introducing the Senior Management Group
The Senior Management Group (SMG) was formed 
in January 2010 to enhance communication across 
the leadership team of the Weir Group and to provide 
a platform to help leverage our strategic agenda.
The SMG is made up of around 300 senior employees 
from across the Weir Group who are key to the 
development and delivery of the Group’s strategy. 
The SMG includes the key decision makers from 
each business and function who have a direct hand 
in shaping the direction of each business within Weir 
and are responsible for its success.
For the first of the SMG meetings, senior leaders from 
across Europe, Africa and the Middle East gathered 
in Glasgow in late August, with the Americas and 
Asia-Pacific regional meetings following soon after in 
Fort Worth and Sydney respectively.
The SMG has four key objectives:
•  Enable the Chief Executive to communicate with 
the most senior employees
•  Enhance communication from the SMG across the 
wider Weir community
•  Build upon the core strategic pillars and leverage 
capability across the Group and
•  Create a standard Weir leadership journey for 
development and succession, including a tailored 
leadership programme for all members.

Engineering
During the year the Engineering Excellence Comm-
ittee met in India attended by 36 participants, 
representing 25 locations from 14 different countries 
to share best practice and to identify priorities and 
focus activities to enable the development of a 
Group-wide, world class engineering organisation.
The objectives agreed were to:
—  take replication of best practice to a 
new level 
—  develop and implement Group-wide 
standards 
—  leverage the Group-wide technical 
resources for the benefit of all the 
Weir businesses 
—  foster the development of engineer-
ing talent and identify strategic tech-
nical capabilities that will support 
Weir Group strategic growth plans.
Procurement
During the year, the Procurement Committee met in 
Shanghai attended by over 40 participants from the 
procurement teams around the world to focus on 
the Group’s global capability and collaboration and 
implementing a standard “Weir Way of Working” for 
the procurement function.
Weir Graduate Development Framework
During 2010, the Group has developed its graduate 
development framework aligning the Group’s three 
strategic pillars of Innovation, Collaboration and 
Global Capability. There are currently 40 graduate 
trainees working across the Group in various 
locations and we plan to recruit 75 graduates in 2011, 
of which 43 will be from emerging markets. During 
the two year programme, graduates will benefit 
from rotational placements to ensure maximum 
exposure to relevant development opportunities.  
A variety of mechanisms will be put in place to 
support the graduate as they move from an academic 
environment to an industrial environment and this 
will be provided through induction, professional 
mentoring and a coaching relationship with a leader 
from the SMG.
Here are some thoughts on the Weir Group from 
our recent graduate intake: 
“The culture within Weir Group 
is one of a kind. There’s an 
open atmosphere, with plenty 
of skills and knowledge shar-
ing. It incubates leadership 
qualities, encourages innova-
tion and engenders trust and 
respect among colleagues. 
These are the foundations of 
the Weir Group”. 
Vinay Sharma, Weir India
“It is a solid culture, with  
clear goals and objectives. 
The implementation of Lean 
manufacturing and 5S serves 
as the basis for the structure 
of the Group in order to meet 
market demands”.
Fernando Tirollo, Weir Minerals South America
Employee development
We recognise that people are vital to the success 
of our business. Training and development play a 
major part in improving businesses and retaining 
employees by developing the skills required for career 
advancement and business process improvements. 
Training and development is managed either on a 
Group or company basis.
The Group employee development programmes 
include induction and leadership development.  
The induction training provides awareness training on 
the Group standard procedures and processes and 
senior managers attend one of these courses within 
a short period of joining the Group. The leadership 
courses are run for the Group’s current and  
future leaders. 60 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report
Sustainability report
3. Employees (continued)
The principal aims of these courses are 
to provide:
—  personal development
—  exposure to different disciplines
—  cultural integration
—  networking across all disciplines and 
operations
—  a good understanding of what is 
expected of a Weir Leader 
—  an improved awareness of self, 
others in the business and the 
enterprise as a whole and 
—  accountability and commitment to 
developing themselves and others in 
the business. 
The courses are aimed at developing existing and 
future managing directors and senior managers 
from across the Group to help them achieve their 
maximum potential. 
In addition, the global personal development plan 
analyses employee performance and enables 
employees to receive the most relevant and tailored 
training to match their specific skills and needs. 
Case studies
Weir India scholarships
In 2010, the chairman Lord Smith launched Weir 
India’s higher education scholarship scheme. In order 
to support the children of Weir India employees in 
their higher education and specifically to encourage 
engineering talent, Weir India is supporting 10 
children of employees in higher education through 
a two year scholarship and supporting 6 children  
of employees through an engineering degree for  
four years.

4: Communities
We believe that any investment in a community should 
create a meaningful and sustainable impact on that 
community. It should be relevant to the local needs 
but at the same time aligned with our business and 
carried out in partnership with local organisations.
We aim to identify the possibilities for investment 
through contact with local people and organisations 
and in particular we work very closely with local non 
Government authorities and community groups.
Education is a priority for communities worldwide. We 
are therefore committed to focusing on community 
projects with an educational theme whether it is 
mentoring at a local school, helping young engineers 
with their school projects, setting up scholarship 
schemes, arranging site visits to local colleges and 
universities to sponsoring the education of children. 
These are all ways we wish to make a difference in 
the communities in which we operate.
The Code of Conduct states that Weir Group 
companies will be ‘good citizens’ in the communities 
they are in by:
•  Respecting the local environment
•  Setting an example by behaving in a manner 
consistent with the Code at all times
•  Supporting local communities who need help 
through charitable contributions and employees 
giving of their free time
•  Informing and updating communities about ongoing 
projects in their areas
•  Respecting the traditions, cultures and laws of  
the countries and the local communities where  
we operate
•  Trying to employ local people in our businesses 
wherever possible
•  Listening to the concerns of the local communities 
and where possible, acting in a way that deals with 
their concerns.
Charitable donations
The total charitable donations of Group companies 
made during the financial year was £333,900 (2009: 
£252,000), as shown below:
The Group’s Code of Conduct prohibits political 
contributions and therefore no political donations 
were made during the period.

Weir Minerals Africa, Rustenburg
In 2010, Weir Minerals Rustenburg partnered with 
the Joint Education Trust (JET), a non-governmental 
organisation, to donate 238 scientific calculators to 
local mathematics and science students. JET operates 
a number of partnerships between schools that lack 
even the most basic facilities and local industry. 
Through a monitoring programme the calculators are 
returned to ensure that the following year’s students 
continue to derive benefit from the scheme. Over the 
targeted three year period the aim is that all students 
in the area have access to one of these calculators.

5: Products and technology
Research and development has a vital role to play  
in meeting our corporate responsibilities. The devel-
opment of new products that are more environmen-
tally friendly in both manufacture and operation  
offers competitive advantage to ourselves and to  
our customers.
We recognise that many of our products and serv-
ices are themselves contributors to environmental 
protection in critical areas such as power generation 
and service.
Within the Power & Industrial Division 40% of input 
in 2010 came from products and services sup-
plied to low carbon industries in nuclear, hydro  
and biomass.
The acquisition of American Hydro in November 
2010 and YES in December 2010 will significantly 
strengthen the Group’s product and service offering 
in the areas of hydro and wind respectively.
Research and development
During the financial year, the Group spent £14.8m 
(2009: £9.7m) on research and development. 
The expenditure reflects the Group’s continued 
commitment to investment in research and deve-
lopment, applied to both the development of new 
leading edge materials technologies and existing 
product innovation. The Group’s worldwide pump 
technology centres focus on developing engineering 
process improvements through the use of a variety 
of analytical tools to design products with optimal 
wear life and improved safety and efficiency. This 
maintains the Group’s competitive advantage in the 
market and controls costs whilst improving quality.
2011 will see further investment in design, research 
and development in which our corporate responsibil-
ity and business objectives are closely aligned.
Case studies
Weir Minerals South America - Energy recovery 
Starting in September 2009, a joint engineering 
project between Codelco and Weir Minerals South 
America developed a micro-power station involving 
the generation of electricity from the tailings being 
transported from Codelco’s mine. This is the first 
stage in the construction of a network of micro-
power generators. The electricity generated takes 
advantage of the force generated from the flow  
of the tailings in the same way as hydro power. The 
turbine has a potential to generate 10 to 12 MW 
when fully operative. 
Tailings are the liquid waste by-products from the 
mining process and must be transported to the tail-
ing tanks or ponds for treatment.

Acquisition of American Hydro
Hydro-power is the world’s largest source of renew-
able energy. American Hydro, which the Group 
acquired in November 2010 has a particular strength 
in improving the efficiency of existing stations.  
This combined with the Group’s existing service 
capabilities means that we are now able to offer to 
customers an attractive proposition to improve 
renewable energy output from existing hydro gener-
ation stations in an economically attractive manner.
Acquisition of Ynfiniti Engineering Services (YES)
During December 2010, the Group acquired a 
majority shareholding in YES which is a Madrid 
based company providing maintenance and other 
services to windfarms throughout Europe. Wind 
power generation is a fast growing market in many 
of the countries in which Weir already operates 
and YES provides a strong platform from which  
to extend our position in this market.
Product efficiency
The GEHO positive displacement pump is 15 to 30% 
more efficient in terms of carbon emission than con-
ventional pumping systems. This technology allows 
mine water to be pumped at higher densities sav-
ing on power and capital costs. GEHO pumps are 
designed to a 30 year life span and use fewer natural 
resources in their installation and running costs.

6: Ethics
The Board is ultimately responsible for setting the 
governance and anti-corruption culture of the Group 
and ensuring that this is understood and communi-
cated to all employees with the necessary reporting 
channels provided together with appropriate training 
and auditing. Regular reports and feedback are pro-
vided to the Board by the legal & commercial director 
who has been appointed to oversee this. 
Driving Growth the Weir Way is a critical feature of 
the Group’s commitment to doing business at all 
times in an ethical and transparent manner – “doing 
it right”. The chief executive in his communication to 
employees at the launch of the Code of of Conduct 
in December 2010 set out his expectation that all 
employees maintain the highest standards of integrity 
consistent with the Code which was launched ahead 
of the proposed implementation of the new UK 
Bribery Act during 2011.
Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct provides a clear framework on 
which to base decision-making and provides details 
of what is expected from each employee to maintain 
the Group’s high standards of ethical behaviour.
The main purposes of the Code of Conduct are to:
•  Set out clearly the behaviour expected from 
employees and stakeholders
•  Provide guidelines to help with applying Weir’s  
values at all times
•  Enable employees to raise a concern or ask a 
question if they are in doubt.
The Code of Conduct is not restricted to bribery and 
corruption but is much broader in nature and covers 
other areas such as respecting our place in the world 
and integrity in the work place.
The Code of Conduct is written in easy to understand 
language with practical examples in each section.
Ethics Hotline
As part of the roll out of the Code of Conduct, the 
Group established a dedicated independent and 
confidential phone line that employees can ring 
to raise any concerns that they have concerning 
unethical behaviour. Calls to the helpline are free and 
lines are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
The communication of the Code of Conduct and the 
details of the ethics reporting line has been carried 
out through use of the following media: the Global 
Intranet and posters at every Group location.
Anti-bribery & corruption training
Following the launch of the Code of Conduct the 
Group introduced a mandatory e-learning training 
programme for all ‘at risk’ employees, including:
•  The Senior Management Group (300)
•  All sales and marketing employees (around 1000)
•  All purchasing employees (270+)
Initially there will be two modules – one covering the 
UK Bribery Act, including the prevention of bribery 
and corruption and the second addressing the Code 
of Conduct.
The Code of Conduct was 
rolled-out on-line 66 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Directors report
Each training module is run through a learning 
management system hosted by a third party. This 
allows the Group to monitor the effective roll out of 
the training. Each participant is expected to complete 
the modules within the specified timelines. The first 
module relating to the UK Bribery Act has a set pass 
rate and participants are awarded a certificate on 
successful completion of the module. Participants are 
then expected to take the second module relating to 
the Code of Conduct and again they are awarded a 
certificate for successful completion. The Group will 
refresh these modules on a regular basis. In addition 
to the training aimed at the ‘at risk’ employees, the 
Group is also developing training modules that will 
be rolled out as part of ‘Town Hall’ meetings. These 
will be carried out by local trainers and the aim will be 
to introduce the Code of Conduct and what it means 
to all employees.
The Group will also be introducing an online certifi-
cation process to enable all employees to certify on 
a quarterly basis that they are in compliance with the 
Code of Conduct.
Communications
The Group’s Code of Conduct will be reinforced 
through an ongoing series of communications via:
•  The Group conference and all regional and func-
tional conferences 
•  Induction days for new executives
•  Training courses for the SMG
•  As part of the 100 day integration plan for new 
acquisitions.
Supply chain
The Weir Group sources components, materials and 
services on a world-wide basis. Our suppliers are an 
integral part of the Group’s business. Relationships 
with all suppliers are built on total quality practices 
and principles to achieve best performance, product, 
delivery, service and total cost.
We recognise that our supply chain activities have 
a broad impact and that our responsibilities extend 
beyond our own operations and into those of our 
suppliers. The Group has, therefore, adopted a 
Supply Chain Policy to ensure that suppliers to the 
Group comply with or exceed certain standards in 
connection with their workforce, legal compliance, 
health and safety, business ethics and environmental 
standards. Our key supplier partners are expected to 
either have accreditation to OHSAS 18001 and ISO 
14001 or be able to demonstrate a plan to achieve it 
within a reasonable amount of time.
We recognise that our corporate responsibility also 
reflects the way we behave towards our suppliers. 
The Group does not operate a standard policy in 
respect of payments to suppliers and each operating 
company is responsible for agreeing the terms and 
conditions under which business transactions are 
conducted, including the terms of payment. 
In addition, many Weir companies collaborate with

The annual general meeting will be held at 11am on Wednesday 
4 May 2011 at the Radisson Hotel, Argyle Street, Glasgow. The 
notice of meeting along with an explanation of the proposed 
resolutions are set out in a separate circular to shareholders which 
accompanies this annual report and can be downloaded from the 
Company’s website. 
Substantial shareholders
At 8 March 2011, the Company had been notified in accordance 
with the UK Listing Authority’s Disclosure Rules and Transparency 
Rules that the following held, or were beneficially interested in 3% 
or more of the Company’s issued share capital:
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since the date of disclosure to the Company, the interest of any 
shareholder listed above may have increased or decreased. No 
requirement to notify the Company of any increase or decrease 
would have arisen unless the holding moved up or down through 
a whole number percentage level. The percentage level may 
increase (if the Company cancelled shares pursuant to the power 
to purchase its own shares) or decrease (on the issue of new 
shares under the LTIP).
Material contracts
There are no persons with whom the Company has contractual 
or other arrangements which are essential to the business of the 
Company. 
Employment policy and involvement
The average number of employees in the Group during the period 
is given in note 4 to the Group financial statements on page 85.
Group companies operate within a framework of HR policies,  
practices and regulations appropriate to their market sector and 
country of operation. Policies and procedures for recruitment, 
training and career development promote equality of opportunity 
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, dis-
ability, race, religion or other beliefs and ethnic or national origin. 
The aim is to encourage a culture in which all employees have the 
opportunity to develop fully according to their individual abilities 
and the needs of the Group. The Group remains committed to 
the fair treatment of people with disabilities regarding applications, 
training, promotion and career development.
Employee involvement and feedback is actively encouraged. A 
variety of ways are used to consult and inform employees including 
a Group-wide bulletin, e-mail, intranet and local briefings. These 
are designed to facilitate dialogue while enabling the development 
of a common awareness among employees of what affects 
business performance.
Financial instruments
The information required in respect of financial instruments 
as required by Schedule 7 of the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 is given in note 30 to the Group financial statements on  
page 110.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s 
auditors will be put to the forthcoming annual general meeting. 
Share capital and rights attaching to the Company’s shares 
Details of the issued share capital of the Company, which 
comprises a single class of shares, ordinary shares of 12.5p each, 
are set out in note 25 to the Group financial statements on page 
106. The rights attaching to the shares are set out in the articles 
of association. There are no special control rights in relation to 
the Company’s shares and the Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights. 
During the period, the 2007 LTIP award vested and the trustees of 
the Company’s employees benefit trust (EBT), Kleinwort Benson 
(Guernsey) Trustees Limited, transferred 37,794 ordinary shares 
to employees to satisfy the LTIP awards using ordinary shares 
purchased by the EBT in the market. A further 343,078 ordinary 
shares were transferred out of treasury to satisfy awards under 
the LTIP. In addition, a total of 123,596 ordinary shares, with an 
aggregate value of £15,449.50 were allotted during the period  
in connection with the Company’s LTIP and executive share 
option scheme.
The EBT has agreed to waive any right to all dividend payments 
on shares held by it. Details of the shares held by the EBT are set 
out in note 25 to the Group financial statements on page 106. 
The EBT holds, through its designated ESOP account nominee 
K.B (CI) Nominees Limited, 0.07% of the issued share capital of 
the Company, as at 31 December 2010, in trust for the benefit of 
certain executive directors and senior executives of the Group. 
The voting rights in relation to these shares are exercised by the 
trustee. The EBT may vote or abstain from voting the shares or 
accept or reject any offer relating to shares, in any way it sees fit, 
without incurring any liability and without being required to give 
reasons for its decision.

Repurchase of shares
At the 2010 annual general meeting, shareholders renewed the 
Company’s authority to make market purchases of up to 21.05m 
ordinary shares (representing 10% of the issued share capital 
excluding treasury shares). No shares were purchased under this 
authority during the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010 and, 
at the forthcoming annual general meeting, the Board will again 
seek shareholder approval to renew the annual authority for the 
Company to make market purchases.
Voting rights
The Company’s articles of association provide that on a show 
of hands at a general meeting of the Company, every holder of 
ordinary shares present in person and by proxy and entitled to 
vote shall have one vote and on a poll, every member present in 
person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for 
every ordinary share held. The notice of the annual general meeting 
specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a 
proxy or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions to be passed at 
the annual general meeting. The Company conducts the vote at 
the annual general meeting by electronic poll. All proxy votes are 
counted and the numbers for, against or withheld in relation to 
each resolution are announced at the annual general meeting and 
published on the Company’s website after the meeting.
The articles of association may only be amended by a Special 
Resolution passed at a general meeting of shareholders.
Transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
Company, other than as contained in the articles of association:
•  The directors may refuse to register any transfer of any certificated 
share which is not fully paid up, provided that this power will 
not be exercised so as to disturb the market in the Company’s 
shares.
•  The directors may also refuse to register the transfer of a cer-
tificated share unless it is delivered to the registrar’s office, or 
such other place as the directors have specified, accompanied 
by a certificate for the shares to be transferred and such other 
evidence as the directors may reasonably require to prove title 
of the intending transferor. 
Certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by laws 
and regulations, for example, insider trading laws, in relation to the 
transfer of shares.
Appointment and replacement of directors
The provisions about the appointment and re-election of directors 
of the Company are contained in the articles of association. 
Powers of directors
The business of the Company is managed by the directors  
who may exercise all the powers of the Company, subject to the 
provisions of the Company’s articles of association, any special 
resolution of the Company and any relevant legislation.
Change of control – significant agreements
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling 
the counterparties to require prior approval, exercise termination, 
alteration or similar rights in the event of a change of control of  
the Company. 
During 2010, the Group secured a new four year US$800m multi 
currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 12 banks. 
This facility replaced the £625m bilateral facilities which were due 
to mature in the third quarter of 2011. Under the terms of these 
agreements, if there is a change of control of the Company any 
lender may request, by not less than 30 days’ notice to the Company, 
that its commitment be cancelled and all outstanding amounts be 
repaid to that lender at the expiry of such notice period.
The Company is party to various note purchase agreements to 
issue an equivalent of US$250m five year and eight year fixed rate 
notes in a combination of US dollar and sterling at an average US 
dollar equivalent interest rate of 4.8% due 11 January 2015 and 
11 January 2018. Under the terms of the agreements, if there is a 
change of control of the Company, the notes must be offered for 
prepayment by the Company within seven days of the change of 
control. The prepayment date would be no later than 60 days after 
the offer of prepayment by the Company.
There are no agreements between the Company and its directors 
or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy 
or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Independent auditors report to the members of  
The Weir Group PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of The Weir 
Group PLC for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 32. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might  
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors & auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors statement of responsi-
bilities set out on page 43, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group financial statements and for being  
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to  
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical  
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and  
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reason-
able assurance that the financial statements are free from mate-
rial misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appro-
priate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signifi-
cant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2010 and of its profit for the 52 weeks then 
ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors report for 
the financial year for which the Group financial statements are  
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
•  certain disclosures of directors remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•  the directors statement, set out on page 43, in relation to going 
concern;
•  the part of the Corporate governance report relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 
2008 Combined Code specified for our review; and
•  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements  
of The Weir Group PLC for the 52 weeks to 31 December 2010 
and on the information in the Remuneration report that is described 
as having been audited.

Notes to the  
Group Financial Statements
1. Authorisation of financial statements & statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010 (“2010”) 
were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 8 March 2011. The comparative information is presented for the 53 weeks ended 
1 January 2010 (“2009”). For practical reasons, the Group prepares its financial statements to the week ending closest to the Company reference date of 31 December. The 
results on this basis are unlikely to be materially different from those that would be presented for a period of one year. The Weir Group PLC is a limited company incorporated 
in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by  
the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are presented in sterling. All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds (£m) except when otherwise indicated. 
In order to provide the users of the financial statements with a more relevant presentation of the Group’s underlying performance, profit for each financial year has been  
analysed between:
i)  profit before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation; and 
ii)  the effect of exceptional items and intangibles amortisation.
  a)   Exceptional items are material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation 
to allow a better understanding of the elements of the Group’s financial performance for the period and are presented on the face of the income statement to facilitate 
comparisons with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
  b)  Intangibles amortisation, including impairment, has been shown separately to provide increased visibility over the impact of increased acquisition activity on intangible assets. 
Further analysis of the items included in the column “Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation” is provided in note 5 to the financial statements. 
The accounting policies which follow are consistent with those of the previous periods except as described below. 
Improvements to IFRS 
In April 2009, the International Accounting Standards Board issued an omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and to clarify 
wording. There are separate transitional provisions for each standard. The adoption of the amendments did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the 
Group. One of the key amendments and its impact is detailed below. 
IAS38 Intangible assets: states that if an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is identifiable only with another intangible asset, the acquirer may recognise the 
group of intangibles as a single asset provided the individual assets have similar useful lives. This has had no impact on the recognition of intangible assets in relation to the 
current year acquisitions as each of the intangible assets recognised on acquisition were separately identifiable.
In addition to the above, the following standards and interpretations have been adopted in these financial statements and have not had a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements in the period of initial application.
IAS39 Eligible Hedged Items (amendment to IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement)
IFRS2 Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions (amendments to IFRS2 Share-based Payments)
IFRIC16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation
IFRIC18 Transfers of Assets from Customers 76 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Use of estimates & judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and 
in any future periods affected.
Details of the significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the financial statements are described in the Financial review on page 31.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC and its subsidiaries and the Group’s share of its joint 
ventures results. The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies. 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to 
obtain benefit from its activities. The results of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the Group’s results from the effective date on which control is transferred 
to the Group. The results of a subsidiary sold during the period are included in the Group’s results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of the Group. All 
intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented within equity in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, separately from the Company shareholders equity.
Joint ventures
The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures. These all take the form of agreements to share control 
over other entities (“jointly controlled entities”). The Group’s interests in the results and assets and liabilities of its jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the  
equity method. 
These investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets less any impairment in value. The income statement 
reflects the share of results of operations of these investments after tax. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investee’s equity, the Group recognises its 
share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Group’s share of the net fair value of the joint 
venture’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the joint venture and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value 
of the joint venture’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Group’s share of the 
joint venture’s profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency. The functional currency is the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which an entity operates. 
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entity’s functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences 
are recognised in the income statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Group’s 
net investment in a foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in  
profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into 
sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign 
operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve. 
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative 
currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation. As permitted by IFRS1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be £nil 
as at 27 December 2003. Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before 27 December 2003. 
In the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the cash flows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to 
the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is shown net of sales taxes, discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from sales of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods and 
can be reliably measured. Revenue from the sales of services and revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion where the outcome 
can be estimated reliably, otherwise it is recognised to the extent costs are incurred. The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the proportion 
that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the contract 
work. The basis used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of the work is subject to 
formal customer acceptance procedures. Losses on contracts are recognised in the period when such losses become probable. 
Property, plant & equipment 
The Group elected to use previous UK GAAP revaluations of land and buildings, amounting to £10.5m, prior to 27 December 2003 as deemed cost at the date of  
the revaluation.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. Cost includes borrowing costs for qualifying assets for 
which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009. Prior to this date, the Group recognised all borrowing costs as an expense immediately. Freehold 
land and assets under construction are not depreciated. 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual 
value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, which is in the following ranges: 
Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings - 10 - 40 years 
Short leasehold land & buildings - duration of lease 
Plant & equipment - 3 - 20 years 
Investment property
The Group has one property which is currently being held to earn rentals and for capital appreciation rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services and as 
such this property is classified as investment property which is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over 40 years. 
Goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the entity’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition. Acquisition costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Goodwill in respect of an 
acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses. 
Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entity’s assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately as a 
gain in the income statement. 
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 27 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount at that date and is not amortised. The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a 
cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit. Goodwill that was written-off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not 
taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after 27 December 2003.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration, which 
is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance with IAS39 in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. In respect of business 
combinations prior to 1 January 2010, subsequent adjustments to contingent consideration will be recognised as part of goodwill. 78 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost on initial recognition. An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible asset 
if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be measured reliably. 
An intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which in respect of an acquired intangible asset represents its fair value at the 
acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life. An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment 
and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line 
basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life, not exceeding eight years.
The expected useful lives of the acquired intangible assets are as follows:
Brand names - indefinite life
Customer relationships -  7 - 25 years
Purchased software - 4 - 8 years
Intellectual property & trade marks - 6 -15 years
Other  - up to 6 years
Research & development costs 
All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. 
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new product and it is incurred after 
the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benefits are probable and 
the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset. Any such capitalised development expenditure will be amortised 
on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product. 
Impairment of non-current assets 
All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired. Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets 
with an indefinite life and any capitalised development expenditure are subject to an annual impairment test. 
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to 
sell and its value in use. An asset’s value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where it is not possible to estimate 
the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. Similarly, the recoverable amount of goodwill 
is determined by reference to the discounted future cash flows of the cash-generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount. The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items. Cost represents the expenditure incurred in 
bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads. 
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. 
Financial assets & liabilities
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and fixed rate notes, cash and short-term 
deposits. The Group also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations. 
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised 
in profit or loss.

Group Financial Statements  
(continued) 79
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Trade & other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally are of a short dated nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed 
as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months 
or less and bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent 
that there is no right of offset with cash balances. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount. 
Interest-bearing loans & borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable 
transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortised 
cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements. 
The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, the Group uses 
interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts 
is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency 
swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates. Changes in their fair values have 
been recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS39 are met. Hedge accounting is applied in respect 
of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS39 and practical to do so. When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships will be classified as 
fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value 
attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the 
change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging 
instrument will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than in the income statement. When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the 
accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, 
will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, 
any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is kept in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction 
occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to net profit or loss for  
the period.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related 
to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.  80 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Share-based payments
Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect 
of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards. The fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which 
the award was granted are modified. The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or performance 
conditions. 
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has applied IFRS2 “Share-based Payment” retrospectively only to equity settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 and 
had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares
The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company and the Group are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost. Consideration received 
for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves. No 
gain or loss is recognised in total comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Post-employment benefits 
Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to employees throughout the world and other benefits, primarily post-retirement healthcare, provided to certain 
employees in the United States. 
For defined benefit plans, the cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating 
employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries. Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, or immediately if the benefits have vested. Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the 
effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. The defined benefit liability or 
asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation using a discount rate based on appropriate high quality 
corporate bonds, at the balance sheet date, minus any past service costs not yet recognised, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date. Where a 
plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount which the Group expects to recover 
by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions. 
For defined contribution plans, the costs represent the Group’s contributions to the plans and these are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due. 
Leases 
Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease 
payments and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases. Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned 
assets or the lease term if shorter. At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a constant 
periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability. Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the income statement while the capital element is applied 
to reduce the outstanding liability. 
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Taxation 
Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period. 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions:
i)     Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised;
ii)    Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future;
iii)   A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in 
respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted 
basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is 
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.

3. Segment information        
For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Power & Industrial. These three divisions are organised and managed 
separately based on the key markets served and each is treated as an operating segment and a reportable segment in accordance with IFRS8. The operating and reportable 
segments were determined based on the reports reviewed by the Group Executive which are used to make operational decisions.
The Minerals segment designs and manufactures pumps, hydrocyclones, valves and other complementary equipment for the mining, flue gas desulphurisation and oil sands 
markets. The Oil & Gas segment manufactures pumps and ancillary equipment and provides aftermarket support for the global upstream and downstream oil and gas markets. 
The Power & Industrial segment designs, manufactures and provides aftermarket support for rotating and flow control equipment to the global power generation and industrial 
sectors. All other segments, which are disclosed as Group companies, include the results of Liquid Gas Equipment which supplies equipment to the liquefied petroleum gas 
marine and onshore markets.
The Group Executive assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles 
amortisation, including impairment (“segment result”). Finance income and expenditure and associated interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments are not 
allocated to segments as all treasury activity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function. The amounts provided to the Group Executive with respect to assets and 
liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements. The assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical location 
of the asset. The liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
In 2010, in conjunction with the acquisition of American Hydro, the decision was taken to restructure our Canadian operations in order to better align the business activities of 
existing operations with the new acquisition as well as to meet developments in the Canadian marketplace. Accordingly, the segment information in respect of the 53 weeks 
ended 1 January 2010 has been restated. The impact of this restatement was to reduce Power & Industrial sales to external customers by £13.5m and to increase Oil & Gas 
and Minerals sales to external customers by £8.2m and £5.3m respectively. Segment result increased in Power & Industrial and Oil & Gas by £0.4m and £0.7m respectively 
and reduced by £1.1m in Minerals. Working capital assets in Minerals increased by £0.6m and liabilities increased by £0.2m. In Oil & Gas, working capital assets increased by 
£2.0m. In Power & Industrial working capital assets reduced by £2.6m and liabilities by £0.2m. Depreciation increased in Minerals by £0.1m and reduced in Power & Industrial 
by the same amount.

8. Discontinued operations
There were no disposals of businesses during the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010. During the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010, there were no disposals of businesses 
which were of a sufficient size to meet the definition of a discontinued operation under IFRS5.
In December 2010, the Group pleaded guilty to two charges of breaching UN sanctions in connection with a number of Oil for Food programme contracts awarded between 
2000 and 2002.  This resulted in a confiscation order of £13.9m and a fine of £3.0m.  Since the business involved was sold in 2007, these costs, along with £1.7m of related 
legal and professional fees, offset by the release of £5.0m of provisions and accruals, are shown as a loss from discontinued operations.
In 2009, a profit of £5.2m (net of tax of £nil) was recognised in respect of prior periods disposals. This related to the release of an unutilised provision following the expiry of 
certain warranty periods.
(Losses) earnings per share from discontinued operations were as follows. 
          2010 2009 
          pence pence
Basic          (6.5p) 2.5p
Diluted          (6.4p) 2.5p
These (losses) earnings per share figures were derived by dividing the net loss attributable to equity holders of the Company from discontinued operations of £13.6m  
(2009: profit of £5.2m) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares for both basic and diluted amounts shown in note 9.
9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period (adjusted for the effects of dilutive share awards).
The following reflects the profit and share data used in the calculation of earnings per share.

13. Business combinations
There were no business combinations during the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010. During the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010, the Group acquired five businesses of 
which Linatex was the most significant. The disclosures in this note present Linatex separately from the other business combinations on the basis that Linatex is considered to 
be individually material.
On 17 September 2010, following receipt of regulatory approvals, the Group finalised the acquisition of 100% of the voting shares of the Linatex group of companies (“Linatex”), 
a global provider of wear-resistant products to the mining and sand and aggregate industries, based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for a total cash consideration of £111.7m. 
Costs associated with the acquisition amounting to £0.8m have been charged to the income statement in the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010.
On 5 March 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the voting shares of Petroleum Certification Services (“PCS”), an Australian based specialist certification and testing business. 
On 11 October 2010, the Group acquired the valves business of BDK Engineering Industries Limited (“BDK”), a family owned business based in Hubli, Karnataka, India, 
which manufactures valves for the oil and gas, petro-chemical and power markets. On 18 November 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the voting shares of American Hydro 
Corporation (“American Hydro”), a manufacturer of high-efficiency turbine components for hydro-electric power generation based in York, Pennsylvania. On 21 December 2010, 
the Group acquired 76% of the voting shares of wind power maintenance specialist, Ynfiniti Engineering Services SL (“YES”) based in Madrid, Spain. YES provides operating 
and maintenance services to the growing installed base of wind turbines. Costs associated with these acquisitions amounting to £1.8m have been charged to the income 
statement in the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010.
The YES acquisition was structured as an initial 76% purchase with the remaining 24% being subject to a put and call option exercisable between 2014 and 2016 and based 
upon an EBITDA multiple of profits in the two years preceding the exercise of the option. The most likely range of possible outcomes is between €6m and €22m. The contingent 
consideration recognised at the acquisition date has been estimated at £12.0m (€14m). This is based on an assessment of the probability of the possible outcomes discounted 
to net present value. Any difference from this estimate will ultimately be taken to the Consolidated Income Statement. The maximum amount of the contingent consideration 
is unlimited.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the relevant dates of acquisition are as follows.

Net cash outflow        (108.6) (94.7) (203.3)
The fair values on acquisition of the above business combinations are provisional, with the exception of PCS, due to the timing of the transactions and will be finalised during the 
following financial year. The fair value of the trade receivables amounts to £21.8m and the gross amount of trade receivables is £23.4m. None of the trade receivables has been 
impaired. From the date of acquisition Linatex contributed £27.2m to the 2010 revenue and £1.5m to the 2010 profit for the period from continuing operations of the Group. 
The combined continuing operations revenue and profit for the period from continuing operations of the Group, assuming that Linatex, BDK, American Hydro, YES and PCS 
had been acquired at the start of 2010, would have been £1,745.7m and £206.1m respectively.
Included in the £86.6m of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their 
nature. These items include anticipated business growth, synergies and an assembled workforce. The amount of goodwill which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
is £55.5m.

14. Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives
Goodwill acquired through business combinations and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. In 2010, following an internal restructuring, goodwill and intangibles relating to the “Weir Warman” CGU was reallocated to 
the “Warman companies” CGU as this was determined to be the revised CGU at which the Group monitors the goodwill and intangibles for indicators of impairment.
The current year acquisitions have been allocated to “Other” with the exception of Linatex which has been allocated to the “Warman companies” CGU. The amounts allocated 
as “Other” are not considered significant in comparison to their respective total carrying amounts.
The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives has been allocated as per the table below.

Discount rate        
The discount rates presented above reflect the pre-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in the most appropriate geographic region. The WACC is the weighted 
average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance. In the main there has been a decrease in the WACC relative to 2009 largely due to a decrease 
in government bond yields and a reduction in lending margins that banks place on borrowing costs. The WACC in relation to Weir Gabbioneta has increased relative to 2009 
as Italian government bond yields have increased over the period while bank lending margins have remained static.  
2 
Real growth        
Real growth beyond the five year forecast period of 1.2% reflects the increasingly global nature of these businesses and the fact that they sell a significant proportion of  
their products to emerging markets which have long-term stronger growth prospects than their home markets.
3 
EBIT margins
EBIT margins have been forecast based on historic levels taking cognisance of the likely impact of changing economic environments and competitive landscapes on volumes 
and revenues and the impact of associated management actions on costs.

Weir SPM 
Weir SPM is a supplier of oil and gas well service pumps, associated flow control equipment and services to the oil and gas production industry. A large proportion of its 
revenues are generated in North America with demand being closely related to the number of conventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs in operation which is in 
turn dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels. Independent forecasts of North American oil and gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast 
oil and natural gas prices and storage levels, have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter  
of 2010.  96 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements

Warman companies 
The Warman companies supply pumps and associated equipment and services to all global markets. The key drivers for revenues are (i) levels of mining capital expenditure 
which drives demand for original equipment and (ii) levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service. Independent forecasts of mining activity 
have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2010. 
6 
Weir Gabbioneta 
Weir Gabbioneta is a supplier of heavy duty process applications to oil and gas refinery, petro-chemical and power generation industries. The key drivers for revenues are capital 
expenditure within oil refinery and petro-chemical industries. Independent forecasts of expenditure in these sectors have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. 
These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2010.
7 
Weir Warman 
Weir Warman is a supplier of pumps and associated equipment and services to the African mining industry. In 2010, Weir Warman was re-allocated to the Warman 
companies  CGU. In respect of the 2009 disclosures, the key drivers for revenues are (i) levels of mining capital expenditure across Africa which drive demand for original 
equipment and (ii) levels of actual mining activity which drive demand for spare parts and service. Independent forecasts of mining activity have been used to derive revenue 
growth assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2009.
Sensitivity analysis 
Base case forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value for each of the CGUs. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any 
reasonably possible change in key assumptions. There is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.

On 11 January 2010, the Group issued through a Private Placement to UK and US investors, the equivalent of US$250m of five year (US$110m) and eight year (US$140m) 
fixed rate notes in a combination of US dollar and sterling. Including the effect of swapping the sterling notes into US dollars the all-in average US dollar equivalent interest rate 
across these notes is 4.8%.
During 2010, the Group also cancelled and repaid all borrowings under its existing £625m bilateral facilities and replaced them with a new US$800m multi-currency revolving 
credit facility. As at 31 December 2010, £203.1m was drawn under the revolving credit facility.
The interest rate swaps which fixed the rate of interest that the Group would pay on US$50m of its variable rate borrowings at a weighted average of 3.26% matured during 
the period.

Warranties        
Provision has been made in respect of actual warranty and contract penalty claims on goods sold and services provided and allowance has been made for potential warranty 
claims based on past experience for goods and services sold with a warranty guarantee. It is expected that all costs related to such claims will have been incurred within five 
years of the balance sheet date.  
Employee related        
Employee related provisions arise from legal obligations and asbestosis claims and are based on management’s best estimate of the likely costs. It is expected that the costs 
will be incurred in the period up to 2021.
Discontinued operations warranty & indemnity
Provisions in respect of discontinued operations include provision for warranty and indemnity exposures under asset and share sale agreements. In December 2010, the Group 
pleaded guilty to two charges of breaching UN sanctions in connection with a number of Oil for Food programme contracts awarded between 2000 and 2002 (note 8). This 
resulted in provisions of £2.4m being utilised in the period. The provision as at 31 December 2010 is based on management’s current best estimate of the remaining liabilities. 
The actual outcome may differ and, in some cases, this may be dependent on the outcome of legal proceedings. It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred 
within two years of the balance sheet date with the remaining costs expected to be incurred within five years of the balance sheet date. 
Onerous sales contracts 
Provision has been made in respect of sales contracts entered into for the sale of goods in the normal course of business where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations 
under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contracts. Provision is made immediately  when it becomes apparent that expected costs 
will exceed the expected benefits of the contract. It is expected that the costs will be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.

22. Provisions (continued) 
Other 
Other provisions relate to an environmental clean up programme in the United States for a company acquired in 1992 and various other legal claims and exposures across 
the Group. The environmental provision is based on management’s current best estimate of the expected costs under the programme. It is expected that these costs will  
be incurred in the period up to 2019.

Untaxed reserves primarily relate to temporarily disallowed inventory / debtor provisions and accruals / provisions for liabilities where the tax allowance is deferred until the cash 
expense occurs.      
Deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of £1.9m (2009: £4.8m) and deductible temporary differences of £nil (2009: £3.6m) have not been recognised on the 
grounds that there is insufficient evidence that these assets will be recoverable. These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax 
benefits. Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to £11.6m (2009: £12.0m) have not been recognised but would be available in the event of  
future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
Temporary differences associated with Group investments        
A deferred tax liability of £21.7m (2009: £18.9m) has been recognised in respect of taxes on the unremitted earnings of the South American and Canadian subsidiaries. As at 31 
December 2010, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group does not foresee a distribution of unremitted earnings 
from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal of deferred tax. The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, 
for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to £820.9m (2009: £762.1m). 102 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements
23. Deferred tax (continued)
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement. The Finance Act (No2) 2010 enacted legislation to reduce the UK 
corporate rate of taxation from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011. Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014. 
These further changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in the consolidated results for the 52 weeks ended 31 
December 2010. We expect that these reductions will not have a material effect on the effective tax rate or on the profit for the year in future periods.
24. Pensions & other post-employment benefit plans
The Group has five defined benefit pension plans in the UK and North America. The most significant of the defined benefit plans are the two UK plans. Contribution salary in 
respect of the Group’s main UK plan is capped and will increase in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5% per annum. The wind up of the Canadian plan was completed in 2009 
and the United States plans are frozen. The Group also provides certain additional post-retirement healthcare benefits to senior employees in the United States. These benefits 
are unfunded. The assets and liabilities of the plans are as follows.

*In 2009, the curtailment gain of £1.5m in respect of the North American pensions & post-retirement healthcare relates to the freezing of benefits in the Atwood & Morrill Salaried 
Employee plan. The settlement gain of £0.7m relates to the wind up of the Canadian plan. The £1.5m settlement gain in respect of UK pensions relates to an enhanced transfer 
exercise completed in 2009 for deferred members of the main UK plan.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit method. The Group 
made contributions of £9.3m in 2010 (2009: £11.1m of which £1.8m related to the wind up of the Canadian plan) in addition to the employers regular contributions. The 
total contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2011 are expected to be £10.0m. Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and  
overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of plan assets and allowing for plan expenses.

The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity. The “current” disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity (in years) 
following retirement at the balance sheet date, with “future” being that relating to an employee retiring in 2040 (in 30 years time).
The assumed investment return and discount rate have a significant effect on the reported retirement benefit obligation and the income statement expense for 2011. The effect 
of a one percentage point change in those assumptions is set out in the table below.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income since 28 December 2003 is a loss of £50.0m (2009: a loss of £46.6m). 
The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan deficits are attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans. Consequently, 
the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised on an IFRS basis in other comprehensive income before 27

Legal claims        
The company and certain subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business.
The Company is subject to a claim relating to a civil action for damages arising from the UN Oil for Food Programme which has been raised in the United States against  
just under 100 companies. This action will be robustly defended.
To the extent not already provided for, the directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material 
adverse effect upon the Group’s financial position.

There are three types of award which may be made under the LTIP to senior executives: performance shares, matching shares and investment shares. Details of each award 
are outlined in the Remuneration report on pages 44 to 51.

An amount of £3.0m (2009: £2.4m) has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the number of awards which are expected to be made at the 
end of the vesting period. This comprises an amount of £1.0m (2009: £1.4m) in respect of parent company employees and £2.0m (2009: £1.0m) in respect of employees of 
subsidiaries. Certain subsidiary companies made a cash contribution to the parent company of £1.2m (2009: £1.1m) in the period in respect of their LTIP awards. 
In addition, the one-off conditional share award granted in 2008 to Mark Selway, the previous chief executive, of 405,953 shares at a market price of 900.5p, which would have 
vested on 8 May 2011 subject to specified performance conditions being achieved, was forfeited as the vesting conditions of the award were not satisfied and, as a result, a 
credit of £0.8m was recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in 2009 in respect of the forfeited conditional share award.
The remaining contractual lives of the outstanding LTIP awards at the end of the period are as follows.

Fair value of equity settled share-based payments        
The fair value of the conditional awards under the LTIP have been estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table gives the assumptions made during 
the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010 and the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010.  
      
          2010 2009

The expected life of the awards is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption 
that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. Market related performance conditions have been taken into 
account in the calculation of fair values.

to amounts owed by related parties as the payment history has been excellent (2009: £nil). This assessment is undertaken each financial year through examining the financial 
position of the related party and the market in which the related party operates.

Group Financial Statements

30. Financial assets & liabilities
Financial risk management objectives & policies 
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, liquidity and credit risk. Foreign currency transactional risk arises when 
operating subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. Translational exposure arises on the translation of overseas 
earnings and investments into sterling for consolidated reporting purposes. Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract 
and liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due. In addition, the Group is subject to a degree of interest rate risk on its borrowings.  
The Group uses financial assets and liabilities, including derivative financial instruments, to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks as set out below.
Foreign exchange risk policy
Foreign currency transactional and translational risk could result in volatility in reported consolidated earnings and net assets.
Foreign currency transactional risk is managed by hedging significant exposures. The Group maintains a policy that all operating units eliminate exposures on material 
committed transactions, usually by undertaking forward foreign currency contracts through the Group treasury function. In addition, it is Group policy that those companies 
where the most significant concentration of foreign exchange risk has been identified also apply hedge accounting. Therefore, some of the Group’s forward foreign currency 
contracts form part of an effective cash flow hedge. Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the forward foreign currency contracts which form part of a cash flow hedge will 
have an impact on shareholders equity. Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the other forward foreign currency contracts will have an impact on profit or loss. It is Group 
policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind.
In respect of translational risk the Group has a policy to partially hedge United States dollar (“US$”) net assets exposure. This is achieved through designating an element of 
US dollar borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps as net investment hedges against the Group’s US dollar investments. The Group does not 
hedge the translational exposure arising from profit and loss items.
Liquidity risk policy
Liquidity risk could impact negatively on the Group’s reputation, borrowing costs or ultimately its ability to continue as a going concern. Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring 
forecast and actual cashflows and ensuring that sufficient committed facilities are in place to meet possible downside scenarios. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance 
between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans and fixed rate notes. Further details of the Group’s borrowing facilities are disclosed 
in note 20.
Credit risk policy
Credit risk could have a negative impact on reported earnings and cash and consequently the liquidity of the Group. 
The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments. The Group’s credit risk is primarily 
attributable to its trade receivables with risk spread over a large number of countries and customers with no significant concentration of risk. Where appropriate, the Group 
endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. Credit worthiness checks are also undertaken with external credit 
rating agencies before entering into contracts with new customers and credit limits are set as appropriate and adhered to. As shown in note 17, the trade receivables presented 
in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful debts. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identifiable loss event which, based on previous experience, 
is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. The Group’s exposure to the credit risk of financial institutions is limited by the adherence to counterparty limits 
and by only trading with counterparties that have a strong credit standing based upon ratings provided by the major agencies.
Interest rate risk policy
The Group’s borrowings are in a combination of fixed and variable rates of interest. Interest rate risk is regularly monitored to ensure that the mix of variable and fixed rate 
borrowing is appropriate for the Group in the short to medium-term. On 11 January 2010, the Group issued the equivalent of US$250.0m of five year (US$110.0m) and eight 
year (US$140.0m) fixed rate notes. This significantly increased the proportion of fixed rate borrowings from 18% as at 1 January 2010 to 44% as at 31 December 2010. All 
interest rate swaps, which had the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates, matured in 2010. 
Net investment in foreign operations
As at 31 December 2010, US dollar fixed rate notes of US$160.0m (2009: US$nil) and US dollar variable rate loans of US$322.5m (2009: US$175.0m) both included in interest-
bearing loans and borrowings, cross currency swaps of US$334.0m (2009: US$324.0m) and net forward foreign currency liability contracts of US$48.0m (2009: US$90.0m) 
have been designated as a hedge of the Group’s exposure to translational foreign exchange risk on its net investments in Weir SPM and Weir Warman. Gains or losses on the 
retranslation of the borrowings and the fair value of the cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on 
translation of the net investments in these subsidiaries. 112 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements

The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The derivative financial 
instruments are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs including spot and forward foreign exchange rates and interest rate curves. The fair value  
of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign 
exchange rates. The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward  
foreign exchange rates.
Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value. This requires disclosure of 
fair value measurements in the form of a three level fair value hierarchy, by class, for all financial instruments recognised at fair value. The Group uses the following hierarchy for 
determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
  Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
  Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; 
  Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
At 31 December 2010 and 1 January 2010, the Group held all financial instruments at level 2 fair value measurement. During the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010 and the 53 
weeks ended 1 January 2010, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into and out of level 3 fair value measurements.
The fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximate their carrying amount due to the short-term maturities 
of these instruments. The fair value of borrowings and obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on 
similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

Liquidity & credit risk 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.  
The liabilities which could impact liquidity risk are best represented by the carrying value and maturity profile of each financial liability, including derivative financial instruments. 
The following tables include the undiscounted cash flows of financial assets and liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to receive or pay these 
financial assets or liabilities and include both interest and principal cash flows. In respect of derivative financial instruments the net credit/ liquidity risk is best represented by the 
net inflows (outflows) shown below together with the Group’s headroom under the borrowing facilities as disclosed in note 20.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax and 
equity through the impact on floating rate borrowings, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps in respect of each currency to which the Group has a significant exposure 
to interest rate risk. There is no impact on the Group’s equity, with the exception of the Group’s interest rate swaps which matured in 2010.

Effect of hedging & derivative financial instruments included in the income statement & equity
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge currency risk associated with expected future sales or purchases for which the Group has firm commitments. The 
terms of the forward foreign currency contracts are negotiated to match the terms of the commitments. Within the Group, two subsidiaries apply cash flow hedge accounting 
to these transactions. Any gains and losses on ineffective hedges were taken to the income statement in the period. The interest rate swaps which the Group utilised to convert 
borrowings from floating to fixed rates of interest all matured during the period. These interest rate swaps were subject to cash flow hedge accounting. All other forward  
foreign currency contracts, while representing commercial hedges, are not subject to cash flow hedge accounting with all fair value movements being recognised in the  
income statement.  119

The £0.1m gain (2009: £0.9m) recognised in profit or loss in respect of cross currency swaps designated as net investment hedges reflects the benefit of US dollar / 
sterling interest rate differential. The Group’s forward foreign currency contracts subject to cash flow hedge accounting which were deemed to be ineffective during the 
period resulted in a net charge to the income statement of £0.3m (2009: £nil). In 2009, a portion of the Group’s interest rate swaps subject to cash flow hedge accounting 
were deemed to be ineffective during the period as a result of a forecast repayment of variable rate debt. This resulted in a net charge to the income statement of £3.7m.  
In 2010, there was no ineffectiveness in relation to the Group’s interest rate swaps. 120 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements

Foreign exchange risk 
The Group considers the most significant foreign exchange risk relates to the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro and US dollar. The following table demonstrates the 
sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in these foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity analysis shows the effect on profit 
or loss in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including payables, receivables, borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts but 
excluding all financial assets and liabilities qualified as either cash flow or net investment hedges. The sensitivity analysis also shows the effect on equity in respect of financial 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency qualified as either cash flow or net investment hedges including forward foreign currency contracts, borrowings and cross 
currency swaps. The sensitivity analysis adjusts the translation of each respective financial asset or liability at the financial year end for a 25% strengthening of sterling against 
the relevant exchange rates.

31. Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains robust capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value. The 
Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust 
the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group monitors capital using the following indicators.
Gearing ratio 
Gearing comprises net debt divided by total equity. Net debt comprises cash and short-term deposits and interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 26).

Independent auditors report to the members of  
The Weir Group PLC 
We have audited the Company financial statements of The Weir 
Group PLC for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010 which 
comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 
to 17. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Account-
ing Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required  
to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the  
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors & auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors statement of responsibilities 
set out on page 43, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Company financial statements and for being satisfied that  
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and  
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and dis-
closures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material  
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall  
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Company financial statements:
•   give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs  
as at 31 December 2010;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with United King-
dom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•  the part of the Remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
•  the information given in the Directors report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the  
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
•  the Company financial statements and the part of the Remu-
neration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of directors remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of The Weir Group PLC for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 
2010.

Notes to the  
Company Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies
The accounting policies which follow have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Basis of preparation 
The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and applicable accounting standards.
Foreign currency translation
The presentation and functional currency of the Company is sterling. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the Company’s functional currency 
at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the 
balance sheet date. Currency translation differences are recognised in the profit and loss account except when hedge accounting is applied.
Tangible assets 
Tangible assets are stated at cost and the cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life by equal annual instalments at rates of 7.5% for office equipment and 25% for 
computer equipment.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are held at historical cost less a provision for impairment.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that 
date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the exception that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the 
directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Post-employment benefits 
The Company and other UK subsidiaries of the Group participate in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans which are set up under separate trusts. These plans are 
operated on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities and, in accordance with FRS17, the Company 
accounts for its contributions to the plans as if they are defined contribution plans.
In addition, the Company has unfunded unapproved pension promises. Contributions are made to the plans on the advice of an independent qualified actuary. Pension plan 
liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the 
liability. Any increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Company’s unfunded unapproved pension promises expected to arise from employee service in the period 
is charged against operating profit. The increase in the period in the present value of the plan’s liabilities, arising from the passage of time, is included in other finance costs. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account when they become payable.
Leases
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Share-based payments
Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The Company recognises a compensation cost in 
respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards. The fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions 
on which the award was granted are modified. The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions 
or performance conditions.
As permitted by FRS20, the Company has applied FRS20 “Share-based Payment” retrospectively only to equity-settled awards that had not vested as at 1 January 2005 and 
were granted on or after 7 November 2002.
Financial assets & liabilities
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans, fixed rate notes, cash and  
short-term deposits. 
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. 125
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements. Additionally, the 
Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Derivative 
financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is 
calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency 
swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates. Changes in their fair values have 
been recognised in the profit and loss account, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by FRS26 are met. Hedge accounting is applied 
in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under FRS26 and practical to do so. When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships will be 
classified as a cash flow hedge.
To the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the profit and loss account. When 
the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the profit and loss account or, if the 
hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any 
cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS29 and has not disclosed information required by that standard in relation to derivative financial instruments as the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS7.
Treasury shares
The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale of 
such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves. No gain or loss is 
recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
2. Profit attributable to the Company
The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £94.3m (2009: £20.7m). In accordance with the concession granted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, 
the profit and loss account of the Company has not been separately presented in these financial statements.

The proposed dividend is based on the number of shares in issue, excluding treasury shares, at the date the financial statements were approved and authorised for issue. The 
final dividend may differ due to increases or decreases in the number of shares in issue between the date of approval of the report and financial statements and the record date 
for the final dividend.        
Directors        
Details of directors remuneration, benefits and LTIP awards are included in the Remuneration report on pages 44 to 51.
Auditors remuneration        
The total fees payable by the Company to Ernst & Young LLP for work performed in respect of the audit of the Company were £13,000 (2009: £13,000). Fees paid  
to Ernst & Young LLP for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in these accounts as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the Company 
is included, are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.         126 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements

Subsidiaries        
As at 31 December 2010, a provision of £5.1m (2009: £6.2m) has been made against the deficiency of underlying net assets in certain subsidiaries. It is expected that this 
amount will be settled within one year of the balance sheet date.        
Discontinued operations warranty & indemnity        
Provisions in respect of discontinued operations include provision for warranty and indemnity exposures under asset and share agreements. The provision as at 31 December 
2010 is based on management’s current best estimate of the remaining liabilities. The actual outcome may differ and, in some cases, this will be dependent on the outcome  
of legal proceedings. It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within two years of the balance sheet date with the remaining costs expected to be incurred 
within five years of the balance sheet date.  128 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements

In addition, the Company also participates in the defined benefit plan arrangements within The Weir Group Pension & Retirement Savings Scheme and The Weir Group 1972 
Pensions and Life Assurance Plan for Senior Executives. These defined benefits plans are funded multi-employer plans which are operated by The Weir Group PLC and which 
are run on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities. In accordance with FRS17, the Company accounts 
for its contributions to these plans as if they were defined contribution plans. While assets and liabilities in respect of these plans are not reflected on the Company’s balance 
sheet, details of these are set out below.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit method. The total contributions 
to the defined benefit plans in 2011 are expected to be £8.8m.
Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts 
to each category of plan assets and allowing for plan expenses. The actual return on plan assets in the period was a gain of £56.5m (2009: £93.4m).
The assets and liabilities of the plans and the long-term expected rates of return are as follows.

Capital gains tax
For the purpose of capital gains tax, the market value of an ordinary share of The Weir 
Group PLC as at 31 March 1982 was 29.75p. This market value has been adjusted 
to take account of the sub-division of the share capital whereby each ordinary share of 
25p was sub-divided into two ordinary shares of 12.5p each on 28 June 1993. Rights 
issues of ordinary shares took place in April 1987 at 157p per share on the basis of 
one new ordinary share for every seven ordinary shares held, in July 1990 at 250p 
per share on the basis of one new ordinary share for every five ordinary shares held 
and in September 1994 at 252p per share on the basis of one new ordinary share for 
every four ordinary shares held.

The Weir Group is well established in all three of our  
chosen markets: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Power & Industrial. 
Throughout 2010, we have used our superb manufacturing 
platform and resilient business model to deliver a perform-
ance that demonstrates our agility to respond quickly and 
benefit from changing market conditions. 
Customer focus is a precondition for sustainable growth. Recognising this we will 
continue to extend our position in the minerals, oil and gas and power sectors, 
all of which are high growth, long cycle markets with positive fundamentals. This 
strategy is underpinned by our three principal drivers of growth - Innovation, 
Collaboration and Global Capability - and will be delivered through organic 
growth supplemented by skillfully integrated, targeted acquisitions with continued 
investment in technology, infrastructure and people to grow our market share 
and our installed base of original equipment.

Market overview 
Market conditions improved in 2010 
underpinned by strong demand for com-
modities, particularly from emerging mar-
kets and a growing sector confidence. 
Most mothballed mines were re-started 
and increased activity was evident in the 
Canadian oil sands. Increases in capital 
expenditure were announced by some 
customers with a number of “mega-
projects” likely to get underway in 2011/12 
principally across South America and the 
Asia-Pacific region.
Weir Minerals is the global leader in the 
provision of slurry handling equipment 
and associated spare parts for abrasive 
high wear applications. Mining and min-
erals is the division’s largest sector but 
it has aligned product sales into niche 
markets, including oil sands and flue gas 
desulphurisation equipment. Products 
include pumps, hydrocyclones, valves, 
dewatering equipment and wear resistant 
linings and following the Linatex acqui-
sition – rubber products and screen-
ing machines. The partnership with KHD 
Humboldt extends the reach into high 
pressure grinding rollers, a new break-
through in milling technology.

Market overview 
The North American upstream mar-
ket experienced a substantial rebound 
in on-shore horizontal drilling with sig-
nificant investment in existing and new 
shale fields, requiring more intensive 
fracturing techniques. Average horizon-
tal rig counts increased 81% on 2009. 
International shale opportunities started 
to gain momentum in China, Europe and 
Australia. Downstream customer activity 
remained low while Middle East services 
market rebounded off 2009 lows in the 
second half.
Weir Oil & Gas designs and manufac-
tures pumps and ancillary equipment for 
the global upstream and downstream 
oil and gas markets and provides sub-
stantial aftermarket service and support. 
The upstream operation specialises in 
high-pressure well service pumps and 
related flow control equipment along 
with repairs, parts and service of pres-
sure control and upstream rotating equip-
ment. Downstream focuses on design 
and manufacture of centrifugal pumps, 
mainly for the refining industry. Principal 
operations are in North America, Europe 
and the Middle East, with an expanding 
geographic footprint in Asia Pacific and 
South America.

Market overview 
Demand for original equipment for the con-
ventional power market was strong in Asia 
but weak in Europe and North America. 
The Chinese nuclear market represented 
the majority of global nuclear new build, 
although procurement began for the first two 
new US nuclear plants in 25 years. Hydro 
and wind markets grew as demand for 
renewable power increased. Existing fossil 
and nuclear plants postponed non-essential 
maintenance, although new build delays will 
increase potential for life extension projects. 
Industrial markets remained weak.
Weir Power & Industrial designs, manufac-
tures and provides aftermarket support for 
specialist and critical-service rotating and 
flow control equipment mainly to the global 
power sector. The division includes valve 
operations; specialist pump, hydro and 
steam turbine businesses and aftermar-
ket operations in Europe, North America, 
Asia Pacific, Middle East, and South Africa. 
Three facilities hold nuclear certification 
making the business one of a few globally, 
capable of providing safety critical valves 
into the nuclear islands of the 3rd and 4th 
generation nuclear power stations. The 
BDK acquisition expanded the valve port-
folio, while American Hydro and Ynfiniti 
Engineering Services added to the renewa-
bles market position.

The Weir Way
The drivers of growth
The Group has a strong operating platform to drive growth 
both through organic development and value enhancing 
acquisitions. We also have a clear and focused strategy 
to build our functional capabilities and prioritise product 
innovation, collaboration and global capabilities as key 
enablers of growth in our chosen end markets, along with 
an increased commitment to research and development 
and investment in sales and engineering resources.

InnovatIve  
solutIons
Innovation is at the heart of our processes. Our global engineering 
teams work to ensure that products continually deliver longer plant 
life, extend maintenance cycles, reduce downtime and lower whole-life 
operating costs. As well as increasing our research and development 
spend, we strongly believe that innovation goes beyond technological 
aspects. Innovation is also about being proactive and creative in 
delivering operational improvement and increasing customer focus.

CollaboratIve  
MIndset
We believe we can achieve much more when we work together  
across businesses, divisions, markets and regions to solve problems 
and exploit market opportunities. Weir people are willing and able to 
work in partnership with each other, as well as with our customers and 
partners and during 2010 we further optimised our ability to operate 
to best effect across divisions and regions.

Global  
CaPabIlItY
We remain committed to going where our customers are, from the  
most challenging oil production environment, to the emerging 
power and energy markets and this commitment brings extensive 
opportunities for us to further internationalise our products and 
services. In 2010 we made considerable progress in leveraging our 
presence in some of the fastest growing emerging markets.

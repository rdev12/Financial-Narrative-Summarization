Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
Proposed final dividend +32.4% up to 4.5p (2007: 3.4p) Business at a glance
As at 31 December 2008 H&T was the largest
pawnbroking business in the UK in terms of the
size of the pledge book. As a business H&T has
existed in some form since the late 1800’s and
over the years has built or acquired some of the
oldest and largest pawnbrokers in the UK. Indeed
the store in Edinburgh has operated from the
same building for over 150 years serving the
same community.
More recently H&T has accelerated its development by adding new
products and services and expanding the store network. On 8 May
2006 H&T floated on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”)
providing the group with access to new sources of finance and
allowing the provision of equity based incentivisation to employees.
Since then, H&T has opened or acquired 36 stores.
H&T operates in a fast moving, competitive environment and 
will continue to succeed by focussing on customer needs, the
development and retention of staff and the ongoing development 
of existing and new products together with expansion in locations.

goods at any point during this time providing
that they repay the original loan amount plus
any interest due. At the end of the contract,
they also have the option to extend the loan 
for a further six months. If the customer chooses
not to redeem or renew the loan, H&T then
take action to dispose of the goods.
A pawnbroking loan is secured on an item of
value with a term of up to six months. H&T
value the item(s) based on weight and the
precious metal or stones used in its
manufacture. The customer agrees on a loan
amount and enters into a consumer credit
agreement. The agreement is for a period of 
6 months and the customer can redeem the
Pay Day Advance
The customer then has the option to: 
• Allow the cheques to be banked; 
• Pay them off in cash; or 
• Extend the cheques for a further 30 days
by paying the charge owed.
A Pay Day Advance (PDA) loan is a short term
cash loan repayable on the customer’s next pay
date. The service is used in a similar manner to
a bank overdraft and in fact the costs are
similar to a number of high street facilities. The
customer writes out cheques to H&T for the
value of up to £750 and is given the value of
the cheques less a 13% charge in cash.

loan agreement and we will collect the
repayments on the date agreed with the
customer. This product provides a useful way
for customers who are unable to repay a PDA
in full to manage down their loan with us.
Customers can have either a Kwikloan or 
a PDA, but not both at the same time.
Kwikloan is a simple way for customers to
obtain an unsecured loan of up to £750 which
is repaid over 12 months by direct debit.
Before issuing a loan we establish the
customer’s identity, confirm their income and
employment, and ensure that they manage their
bank account in a reasonable way. If approved
then the customer enters into a consumer credit

Cheque Cashing

almost two weeks to clear a cheque) or to
avoid banking the cheque into an overdrawn
account. Customers are required to provide
proof of identity and address in order to use
the service.
Third Party Cheque Cashing is a service that
allows customers to get cash for their cheques
in a few minutes, rather than banking the
cheque. Most cheques are wages cheques,
although other types such as personal, lottery,
building society and Giro are considered.
Customers use H&T to speed up the cheque

country. H&T staff are able to use their
extensive product knowledge to assist
customers to choose individual pieces to 
suit their requirements, a skill which of 
course enables them to make the right 
loan in the first place.
H&T offer a unique range of new and second-
hand jewellery sourced from our pledge book,
purchased over the counter or purchased from
suppliers. The vast majority of items sold are
from forfeited items and all are professionally
cleaned and restored at the company’s
refurbishment centre in Kent. They are then

leave the store with an ATM only card and the
personalised Mastercard arrives in the post
shortly after. Cash can then be loaded to the
card at over 14,000 locations across the UK,
including any H&T store or Post Office branch.
A pre-paid debit card is an ideal way for
customers to have the functionality of a
Mastercard without the associated credit,
giving them the freedom to shop online, over
the phone or in store. As there is no loan or
credit involved the application process is simple
Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements What is Pawnbroking?
H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 4
Pawnbroking is quite simply a loan secured on an item of
value. Traditionally pawnbrokers would accept almost
anything of value in order to secure the loan. The H&T
pawnbroking offer is mainly based on jewellery as it is
compact, high value and can be valued and if necessary
resold relatively easily.
How does it work?
The customer brings in the item(s) of value to the
store and is asked to give an indication of how
much they want to borrow. This is done in order 
to establish how realistic the customer’s expectation
is, as the high margins charged by the high street
jewellers can give an inflated perception of the
value of the goods. The store staff then use a
combination of their expertise and training, together
with the point of sale system to determine if there is
adequate security for the loan. Assuming that there
is, the customer and H&T then enter into a credit
agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act.
This is a contract for 6 months and carries interest of
8% to 10% flat rate per month. The rate charged is
dependent on local competition and the location of
the store.
During the contract the customer can:
• Redeem the pledge. This means they pay
H&T the value of the loan, plus the interest
accrued to date; or
• Renew the pledge. This means they pay H&T
the interest only and a new loan agreement is
issued for a further six months.
Approximately five months after the date of the loan
we will write to the customer explaining that the
contract is almost due and reminding them of the
final date to redeem. We write again once the
contract is expired to give the customer one more
chance to redeem or renew their pledge.
If the customer does not redeem or renew then we
have to attempt to realise the value of the pledge 
to repay the loan. 
The Consumer Credit Act sets out a different
treatment for pledges over £75 and those £75 and
under.
• Over £75: These pledges are sent to public
auction with a reserve price. In the event that the
pledge is sold then H&T retains the value of the
loan, interest to date plus a small administration
fee. Any surplus is repaid to the customer.
• £75 and under: These pledges become the
property of H&T immediately; the rules relating
to the surplus do not apply due to the lower
value of the items concerned.
Regardless of the outcome H&T does not pursue 
the customer in the rare circumstances when there 
is a shortfall between the amount due under the
agreement and the amount recovered when the 
item is sold. Therefore if the customer is unable 
to redeem there will be no further consequences 
and their credit rating is unaffected.
As Good as Gold
For some, lending money can be a risky business, but not for H&T. The loan
is secured on gold and precious stones (over 98% of our pawnbroking
business) and that security is left in our possession for the duration of the
contract. If the loan forfeits, then the collateral can be easily liquidated, in
almost all cases at a profit. Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
Valuations, how H&T manage the process
H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 5
A pawnbroker advances money secured on 
items of value. Therefore it is vital that we can
determine what those items are worth to ensure
adequate security, whilst also being able to give
the customer what they want.
H&T’s pledge book is almost entirely gold
and diamond set jewellery, as those items
are relatively easy to value and in the
event of default they can be sold either
through the window or as a commodity.
Our staff ask the customer how much
they would like to borrow and perform a
visual examination of the item. Using the
weight and metal type we now have a
good idea of what the item is worth
based on our general lending guidelines.
If we can meet the customer’s expectations
then the item is tested with a range of
acids to determine the metal type and
carat, while diamonds are verified using
electronic testing equipment. 
The customer details and a full description
of the item are entered to the computer
system which calculates a range of loan
values in accordance with Group policy.
A credit agreement is produced and the
cash issued to the customer.

Our Customers
Our pawnbroking customers come from 
a wide range of social and demographic
backgrounds and bring with them a
multitude of different items of jewellery, 
from a heavyweight belcher chain to a
1970s Rolex to a 5ct diamond solitaire.
The single factor that unites them is 
the ownership of an asset and a
requirement for short term cash.
Use of Funds
Generally our customers use the funds
obtained for day to day expenses with
a small number borrowing to solve the
short term cash needs of their
businesses.
The H&T Difference
H&T has a long established culture 
of customer service and our staff 
strive to help and empathise with our
customers. It is common to hear first
names being used in the stores and
equally the customer to call our staff 
by their first name. This is not the 
result of scripts or training but rather
an expectation that they are there to
help the customer during what may 
be a difficult time. The key to this
relationship is the autonomy given 
to the store managers in their
management of the customer
relationship. This maintains the
customer relationship and provides 
that flexibility and helpfulness that 
is so often missing from the rest of 
the high street.
December 2006 Research
Historically we have scored well in
independent research and mystery
shopping of our stores. The most 
recent survey was in December 2006*
using both quantitative and qualitative
techniques and interviews of 250
customers. Once again the research
demonstrated high levels of customer
satisfaction, with over 88% of
customers rating their satisfaction 
with H&T 8 or more out of 10.

Chairman’s Statement
The directors and I are very pleased with H&T’s
performance in 2008. It was another year of record
financial results with profit before tax and exceptional
items reaching £10.9 million (2007: £7.2 million).
We opened 16 new stores in the year (2007: 12),
including our 100th store in Stockton, and had 105
stores trading at 31 December 2008 (2007: 89).
Financial Performance
H&T exceeded internal financial targets set by the
Board for the Group at the beginning of the year
and, in the process, achieved record gross profit
and earnings per share. 
Gross profit increased by 28.9 per cent. to £35.7
million (2007: £27.7 million) driven by new stores,
like-for-like growth and continued rise in the gold
price (contributing an estimated £1.8 million
additional profit when compared with FY07).
Earnings Before Interest Taxation Depreciation 
and Amortisation (“EBITDA”) before exceptional
items increased by 38.6 per cent. to £15.8 million
(2007: £11.4 million). Operating profit before
exceptional items increased by 41.0 per cent. 
to £14.1 million (2007: £10.0 million).
Basic earnings per share was up from 15.17 
pence in 2007 to 20.27 pence in 2008. 
Net cash generated by our operating activities
increased by £1.5 million to £4.1 million (2007:
£2.6 million) and the Group has bank funding in
place to May 2011.
Final Dividend
Subject to shareholder approval, a final dividend 
of 4.5 pence per ordinary share (2007: 3.4
pence) up 32 per cent. on 2007 will be paid on 
3 June 2009 to shareholders on the register at the
close of business on 8 May 2009. The shares will
be marked ex-dividend on 6 May 2009. This will
bring the full year dividend to 6.5 pence per share,
a 30 per cent. increase on 2007 (5.0 pence).
The growth in dividend reflects the good
performance of the Group in 2008 and the 
Board’s confidence in future prospects.
Prospects
We do not consider Pawnbroking to be a cyclical
business. We are benefiting from the price of gold
in our disposition activities and, unlike other
lending businesses, pawnbroking has resilient
collateral. The Group has so far seen an increase
in the number of new pawnbroking customers in
line with historical trends and the expansion in our
store estate. Our strong financial performance is
the result of a successful growth strategy which we
intend to continue in 2009. 
I would like to thank all our staff for their hard work
and contribution to these excellent results. I also

the end of March 2009 to return to continental
Europe, and welcome Alex Maby his successor.

Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
H&T’s overall growth strategy can be summarised as:
• Increase footprint through new build and acquisition
• Improve performance of existing products
• Develop and implement new products and services
The expansion in the estate is key to the long term growth 
of the business but at the same time actually reduces
earnings at profit before tax level in the short term. The
challenge for H&T is therefore to deliver growth from the
core stores to enable this growth, whilst at the same time
continually improving the early performance of new stores to
reduce the profit lag.
New Store Profile
H&T’s new store profile is quite different to a traditional
retailer in that a new store will dilute profits and be capital
intensive in the short term while the pledge book grows and
the store establishes itself. Increasing profitability in the early 
years through maximising the income from other products 
is therefore a key challenge for the business.
The growth in profitability of the new stores continues for
many years, indeed the stores over 10 years old still deliver 
a significant proportion of the Group’s earnings growth.
Store Format
The store format has evolved over the last 10 years from a
pure financial services model, with no retail, to a format that
resembles a high street jeweller with a secure building society
style counter to serve the financial services customers.
Where possible we now include open retail counters as part
of the internal fit out together with a large jewellery display
in the window. This provides us with an improved retail
potential which enables us to increase the early performance
of the new store.
The presence of retail in the stores also serves as a
communication tool to the customer, clearly demonstrating
those products on which we will lend money. Pawnbroking
still has a stigma attached to it and some customers like the
retail proposition as it provides another reason to be in the
store. Many consumers also see pawnbrokers as a way to
get a better deal on quality jewellery on the high street.
The developments in the store format have improved the first
year performance from an average £40k EBITDA loss in
Year 1 to break even. We intend to continue this process
through further evolution in our staff development, store
format and marketing communication.
Expansion in the store estate
Growth so far
During the last four years H&T has almost doubled in size,
entering a number of new markets nationally as well as
consolidating our position in key areas. We believe that
there is still significant potential in the UK and we are well
placed to capitalise on it

H&T opened its 100th store in Stockton-on-Tees on 27th
October 2008, which marked a real milestone for the
company. 
The Stockton store increases the company’s presence in
the North-East of England, where we now have seven
stores. Pawnbroking in this area has been historically
strong.
H&T traded from 105 outlets across the UK at the end
of 2008, an increase of 16 from 2007.
The 100th store was opened by Operations Director
Alan Lilley and Store Manager Margaret Watson,
amidst a grand opening frenzy including champagne
and refreshments for the customers, as well as a
competition to win a diamond ring, which generated
some positive local press coverage on the day.
Staff across all other branches also celebrated the
opening with an internal competition. 
With H&T now having a recognised presence on the
High Street, this only adds to the fact that we continue
to be the country’s leading pawnbroker by size of
pledge book. 
Store staff have reacted well to the opening of the
100th store, as it makes them feel part of a larger,
recognised company and brand.

Glasgow Chief Executive’s Review
H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 12
H&T’s clear growth strategy has delivered another strong
financial and operational performance, with record profits
and a record number of new stores. This growth was
achieved despite the negative economic climate impacting
the UK and world economy.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Pawn Service Charge 
H&T has been the largest pawnbroker in the UK
based on the size of the pledge book for many
years with a current pledge book of £32.0 million
(2007: £27.8 million). This increase in the pledge
book translated to a 15.2 per cent. increase in
Pawn Service Charge. The pledge book generated
£19.7 million of net revenues directly through the
Pawn Service Charge and £11.9 million indirectly
through the disposition process. Pawnbroking is 
and will remain the core of H&T’s business. To date
there has been no tangible evidence to prove that
an economic recession would be beneficial to
pawnbroking. We believe that the increase in 
new customers arise from:
• The increased number of outlets; 
• The high street location and modern lay out 
of our stores;
• The simplicity of the product in terms of pricing
and security; 
• The quality of our customer service which 
leads to high levels of customer retention and
repeat business.
Disposition
The sale of forfeited items to the general public
(“Retail”) is the most important element of
Disposition, generating higher margins when
compared with scrap or auction. 2008 proved 
a difficult year for the high-street retail environment
with many retailers, including jewellers, reporting
negative like-for-like results for the year, further
highlighted by trading deterioration during the 
last quarter of 2008. Despite this challenging
environment, I am delighted to report that we
achieved retail turnover growth of 32.5 per cent.
(10.7 per cent turnover growth on a like-for-like
basis) and maintained our retail gross margin at 
49 per cent.
Once again we have achieved double digit growth
in gross profit in our major business segments.
Pawnbroking activities, comprising Pawn Service
Charge and Disposition, represented 89 per cent.
(2007: 87 per cent.) of total 2008 gross profits 
and grew 32 per cent. year-on-year. The demand
for all these products was strong and the business
benefited from the price of gold. At the same time
financial services activities, comprising Cheque
Cashing and Other Financial Services, grew 12 
per cent. year-on-year and represented 11 per cent.
(2007: 13 per cent.) of total 2008 gross profits. 
The performance of the financial services products
was mixed with the overall gross profit growth
primarily delivered by the Pay Day Advance
product .
H&T remains the UK’s leading pawnbroker by size
of pledge book and at 31 December 2008 had
105 outlets across the UK. The estate increased by
16 store openings (2007: 12) during 2008. Of
those, 12 (2007: 5) were greenfield stores and 4
(2007: 7) were acquired branches. Further progress
was made on the new greenfield store layout which
has contributed to EBITDA profitability on average
now being achieved in the first year of a greenfield
site trading. The Group has opened or acquired 46
stores (44 per cent. of the total estate) over the last
four years.
The continuing growth we derive from our
established and greenfield stores has led to record
profits. Operating profit before exceptional items
reached £14.1 million (2007: £10.0 million), a 
41 per cent. increase on 2007 and 76 per cent.

Pawn Service Charge gross profit
(£’000)
Pawn Service Charge
Pawn Service Charge (PSC) represents all income earned 
up to the completion of a pledge. The main items are interest
and net profit from auctions after returning any surplus to the
customer.
In 2008 PSC represented 55% of total net revenues (2007:
62%) and 62% of total pawnbroking income (2007: 71%).
The reduction of PSC as a percentage of the total group net
revenues is due to the strong increase in disposition
turnover and margin.
The average loan in 2008 was £125 (2007: £111) and
the yield on the pledgebook was 65% (2007:66%). The
increase in the average loan is partly driven by the increase
in the gold price and the full effect of purchasing where
loans with lower values used to be pawned.
Disposition
Disposition refers to the entire process to dispose of
forfeited pledges. The key routes are retail through the
stores and scrap. Given the higher margin our preferred
route is via retail.
Retail
The Company’s retail proposition is primarily gold and
jewellery and the large majority (90.4%) of retail sales are
items sourced from pawnbroking or purchasing operations.
We complement our retail offering with a small amount of 
new jewellery. The turnover of new jewellery increased
sharply in 2008 with the introduction of some new ranges
which have been attracting new retail customers. 
We have incorporated the retail offering into all but one H&T
branded outlet and all new H&T Pawnbrokers now have a
dedicated retail window, most including an internal display
with a separate retail counter.
Profitability in this area is driven by sound valuation at the
point of purchase or lending and also by the management 
of appropriate stock. Our preference is to retail the stock that
is produced from forfeited loans to maximise our returns.
The advantage of H&T over other retailers is that the cost of
our supply is relatively low and we can scrap surplus items
and still make a profit. This offsets the fact that we have little
choice over our supply and therefore must retail what we have
available to sell.
As almost all items retailed come from pawnbroking or
purchasing operations we are able to offer an excellent value
proposition that is extremely hard to beat on the high street.
Scrap
Items that are damaged beyond repair, slow moving or surplus
to retail requirement, may be smelted and sold at the current
gold spot price less a small commission. The point of sale
system reduces the amount lent or paid on items identified as
scrap or low quality so we are still able to make a reasonable
margin on scrap sales.

Chief Executive’s Review (continued)
This strong performance in retail is a result of
different factors:
• Continued investment in staff training;
• Investment in new retail displays and windows;
and
• Introduction of some new jewellery ranges
supplementing the existing second hand product
range.
Scrap represents an increasingly important element
of disposition. Scrap profit in 2008 reached £4.8
million (2007: £1.5 million). This £3.3 million
increase can be analysed into two parts:
• The increase in the price of gold contributing
£1.8 million. The gold price in Sterling terms
continued to rise throughout 2008 mostly as 
a result of the strengthening of the US Dollar
currency; and
• The higher scrap volume contributing £1.5
million driven mostly by the success of gold 
and jewellery purchasing.
The Board announced in the 2008 interim report 
its intention to hedge some of its exposure to gold
price movement in order to protect its current scrap
margin. With the continued rise in the gold price,
the Board has decided to put its hedging strategy
on hold.
Total disposition gross profit increased to £12.0
million (2007: £6.9 million).
OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Cheque Cashing (comprising Third Party Cheque
Cashing and Pay Day Advance)
During 2008, Third Party Cheque Cashing turnover
declined by 1.1 per cent. due to deteriorating
market conditions and increasing competition. We
expect this downwards trend to continue during
2009 and it may worsen in line with the general
economy.
Pay Day Advance continues to provide excellent
growth. Due to the expanding loan book and the
current economic climate, we experienced a small
increase in the percentage of bad debt. The Group
has in place a number of controls and indicators to
monitor the bad debt for these products and the
collection of arrears to mitigate this risk. H&T also
caps the weekly amount of new Pay Day Advance
business written in order to manage the profile of
the Pay Day Advance product growth. During
2009, H&T will continue to invest in new systems 
to enhance product underwriting and collection of
arrears. 
The revenues net of bad debt and provisions from
Third Party Cheque Cashing and Pay Day Advance
increased to £3.8 million (2007: £3.4 million).
KwikLoan
In view of the worsening economic and credit
climate, the Group decided, at the beginning of
2008, to adopt a cautious approach as regards to
signing up new KwikLoan customers. As a result the
KwikLoan loan book decreased from £0.5 million 
to £0.4 million during the year while KwikLoan
gross profit was flat year-on-year. 
Point of sale development
We look to invest in new technology in order to
improve operational efficiency, enhance
management information and risk management
systems, and simplify store operations to enable us
to achieve the full potential of the existing product
range and implement new products more easily.
In 2006 we commenced the development of our
new point of sale system and expected to implement
the solution in the summer of 2007. Due to the
delays and inability by the third party software
developers to complete the application, the contract
was terminated in December 2008. The intangible
asset was written off resulting in a £0.8 million
exceptional loss. 
In view of the repeated delays in the overall project,
the Board determined in early 2008 that a
contingency plan was required in the event that 
the project failed. This has proved to be the right
decision since the development work on this
alternative has been progressing rapidly and will 
be undergoing user acceptance testing in the first
half of 2009 with a planned deployment shortly
thereafter. This software is considered to carry 
lower risks than the initial point of sale development
project as it is built on current proven systems which

Third Party Cheque Cashing
Third Party Cheque Cashing is the provision of cash in
exchange for a cheque payable to our customer for a
commission fee based on the face value of the cheque. The
average cheque value in 2008 was £332 (2007: £355),
with the average fee being £21 (6.4%) (2007: £23 (6.4%)).
The cheques are normally in respect of wages and the
service is used as a quick and convenient alternative to a
bank overdraft. The product simply serves a short term need
for cash.
In order to manage the risk associated with cashing third party
cheques we have access to a variety of information, from credit
reference agencies to internet directories, as well as our own
point of sale system and database of customer activity. 
Pay Day Advance
Pay Day Advance is a simple form of credit, where the
advance is repaid by cheques presented by the customer at
the point of the loan. The contract allows for 30 days credit
and the average advance in 2008 was £458 (2007: £452),
with a typical charge of 13% (2007: 13%) per 30 days.
The customer will agree a date for the cheque to be banked,
then either:
• Pay additional fees for another 30 days (Extend); or
• Pay the face value of the cheque in cash (Settle); or
• Allow the cheque to be deposited into our account.
KwikLoan
H&T identified the need for an unsecured loan product that
had a longer duration than a Pay Day Advance. The
principle is that some customers are unable to repay the lump
sum of a Pay Day Advance after 30 days and prefer a
smaller regular repayment. The underwriting criteria are
essentially the same as for a Pay Day Advance although we
do more verification to ensure that the customer is likely to be
a reasonable risk for the duration of the loan.
KwikLoan is currently offered over a 12 month period for
loan values up to £750, although the average is closer to
£600. We earn approximately £300 gross interest on a
£500 KwikLoan over a 12 month period.
Prepaid Debit Card
H&T offer a prepaid debit card on behalf of Advanced
Payment Solutions (APS) under the CashPlus brand. The card
is an instant issue Cirrus card (which allows ATM access
immediately), with a personalised MasterCard issued to the
customer in the post within 10 days. For further product
information refer to www.apsgroup.com.
H&T were the first national chain to provide the CashPlus
card in the UK and we remain one of the largest customers of
APS.
The card is the ideal vehicle to provide funds to our
customers in a more convenient form than cash. The card is
the natural extension to each of our cash based products,
with the store staff cross selling the benefit as part of our
pawnbroking and cheque cashing transactions. We expect
the card to enhance our relationship with customers,
increasing retention and loyalty as they will use our outlets to
load additional funds on to the card.
The customers value the status of having a MasterCard and
the ability to use the card online, with over half the
transactions on the card being for internet purchases.

were originally implemented in January 2006 in 
our cheque cashing business. This system can also
be deployed in stages, thus reducing risks and
costs. The overall project including the new point 
of sale system is still planned to complete within the
original £1.8 million budget. This budget includes
new hardware which has mostly been acquired at
the balance sheet date.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY
Expand geographical footprint
The significant fragmentation in the UK
pawnbroking market will continue to provide the
Group with acquisition opportunities. In addition,
there remains substantial opportunity for organic
growth with a significant number of towns with 
an appropriate population size and demographic
mix to support a greenfield store.
H&T’s strategy at IPO was originally to add 30
stores between 2006 and 2008, both through
greenfield stores and acquisitions, using current
resources whilst maintaining cash flow and earnings
growth at an appropriate level. During 2008, H&T
added 16 outlets (2007: 12) to the store portfolio -
twelve greenfield and four acquisitions. This brings
the total number of new stores to 36 since IPO,
seven stores ahead of the original three-year plan.
Our greenfield stores are performing well and have
on average exceeded our expectations in terms of
pledge book growth and profitability. While new
stores used to be loss-making at EBITDA level in 
their first full year of trading, we are pleased to
report that our new stores are now on average
breaking even in their first year of trading. This 
has been achieved through improved store layouts,
the introduction of gold purchasing and the quality
and enthusiasm of our staff. Whilst encouraging, 
we note that given the maturity of these stores they 
will not have a significant impact on revenues in 
the immediate term. These stores will nevertheless
deliver a greater contribution to group profitability
over the next few years.
The Group is also actively pursuing acquisitions 
to accelerate the consolidation of the industry. 
In 2007 the Group issued 3.6 million shares to
raise additional capital of £7 million, of which 
£3.4 million remained at the 31 December 2007. 
The Group spent £1.6 million during 2008 on
acquisitions and has deployed the remaining 
capital in greenfield stores.
Develop and establish new products and services
During 2007 we introduced the purchase of gold
and jewellery into all of our stores. This strategy
proved very successful as evidenced by the sharp
increase in scrap profit. Although this may be
reducing the pledge book as customers who would
previously pledge now sell, it allows a more efficient
use of capital. More importantly this service also
allows for much simpler communication to new
customers whose conversion into regular
pawnbroking customers will be a focus in 2009. 
Due to H&T’s success with stores focusing primarily
on pawnbroking and jewellery, the Board decided
to end the Get>Go trial and rebranded the two 
trial stores as “H&T Pawnbrokers”. The Group
anticipates that the turnover from the current
Get>Go financial services offered should remain
unchanged and the stores profitability is expected 
to increase driven by the development of
pawnbroking and the introduction of jewellery retail.
REVIEW OF THE PAWNBROKING MARKET
The competitive environment has not changed
substantially in the last year.
The pawnbroking industry remains very fragmented.
Although there are no official statistics, the National
Pawnbrokers Association estimates that there are
around one thousand pawnbroking locations in the
UK.
It is critical to maintain the high levels of customer
service in store and by doing so we will continue 
to be the first choice for our customers.
Current Trading and Outlook
The directors remain cautious about the current
uncertain economic climate though the Board does
not see the overall business as cyclical. Since the
beginning of 2009, trading has been positive, in
part benefiting from the gold price level. We will
continue to build on H&T’s proven business model
and strategy to deliver revenue growth through
2009 and beyond.
I would like to thank, on behalf of the Board, all our
people whose skills, commitment and enthusiasm
continue to drive our success and give us confidence
in our future.
John G Nichols
Chief Executive H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 17
Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
Finance Director’s Review
Turnover and gross profit
Turnover in 2008 amounted to £52.9 million compared with
£38.4 million in 2007. Total gross profit in 2008 increased 
by 28.9 per cent. to £35.7 million (2007: £27.7 million)
driven by the strong turnover growth (increase of 36.2 per
cent.) across the Pawnbroking, Retail and Scrap business
segments. 
Other direct and Administrative expenses 
The Group’s combined Other direct and Administrative
expenses before exceptional items in 2008 were £21.6 million
compared with £17.7 million in 2007. This 22.0 per cent.
increase in expenses was primarily driven by the addition 
of sixteen additional stores, the full year impact of the twelve
stores opened in 2007 and the overall increase in business
volumes. 
Operating profit
During 2008, EBITDA before exceptional items increased by
38.6 per cent. to £15.8 million (2007: £11.4 million). The
Group recorded a 41.0 per cent. increase in operating profit
before exceptional items reporting £14.1 million in 2008
compared with £10.0 million in the previous year. Exceptional
expenses in 2008 of £0.8 million relate to the write off of the
bespoke point of sale system. After taking account of the
exceptional items, operating profit was £13.3 million in 2008
compared with £10.0 million in 2007. 
Finance costs and similar charges
Finance costs decreased marginally by £0.1 million from 
£2.7 million in 2007 to £2.6 million in 2008. Included in 
the finance costs is a £0.6 million loss in the movement in 
fair value of interest rate swap reflecting the sharp drop in 
the LIBOR rate. This economic hedge (which is not accounted
for as a hedge under IAS 39) will terminate in June 2009 
and the Group anticipates that a new economic hedge will 
be taken out.
Profit before taxation
Profit before taxation and exceptional items increased by 
£3.7 million from £7.2 million in 2007 to £10.9 million in
2008. The 2007 result was enhanced by an exceptional profit
consisting of £0.2 million profit relating to the disposal of a
freehold property while the 2008 result was impacted by the
£0.8 million exceptional loss referred to previously. As a result,
the Group recorded a record profit before taxation of £10.1
million in 2008 compared with a profit before taxation of 
£7.4 million in 2007. 
Taxation
The effective corporation tax rate excluding exceptional items
was 29 per cent. for the year (31 per cent. in 2007). The
decrease reflects the fall in the UK corporation tax rate to 
28 per cent from 1 April 2008, and the overall effective tax
rate is close to the blended 2008 tax rate of 28.5 per cent 
for the year.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share for 2008 was 20.27 pence
compared with 15.17 pence in 2007. Diluted earnings per
share for 2008 was 20.26 pence compared with 15.14 pence
in 2007. After adjusting for exceptional items referred to in the
Profit before taxation section, adjusted basic earnings per share
increased by 49.3 per cent. from 14.72 pence in 2007 to
21.97 pence in 2008.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 4.5 pence per
share (2007: 3.4 pence) bringing the 2008 full year dividend
to 6.5 pence (2007: 5.0 pence).
Cash flow and investments
The Group generated cash from operations before interest
payments and taxation of £8.6 million in 2008 (2007: £6.3
million). This result was impacted by the increase in receivables
(£4.9million) driven by the growth in the pledge book and loan
portfolio, the increase in inventories (£3.7 million) required to
support the larger retail offering, offset by a £1.2 million
increase in payables. During 2008 the Group invested £1.6
million (2007: £3.6 million) in the acquisition of the trade and
assets of four pawnbrokers . 
Capital expenditure on tangible fixed assets during the year
was £3.3 million (2007: £1.9 million) £3.1 million of which
related to the 12 new greenfield stores opened during the year
and the estate refurbishment program. A further £0.4 million
was also invested in the new EPOS software reported in
intangible assets and subsequently impaired. 
Debt structure
The Group repaid £2.0 million of facility A debt in 2008
(2007: £1.5 million) while drawing down £5.0 million from
other banking facilities. Net debt (before unamortised debt
issue costs) was £34.4 million at 31 December 2008
compared with £32.2 million at 31 December 2007. 
The Group has in place a hedging agreement fixing the 
interest rate on £35.0 million of banking debt for a period
ending 30 June 2009. H&T’s current debt facilities extend to
May 2011 and the Group remains compliant with all its
banking covenants. In 2008, H&T’s EBITDA to interest ratio
(interest cover) was 6.7x (2007: 4.6x).
Return on capital employed (ROCE)
ROCE, defined as profit before tax excluding exceptional items,
interest receivable, finance costs and movement in fair value 
of interest rate swap as a proportion of net current assets and
tangible and intangible fixed assets (excluding goodwill),
increased from 21.7 per cent. in 2007 to 26.3 per cent. in
2008. 
Going concern
After careful consideration, I am pleased to report that our
budget for FY09 and FY10 supports in all reasonable scenarios
that the Group is a going concern. Further details of our
assessment are included in the Corporate Governance section
of this annual report.

corporate governance practices in the best interests of all
shareholders. Although the Company is not required to report
on compliance with the Combined Code (“the Code”) since its
shares are traded on the AIM market, the Company complies,
so far as practical, with the Code in the following ways:
DIRECTORS
The Board
The Board comprises three executive directors and three non-
executive directors. Their biographies appear on page 18. 
A review of these shows a range of experience and expertise
sufficient to bring independent judgement on issues of strategy,
performance, resources and standards of conduct which is
vital to the success of the Group. The three non-executive
directors hold shares (as disclosed page 25). However,
because the number of shares held is small and there are no
cross directorships between executive and non-executive
directors, the non-executive directors are considered to be
independent. Laurent Genthialon has advised the Board of his
decision to resign on 20 March 2009. He will be replaced by
Alex Maby who was appointed to the Board on 19 March
2009.
Board meetings
The Board is responsible to the shareholders for the proper
management of the Group. A statement of directors’
responsibilities in respect of the financial statement is set out 
in this Annual Report on page 27. 
The Board meets 10 times during the year. To enable the
Board to discharge its duties, all directors receive appropriate
and timely information. Briefing papers are distributed to all
directors in advance of the Board meetings. There is a formal
schedule of matters reserved to the Board which include the
determination of strategy, approval of new stores and
acquisitions, approval of budget and major capital
expenditure. 
At Board meetings, the agenda normally comprises a review
of the management accounts, a CEO review of operations, a
review of new store proposals and potential acquisitions and
an update on the progress of the Group’s other strategic
objectives. 
The Board meetings in August and March cover the approval
of the interim and preliminary financial results respectively and
the November meeting deals with the approval of the annual
budget.
The following committees deal with the specific aspects of the
Group’s affairs:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent
Non-Executive Directors of the Company. The members of the
Committee are:
• Peter D McNamara (Chairman)
• Malcolm L Berryman
• Andrew J Brown
The Committee meets at least once in each year and at such
other times as the Chairman of the Committee sees fit.
The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the Board 
on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. The
quorum for the Committee is two.
The duties of the Committee are to:
• determine and agree with the Board the framework 
or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman,
executive Directors and any employees that the Board
delegates to it;
• within the terms of the agreed policy, determine individual
remuneration packages including bonuses, incentive
payments, share options, pension arrangements and any
other benefits;
• determine the contractual terms on termination and
individual termination payments, ensuring that the duty 
of the individual to mitigate loss is fully recognised;
• in determining individual packages and arrangements,
give due regard to the comments and recommendations 
of the Combined Code;
• be told of and be given the chance to advise on any major
changes in employee benefit structures in the Company;
• recommend and monitor the level and structure of
remuneration for senior managers below Board level as
determined;
• agree the policy for authorising claims for expenses from
the Chief Executive and from the Chairman of the Board;
and
• recommend an annual report for the Board to put to
Shareholders on executive remuneration compliant with
relevant legal and regulatory provisions.
The Committee is authorised by the Board to:
• seek any information it requires from any employee 
of the Group in order to perform its duties;
• be responsible for establishing the selection criteria 
and then for selecting, appointing and setting the terms 
of reference for any remuneration consultants providing
advice to the Committee, at the Group’s expense; and
• obtain, at the Group’s expense, outside legal or other
professional advice where necessary in the course of 
its activities.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three independent Non-
Executive Directors of the Company. The members of the
Committee are:
• Andrew J Brown (Chairman) - Chartered Accountant
• Malcolm L Berryman
• Peter D McNamara
The Audit Committee reviews each year the arrangements for
safeguarding auditor objectivity and independence. The Audit
Committee reviews the scope, results and cost-effectiveness of
internal and external audit, and has delegated power from the
Board to exercise the power from shareholders to agree fees
for external auditors. The Audit Committee is responsible for
satisfying itself on the independence of internal auditors and
on the independence and objectivity of external auditors. 
The Committee reviews the operation of internal controls 
and reports to the Board on the annual review of the internal
control and risk management.

Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises three independent Non-
Executive Directors of the Company. The members of the
Committee are:
• Peter D McNamara (Chairman)
• Malcolm L Berryman
• Andrew J Brown
The function of the Nomination Committee is to provide a
formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the
appointment of new Directors to the Board. In carrying out its
duties, the Nomination Committee is primarily responsible for:
• identifying and nominating candidates to fill Board
vacancies;
• evaluating the structure and composition of the Board with
regard to the balance of skills, knowledge and experience
and making recommendations accordingly;
• reviewing the time requirements of Non-Executive Directors;
• giving full consideration to succession planning; and
• reviewing the leadership of the Group.
Internal control
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s
system of internal control and for the continuing process of
reviewing the effectiveness of the internal controls. Internal
control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss. The directors confirm that they
have reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of internal
control that have been in operation during the year. The
Group has an internal audit function principally for periodic
store visits. 
lnternal control: financial
The internal control process has been reviewed and its main
features are:
• Financial Reporting: there is a comprehensive budgeting
system with an annual budget approved by the Board.
Monthly trading results are reported against the
corresponding figures for the budget and previous year.
The Board also reviews re-forecasts on a regular basis.
• Capital Expenditure: there is a comprehensive budgeting
system for capital expenditure with an annual budget
approved by the Board. The Finance Director authorises
individual items of capital expenditure and material items
are also authorised by the Board or CEO.
• Cash flow: an annual cash flow forecast is drawn up and
approved by the Board and actual cash flow is reviewed
monthly against this forecast.
• Organisational Structure: a clear organisational structure
with defined responsibilities and clear authority levels has
been set.
• Store Audits: a Stores Audit function exists to ensure that
Group procedures regarding cash, pledges and stock
handling are being adhered to.
Internal control: risk management 
During the year, the Group had in place formalised
procedures to identify, evaluate and manage significant risks
and to enable management to assess and regularly report to
the board on issues relating to business, operational, financial
and non-compliance risks.
Relations with shareholders
The board recognises the importance of communications 
with shareholders. The Chief Executive’s statement and the
operational review on pages 12 to 16 include a detailed
review of the business and future developments. There is a
regular dialogue with institutional shareholders including
presentations after the Group’s preliminary announcement 
of the year end results and at the half year results.
Going concern
The Group has continued to improve its financial performance
on a year by year basis in line with the Group business plan,
delivering £7.1m profit after tax and exceptional items for the
year ended 31 December 2008 (year ended 31 December
2007: £5.1m), and operating cash inflows of £4.1m (year
ended 31 December 2007: £2.6m). These cash flows have
been sufficient to meet all debt repayments as they fall due
and fund our acquisition and greenfield stores in the period.
This is reflected in the strength of the Group balance sheet,
ending as at 31 December 2008 with net assets of £35.7m
(2007: £30.3m) and net current assets of £44.7m (2007:
£38.5m).
The Group has prepared a detailed budget, approved by the
Board of Directors, which indicates an improved performance
for 2009 and 2010, with budgeted operating cash inflows,
post tax and interest, of £5.0m. This anticipated performance
reflects the fundamentals of our markets and products. We
believe that pawnbroking is a non-cyclical business and
therefore the current economic climate should have no
significant negative impact to our business model. The Group
offering is principally through secured lending against
pledges. The Group policies on pawn lending remain rigorous
and prudent, such that the Group has very limited exposure 
to loss in the event of customers not redeeming their pledges,
due to the value of the pledge collateral held, principally
being gold and precious stones. These commodities have
exhibited increasing values in the current environment, and 
the Group has no reason to believe that the value will not 
be maintained in the foreseeable future. Further details are
provided in note 28.
The Group has a 96% debt to equity ratio which reflects the
current Board strategy for the financing of operations. The
Group policy and annual review of what the Group manages
as capital, and the optimisation of the debt to equity ratio is
discussed in further detail in note 29. The bank funding loans
are provided under agreements with renewal dates in 2011
and the Group has complied with all covenants in the period
and to the date of this report. Additionally, future compliance
with covenants and debt repayments have been considered in
our detailed budget, and in all reasonably probable scenarios,
we are able to meet the conditions in the loan agreements.
Accordingly, the Board is satisfied that the existence and level
of Group debt does not cause concern for the on-going going
concern assessment of the Group.
Based on the above considerations and after reviewing in
detail our FY 2009/10 forecasts, the directors have formed
the view that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
as a going concern for the foreseeable future and has
prepared the financial statements on this basis. Principal risks
and uncertainties to the Group’s business are discussed in
more detail in the Directors’ Report. The directors present their annual report and the audited
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Principal activities and review of the business
The principal activity of the Company is that of a non-trading
holding company for Harvey & Thompson Limited and H & T
Finance Limited. The main activities of the Group continue to
be pawnbroking, retail of jewellery, cheque cashing,
unsecured lending and other related services operated through
Harvey & Thompson Limited.
A review of the business and its future development (including
the information that fulfils the relevant requirements of section
234ZZB of the Companies Act 1985) is given in the
Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Finance
Director’s Review on pages 8 to 17.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The directors continually identify, evaluate and manage
material risks and uncertainties faced by the Group which
could adversely affect the Group’s business, operating results
and financial condition. It is unfortunately inevitable in a
business that has a stock in trade consisting of cash and gold
that fraudulent losses occur from time to time. We have in
place both the highest ethical requirements of our staff,
continually refined and improved procedures, together with an
internal audit team to address this risk. The list below details
what the directors consider to be the principal risks and
uncertainties and the actions taken, or to be taken, to mitigate
the adverse consequences. This list is not intended to be
exhaustive and other risks may emerge over time:

Results and financial position
The Group results for the financial year, set out on page 29 
and the financial position as at 31 December 2008 set out 
on page 31, are commented upon in the Finance Director’s
Review on page 17.
Dividends
The directors propose a final dividend of 4.5p (2007: 3.4p)
per share subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting
on 13 May 2009. This proposed dividend, in accordance
with IAS 10 ‘Events after the balance sheet date’ for the
Group, and, FRS 21 ‘Events after the balance sheet date’ for
the Company, has not been provided for in the attached
financial statements. During the year, the Company paid the
final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2007 of 3.4p
per share and an interim dividend for the year ended 31
December 2008 of 2.0p per share (2007: 1.6 p per share).
Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s activities expose it to a number of financial risks
including cash flow risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and price
risk. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the
Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which
provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives to
manage these risks. The Group does not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
A summary of the principal financial risks is provided below.
Further detailed discussion is provided in note 28 to the
consolidated financial statements.
Cash flow risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks
of changes in interest rates. The Group uses an interest rate
swap contract to hedge this exposure on £35,000,000
(2007: £35,000,000) of the Group bank loans. The Group
has limited exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates as the Group’s activities are wholly conducted
in Great Britain and foreign exchange only affects the gold
price exchange from USD to GBP.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and
cash, trade and other receivables. The Group’s credit risk is
primarily attributable to its trade receivables, the most
significant of which are the pledge book, the KwikLoan
loanbook, Pay Day Advances and Cheque Cashing balances.
The risk attributable to the pledge book is low due to the
presence of collaterals (the customer’s pledges) which can be
easily liquidated in almost all cases at a profit. 
The risks attached to the KwikLoan loan book and Pay Day
Advances, both of which are unsecured lending, are mitigated
by the continual monitoring of bad debts and a possible
modification of lending criteria. With respect to the KwikLoan
product, the Group performs an external credit check prior to
lending. Similar procedures mitigate the risks associated with 
Cheque Cashing activities.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for
impairment is made where there is an identified loss event
which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a
reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial
instruments is considered to be low as funds are held with
financial institutions with high credit-ratings assigned by
international credit-rating agencies to the Group’s bankers as
shown below:
Moody’s credit rating
Barclays Bank plc A1
The Royal Bank of Scotland plc A1
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk (other
than on bank balances of £1,076,000 with Barclays Bank plc
(2007: £628,000) and £493,000 (2007: £380,000) with
Royal Bank of Scotland plc). Exposure on trade and other
receivables is spread over a large number of counterparties
and customers. Directors’ Report (continued)
H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 24
Liquidity risk
In order to maintain liquidity to ensure that sufficient funds are
available for ongoing operations and future developments, the
Group uses a mixture of long-term and short-term debt finance.
At 31 December 2008 the Group had sufficient headroom on
its current borrowings and is in full compliance with all loan
covenants.
Furthermore, the Company will review at the appropriate time,
the possibility of raising future equity finance or refinance
existing banking facilities to expand activities.
Price risk
Generally the Group is not exposed to price risk, as the
majority of its jewellery and all of its scrap gold are obtained
through unredeemed pledges, which have a cost to the Group
which is lower than the resale value. The Group is exposed 
to adverse movements in the price of gold in its gold scrap
activities and the value of the pledge collaterals. The Group
considers this risk to be limited due to the current high margin
on scrap gold. Should the price of gold drop significantly, the
Group can mitigate that risk by changing its lending policy on
pawnbroking pledges or by entering hedging instruments.
Capital structure 
Details of the authorised share capital are shown in note 29 
to the consolidated financial statements. The company has one
class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income.
Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of
the Company. As disclosed in note 29, during the period
253,484 new ordinary shares (2007: 3,600,000) of £0.05
each were issued, called up and fully paid.
As a result of the above transaction the nominal issued share
capital has increased from £1,754,285 as at 31 December
2007 to £1,766,960 as at 31 December 2008.
On 19 March 2008, the company has been notified of the
following voting rights by major shareholders of the Company:
Percentage of voting rights 
Name of holder and issued share capital
Morley Fund Management 8.80%
UBS Global Asset Management 7.98%
BlackRock Investment Management 8.18%
Rensburg Sheppards Investment Management 4.95%
Directors 5.57%
Baillie Gifford 5.50%
Fidelity Investments 4.96%
Henderson Global Investors 4.69%
Jupiter Asset Management 4.43%
Gartmore Investment Management 3.48%
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 30.
Under these share schemes, there are currently a potential
1,297,842 number of shares that will be issued to current
option holders at the call of the option holder. Under its
Articles of Association, the Company has authority to allot
under these share schemes, for cash, up to a maximum of
2,098,500 ordinary shares without being required to offer
such securities to all shareholders in accordance with statutory
pre-emption rights.
On any date, no option may be granted under any share
option scheme, if (as a result) the aggregate nominal value of
ordinary shares issued or issuable pursuant to options granted
during the previous 10 years under any share option scheme
would exceed 10% of the nominal value of the share capital
of the Company in issue on that date.
There are no other potentially dilutive equity instruments in the
Company in issue at 31 December 2008 or 31 December
2007. 
No person has any special rights of control over the
Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. 
With regard to the appointment and replacement of directors,
the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the
Companies Acts and related legislation and requires certain
directors annually to retire by rotation. The Articles themselves
may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. 
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or
terminate upon a change of control of the Company, such as
commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease
arrangements and employees’ share plans. None of these are
considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on
the business of the Group as a whole. Furthermore the
directors are not aware of any agreements between the
Company, or any other group company, and its directors or
employees that provide for compensation for loss of office or
employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Directors’ indemnities
Under the Company’s articles of association, any director is
entitled to be indemnified by the Company (to the extent
permitted by law) against any liability incurred by him in
defending proceedings which relate to any acts or omissions
in his capacity as officer of the Company. In addition, the
Company maintains insurance for the benefit of the directors in
respect of such matters which it considers to be appropriate.
These arrangements were in force throughout the whole of the
current and preceding financial years.
Personnel
Details of the number of employees and related costs can be
found in note 9 to the consolidated accounts. All employees
have contracts of employment with Harvey & Thompson
Limited, the trading subsidiary in the H & T Group plc group.
Harvey & Thompson Limited maintains a policy of equal
opportunities and is committed to ensuring that all individuals
are treated fairly, with respect and are valued. 
All employees are incentivised through different bonus
schemes. Store managers and management also qualify for 
the approved share option scheme (CSOP) while directors 
and senior management also qualify for the unapproved 
share option scheme (USOP). The executive directors also
qualify for the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Further details
on share option plans is provided in note 30.
Employee consultation
Consultation with employees or their representatives has
continued at all levels, with the aim of ensuring that their views
are taken into account when decisions are made that are likely
to affect their interests and that all employees are aware of the
financial and economic performance of their stores, regional
areas and of the Group as a whole. This is achieved through
formal and informal meetings, weekly information bulletins, a
quarterly newsletter and every year through a store managers’
conference.
Employment of the disabled
It is the policy of the Group to give full and fair consideration
to the employment of disabled persons in jobs suited to their
individual circumstances and, as appropriate, to consider them
for recruitment opportunities, career development and training.
Where possible, arrangements are made for the continuing
employment of employees who have become disabled whilst
in the Group’s employment.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy is to settle terms of payment with suppliers
when agreeing the terms of each transaction, ensure that
suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and abide
by the terms of payment. Trade creditors of the Group at 
31 December 2008 were equivalent to 28 (2007 - 29) days’
purchases, based on the average daily amount invoiced by
suppliers during the year. 
Charitable and political contributions
During the year the Company and Group did not make any
charitable donations (2007 - £nil) nor any political
contributions (2007 - £nil).
Independent auditors and statement of provision of information
to the independent auditors
On 1 December 2008, Deloitte & Touche LLP changed its
name to Deloitte LLP.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in
office as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval
of this report confirms that:
(1) so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company's auditors are unaware;
and
(2) the director has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the
Company's auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in
accordance with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies
Act 1985.

Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. The directors are required
to prepare the Group financial statements under International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union. The Group financial statements are also
required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and The AIM Rules. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS
financial statements present fairly for each financial year the
Group's financial position, financial performance and cash
flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with
the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities,
income and expenses set out in the International Accounting
Standards Board's 'Framework for the preparation and
presentation of financial statements'. In virtually all
circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by
compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, directors 
are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information; and 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other
events and conditions on the entity's financial position and
financial performance.
The directors have elected to prepare the parent company
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent
company financial statements are required by law to give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. In
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required
to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have
been followed; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure
that the parent company financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and financial information included on the
Company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 28
We have audited the Group financial statements of H & T
Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 which
comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated
balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, the
consolidated statement of changes in equity and the related
notes 1 to 36. These group financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of H & T Group plc for the year ended 31
December 2008.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have
formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report
and the Group financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set
out in the Statement of directors' responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether 
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors' report is consistent with the Group financial
statements. The information given in the Directors' report
includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review and the Finance
Director’s Review that is cross referred from the Principal
activities and review of the business section of the Directors'
report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
director's remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual report
as described in the contents section and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited Group financial statements. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any further information outside the Annual report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in
the Group financial statements. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and judgments made by the
directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the Group financial statements. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,
of the state of the Group's affairs as at 31 December
2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985;
and
• the information given in the Directors' report is consistent
with the Group financial statements.

Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the financial
statements may differ in other jurisdictions.

For the year ended 31 December 2008
1. General information

3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted by
the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with The AIM Rules.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial
instruments, and on a going concern basis as discussed in the Finance Director’s Report and the Corporate Governance section
of the annual report.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiary
undertakings have been included in the Group financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, 
the Group income statement includes the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line
with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2008 (continued)
H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 34
3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries, or trade and assets, is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is
measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity
instruments issued, or to be issued, by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to
the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for
recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal
groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued
Operations”, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities of a subsidiary, or trade and assets previously operated through either sole partnerships in limited companies with no
audited accounts at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at
cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least
annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Group income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (‘CGU’) expected to
benefit from the synergies of the combination. CGU’s to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually,
or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than
the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to
the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An
impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. The Group considers each of its stores to be a
CGU with the exception of the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Harvey & Thompson Limited by the Group in September
2004, where the subsidiary undertaking as a whole is the cash generating unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, or CGU represented by a store, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination
of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
subject to being tested for impairment annually as described above.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are carried at cost less amortisation less impairment losses. Intangible assets represent
intangibles which have been separately identified under IFRS 3 arising in business combinations, or meet the recognition criteria
of IAS 38, “Intangible Assets”, being principally computer software assets.
Amortisation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is calculated using the expected life of the intangible assets
acquired.
Amortisation of other intangible assets (computer software) is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the
asset less its assessed realisable value over its estimated useful life (6 to 8 years).
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual
value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:
Short leasehold premises - Leasehold improvements Shorter of 7 years or life of lease
Motor vehicles 4 years
Computer equipment - Computer hardware 3 to 5 years
Fixtures and fittings 10 years H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 35
Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) to
which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset
(CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement as an expense
immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognised as income immediately.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the
asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale
which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. For stock acquired for retail sale the cost represents the
purchase price plus overheads directly related to bringing inventory to its present location and condition and is measured on a
first in first out basis. For stock arising from unredeemed pledges the cost represents the amount originally loaned, plus overheads
directly related to bringing inventory to its present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Where necessary provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and damaged stocks.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet at fair value when the Group becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
In accordance with IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ financial assets are classified into the following
specified categories: 
• financial assets ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL);
• ‘held-to-maturity’ investments;
• ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial assets; and
• ‘loans and receivables’. 
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Currently the Group has financial assets classified as ‘loans and receivables’ and financial assets at ‘fair value through profit and
loss’. No financial assets are classified as ‘held to maturity’ or ‘available-for-sale’. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market
are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method,
less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when
the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all
fees on points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or
discounts) through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
The principal financial assets included in this measurement category are:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables represent amounts due from customers in the normal course of business. Trade receivables include certain
amounts, namely pledge receivables and KwikLoan debtors which are interest bearing. The accrued interest arising on these
interest bearing assets is included in prepayments and accrued income using the effective interest method. All other amounts
which are not interest bearing are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts, which are charged to the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at hand and deposits held with banks with original maturities of three months or less.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets are classified as FVTPL where the financial asset is either held for trading or it is designated as FVTPL. The Group
has not designated any financial assets as being FVTPL and accordingly only holds financial instruments in this category that are
deemed to be held for trading under the provisions of IAS 39.
With respect to the Group, all financial assets that are held for trading are derivative instruments that are not designated and
effective as hedging instruments (see the derivative accounting policy below).
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. Fair value is
determined in the manner described in note 28.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets
are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of
the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been reduced. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
• significant financial difficulty of the counterparty; or
• default on payments; or
• it becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are
subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of
trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is
considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying
amount of the allowance account are immediately recognised in profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income
statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the financial asset at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed
what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.  H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 37

Financial instruments (continued)
De-recognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transfers
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither
transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group
recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial
asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as FVTPL. 
The Group has not designated any financial liabilities as being at FVTPL and accordingly only holds financial instruments in this
category that are deemed to be held for trading under the provisions of IAS 39.
With respect to the Group, all financial liabilities that are held for trading are derivative instruments that are not designated and
effective as hedging instruments (see the derivative accounting policy below).
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or
loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability. 
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. All other financial
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an
effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of
allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future
cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
De-recognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they
expire.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates. The Group uses interest rate swap
contracts to hedge the economic exposure to this risk. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes.
The Group has elected not to adopt the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39, and accordingly derivative financial instruments
are initially measured at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured to fair value at
each reporting date. The gains and losses on re-measurement are taken to the income statement and included adjacent to finance
costs.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than
12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or
current liabilities. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises
from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly
to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Leases
Leases taken by the Group are assessed individually as to whether they are finance leases or operating leases. Leases are
classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rental payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. The benefit of lease incentives is spread over the term of the lease.
The Group currently has no finance leases.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past
event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at
the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to
present value where the effect is material.
All the Group’s premises are leased under operating leases. The majority of the leases include end of lease rectification clauses
which impose certain requirements on the Group to complete repairs and maintenance, or re-decoration activities if required. 
The Group provides for repairs and maintenance obligations as it becomes aware of any significant amounts that will be required.
Share capital and share premium account
There is one class of shares. When new shares are issued, they are recorded in share capital at their par value. The excess of
the issue price over the par value is recorded in the share premium account.
Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recorded in equity as a deduction, net of tax, to the
share premium account.
Employee Benefit Trust Shares
Under the terms of the Group Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for the directors, the parent Company issued certain shares to an
Employee Benefit Trust, with consideration paid for through the issuance of a loan to the Trust from the Group. The award of
shares under the LTIP is conditional upon certain vesting criteria, as outlined in note 30. The fair value of the awards made is
measured under the policy disclosed below for Share Options. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 39
Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Employee Benefit Trust Shares (continued)
The Group presents the conditional shares as an adjustment to own equity at the balance sheet date through the Employee
Benefit Trust shares reserve, until the point that the shares are awarded, and cease to be conditional awards of shares.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods
and services and interest income provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be
reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
• Retail comprises revenue from retail jewellery sales, of both purchased stock and from the sale of pledged security from
unredeemed pawn loans and is recognised at the time of sale;
• Pawnbroking, or Pawn Service Charge (PSC), comprises interest on pledge book loans, plus auction profit and loss, less any
auction commissions payable and less surplus payable to the customer. Interest receivable on loans is recognised as interest
accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts the
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount;
• Scrap comprises proceeds from gold scrap sales and is recognised at the time of sale;
• Cheque cashing comprises revenues from third party Cheque Cashing and Pay Day Advances. The commission receivable on
cheque cashing is recognised at the time of the transaction; and
• Other financial services comprise revenues from other unsecured lending, foreign exchange income, prepaid card and other
income. Interest receivable on unsecured loans is recognised as interest accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and
the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the expected
life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. Any other revenues are recognised on an accruals basis.
The Group recognises interest income arising on secured and unsecured lending within trading revenue rather than investment
revenue on the basis that this represents most accurately the business activities of the Group.
The Group recognises revenue and bad debt expenses (both impairments and movements on allowance accounts) on
pawnbroking, cheque cashing and other financial services on a portfolio approach. The Group considers that the bad debts
arising on the loans and receivables balances are a direct function of the revenue earned due to the nature of the activities, and
accordingly records the net amount of interest or commissions due and bad debt expenses within revenue. The Group provides
an analysis of the amounts recorded against revenue in notes 6, 7 and 28.
Gross profit
Gross profit is stated after charging bad debt expenses and the direct costs of stock items sold or scrapped in the period.
Other direct expenses
Other direct expenses comprise all expenses associated with the operation of the various shops and collection centre of the
Group, including premises expenses, such as rent, rates, utilities and insurance, all staff costs and staff related costs for the
relevant employees.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items represent material items of income or expense which derive from events or transactions that fall within the
ordinary activities of the Group and which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of
their size or incidence, if the financial statements are to provide a meaningful year on year comparison of results.  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

EBITDA
EBITDA is defined as Earnings Before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation. It is calculated by adding back
depreciation and amortisation to the operating profit as follows:
Before Exceptional Before Exceptional
exceptional Items 2008 exceptional Items 2007
items (note 14) Total items (note 14) Total
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000

Depreciation and amortisation 1,645 – 1,645 1,368 – 1,368
EBITDA 15,751 (832) 14,919 11,352 – 11,352
The Board considers EBITDA as a key measure of the Group’s financial performance.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before investment income, finance costs, other gains and movement in fair value of interest rate swaps.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme which is contracted into the State Scheme. The amount charged to
the income statement in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year. 
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or
prepayments in the balance sheet.
Employee share incentive plans
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees (including directors). These payments are measured at
fair value at the date of grant by use of a Binomial model or a Monte Carlo model depending on the vesting conditions attached
to each scheme. This fair value cost of equity-settled awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based
on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of any non market-based vesting conditions.
For the share options and conditional shares subject to vesting market and non-market based conditions, the fair value cost of
equity-settled awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that
will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of any non market-based vesting conditions irrespective of the outcome of the
market conditions. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. A corresponding credit is recorded in equity.
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Dividends
Dividends are provided for in the period in which they become a binding liability on the Company.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the directors are required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered
to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the
directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognised in financial statements. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 41
Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Revenue recognition
Interest receivable on pawnbroking loans is recognised as interest accrues by reference to the percentage of the pawn loans that
are estimated to be redeemed and the effective interest rate applicable. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. The estimated
future cash receipts are based on the historical cash receipts experience (the “Pledge Redemption”) of the business which vary
from month to month. The Group monitors the Pledge Redemption on a monthly basis.
The Group does not recognise interest income on the pawn loans that are not expected to be redeemed. The Group recognises
income on these loans when the related collateral that supports the loan is disposed of, through either the scrap or retail
operations of the Group. The Group is of the opinion that the revenue earned on the unredeemed pledges is only realised from
the Group perspective at the point at which the stock, or scrap item that the Group obtains from the pledge collateral is disposed
of. In arriving at this treatment, the Group also considers that the transfer value from pawn loans to inventory of the unredeemed
pledge collateral cannot exceed the cost to the Group of the inventory item which is represented by the underlying loan amount
provided on the unredeemed pledge item.
Inventories 
The majority of the inventory balance is obtained as a result of default by pawn loan customers. The inventory is stated at cost 
to the Group, being the amount initially lent on the pawn loan, plus overheads directly related to bringing the inventory to its
present location and condition. As stated above, the Group does not allocate any interest that would have been earned on the
pawn loans to the cost of inventory. Accordingly, the profit that arises on the subsequent disposal of the inventory, through either
retail or scrap, includes an element which relates to the appropriation by the Group of collaterals supporting pawn loans that
have a higher market value, than the pawn loan amount. 
Dilapidations provisions
All the Group’s premises are leased under operating leases. The majority of the leases include end of lease rectification clauses
which impose certain requirements on the Group to complete repairs and maintenance, or re-decoration activities if required. 
The Group provides for repairs and maintenance obligations as it becomes aware of any significant amounts that will be
required. The Group does not provide for amounts where the potential exposure cannot be reliably measured and accordingly
does not anticipate potential repairs and maintenance on the portfolio of stores. Additionally, the Group maintains the stores to 
a high standard and completes any necessary repairs and maintenance on a timely basis, addressing any events that require
expenditure throughout the lease period as and when required. Such costs are expensed as incurred.
Intangible assets – Software
The Group has impaired the carrying value of the bespoke EPOS software that was being developed for the Group from 2006 
to 2008. The impairment has been presented as an exceptional item reported under intangible assets. This reflects the Group
assessment that the impairment represents a material item of expense which derives from events or transactions that fall within 
the ordinary activities of the Group which is individually material to the financial statements and requires separate disclosure 
in order for the financial statements to provide a meaningful year on year comparison of results. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
discussed below.
Pawnbroking loans interest accrual estimation
The Group recognises interest on pawnbroking loans as disclosed in the Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting
policies section above. The pawn loans interest accrual (‘pledge accrual’) is material to the financial statements and is dependant
on the estimate that the Group makes of the expected level of redeemed pawn loans. The Group estimates the expected
redemptions based on the historical redemption rates achieved. There is a risk that the actual redemption rate may vary
significantly from the historical rate used to estimate the pledge accrual at the balance sheet date. The Directors assess the
pledge accrual estimate made at the prior balance sheet date annually to determine if the actual redemption differs significantly
to the previous estimate. No significant differences were noted for 2007 or 2008. The sensitivity of the pledge accrual to
reasonable changes in the redemption rate is shown in note 28.  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 42
4.Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which
goodwill has been allocated. None of these cash generating units include intangible assets with indefinite lives. The value in use
calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate present value. The review is conducted annually, in the final quarter of the year. The
impairment review is conducted at the level of each cash generating unit, which for acquisitions represents the specific store
acquired. For disclosure purposes, the Group aggregates the acquisitions in each period to simplify the overall presentation. 
The carrying value of each aggregated set as described above, including the amount of goodwill included in each cash
generating unit is as follows:
Carrying value
Carrying value of goodwill included

Stores acquired in 2006 801 553
Stores acquired in 2007 2,420 1,516
Stores acquired in 2008 625 391
There were no impairments recorded in the current or preceding year. The principal assumptions applied by management in
arriving at the value in use of each cash generating unit are as follows:
1. The Group has forecast cash flows, over a five year period, reflecting management’s estimate of the expected growth of the
revenue in the relevant cash generating unit, based on the specific characteristics of the store, and the stage of development
of the core product offerings, being principally the pledge book and the cheque cashing activities. This reflects both past
experience of the Group, and store specific factors.
2. The Group has discounted the cash flows at a pre tax, risk adjusted rate of 16%. This rate is considered to be appropriate 
on the basis of the relatively small size of each cash generating unit.
3. The directors have considered reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions and are of the opinion that no change to
the impairment review conclusions would arise from such changes. This reflects the prudent acquisition policy applied by the
Group, the integration of the acquisitions within the overall portfolio of stores that the Group operates, and the growth
obtained through the introduction of the Group’s products in newly acquired stores.
While the impairment review has been conducted based on the best available estimates at the impairment review date, the
Group notes that actual events may vary materially from management expectation.
Fair value of derivatives
The directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active
market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative financial instruments,
assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. This requires estimation of
the future interest rates, and also the appropriate discount rate. Actual events may vary materially from management expectation.
Trade receivables provisioning
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount less expected impairment losses. 
The impairment losses on the pledge book only relate to pledges seized by the police and shrinkage. The pledge book items
seized by the police are impaired on an item by item basis since the Group tracks the status of each pledge individually. The
shrinkage provision is based on an estimate of the pledge book missing at reporting date using historical shrinkage experience.
No other impairment losses are provided on the pledge book since the value of the collaterals is greater than the pledge book
nominal value. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 43
Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
4.Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Trade receivables provisioning (continued)
The impairment of Pay Day Advance loans is subject to a portfolio approach, based on an estimate of historical bad debt
experience and expected recoveries.
The impairment of KwikLoan loans is subject to individual assessment based on the number of payments missed. If one payment
has been missed, a third of the remaining balance is impaired, if two payments have been missed, two-third of the remaining
balance is impaired and if three payments or more have been missed, the whole remaining balance is impaired.
With respect to all provisions that are based on estimates, there is a risk that actual losses incurred will vary significantly from
management expectation at the balance sheet date, if historical loss rates are not a good indicator of the actual credit risk profile
of the year end receivables.
For further details on the provisions and impairment losses, refer to note 28, which show the amounts recorded in the period and
the sensitivity at the balance sheet date to changes in the key assumptions with respect to impairment losses.
Stock provisioning
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and damaged stock or stock shrinkage. The provision for
obsolete, slow moving and damaged stock represents the difference between the cost of the stock and its market value. The stock
shrinkage provision is based on an estimate of the inventory missing at reporting date using historical shrinkage experience. For
further details on the provisions for inventory, refer to note 7.

6. Business and geographical segments
Business segments
For reporting purposes, the Group is currently organised into five segments – Pawnbroking, Retail, Scrap, Cheque cashing and
Other financial services. The principal activities by segment are as follows:
Pawnbroking: 
Pawnbroking is a loan secured against a collateral (the pledge). In the case of the group over 98% of the collaterals against
which amounts are lent is jewellery made of gold, precious metals and/or diamonds. The pawnbroking contract is a six month
credit agreement bearing a monthly average interest rate of 8%. The contract is governed by the terms of the Consumer Credit
Act 2006 (previously the Consumer Credit Act 2002). If the customer does not redeem the goods by repaying the secured loan
before the end of the contract, the Group is required to dispose of the goods either through public auctions if the value of the
pledge is over £75 (disposal proceeds being reported in this segment) or, if the value of the pledge is under £75, through public
auctions or the Retail or Scrap activities of the Group.
Retail: 
The Group’s retail proposition is primarily gold and jewellery and the majority of the retail sales are forfeited items from the
pawnbroking pledge book or purchased second-hand jewellery. The retail offering is complemented with a small amount of new
jewellery purchased from third parties by the Group.
Scrap: 
Items that are damaged beyond repair, are slow moving or surplus may be smelted and sold at the current gold spot price less 
a small commission.
Cheque cashing: 
This segment comprises two products:
• Third Party Cheque Encashment which is the provision of cash in exchange for a cheque payable to our customer for a
commission fee based on the face value of the cheque.
• Pay Day Advance which is a simple form of credit where the advance is repaid by post dated cheques presented by the
customer at the point of the loan. The Group applies a 13% charge per 30 days on the value of the advance. At the end 
of the 30 days, the customer has a choice to either extend the advance for another 30 days, repay the advance or allow 
the cheques to be deposited in the Group’s bank account.
Both products are subject to bad debt risk which is reflected in the commissions and fees applied.
Other financial services: 
This segment comprises:
• KwikLoan product which is an unsecured loan repayable over 12 months of up to £750. The Group earns approximately
£300 gross interest on a £500 loan over 12 months.
• The Prepaid debit card product where the Group earns a commission when selling the card or when the customer is topping
up their card.
• The foreign exchange currency (Euro and US Dollar) service where the Group earns a commission when selling or buying
foreign currencies. This service is currently on trial in a limited number of stores.
• The LogBook Loan product where the Group earns a commission when referring a customer to a third party providing loans
secured on personal vehicles. This service is currently on trial in a limited number of stores.
Only the KwikLoan product is subject to bad debt risk which is reflected in the interest rate offered.
Further details on each activity are included in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 12 to 16.  H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 45

As disclosed in note 3, Gross profit is stated after charging bad debt expenses and the direct costs of stock items sold or
scrapped in the period. Other operating expenses of the stores are included in other direct expenses. The Group is unable to
meaningfully allocate the other direct expenses of operating the stores between segments as the activities are conducted from 
the same stores, utilising the same assets and staff. The Group is also unable to meaningfully allocate Group administrative
expenses, or financing costs or income between the segments. Accordingly, the Group is unable to meaningfully disclose an
allocation of items included in the income statement below Gross profit, which represents the reported segment results.

11. Other gains
In 2007, the Group disposed of its final freehold property. The disposal in 2007 was leased back under an operating lease. 
The Group applied the considerations of IAS 17 to the sale and leaseback transaction and recorded the full profit on disposal 
on an historic cost basis. In arriving at this treatment, the Group concluded that the disposal proceeds and subsequent rentals 
are at fair market amounts.
The profit on disposal of the freehold property was determined as follows:
2007
£’000
Sale proceeds 260
Costs of disposal (22)
Net book value of freehold properties (37)
Profit on disposal reported as an exceptional item 201
The capital gains tax payable in respect of the disposal of the property was £45,000 in 2007 (2008: £nil) and was reported
within deferred tax liabilities in the 2007 accounts as the Group planned to claim hold-over relief on the gains. The gain was
subsequently paid in 2008 as part of the 2007 corporation tax liability, resulting in a £34,000 deferred tax credit to the income
statement reported as an adjustment in respect of prior periods for deferred tax with a corresponding adjustment to the current
tax charge in respect of prior years. The Company still intends to claim hold-over relief on the gains arising on disposal of the
freehold property through reinvestment of the disposal proceeds in qualifying assets.

14. Exceptional items
The Group considers certain items to be non-recurring exceptional items, and accordingly, they are presented as such in
accordance with the Group accounting policy in note 3.
Year ended 31 December 2008
In 2006 the Group commenced the development through a third party software development house of a bespoke point of sale
software. During the year to 31 December 2008, the Group commenced detailed user acceptance testing on the software,
significantly behind the initial planned user acceptance testing which was scheduled for June 2007. This testing indicated a
significant number of problems with the software. Due to the delays in development, and the difficulties encountered in the user
acceptance testing, the directors have terminated the contract with the third party software house by mutual agreement. The
carrying value of the point of sale software that has no further use to the Group has been written off in full, resulting in a non
recurring exceptional cost in the period of £832,000. The Group is separately developing a substitute point of sale software,
which the Group intends to roll out in 2009. The current software is aged, but remains reliable, such that the delay in
implementation of the replacement system does not have a material impact on the ability of the Group to manage operations 
on a day to day basis, or report transactions and balances in a reliable and timely manner. 
Year ended 31 December 2007
In the year ended 31 December 2007, as disclosed in note 11, the Group disposed of its final freehold property making an
exceptional profit of £201,000. 
Tax effect of exceptional items
The tax effect of the above exceptional items is shown separately in note 13. 
15. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 
all dilutive potential ordinary shares. With respect to the Group these represent share options and conditional shares granted 
to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.
The directors also present an adjusted earnings per share as the directors consider that it reflects the Group results on a
comparable basis once non-recurring items are taken into consideration. The only adjustments made to the non-adjusted 
earnings per share in arriving at adjusted earnings per share are for exceptional items disclosed separately on the face of 
the consolidated income statement and disclosed in note 14. Other than for the adjusting items, the calculation is the same 
as for the statutory per share amounts.
Reconciliations of the earnings per ordinary share and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out
below:

Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
17. Goodwill (continued)
The Harvey & Thompson Ltd CGU was created when H & T Group plc acquired Harvey & Thompson Limited in September
2004. Management is unable to allocate this goodwill by store and accordingly, tests this for impairment at the subsidiary entity
level, adjusted for the recoverable amount of CGU’s acquired after September 2004. All assets acquired after September 2004
are reviewed for impairment at the related store level. The stores are grouped for financial reporting purposes by year of
acquisition to facilitate presentation and comparability on a year by year basis. Additionally, store performance is monitored by
management based on the year of acquisition as the historic performance of an individual store is linked to its acquisition date.
This approach is reflected in the way management has presented the above CGUs. 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The impairment review was conducted as described in note 4.

The customer relationships intangible assets arise from the acquisition of trade and assets of sole partnerships or limited
companies with no audited accounts and reflect the repeat business associated with the pawnbroking and pay day advance
industry from existing customers at the acquisition date of the relevant assets. 
The amortisation period for customer relationship intangible assets is between 6 and 8 years and the amortisation period for
software intangible assets is 7 years. These amortisation periods reflect the directors’ best estimate of the estimated useful
economic lives of these intangible assets.
Included within disposals and written off intangibles in the year is the permanent reduction in carrying value of the bespoke point
of sale system of £832,000. The directors are of the opinion that this asset no longer exists in the Group and accordingly, it has
been removed from the cost of intangible assets. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

from 1 May 2008 since the Group met ratios as stipulated in the Credit Agreement. The lowest facility A margin achievable is
LIBOR plus 1.50% (2007: 1.50%). As at 31 December 2008, the balance on the Facility A Loan, including short-term, was
£11,000,000 (2007: £13,000,000). 
Facility B - The Facility B Loan has an interest of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.40% (2007: 1.40%). A margin rachet, offering
reduced interest rates, came into force from 1 May 2008 since the Group met ratios as stipulated in the Credit Agreement. 
The lowest facility B margin achievable is LIBOR plus 1.25% (2007: 1.25%). This loan is secured on the pledge book of 
Harvey & Thompson Limited, one of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings. The Facility B loan is repayable by 11 May 2011. 
The available facility is increased from 11 May 2009 by £1,000,000 to £27,000,000, provided that the facility does not
exceed £27,000,000 and the working capital facility (noted below) is reduced by £1,000,000. As at 31 December 2008, 
the balance on the Facility B Loan was £25,200,000 (2007: £20,500,000).
Facility C - The Facility C Loan has an interest of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.65% (2007: 1.65%). A margin rachet, offering
reduced interest rates, came into force from 1 May 2008 since the Group met ratios as stipulated in the Credit Agreement. 
The lowest facility C margin achievable is LIBOR plus 1.50% (2007: 1.50%). The Facility C Loan is repayable by 11 May 2011.
As at 31 December 2008, the balance on the Facility C Loan was £956,000 (2007: £651,000). 
Working capital facility - The working capital facility has not been utilised by the Group. The working capital facility has an
interest of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.65% (2007: 1.65%). A margin rachet, offering reduced interest rates, came into force from
1 May 2008 since the Group met ratios as stipulated in the Credit Agreement. The lowest facility B margin achievable is LIBOR
plus 1.50% (2007: 1.50%). The working capital facility loan is repayable by 11 May 2011. The facility is automatically
reduced by £1,000,000 from 11 May 2009. 
Interest due on the loans is payable at each interest period end. Interest amounts outstanding at the year end are included in
accruals.
All loans, with the exception of the Facility B Loan which is additionally secured on the pledge book of Harvey & Thompson
Limited, are secured with a floating charge over the remaining assets of the companies in the Group.
Deferred debt issue costs
The movement in the deferred debt issue costs of £223,000 represents the amortisation of the debt issue costs brought forward
as at 31 December 2007. 
Undrawn borrowing facilities
At 31 December 2008, the Group had available £5,844,000 (2007: £8,100,000) of undrawn £ Sterling committed borrowing
facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met. Additionally the Group has a £1,900,000 (2007:

latest date that the customer can redeem the pledge, being six months from the pledge contract commencement date, and
accordingly that an element of the pledge interest accrual does not meet the strict definition of a financial instrument under

Classes of financial assets and liabilities
The Group further analyses the categories of financial assets and liabilities as defined in IAS 39, into classes of financial assets
and liabilities as defined in IFRS 7. The book values of these classes and fair values are as follows:

Fair value
The assumptions used by the Group to estimate the current fair values are summarised below:
(i) For the Pawnbroking class, the fair value has been calculated by adding:
• The principal outstanding on pawn loans; 
• The interest receivable accrued using the effective interest rate method; and
• The proportion of the profit on scrap for the loans on which the Group does not recognise interest due to the uncertainty
of recovery of the interest, apportioned over the pledge contract. 
(ii) For Cheque cashing, Other financial services and Unallocated classes, the book value approximates to fair value because of
their short maturities, fixed or floating interest rates which reflect market rates, and the provisions recorded for losses at the
balance sheet dates, where relevant.
(iii) For the Interest rate derivatives class, the fair value has been calculated by discounting the future estimated cash flows based
on the applicable yield curve derived from quoted interest rates.
(iv) For Borrowings and Short term operating liabilities classes, the book value approximates to fair value because of their short
maturities and interest rates where applicable. None of the Short term operating liabilities are interest bearing. The
borrowings are all held at floating interest rates which approximate market rates, and accordingly, the book value and fair
value are the same.
Financial risk management objectives
The Group monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the financial instruments held. The principal risks include credit
risk (on financial assets), liquidity risk (on financial liability Borrowings and Other financial liabilities) and interest rate risk (on
financial liability Borrowings). The risks are analysed by each class of financial assets and liabilities in the relevant section below.
Generally the Group is not exposed to price risk, as the majority of its jewellery and all of its scrap gold are obtained through
unredeemed pledges, which have a cost to the Group which is lower than resale value. The Group is exposed to adverse
movements in the price of gold in its gold scrap activities. The Group considers this risk to be limited due to the current high
margin on scrap gold. Should the price of gold drop significantly, the Group can mitigate this risk by reducing its lending policy
on pawnbroking pledges or by entering gold hedging instruments.
Additionally, the Group is not exposed to significant interest rate risk on the financial assets, other than cash and cash
equivalents, as these are lent at fixed rates, which reflect current market rates for similar types of secured or unsecured lending,
and are held at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents are exposed to interest rate risk as they are held at floating rates, although the risk is not significant
as the interest receivable is not significant.
Pawnbroking financial asset class
The pawnbroking financial asset class is exposed to three principal risks:
• credit risk;
• the risk of a change in pawnbroking loan redemption; and
• the risk of changes in the price of gold. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 61
Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
28. Financial instruments (continued)
Pawnbroking financial asset class (continued)
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily through:
(i) default on the loan amounts (forfeits).
Additionally, the Group is exposed to risk in recovery of the loan amounts, which is considered to be similar to credit risk, due
to:
(ii) assets being pledged as security against loans, which are subsequently seized by the police; 
(iii) assets being pledged as security against loans being stolen or lost, resulting in the borrower being relieved of the liability to
the Group.
The Group mitigates these risks by applying strict lending criteria, which are continually reviewed and monitored at both store
and at board level. 
A principal aspect of the pawn contract is the requirement for the borrower to provide collateral (the pledge) which remains in
the possession of the Group, in secure safes, while the pawn loan is outstanding. The Group has the right to dispose of the
pledged items in the event of default by the borrower. The pledge book is accordingly secured over the goods pledged. The
value of the pledge items (which is in excess of the pawn loan in all instances where the Group lending policy is applied), the
legal title that the Group can enforce on these items, and their ongoing security are vital to the Group to ensure that the credit
risk is mitigated to an acceptable level.
Due to the significance of the pledged item as security for the Group with respect to the recovery of the amounts lent, the Group
applies strict criteria at the point of lending to assessing both the customer requiring the pawn loan, and the value of the pledge
item. The Group has set criteria for lending based on the assessed value of the item pledged, which takes into account the
various aspects of the pledge. Over 98% of the pledged items are gold and jewellery. Some of the key attributes of the pledge
are therefore the metal it is made of, the presence of precious or semi precious stones and the appearance and condition of the
item. This high percentage lending on marketable items, which are available under certain circumstances to the Group for
onwards disposition through either the Group’s retail or scrap operations (see below), provides significant security to the
pawnbroking financial assets. 
The Group maintains the customer’s title to the goods pledged through strict criteria. In order to pledge an item, the customer
needs to be registered for which a proof of address is required. All the transactions are also captured through CCTV. The Group
also encourages good relationships with local police forces.
The pawn contract is regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 2006, which specifies the rights and obligations of both the Group
and the borrower with respect to the collateral provided and default on the loan. The Group continually reviews the pawn
contract to ensure that it complies with the relevant legislation and provides sufficient protection to the Group.
The Group also retains all pledged items in locked safes at each store and maintains sophisticated security systems. The staff
handling the pledged items are also carefully screened and trained by the Group prior to commencing employment and then 
on an ongoing basis. 
Finally, the Group maintains an internal audit department, staffed by auditors with significant experience in the pawnbroking
industry, to monitor compliance with the Group policies, and in particular to monitor the existence and security of the pledge
items, the value of the pledge items compared with the pledge loan, the legal compliance of the pledge contracts and the
compliance of the stores with the Group lending policies. The internal audit department reports directly to the Finance Director
and the Chairman of the audit committee and makes regular visits to all stores throughout the year, in meeting the objectives 
of its work.
In the event of default by the borrower, the Group is required by the Consumer Credit Act to dispose of the items differently,
depending on whether the loan value is less than or greater than £75:
(i) If the value of the loan is £75 or under, the goods become the property of the Group immediately. The goods are then either
auctioned, retailed through the Group outlets or scrapped, with profits reported in either the Retail or Scrap segments as
applicable.
(ii) If the value of the loan is over £75, the goods are sent to public auction. The goods are then either sold at auction or bought
back by the Group. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Pawnbroking financial asset class (continued)
Credit risk (continued)
In the absence of either over-lending on the pledge item, loss of the pledge item, or police seizure of the item, the Group realises
at least the value of the pledge loan immediately, with additional profits recorded upon sale or scrapping of the item. The value
that the Group can realise is measured by the excess of the fair value of the collaterals, which is estimated at £43,074,000
(2007: £33,970,000) over the book value of the pledge book and associated accrued interest which amounts to £36,999,000
(2007: £32,288,000).
The pawnbroking assets are disclosed net of the provision for bad and doubtful debts associated with these financial assets. 
As a result of the strong controls surrounding the pledge collateral, the Group has limited exposure to losses arising from the 
loan default, police seizure, or loss of pledged items. This is reflected in the movement in the bad and doubtful debts provision
for pawnbroking assets, an analysis of which is as follows:

The Group has fully provided for all amounts lent on pledges which are either held by the police, or have been notified to the
Group by the police as frozen assets.

0 - 90 days 5,444 4,496
Over 90 days 1,511 1,519
Total 6,955 6,015
The Group has not provided for the £6,955,000 (2007: £6,015,000) contractually overdue receivables (i.e. loans where the
pawn agreement has terminated but the customer has not redeemed the assets) at the reporting date since the realisable value 
of the collaterals held is greater than the carrying value of the pledge loan as disclosed above. The Group does not start the
disposition process of the unredeemed pledges for around 3 months after the end of the credit agreement since it is commercial
practice to allow additional time for the customers to come and redeem their pledged items, for an additional fee. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk would be £36,999,000 (2007: £32,283,000), being the gross carrying amount net of any
amounts offset and any impairment losses. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 63
Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
28. Financial instruments (continued)
Pawnbroking financial asset class (continued)
Risk of a change in pawnbroking loan redemption
As disclosed under the significant accounting policies (note 3), the interest receivable on loans is recognised as interest accrues
by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable. As explained under critical accounting
judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty (note 4), the estimated future cash receipts are based on the historical cash
receipts experience (the “Pledge Redemption”) of the business which vary from month to month. Accordingly, the Group is subject
to risks associated with the variability in the redemption rate on the amount of interest which is accrued on the pledge book, and
with the amount of accrued interest included in the pawnbroking financial assets.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to changes in the pledge redemption rate assuming
the pledge book outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 2% increase or decrease is used
when reporting pledge redemption rate sensitivity risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s
assessment of the monetary impact of the change in pledge redemption rates.

The above impact on income statement would be partly or fully offset by an increase or decrease in profits made on disposition
of the forfeited items, although this may be in a different financial reporting period.
Risk of changes in the price of gold 
The collateral which protects the Group from credit risk on non-redemption of pawn loans is 99% comprised of gold and
jewellery items. The value of these items as security is directly linked to the price of gold. The Group is therefore exposed to
adverse movements in the price of gold on the value of the security that would be attributable for sale in the event of default by
the borrower. The Group considers this risk to be limited for a number of reasons. First of all, the Group applies conservative
lending policies in pawnbroking pledges reflected in the margin made on scrap gold when contracts forfeit. The value of gold 
for our customers is also much greater than the price of gold since jewellery items contain a retail margin. The Group is also
protected due to the short term value of the pawn contract (6 months). In the event of a significant drop in the price of gold, the
Group could mitigate this risk by reducing its lending policy on pawnbroking pledges or by entering gold hedging instruments.
Management monitors the gold price on a constant basis. Based on the price of gold on 19 March 2009, the Group estimates
that a 38% fall in the price of gold would be required for the pledge collateral to no longer support the value of the pawn loans
and associated accrued interest. The directors are of the opinion that a decrease of this magnitude is highly unlikely.
Cheque cashing financial asset class 
This class represents amounts recoverable by the Group through cheques that are already in the possession of the Group. The
Cheque cashing financial asset class is exposed primarily to the credit risk through default on the loan amounts for Pay Day
Advance or default from the drawer for Third Party Cheque Encashment. This credit risk is mitigated at the outset of the lending
agreement by the strict application of the Group lending policies, including credit checks, the legal security provided by the
assignment of cheques to the Group, and the staff recruitment and training policies referred to above. The Group monitors the
ongoing risk associated with this class of financial assets through a continual review of bad debts, modifications to the lending
policy, and the internal audit activities referred to above ensure that the Group policy is consistently applied. In the event of
default by the customer, the Group has also developed a debt collection department to recover any cheque cashing debt.  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The class of financial assets is stated net of estimated irrecoverable amounts. Accordingly, the carrying value is dependant on 
the Group assessment of the expected level of bad debts in the financial assets at the balance sheet date. The sensitivity analysis
below has been determined based on the exposure to changes in the percentage of bad debt as a function of amounts lent,
assuming the Pay Day Advance book outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 2% increase
or decrease in bad debt is used when reporting credit risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s

Other Financial services financial asset class 
This class represents primarily unsecured loans receivable. This class is exposed primarily to the credit risk through default on 
the loan amounts for the KwikLoan product. This credit risk is mitigated at the outset of the lending agreement by the strict
application of the Group lending policies, including credit checks, and the staff recruitment and training policies referred to
above. The Group monitors the ongoing risk associated with this class of financial assets through a continual review of bad
debts, modifications to the lending policy, and the internal audit activities referred to above to ensure that the Group policy 
is consistently applied. The Group also uses its Cheque cashing debt collection department to recover any KwikLoan debt. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 65

The Unallocated financial asset class comprises mainly cash and cash equivalents. Of the £2,956,000 balance at 31 December
2008 (31 December 2007: £2,118,000), cash and cash equivalents amounted to £2,744,000 (2007: £1,966,000). The
remainder of the balance is considered immaterial.
The cash and cash equivalents balance comprises both bank balances and cash floats at the stores. The bank balances are
subject to very limited credit risk as they are held with banking institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit
rating agencies. The cash floats are subject to risks similar to any retailer, namely of theft or loss by employees or third parties.
These risks are mitigated by the security systems, policies and procedures that the Group operates at each store, the Group
recruitment and training policies and the internal audit function.

Interest rate risk
The Group is funded based on a combination of equity and bank borrowings. The bank borrowings are all held at floating rates
based on LIBOR. Accordingly the Group is exposed to cash flow risk through changes in the LIBOR rate impacting cash flows. 
The Group mitigates exposure to this interest rate risk through the use of financial derivatives instruments in floating to fixed
interest rate swaps, arranged through Barclays Bank Plc. See the Interest rate derivative class for further details.
Liquidity risk
The Group has significant borrowings exposing it to liquidity risk in both repayment of borrowings and availability of finance. 
In order to mitigate this risk, the Group uses a mixture of short-term and long-term debt finance with banking institutions with high
credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The current borrowings are disclosed in detail in note 24, which
shows that the Group has arrangements in place to ensure sufficient funding is in place until 2011 under the current agreements.
At 31 December 2008, the Group also has available £5,844,000 (2007: £8,100,000) of undrawn committed borrowing
facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met. This level of headroom is considered sufficient to finance
operations at the current level, but will need to be increased to allow for expansion of the Group. Furthermore, as shown in note
33, the business generates a positive cash flow from operating activities and has discretion in its expansion programme should
the Group need to improve short term cash flow. 
The Group is in full compliance with all loan covenants. 
The impact on the Group of the liquidity risk arising from the Borrowings class is shown along with all other classes, in the
combined liquidity risk disclosures below.
Interest rate derivatives class
This class includes all derivative financial instruments that the Group has in place to mitigate the interest rate risk arising on 
the Borrowings class as noted above through floating to fixed interest rate swaps. The principal instrument fixes the 3 month
LIBOR element of the interest cost of a portion of the bank loans to 5.315% (2007: 5.315%). A secondary instrument converts
the 3 month LIBOR to 1 month LIBOR. The agreements terminate on 30 June 2009. The instruments cover £35,000,000 
(2007: £35,000,000) of the loan balances. The fair value of the instrument at 31 December 2008 is £665,000 payable 
(2007: £18,000 payable). The Group anticipates that it will be able to obtain a similar instrument at applicable market rates
when this agreement terminates.
As required by IAS 39, the Group measures the interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date. The Group does 
not apply hedge accounting. Accordingly, while the Group mitigates cash flow interest rate risk arising on the Borrowings class
through these instruments, the Group is exposed to fair value risk on the revaluation of the instrument. The sensitivity analyses
below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both the Borrowings class and the Interest rate
derivatives class, as these are intrinsically linked. For floating rate liabilities (the Borrowings class), the analysis is prepared
assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 1.0% increase 
or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s
assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 67

The impact of a change in interest rate has no material impact on finance costs due to the interest rate swap which covers the
majority of the loan balances. The principal movements reflect the movement in fair value of the interest rate swap. Management
intends to retain the interest rate swaps to maturity and replace them with similar instruments, as required under the loan
agreements. Accordingly, the positive or adverse movements on the fair value of the hedging instrument will offset over the life 
of the instrument, though this may be in different financial reporting periods.
Liquidity risk
The interest rate derivative instruments expose the Group to liquidity risk on the payments required under the contracts. The
impact on the Group is shown along with all other classes in the combined liquidity risk disclosures below.
Credit risk
The credit risk on derivative financial instruments is limited because of the high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-
rating agencies to the Group’s bankers.
The Group has no exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date on the derivative financial instruments as the fair value
positions are payable.
Short term operating liabilities financial liability class 
The short term operating liabilities financial liability class is not exposed to any significant risk. Liquidity risk is considered to 
be minimal due to the availability of borrowings as discussed above and the positive cash flow from operations (see note 33).

In 2008, a further 253,484 new ordinary £0.05 shares were issued, called up and fully paid. Of these new ordinary shares,
1,299 were issued to satisfy options granted under the 2006 Option Schemes exercised at a grant price of £1.825 per share on
20 February 2008, resulting in an increase in share capital of £65 and in the share premium account of £2,036. The remaining
252,185 shares were acquired by the Employee Benefit Trust as part of the LTIP 2008 (see note 30) and were issued at par
value on 12 November 2008.
In 2007, 3,600,000 new ordinary shares were issued, called up and fully paid at the placing price of £2.04 per share on 
16 May 2007. Of the proceeds received of £7,344,000, £180,000 was recorded in share capital and £7,164,000 in the
share premium account. £282,000 was incurred in expenses directly related to the issue of these shares, which was expensed 
to the share premium account.
Options over shares of the Company are disclosed in note 30. Under these share option arrangements, there are 1,297,841
(2007: 789,837) open options over shares. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 69

29. Share capital (continued)
Employee Benefit Trust shares reserve
Under the terms of the Group Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for the directors, the parent Company issued 252,185 ordinary
shares of £0.05 to the Employee Benefit Trust, with consideration paid for through the issuance of a loan to the Trust from the
Group. The award of shares under the LTIP is conditional upon certain vesting criteria, as outlined in note 30. 
The Group presents the conditional shares as an adjustment to own equity at the balance sheet date through the Employee
Benefit Trust shares reserve, until the point that the shares are awarded, and cease to be conditional awards of shares.
Movements in this reserve are shown in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of
debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 24, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of
the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Gearing ratio
The Group reviewed its gearing ratio determined as the proportion of net debt to equity at the time of its flotation in May 2006
and considered it as appropriate. Although the Group reviews its gearing ratio at each reporting date, no specific target has
been fixed by management.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Debt 37,156 34,152
Cash and cash equivalents (2,744) (1,966)
Net debt 34,412 32,186
Equity 35,748 30,345
Net debt to equity ratio 96% 106%
Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 24, before unamortised issue costs.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Company.

Awards that can be granted under the three schemes total a maximum of 2,098,500 shares (2007 – 2,098,500 shares). 
A. Approved Share Option Scheme (‘ASOS’)
The Approved Share Option Scheme is a share option scheme approved by HMR&C where favourable tax treatment is received
on exercise. The options may be granted to all management from Shop Manager to Executive Director level. The Remuneration
Committee sets the performance conditions.
The performance conditions applied were: 
• In 2008 and 2007 that an option may not be exercisable unless the growth in adjusted basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) of the
Group reaches 3% above the General Index of Retail Prices (‘RPI’).
• In 2006 that an option may not be exercisable unless the Group reaches the yearly EBITDA budget target set for the financial
year. 
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment over a three year period from the date of grant. Early exercise of the
options is permitted if an option holder ceases to be employed by reason of death, injury, disability, retirement or sale of his
employing company.

Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
30. Share based payments (continued)
Options were valued using a Binomial option pricing model. The inputs into the model used by the Group to estimate the fair
value of the options awarded are as follows:
2008 2007
Fair value at measurement date 36.27 pence 68.10 pence
Weighted average share price 175.5 pence 217.5 pence
Weighted average exercise price 175.5 pence 217.5 pence
Expected volatility 20.6% 31.0%
Expected life 6.5 years 6.5 years
Risk-free rate 4.99% 4.82%
Expected dividends 3.4% 2.5%
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the share price of the Company as an estimate of
future votality. The expected life used in the model for both years has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for 
the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The average remaining contractual life is 8.5 years.

B.Unapproved Share Option Scheme (‘USOS’)
The Unapproved Share Option Scheme is a discretionary option scheme under which the Remuneration Committee may grant
options to all Executive Directors and Senior Management of the Company. The Remuneration Committee sets the performance
conditions.
The performance conditions were: 
• In 2008 and 2007 that an option may not be exercisable unless the growth over 3 years in adjusted basic Earnings Per
Share (EPS) of the Group reaches on average at least 8% plus RPI. This applies to 25% of the options granted.
• In 2008 and 2007 that an option may not be exercisable unless the growth over 3 years in adjusted basic Earnings Per
Share (EPS) of the Group reaches on average at least 10% plus RPI. This applies to 25% of the options granted.
• In 2008 and 2007 that an option may not be exercisable unless the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over 3 years exceeds the
FTSE AIM 100 performance. This applies to 50% of the options granted.
• In 2006 that an option may not be exercisable unless the Group reaches the yearly EBITDA budget target set for the financial
year. 
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment over a three year period from the date of the grant. Early exercise of
the options is permitted if an option holder ceases to be employed by reason of death, injury, disability, retirement or sale of his
employing company.

Long-term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The LTIP is a discretionary share incentive scheme under which the Remuneration Committee may grant ordinary shares at no cost
to executive directors. 
The LTIP operates as conditional shares awarded over a three year performance period. The performance period commences on
the start of the financial year of the grant date, 1 January 2008 and runs to 31 December 2010. The shares first vest three years
from the grant date on 7 November 2011.
The performance measurement condition is based on Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and an Earnings per share (EPS) test. 
The performance conditions were: 
• That the award may not be exercisable unless the growth over 3 years in adjusted basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) of the
Group reaches on average at least 8% plus RPI. This applies to 25% of the shares granted.
• That the award may not be exercisable unless the growth over 3 years in adjusted basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) of the
Group reaches on average at least 10% plus RPI. This applies to 25% of the shares granted.
• That the award may not be exercisable unless the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over 3 years exceeds the FTSE AIM 100
performance. This applies to 50% of the shares granted. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

31.Acquisition of trade and assets (continued)
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of all the trade and assets presented above is attributable primarily to the anticipated
increased profitability of the acquired shares arising from:
• the introduction of all the Group’s products;
• the growth in existing products driven by the Group’s expertise, know-how, financial resources and systems; and
• the anticipated central cost savings to operate the businesses within the Group rather than as stand alone businesses.
Accordingly, staff who were employed by the relevant business have been retained in some instances, representing a saving to
the Group in recruitment and training costs.
The above acquisitions contributed in total £500,000 revenue and £100,000 to the Group’s profit before tax for the period
between the date of each acquisition and the balance sheet date. No individual acquisition was material and accordingly,
further analysis by acquisition is not presented.
The Group cannot estimate the revenue and profit or loss of the Group had the acquisitions been completed on the first day of
the financial year since no reliable historical financial information is available. The trade and assets acquired were operated
through either sole partnerships or limited companies with no audited accounts.

Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
We have audited the parent Company financial statements 
of H & T Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2008
which comprise the Company balance sheet and the related
notes A to F. These parent company financial statements have
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group financial
statements of H & T Group plc for the year ended 
31 December 2008.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have
formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,
and the parent Company financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice) are set out in the Statement of directors'
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial
statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent
Company financial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the parent Company financial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
Directors' report is consistent with the parent Company
financial statements. The information given in the Directors'
report includes that specific information presented in the
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review and 
the Finance Director’s Report that is cross referred from the
Principal activities and review of the business section of the
Directors' report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors' remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
as described in the contents section and consider whether it 
is consistent with the audited parent Company financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the parent Company financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information
outside the Annual report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in
the parent Company financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made 
by the directors in the preparation of the parent Company
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Company's circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the parent Company financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the parent Company financial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the parent Company financial statements give a true and
fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the
Company's affairs as at 31 December 2008; 
• the parent Company financial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985; and
• the information given in the Directors' report is consistent
with the parent Company financial statements.

A. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. They have all
been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding financial year.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Finance Director’s Report and the
Corporate Governance section of the annual report.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
Taxation
Current UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Where tax losses are surrendered to, or received from, group
companies, the amount received/surrendered is charged/credited to the profit and loss account and treated as payable
to/receivable from the related group party that has surrendered/received the losses.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred 
at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company's taxable profits and its results as stated in the
financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they
are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends 
Dividends receivable from subsidiary undertakings are recorded in the profit and loss account on the date that the dividend becomes
a binding liability on the subsidiary company. Under the terms of FRS 6 ‘Acquisitions and mergers’, the Company records dividends
arising from pre-acquisition profit and loss reserves of its subsidiary undertaking in the profit and loss account and considers whether
the distribution affects the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary undertaking.
Dividends payable are recorded as a distribution from retained earnings in the period in which they become a binding liability on
the Company.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8, ‘Related Party Disclosures’, available to parent Company’s
presenting single company financial statements together with the consolidated Group financial statements of the Group headed by
the Company, not to disclose transactions with entities that are part of the group headed by H & T Group plc or investees of the
group qualifying as related parties. 
There are no other related party transactions of the Company that require disclosure.
Cash flow statement
The Company is the parent company in the H & T Group plc group, which prepares consolidated financial statements, including 
a cash flow statement, which are publicly available. Consequently, under the terms of FRS 1, ‘Cash Flow Statements’, the Company
has not prepared a cash flow statement.
Share options 
The Company’s trading subsidiary, Harvey & Thompson Limited issues share options to employees in that Company, which are
equity settled in shares of H & T Group plc. Harvey & Thompson Limited determines the fair value of the options granted measured
at the date of grant by use of a Binomial model or a Monte Carlo model depending on the vesting conditions attached to each 
scheme. This fair value cost of equity-settled awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in the financial
statements of Harvey & Thompson Limited, based on the estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of 
any non market-based vesting conditions. 
Notes to the Company Financial Statements
Year ended 31 December 2008 H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 83
Highlights Overview Review of the Business Financial Statements
A. Accounting policies (continued)
Share options (continued)
The Company receives a payment each period, equal to the annual expense recorded in Harvey & Thomson Limited calculated on
the basis described above. This amount is credited to the profit and loss account each period and is treated in a similar manner to 
a distribution of dividends from Group companies.
B. Company profit and loss account
No profit and loss account is presented for the parent company pursuant to section 230 of Companies Act 1985.
The Company made a loss after taxation of £66,000 in 2008 (2007: £206,000 loss).
The auditors’ remuneration for the current and preceding financial years is borne by a subsidiary undertaking, Harvey & Thompson
Limited as disclosed in note 8 to the Group financial statements.
No emoluments were paid to the directors by the Company (2007: £nil). The directors were paid by Harvey & Thompson Limited, a
subsidiary company of H & T Group plc. Details of their emoluments are shown in note 9 to the Group financial statements. Other
than the directors, the Company has no employees in either financial year.

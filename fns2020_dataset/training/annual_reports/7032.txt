+1 5 . 0 % In the year to 31 March 2008 operating profit
rose by 25.8% to £16.5 million (2007: £13.1million)
with earnings per share increasing by 25.9% to 28.7p
(2007: 22.8p). All four operating divisions contributed
to this growth.The closing order book was 16.3%
higher at £31 1 .8 million (2007: £268.2 million) despite
a fall in order intake to £228.1 million (2007: £245.7
million). Operating cash flow was particularly strong
with net operating cash inflow of £19.3 million
(2007: £9.7 million) equal to 1 16.8% of operating
profit (2007: 73.4%).
The Group maintains a strong order book providing
good visibility for the operating businesses. We are
confident in the future growth of the business and
are investing accordingly.The lower order intake
this year was primarily due to the peaking of Qatar
LNG carrier orders in gas systems in the prior year.
The Group continued its track record of innovation
and maintained its leading position in its principal
market sectors. A significant increase in research
and development expenditure has maintained the
pace of new products being offered to customers
and broadens further the opportunities for growth.
This success has enabled us to maintain our
progressive dividend policy.Y our directors are
recommending a final ordinary dividend of 5.29p
per share which, if approved, would result in a 15%
increase in the total dividend declared in respect of
the year to 7 .94p per share (2007: 6.90p). Subject to
shareholders’ approval the final dividend will be paid
on 21 July 2008 to all shareholders on the register
on 27 June 2008.
Joe Oatley joined Hamworthy as Chief Executive
on 3 September 2007 . Joe, together with the board
and the senior executive team, has carried out a
detailed review of strategy.The result of this review
will sharpen our approach to internal and external
business processes whilst developing further the
theme of growth by market led innovation. We are
confident that the Group can achieve consistent
long-term earnings growth through extending its
presence in growth markets, developing its people
and improving operational performance. We will also
seek to acquire businesses at appropriate valuations
where these contribute to our strategic objectives.
The Group takes seriously its responsibilities to
the environment. Its principal sites are now
compliant with Environmental Standard ISO 14001
and its technical product innovations help customers
to reduce the impact of their operations on the
marine and offshore environment with emission
and discharge control and safe handling of
hazardous substances.
We recognise the critical role that our employees
play in the Group’s success. Our ability to recruit,
retain and develop our people is an important part
of Hamworthy’s strategy. On behalf of the board
I thank all employees for another year of significant
achievement and look forward to their involvement
in the next stage of our future growth.
The Group increasingly seeks to develop products
and systems for long-term growth markets.
The breadth of those opportunities and balance
across a number of sectors should mitigate exposure
to cyclical demand in individual sectors. With a proven
ability to design, develop and provide innovative
products and systems to those markets and a strong
future order book, the board is confident that the
Group’s strategy will result in continued growth.

05 Hamworthy plc Chief Executive’s strategic review
06 Hamworthy plc
I came to Hamworthy plc in September 2007 with high
expectations and those expectations have been more than
fully met.The Company has a well respected brand and has
delivered impressive returns to shareholders since flotation
in 2004. I am pleased to say that I believe we have both the
opportunities and the capability to continue to deliver sustained
earnings growth and enhanced shareholder value. Company overview Business review Governance Accounts
07 Hamworthy plc
Our goal is to continue to deliver enhanced
shareholder value through long-term earnings
growth and we have a new strategy in place
to deliver this.
Our Group strategy
I have visited all of our operations worldwide and
met with many of our employees and customers.
I have also undertaken a strategic review of the
business and implemented a thorough strategic
planning process throughout the Group.The purpose
of this process is to ensure that we have the best
information available to inform the development of
our Group strategy and to involve our key people in
determining the changes we will need to make to
continue the success of the Group.
Our goal is to continue to deliver enhanced
shareholder value through long-term earnings growth.
Our strategy to deliver this is outlined below.
Balanced business in long-term growth markets
In order to protect our shareholders against individual
market cycles, we aim to have a balance of earnings
across a number of specialist markets. In doing so
we target markets with long-term growth prospects.
Our main market today is the new building of
specialist ship types, predominantly oil and gas
carriers and cruise ships. Looking forward, we are
putting increased focus on growing our position in
related markets with different cycles with particular
emphasis on oil and gas production. We are also
increasing our aftersales services across our whole
range of existing and new businesses. In addition to
maintaining a balanced business we believe these
markets will deliver higher margins and thus improve
Group returns.
Leadership through market-led innovation
We aim to be market leaders in our target market
segments.We achieve this leadership by having a deep
understanding of our customers’ needs and responding
quickly to those needs by developing innovative
solutions both for today and in the future. Developing
world-class solutions is crucial to our continued growth
and we plan to increase our investment in research and
development to achieve this.
Operational excellence
We are putting increased emphasis on margin
enhancement through improved operational
efficiency throughout our businesses.This spans
the introduction of new processes for project
management, continued development of lean
methodologies in our manufacturing plants and
expansion of our Group sourcing capability in China.
By putting more focus on operational effectiveness
we believe we will improve our returns to
shareholders and fund an increased level of
investment in research and development.
Flexible cost base
We aim to reduce our fixed cost base by focusing on
the parts of our value chain where the most value is
added. In doing this we will have a structure which is
better able to flex with market demand and also
minimise the invested capital in the business.
Acquisitions
We have a strong track record of organic growth and
we expect this to continue. We will seek acquisitions
to augment this growth by buying new technologies,
gaining access to new markets or enhancing market
positions for our existing businesses.
We recognise that any strategy is only as good as
the people who implement it. Hamworthy has a
highly skilled and experienced workforce and we are
implementing a more formal talent management
process to develop and grow that skill base across
the Group. We continue to believe we have an
exceptional team capable of delivering the strategy.

Acquisitions Business review
08 Hamworthy plc
Operating profit margins increased to 7 .1% (2007:
6.9%) with a particularly strong second half year
performance of 8.3%.The closing order book, which
is translated into sterling using the year end rates of
exchange, was 16.3% higher than the prior year end.
Across all its divisions the Group continued to invest
in future innovation with a near 50% increase in
expenditure on research and development compared
to 2007 . Significant new products introduced during
the year include deepwell pumps for LNG cargo
applications, LNG fuel systems for lower emission
gas engine driven ships and the upgrading of the
smaller desalination plant range designed to be
manufactured in our Chinese factory.This pace of
development provides a range of opportunities for
future growth.
The performance of individual businesses is reviewed
in the divisional review on pages 10 to 17 .The Group’s
aftersales businesses operate within the separate
divisions but with a common customer facing
organisation.The Group continued to invest in
this capability during the year.This included a 25%
increase in the number of direct customer support
personnel, the establishment of a new team in
Shanghai and the merging of separate support
teams in the UK.
Aftersales turnover rose to £29.3 million (2007:
£24.3 million), the constituent parts of which are
included within the divisional sales reported in the
divisional review on pages 10 to 17 .The increase
in business is one mark of the progress in our
mission of developing best practice to provide a
consistent, high level of service to customers.
Despite the high utilisation of capacity in most
of the Group’s manufacturing sites, the business
successfully met the challenge of improving stock
availability in a market where short lead times are
of great importance.
Hamworthy is able to report another year of successful performance
and development.The Group has delivered increased profits,
improved margins and retained a strong order book providing good
visibility for its operating businesses. Operating profits translated at
the same average exchange rates as the previous year increased by
17 .5%.The strengthening against sterling of the basket of functional
currencies in which the Group’s subsidiaries operate improved the
reported operating profit by a further 8.3% relative to 2007 in the
consolidated sterling income statement. Company overview Business review Governance Accounts
09 Hamworthy plc
Markets
The Group primarily operates in markets with long-
term growth characteristics.There are two principal
drivers of this long-term growth.
The first is increasing environmental legislation and
awareness.This is a driver behind the growth of
many of the Group’s businesses from water systems,
where environmental legislation is driving the need
for more sophisticated water treatment systems
on board ships, to gas systems where natural gas
is being preferred as an energy source as it is the
cleanest of the hydrocarbon fuels.
The second is the growing demand for energy and
the increasing geographical dislocation between
consumption and production. Coupled with a move
towards the increasing use of natural gas as a
fuel source this is driving increased demand for
investment across the gas supply chain.
The Group operates in four main markets: gas
production and transportation; oil production and
transportation; cruise ships; and merchant shipping.
In gas production and transportation, deliveries of
both LNG and LPG carriers are currently at historical
highs, driven by very high levels of ordering in 2005
and 2006. As this new shipping capacity comes on
stream the focus of investment will shift away from
shipping towards other parts of the gas supply chain:
onshore and offshore production and regasification.
The Group has successfully responded to this shift
by innovating system solutions across the broader
LNG supply chain.
The oil production and transportation market is
exhibiting similar dynamic, with current high levels of
deliveries of tankers but a shift towards increasing
investment in offshore production. As previously stated
in the Group’s latest interim report, a number of key
FPSO projects have experienced delays, largely due
to geopolitical issues. However, activity levels have
increased markedly in this area in the last quarter.
The cruise ship market continues to be robust with
the main constraint to growth being a lack of capacity
at the European shipyards where these vessels are
built. A number of the major Korean shipyards are
beginning to invest in developing the capabilities
needed to deliver cruise ships in the future.
The merchant shipping market achieved a record level
of deliveries in 2007 , driven by the global demand
for transportation of both raw materials and finished
goods. Shipyards continue to have very full order
books with most major yards full into 201 1 .
Outlook
The near-term outlook for the Group is secure, being
underpinned by a strong order book which the Group
expects will deliver another year of strong sales.
In the medium-term, the security of this strong order
book is expected to be maintained with a change
in product mix reflecting the changing dynamics in
the Group’s markets. It is anticipated that there will
be a shift in emphasis towards the strong growth
segments of onshore and offshore production of oil
and gas, LNG regasification and cruise ships, and
away from the gas carrier and tanker markets with
demand for new vessels reducing as fleet capacity
expands.The Group aims to drive an improvement in
margins through increased emphasis on operational
efficiency across all businesses. In the long term,
the fundamental growth drivers of environmental
legislation and energy demand remain very strong.
The Group is pursuing a strategy that makes it well
positioned to take advantage of these dynamics and
the board therefore looks forward with confidence.

T urnover rose to £98.9 million (2007: £89.6 million)
and operating profit rose to £5.5 million
(2007: £4.7 million). T urnover grew in both the
LNG and LPG segments.
Margins improved significantly in the second half
year to 6.9%, compared to the first half year of 4.1%
which was affected by recognising additional costs to
complete a turnkey land-based LNG system.This also
represents a marked increase on the 5.2% margin
achieved in 2007 .
During the year the first 10 “Q-Flex” ships equipped
with Hamworthy LNG reliquefaction equipment
successfully completed sea trials.These are the
largest LNG carriers to enter service for the Qatar
gas fields and are a significant demonstration of the
Group’s ability to deliver innovative systems to meet
new market requirements.
The previous two financial years saw a particularly
concentrated period of ordering of LNG reliquefaction
systems for LNG carriers to serve the Qatar Gas field.
Consequently order intake reduced to £69.7 million
(2007: £106.3 million).The division has successfully
pursued a strategy of extending its technology to
applications across the LNG supply chain. During the
year this resulted in securing two further contracts for
floating regasification systems in South America and
the Middle East and a first order for LNG fuel systems
for gas engine driven ships.This latter application is
an emerging market for coastal vessels where a gas
fuelled engine is used in order to reduce emissions
of nitrous and sulphur oxides and particulates.
The offshore market also offers significant potential in
the medium term particularly for liquefaction plant on
LNG FPSOs.There are now several projects seeking
to build such vessels and, whilst the timing of order
placement is uncertain and unlikely to affect the
next financial year, contract sizes are likely to be
significantly higher than those in the Group’s existing
order book.
The total number of permanent and contract staff
in this division rose from 173 to 242.T o help meet
the challenge of continuing growth, the business
has invested over £1 million in a state-of-the-art
information technology system commissioned during
2007 .T ogether with improved business processes
and controls, this will further help improve the return
on sales as the business grows.

Market-led innovation
is ensuring our long-
term growth potential
Hamworthy secured its first order during
the year for an LNG fuel system for gas
engine driven ships from Rolls Royce.
LNG is increasingly being employed for
powering ships where there are new
regulations being introduced to tackle
emission of NOx, SOx and particulates.
This is a good example of where our gas
systems engineers are able to identify
and respond to market requirements
and employ their core skills in gas
handling technology to rapidly develop
new applications.

Pump systems
T urnover rose to £66.6 million (2007: £55.1 million)
with operating profit rising to £7 .3 million (2007:
£5.5 million).T urnover grew in deepwell pumps for
tankers and LPG carriers, pump room systems for
oil and product tankers and engine room pumps
for marine and offshore applications.The business
saw slow progress in contract awards from the
FPSO market due to operational and political
rather than economic factors although these are
now showing signs of increased activity.
Margins improved to 10.9% (2007: 10.0%) largely due
to the benefit of increased volumes combined with
material cost efficiency gains in deepwell pumps from
continued focus on low-cost sourcing.
Order intake fell to £65.5 million (2007: £75.5 million)
due to a fall in deepwell pumps orders following an
unprecedented level of intake in the prior year from
the LPG carrier sector. Each of pump room systems,
engine room systems and fire fighting pumps
experienced strong growth.The business had notable
successes in securing orders for engine room pumps
in the offshore sector and in pump room systems for
tankers.The division continues to enjoy a strong order
book, up from £71 .7 million to £85.6 million.
The division has greater in-house manufacturing
activity than other parts of the Group. Both principal
plants in Denmark and Singapore continue to work
at full capacity with Singapore delivering a record
number of pumps following its capacity and
operational improvements over the last two years.
This in-house capability is matched with progress
on outsourcing of parts production to low cost
regions, an area in which the Group has developed
considerable expertise.
Following a successful development and cryogenic
test programme the Group achieved first deliveries of
deepwell pumps for LNG applications.This will enable
the Group to extend its range of deepwell pumps
from the LPG and Ethylene carrier market, where it
has a world leadership position, to the wider LNG
carrier market. A new range of pumps designed
specifically for the offshore fire fighting supply vessel
market will allow the Group to extend its presence
in that market.

multi-cargo coastal gas carrier in 2008.
The pumps, which traditionally handle
LPG and Ethylene at minus 104°C, were
redesigned to pump LNG cargoes at
minus 163°C.Tests were carried out in
our Danish site using liquid Nitrogen to
verify pump performance at cryogenic
conditions.The successful introduction of
this new product opens up the market of
small LNG and combined LPG-LEG-LNG
vessels used in coastal gas cargo
distribution for remote locations.

Water systems
T urnover rose to £43.8 million (2007: £28.9 million)
and operating profit rose to £5.0 million (2007:
£4.5 million).T urnover grew in both waste water
treatment systems and in fresh water generation
systems. Growth was also partly driven by the
effect of the first full year of sales of the Serck
Como acquisition.
Margins fell to 1 1 .4% (2007: 15.5%).This was due
to both the dilutive effect of the full year of the
Serck Como acquisition and particular cost pressures
on advanced waste treatment plants.These cost
pressures are now largely overcome as the business
focuses on improved project implementation and
continues to benefit from low-cost manufacturing
in China.
Order intake rose to £63.2 million (2007: £35.4 million).
The order book rose to a record level of £64.4 million
(£38.7 million).
The Serck Como business acquired in the prior year
is now fully integrated into the Group and performing
ahead of expectations.The business consolidated its
position as world leader in desalination plant for cruise
ships and has a forward order book of almost two
years’ sales value.The business has completed a
design upgrade to its single stage desalination
systems for the merchant shipping market and the
assembly of these is now being transferred from
Germany to the Group’s low cost manufacturing
facility in China.
The waste water business both delivered a record
number of small sewage treatment plants for
the general shipping market during the year and
increased significantly the receipt of orders for
advanced waste water systems to the cruise market,
confirming the Group as the market leader in these
sectors.The Group was the first major supplier to
receive type approval for sewage treatment plant
under IMO’s new, more stringent standards.
The Group has been selected as supplier of the
advanced waste water systems for the UK Royal
Navy’s future aircraft carriers. Orders have been
received for the initial work scope and this is
expected to be extended during 2008.

the long-term growth
of many of our
businesses
Being the world’s number one in the
field of onboard sewage treatment
systems it was natural that Hamworthy
was one of the first companies to
develop a system capable of meeting
new international regulations on
overboard discharge. From 1 January
2010 all ships will need to comply with
the new regulations. Hamworthy, which
is also recognised as a leader in the field
of advance water systems for cruise
ships, was the first major supplier to be
awarded Lloyds Register type approval.

T urnover rose to £22.5 million (2007: £17 .2 million)
with operating profit rising to £1.4 million
(2007: £1.0 million).T urnover growth was driven
by demand both from tankers and gas ships,
including the first deliveries and successful sea
trials for the new LNG Q-Flex carriers.
Margins recovered in the second half and improved
to 6.0% for the full year (2007: 5.6%). Manufacture
of all major products has now been moved from
Norway to China. Order intake rose from an already
strong performance in the prior year to £29.8 million
(2007: £28.5 million).The order book rose to a record
level of £40.0 million (2007: £27 .1 million).
The business has focused its development efforts on
systems for offshore FPSOs, LNG and LPG carriers
and nitrogen generator systems. Its success in these
latter areas is illustrated by a doubling of sales to gas
ships and recent success in securing a multi-ship
order in Korea for chemical tanker nitrogen generator
systems. Hamworthy Moss is now the leading inert
gas systems supplier in the Korean market.
Consistent with the pump systems business,
the slow progress in contract awards for FPSOs
reported in the interim report continued through the
third quarter. Activity has increased during the last
few months on several orders which the business
is pursuing and order placements are expected
soon.This remains a strong medium-term sector
for Hamworthy.

18 Hamworthy plc
Basis of reporting
The Group financial statements in this report have
been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the
associated International Financial Reporting
Interpretation Council (IFRIC) interpretations each
as adopted for use in the EU.The financial statements
of the parent company have been presented in
accordance with UK GAAP .
Accounting policies
The Group has reviewed its accounting policies in
accordance with IAS 8 and determined that they are
appropriate for the Group.
Operating performance
T urnover increased by 21 .5% to £ 231 .8 million
(2007: £190.8 million) and operating profits rose
by 25.8% to £ 16.5 million (2007: £13.1million).
Group operating margins increased to 7 .1%
(2007: 6.9%). All four divisions demonstrated
growth in both turnover and operating profit.
The Group generated 7 4% of its operating profits
before central costs in reporting currencies other
than sterling, the most significant being euro,
Danish kroner, Norwegian kroner, Singapore dollars
and Chinese renminbi.The weighted average rate
for these currencies has strengthened by 6.6%
compared to the prior year which had the effect
of increasing sterling consolidated turnover by
£14.0 million and operating profits by £1 .1 million.
Profit before taxation rose 28.0% to £17 .4 million
(2007: £13.6 million) with a rise in net interest income
to £0.9 million (2007: £0.5 million).
The Group’s undelivered order book increased from
£268.2 million to £31 1 .8 million.
T axation
The tax charge of £4.6 million (2007: £3.8 million)
represents an effective rate of 26.6% (2007: 27 .8%).
The Group generates taxable profits in a number of
jurisdictions where the underlying rate of corporation
tax is lower than the UK.The most notable differences
are in China and Singapore.The net effect of these
lower underlying foreign tax rates is equivalent to
4.0% of the profit before taxation. Several of these
jurisdictions have also changed their underlying rates
of corporation tax during the year which has had a
net reduction in the Group’s tax charge equivalent to
1 .4% of profit before taxation. Note 8 to the financial
statements provides details of the tax charge.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share increased from 22.8p per
share to 28.7p per share and fully diluted earnings
per share increased from 21 .9p to 28.6p. Note 10
to the financial statements provides details of
these calculations.
Hamworthy has had a further successful year, delivering increased
revenues and profits, integrating the Group’s first acquisition since
flotation and improving future prospects with increased order
books across all product groups.

Dividend
The directors are recommending a final ordinary
dividend of 5.29p per share. If approved by
shareholders this would result in a total dividend
declared in respect of the year of 7 .94p per share
when added to the interim dividend of 2.65p per
share paid in December 2007 .
Financing, cash flow and treasury
The Group maintains a focus on controlling working
capital requirements and resultant cash flows.
Despite the volatility in net flows in the larger contract
based businesses, the Group continues to be a strong
generator of cash.The Group had a particularly strong
net cash flow in the first half of the year under review
and maintained that benefit through the second half.
A summary of cash flows and the change in net funds
is set out below. Operating cash flow amounted to
£19.3 million (2007: £9.7 million) which is 1 16.8%
(2007: 73.4%) of operating profit.The conversion
of operating profit to operating cash flow averaged
103.6% for the last three years.The net funds
position at the year end was £48.0 million (2007:
£27 .0 million). Further detail relating to the cash flows
and movements in net funds of the Group is given in
the consolidated cash flow statement on page 32 and
in notes 28 and 29 to the financial statements.

All businesses are responsible for management of
cash and working capital locally. Principal operating
companies then participate in a cash pooling
arrangement under which a central treasury function
manages the most efficient use of funds across
activities.The Group has historically hedged
approximately two-thirds of the interest rate exposure
on its term debt.The hedge currently in place caps
the LIBOR rate within the interest charge at 6.39%
on the proportion of debt hedged. As that debt will
fall below £3.0 million during 2008 the interest hedge
will cease in June 2008.
The Group’s businesses are global and each can
contract in several currencies.The Group’s policy
is to hedge all currency transaction exposures at the
time of entering into the contractual commitment
back to the relevant contracting business’ local
currency.The significant majority of this hedging
is operated through the central treasury function.
The Group’s principal operating businesses are
required to reconcile their exposures and related
hedges and report them to the treasury function as
part of their financial reporting routines.The Group
intends that its hedging procedures qualify for hedge
accounting as far as is practical to do so.This will
result in any gain or loss volatility of hedge derivatives
initially being recorded in a separate component of
equity and not through the Income Statement.
The Group’s primary banking and finance facilities are
provided by Barclays Bank plc under the terms of a
Facilities Agreement originally dated December 2002
as since amended.The facility includes a £9.0 million
five year term loan of which £3.0 million remains
outstanding (2007: £4.9 million) and a revolving
and related ancillary facility for overdraft, foreign
exchange transactions and letters of credit, bonds,
guarantees and indemnities. In addition the Group
has further facilities held directly by its subsidiaries
with local banks.

Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are required by company law to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The directors are required to prepare the financial
statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company or the Group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently throughout the year. They confirm that
reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008
and that applicable accounting standards have been followed. The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for keeping accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Group website is the responsibility of the directors. The work carried out by the auditors does not involve
consideration of these matters and accordingly the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have been made to the financial
statements since they were initially presented.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
Disclosure of information to auditors
As far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and they have taken
all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish
that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company will take place at the Verona Suite, The Italian Villa, Compton Acres, 164 Canford Cliffs
Road, Poole, Dorset BH13 7ES on 14 July 2008 at 2.00 pm. Full details of the resolutions to be put to the meeting are given in the notice of
the AGM to be found at pages 70 to 71 of this Annual report and accounts.
Share capital
An ordinary resolution will be put to the shareholders at the AGM to renew the directors’ authority to issue and allot ordinary shares.
The nominal value of ordinary shares to which this authority will be limited is £755,422. A special resolution will also be put to the
shareholders at the AGM which renews the authority of the directors to allot ordinary shares without first offering them to existing
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. This authority is limited to 5% of the issued share capital.
The Companies Act 1985 permits a company to purchase its own shares provided the purchase has been authorised by the members in
general meeting. A special resolution will be put to the shareholders at the AGM to authorise the Company to purchase up to 5% of the
issued share capital at a maximum price 5% above the average middle market quotation according to the London Stock Exchange for the
five days’ preceding any purchase.
In all cases the above resolutions will expire at the earlier of the next AGM in 2009 or 15 months after the date of the resolutions.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution proposing their reappointment will be
made at the AGM.
By order of the board.

Directors’ remuneration report
25 Hamworthy plc
The Company is listed on AIM and as such is not required to prepare a formal remuneration report. However, in line with best practice the
Company has prepared this report in order to enable a better understanding of directors’ remuneration.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists exclusively of independent non-executive directors and its members are JN Wilding (Chairman),
GF Page and AJ Frost. The committee also consults with the Chief Executive. It meets at least twice per year and has delegated responsibility
for recommending to the board the remuneration and other benefits of the executive directors and senior executives. The full terms of
reference of the committee are available on the Company’s website or on request from the Company Secretary.
The committee has access to external remuneration data and professional advice. In 2007 it sought advice from Kepler Associates on various
matters relating to executive remuneration and long-term incentives.
Remuneration policy
The board’s policy is to recruit, motivate and retain senior executives of high calibre by rewarding them with competitive but responsible
salary and benefit packages. A significant proportion of executive remuneration is performance related, both short-term and long-term,
including participation in share incentive schemes which are closely aligned with the interests of shareholders.
The remuneration packages for executive directors comprise the following main elements:
• basic annual salary;
• annual bonus payments in respect of the performance of the individual and the Group calculated as a percentage of salary;
• share-based long-term incentives via participation in the Company’s Share Option Plan and Share Matching Plan;
• retirement benefits under the Company’s defined contribution pension scheme;
• other benefits.
The board’s intention is to combine appropriate levels of fixed pay with incentive schemes that provide executives with the ability to earn
above median levels for true out-performance and encourage executive co-investment in the Company’s shares.
Basic salaries
Basic salaries are reviewed by the committee annually to take effect on 1 April. In setting basic salaries the committee assesses individual
responsibilities, experience and performance and considers external market data. During 2007 the committee sought benchmarking advice
from Kepler Associates on comparative remuneration data and have built on the results of that advice in 2008.
Annual bonus payments
Executive directors participate in the annual cash bonus scheme under which bonuses of between 0% and 100% of basic salary are payable.
Bonuses are awarded following consideration of the performance of the Group, achievement of profit and cash targets and the individual’s
contribution to that performance. The principles of this scheme also apply to annual bonuses payable to the Group’s senior executives.
Where an executive has specific responsibility for a division or subsidiary in the Group the performance of that business unit is considered
along with the Group performance. Bonus awards were paid to KG Derrick in respect of the period from 1 April 2007 to the date of his
retirement and to JM Oatley from the date of commencement of his employment to 31 March 2008.
Long-term incentives
The Company operates long-term incentives for executive directors and senior executive managers in the form of the Share Option Plan and
a complementary co-investment Share Matching Plan. These schemes aim to encourage participants to contribute to the performance of the
Company and participate in the Company’s success along with other shareholders.
It is the intention of the board to grant share options to reward performance and align the interests of executives with those of shareholders.
Share options are granted at the discretion of the committee. Exercise of options is subject to the committee’s performance criteria set at
the time of award.
For awards granted prior to 31 March 2007 this requires that growth in earnings per share over the following three year period shall be in
excess of the rise in the Consumer Price Index plus 3% per annum. Following the review of remuneration advised on by Kepler Associates
in 2007 , the vesting of subsequent awards has been conditional on an equally weighted measure of earnings per share growth and total
shareholder return (TSR). The minimum performance for any vesting is an earnings per share growth of CPI plus 5% and a TSR equal to the
average of the UK Industrial and Oil and Gas indices over a three year period. The percentage vesting rises from 25% to 100% in proportion
to increases in these two performance measures up to earnings per share growth of CPI plus 20% and TSR of 115% of the above indices.
Details of options held by the executive directors under the plan are given in the tables on page 27 .
The Share Matching Plan is designed to encourage the acquisition and retention of the Company’s shares. Participation is by the invitation
of the committee which grants awards to executive directors and senior executive managers. Awards of matching shares are granted to
participants on the basis of one matching share for each share already owned or for every two vested but unexercised share options held.
Vesting of awards is subject to retention of the participant’s initial qualifying holding over a three year period and the meeting of performance
criteria over that period. The percentage of awards vesting at the end of the three years is calculated by reference to the growth in earnings
per share over a three year period. The percentage rises proportionally from 25% for earnings per share growth of CPI plus 5% to 100% for
earnings per share growth of CPI plus 20%. Details of the participation by executive directors is given below.
Retirement benefits
The executive directors are members of the Hamworthy Pension Scheme, a UK defined contribution scheme. The scheme provides for
pension benefits payable on retirement and for a lump sum benefit payable to dependants in the event of death in service.
Prior to his retirement KG Derrick elected to sacrifice some of his basic salary in exchange for additional payments made to his account
under the scheme. Full details are given in the tables below. Directors’ remuneration report (continued)
26 Hamworthy plc
Other benefits
The executive directors receive private health insurance and allowances in lieu of company cars and fuel. JM Oatley received a cash amount of
£30,000 on commencement of employment as compensation for certain accrued benefits lost as a result of leaving his previous employment.
Service contracts
Service agreements for executive directors are for no fixed term and are terminable on 12 months’ notice from the Company or six months’
notice from the director. There are no provisions for compensation in event of early termination.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts and nor do they participate in any share option scheme, long-term incentive plan or
pension scheme. GF Page, AJ Frost, and JN Wilding have each been appointed under letters of engagement which commenced on 21 July
2004 and can be terminated by either party giving three months’ notice. Fees payable under the terms of their appointments are shown
in the tables on page 26. The fees payable in respect of the appointment of JN Wilding are paid to his principal employer.
External appointments
It is the Company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold external appointments and to receive payment therefrom provided such
appointments are agreed by the board in advance. During the year no executive director was a director of another public company.
Directors’ emoluments
The remuneration of the directors including the highest paid director and chairman was as follows:

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Corporate governance

Introduction
The Company is listed on AIM. Although the rules of AIM do not
require the Company to comply with the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance (‘the Code’) the Company fully supports the
principles set out in the Code and will seek to comply wherever
practical, given both the size and resources available to the Company.
Details are provided below of how the Company applies those parts
of the Code which it believes to be appropriate.
The board
The Company has appointed non-executive directors to bring an
independent view to the board and to provide a balance to the
executive directors. The board of directors comprises two executive
directors and three non-executive directors, one of whom is the
chairman (GF Page) and one of whom is the senior independent
director (AJ Frost).
The board considers that each of the non-executive directors is
independent within the meaning of the Code.
The board generally meets every other month and receives a board
pack with information deemed necessary for the board to discharge
its duties. Over the year these packs will include financial data,
reporting on health and safety, controls and risk assessments and
individual reports from each of the executive directors and members
of the senior management team. The board has responsibility for
formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, budgets,
major items of expenditure, acquisitions and the annual and interim
directors’ report and financial statements.
During the year the board carried out a formal assessment of its
performance and effectiveness using the services of an outside
consultant (Edis-Bates Associates), as a result of which a number
of process improvements will be introduced to the conduct of the
board and its committees.
Board committees
The board has established three committees: audit, remuneration and
nominations, all having written terms of delegated responsibilities.
Each is chaired by a different non-executive director. The Company
Secretary is secretary to each committee. A copy of each committee’s
terms of reference can be found at the Company’s website
www.hamworthy.com.
Audit committee
The audit committee consists of GF Page, AJ Frost and JN Wilding
and is chaired by AJ Frost. It meets at least three times a year
including attendance from the external auditors and internal personnel
as required. The committee is responsible for ensuring that the
appropriate financial reporting procedures are properly maintained
and reported on and for meeting the auditors and reviewing their
reports relating to the Group’s accounts and internal control systems.
The committee also receives all internal operational review reports
and any matters reported under the Group’s whistleblowing policy.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists of GF Page, AJ Frost, and
JN Wilding and is chaired by JN Wilding. It meets at least twice a
year and is responsible for reviewing the performance of the
executive directors and other senior executives and for determining
appropriate levels of remuneration. The chief executive is invited to
participate in the committee on matters except consideration of his
own remuneration. The committee’s remuneration report is set out
on pages 25 to 27 .
Nomination committee
The nomination committee consists of GF Page, AJ Frost, JN Wilding
and JM Oatley and is chaired by GF Page. It makes recommendations
on all new board appointments.
Shareholder relations
The Company meets with institutional shareholders and analysts
as appropriate and uses its website to encourage communication
with private, existing and prospective shareholders. Hamworthy plc
welcomes feedback from investors about its published reports and
website. Please address your feedback to our investor relations team
by e-mail to investor@hamworthy.com or in writing to Hamworthy plc,
Fleets Corner, Poole, Dorset BH17 0JT .
Internal control and risk management
The Group operates a system of internal control and intends to
develop and review that system in accordance with the guidance
published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales. The internal control system is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. The board
is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing
its effectiveness. It can only provide reasonable, but not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The board operates a formal process of risk assessment and
reporting. Each major business unit carries out formal risk
assessments annually and regularly updates these during the
year. The assessments are carried out using, where appropriate, a
standard categorisation of risk. Reports on the assessments and
mitigation actions of all significant risks are provided to the board.
The Group does not have an internal audit function due to the small
size of the Company’s administrative function, the high level of
director review and authorisation of transactions. However, the
Company undertakes a programme of operational reviews designed
to visit all major businesses on a regular basis. The finance director
is responsible for that programme and its reporting to the audit
committee and it is integrated into the risk assessment programme.
The board recognises that an essential part of its responsibility is the
effective safeguarding of assets, the proper recognition of liabilities
and the accurate reporting of results. The Group has a comprehensive
system for regular reporting to the board. This includes an annual
planning and budgeting system with budgets approved by the board.
The financial reporting system compares against budget and prior year
and reconsiders its financial year forecast all on a monthly basis.
The board has established a formal policy of authorisation setting out
matters which requires its expressed approval and certain authorities
delegated to the executive directors.
The Group operates in a multi-currency environment and is exposed to
a number of foreign currency risks. The board has set a policy for the
management and reporting of those risks and this is set out in more
detail in the Financial review on pages 18 and 19 and in note 30 to the
financial statements.
In compliance with AIM rules the Company has established a policy
and share dealing code relating to dealing in the Company’s shares
by directors, employees and connected persons.
The Company has established, operates and publicises within the
Group and via its website a whistleblowing policy. This provides the
necessary access for, and protection of, employees wishing to bring
matters they suspect as being malpractice or impropriety to the
attention of the relevant person.
The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of
legal actions against directors as well as against material loss or claims
against the Group, and reviews the adequacy of cover regularly.
The Group operates formal assessment and reporting systems in
respect of its health and safety and environmental performance.
With the exception of the Group’s German business all of the Group’s
principal business sites have achieved accreditation under OHSAS
18001 health and safety standard and ISO 14001 environmental
standard. The German Hamworthy Serck Como business already
operates in compliance with these standards and will seek formal
accreditation to both in 2008.
There were no notifiable environmental impacts at any Hamworthy
site during the financial year. Company overview Business review Governance Accounts

29 Hamworthy plc
We have audited the group financial statements of Hamworthy plc
for the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the Consolidated
Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated
Cash Flow Statement, the Statement of Group Total Recognised
Income and Expense and the related notes. These group financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set
out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements for Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Respective responsibilities of directors
and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the
group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the Statement of directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the group
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you whether, in our opinion, the information
given in the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the group
financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited group financial
statements. This other information comprises only the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s strategy statement, the Business
Review, the Financial Review, the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the
Directors’ Report and the Corporate Governance statement. We

Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial statements.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the group
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the group financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2008 and of its profit
and cash flows for the year then ended;
– the group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; and
– the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with
the group financial statements.

Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these
financial statements are set out below. These policies have been
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise
stated.
General information
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements
of Hamworthy plc, a public limited company registered and domiciled
in the United Kingdom and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’). The address
of the registered office is Fleets Corner, Poole, Dorset BH17 0JT .
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC
interpretations endorsed by the European Union (EU) and with those
parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting
under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention as modified by the revaluation of derivative contracts and
retirement benefit obligations which are held at fair value. A summary
of the more important Group accounting policies, which have been
applied consistently across the Group, is set out below, together with
an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies
on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
The following new standard and amendment to an existing standard
have been adopted from 1 April 2007:
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures; and the related
amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures.
This introduces new disclosures relating to the Group’s financial
instruments and policies for managing capital but does not have any
impact on the classification and valuation of the Group financial
instruments.
The following interpretation to an existing standard was adopted but
does not have an impact upon the reporting of the Group’s operations:
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
The following interpretations to existing standards would be effective
for the current year but are not considered relevant to the Group’s
operations:
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2.
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives.
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements represent a consolidation of the Company
and its subsidiary undertakings (‘the Group’) as at the balance sheet
date and for the year then ended. Subsidiaries acquired or disposed of
during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements
from, or up to, the date upon which control passed, being the ability
to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee entity so
as to obtain benefits from its activities. This is considered to be the
effective date of acquisition or disposal, as appropriate.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a
subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over fair values of the identifiable
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the
cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets
acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the Income
Statement in the period of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with
those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are
eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received
and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided
in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other
sales related taxes, and excluding inter-company sales.
Sales of goods and services are recognised when goods are
despatched or services rendered. Revenue from construction
contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting
policy on construction contracts (see below).
Segmental reporting
For reporting purposes the results of the Group are allocated between
four reporting product groups. These operate in specific product and
market areas and are as described in note 2. The Group accounting
policies are applied consistently across the four divisions. Head Office
costs are shown separately.

The functional and presentational currency of the parent company
is UK Pounds sterling. Group companies use their local currency as
their functional currency. Transactions denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the
balance sheet date, with any gains or losses being included in net
profit or loss for the period.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any,
are dealt with through the Group’s reserves, until such time as the
subsidiary is sold whereupon the cumulative exchange differences
relating to the net investment in that foreign subsidiary are recognised
as part of the profit or loss on disposal in the Income Statement.
However, cumulative exchange differences arising prior to 1 April
2005 remain in equity as permitted by IFRS 1 .
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks
the Group enters into forward contracts and options (see below for
details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative
financial instruments).
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity
and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat
goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before
the date of transition to IFRS as sterling denominated assets
and liabilities.
Financial instruments
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s
policies approved by the board of directors which provide written
principles on the use of financial derivatives.
All derivative financial instruments are recorded in the balance sheet
at fair value. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting,
any gains or losses on remeasurement are immediately recognised in
the Income Statement. Where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge
accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss will initially be
recorded in a separate component of equity (‘Other Reserves’).
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to
document from inception the relationship between the item being
hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to
document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which
shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is performed at each period end to ensure
that the hedge remains highly effective. Accounting policies (continued)
34 Hamworthy plc
Cash flow hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges
when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that
is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised
asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are
designated as effective hedges of future cash flows are recognised
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately
in the Income Statement. The associated cumulative gain or loss is
removed from equity and recognised in the Income Statement in the
same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
the Income Statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for
hedge accounting. At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the
hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the
forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer
expected to occur the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity
is transferred to the Income Statement.
Derivative instruments qualifying for cash flow hedging are principally
forward foreign exchange transactions and interest rate swaps.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host
contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and
the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains
or losses reported in the Income Statement.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.
T rade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their
fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts. Allowances for irrecoverable amounts are
made when there is evidence that the Group may not be able to
collect the amount due. The impairment recorded is the difference
between the carrying value of the receivables and the estimated
future cash flows. Any impairment required is recorded in the
Income Statement in administrative expenses.
T rade payables
Trade payables do not carry any interest and are stated at their
fair value.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation in respect of a past event and it is probable
that settlement will be required of an amount that can be reliably
estimated.
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the
relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the Group’s liability.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or
production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale,
are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are
substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing
costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which
they are incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and provision for impairment. Cost includes expenditure
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item including the
costs of acquiring or constructing the asset and costs incurred
subsequently to add to, or enhance the asset. Depreciation is
provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off
the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset
on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life at the
following annual rates:
Freehold land Nil
Freehold buildings 2%–5%
Leasehold buildings 2%–10% or over the life
of the lease if different
Plant, machinery
and equipment 20%–33%
Assets under construction Nil
Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and
adjusted where necessary.
Intangible fixed assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of
acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable
assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings at the date of
acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 April 2005 has
been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment
annually or where there are indications that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the
Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition
to IFRS has been eliminated through reserves on transition.
Research and development expenditure – internally generated
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the
period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are written off as incurred until it can be
demonstrated that the conditions for capitalisation in IAS 38
(Intangible Assets) are met, at which point further costs are
capitalised as intangible assets until the intangible asset is readily
available for production, and amortised on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Group, other than goodwill, are
stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortised over the asset’s estimated useful life
on a straight-line basis as follows:
Software three to five years
Development costs three years
Customer contracts one to three years
Customer relationships ten years
Impairment of fixed tangible assets and intangible assets
excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts
of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
asset is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s value in use and
its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is calculated using cash
flow projections for the asset (or group of assets where cash flows
are not identifiable for specific assets) discounted at the Group’s
cost of capital. Company overview Business review Governance Accounts
35 Hamworthy plc
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated
to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash
generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised as an expense in the Income Statement, unless the relevant
asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is
treated as a revaluation decrease.
Retirement benefit costs
The Company provides pension arrangements to the majority of full
time UK employees through a money purchase (defined contribution)
scheme, and similar schemes exist across other countries in which
the Group operates, except Norway and Germany. Contributions
and pension costs are based on pensionable salary and are charged
as an expense as they fall due. The Group has no further payment
obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Employees in Norway and Germany participate in funded defined
benefit pension plans. The cost of benefits accruing during the year in
respect of current and past service is charged against operating profit.
The expected return on the scheme’s assets and the change in the
present value of the scheme’s liabilities arising from the passage of
time are included in other finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognised in the Statement of Group Total Recognised Income and
Expense. The balance sheet includes the surplus/deficit in the scheme
taking assets at their year end market values and liabilities at their
actuarially calculated values discounted at year end AA corporate
bond interest rates.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are
dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the
Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising
in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated
using the FIFO method. Net realisable value represents the estimated
selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for
obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated
reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage
of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is measured using a matrix of indicators applicable to the contract
including costs incurred, man hours expended, deliveries made and
engineering work completed. Variations in contract work, claims and
incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been
agreed with the customer.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract
revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
T axation including deferred tax
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent that
it relates to items recognised in equity in which case it is recognised
in equity.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year calculated using
tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases
used in the computation of taxable profit. In principle deferred tax
liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are
not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or
from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of
other assets or liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax
profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or
part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply
in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
Share-based payment
The Group operates equity settled share-based compensation
plans through two share option schemes. The fair value of options
awarded is calculated at the time of grant and is charged to the
Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period
based on an estimate of the number of options that will actually vest.
The Group has adopted a Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair
value of options. The Group has also introduced a complementary
co-investment share matching plan, details of which are given in note
24. The fair value of these matching shares are calculated at the date
of award based upon the market value of the issued shares and are
charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period based on an estimate of the number of options that
will actually vest.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the same period in which
they are fully authorised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at
banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity
of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and
cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Significant judgements, assumptions and estimates
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies,
management has made a number of judgements, and the preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are
based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year
are discussed below.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes that provide
benefits to a number of current and former employees. The value of
the deficit is particularly sensitive to the market value of the scheme’s
assets, discount rates and actuarial assumptions related to mortality.
Further details are given in note 27 .
Revenue recognition for fixed price contracts
The Group derives revenue from long term projects, most of which
are normally fixed price contracts which may extend for a significant
period of time. While fixed price contracts are in progress, revenue
is recognised based on their expected profitability and extent of
completion. Profit is only taken once the outcome of the contract
can be estimated reliably, however unforseen future events may
adversely impact the accuracy of those estimates. Further details
are given in note 16. Accounting policies (continued)
36 Hamworthy plc
Current and deferred taxation
Legislation related to taxation is complex and its impact on the Group
may be uncertain. In preparing the Group’s financial statements
management estimates its taxation liability having taken appropriate
professional advice. Determination of an agreed amount of taxation
payable may take several years, and the final amounts paid may differ
from the liabilities recorded in these financial statements.
The recognition of assets and liabilities related to deferred taxation
also requires the exercise of management judgement, in particular the
extent to which assets should be recognised.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an
annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the
cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating
the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the
expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to
choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value
of those cash flows. Further details are given in note 13. The carrying
amount of goodwill at 31 March 2008 was £9,998,000 (2007:
£9,998,000).
Accounting standards not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the
following relevant Standards and Interpretations which have not
been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not
yet effective:
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
IFRS 8 Operating Segments (effective for periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2009)
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
(revised 2007) (effective for periods beginning on or after
1 January 2009) – introduces changes to the
titles of the main financial statements,
although their usage is not required, and the
incorporation of a statement of changes in
equity in to the main financial statements.
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs (effective (amended 2007)
(amended 2007) for periods beginning on or after
1 January 2009).
IFRS 3R Business Combinations (effective for periods
(revised 2008) beginning on or after 1 July 2009) – the main
anticipated impact is the requirement that all
acquisition-related costs are to be expensed
and will therefore no longer form part of the
cost of the investment.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial
(revised 2008) Statements (effective for periods beginning
on or after 1 July 2009).
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC)
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements – effective
from 1 January 2008.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes – effective
from 1 July 2008.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset,
Minimum Funding Requirements and their
Interaction – effective from 1 January 2008.
With the exception of IFRS 3R and acquisition-related costs, the
directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and
Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the
financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures
when the relevant standards come into effect.
Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s operations expose it to a number of financial risks
including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
These risks are managed centrally by the Group’s treasury function in
accordance with board approved objectives, policies and authorities.
There are internal audit procedures to ensure local compliance.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is subject to foreign exchange
risks on future commercial transactions. The principal exposures arise
in respect of variations in the cross rates between sterling, euro,
US dollar, Singapore dollar and Norwegian kroner. The Group seeks to
hedge all its transactional currency exposures through the use
of forward currency contracts. The Group does not hedge balance
sheet or income and expenditure translation exposures, or undertake
trading in financial instruments.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to its borrowings under a Senior Credit Agreement.
The Group has entered into interest rate capping arrangements to
cover approximately two-thirds of the interest payments under this
Agreement.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s cash flows and funds are managed in a central treasury
function under a cash pooling structure. The Group maintains the most
appropriate mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings from the
Group’s lenders. Details of available facilities are set out in note 20.
Credit risk
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk
with exposure spread across a number of companies across the
world. Policies are maintained to ensure that the Group makes sales to
customers with appropriate credit history. Letters of credit or other
appropriate instruments are put in place to reduce credit risk where
considered necessary.
The Group is also subject to credit risk on counter parties to its liquid
funds and its derivative financial instruments which it controls by
only dealing with highly-rated counterparties. The ratings are
constantly monitored.
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group
will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the
return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and
equity structure. The capital structure of the Group consists of
borrowings (disclosed in note 20), cash and cash equivalents and
equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued
capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 23
and 25. The Group balances its overall capital structure through the
payment of dividends, new share issues, and the use of debt facilities.
Details of the Group’s policy regarding employee share ownership and
the Group’s share option programme can be found in the Director’s
remuneration report on pages 25 to 27 .
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market
through an employee benefit trust, and these are intended to be
used for issuing shares under the Group’s Share Co-investment
Incentive Plan. The timing of these purchases is at the discretion of
the trustees. The Group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital
management during the year other than the introduction of the
incentive plan. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are
subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements. Company overview Business review Governance Accounts

2 Business and geographical segments
Business segments
For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into four operating divisions – pump systems, gas systems, water systems and
inert gas systems. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The principal activities of each segment are as follows:
– The pump systems division designs and manufactures a range of cargo and general duty pumps and pump systems.
– The gas systems division’s principal activity is the design and supply of systems which handle the phase change of petroleum products and
natural gas cargos between vapour and liquid.
– The water systems division provides advanced, environmentally-friendly solutions for the on-board treatment of liquid waste products and
the generation of fresh water through desalination plant.
– The inert gas systems division provides products which supply oxygen-depleted air to the ship’s cargo tanks to prevent explosion during the
transportation of oil and chemical cargos.

Income tax for the UK is calculated at the standard rate of UK Corporation Tax of 30% (2007: 30%) on the estimated assessable profit for the
year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
The total charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting profit as follows:

10 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential
ordinary shares where, on options granted, exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during
the year.
The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:

Values ascribed to customer contracts and relationships represent the fair value of acquired customer contracts and related customer
relationships, both contractual and non-contractual, held by the acquired company at the date of acquisition by the Group.
Values ascribed to software represent the fair value of purchased technology and software rights and licenses, where it is appropriate to
recognise such items as assets.
Values ascribed to development costs represent the directly attributable costs of internally generated development knowledge from the point
at which an individual project meets the requirements for capitalisation until it is available for utilisation in the business.
All of these assets are recognised at fair value to purchase or acquire and are amortised over their estimated useful lives. Fair values of
acquired Intangible Fixed Assets have been assessed by reference to the future estimated cash flows arising from the application of assets,
discounted at an appropriate rate to present value, or by reference to the amount that would have been paid in an arm’s length transaction
between knowledgeable and willing parties.

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) which principally comprise its individual business operations. For each CGU
the Group has determined its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. No impairment
charge was required in the year (2007: £nil) and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date was £nil (2007: £nil). The key
assumptions used in the calculations were:
– The forecast operating cash flows for the next four years based on approved budgets and plans. These budgets and plans are based on past
performance and expectations for the market development of the CGU.
– An estimate of the long-term effective tax rate for the CGU.
– An estimate of the long-term growth rate for the CGU.
The resulting cash flows were discounted using a post tax discount rate of 11%.
Sensitivity analysis has determined that there is sufficient headroom in all of the key assumptions before the carrying value becomes
impaired. For instance, the discount rate would have to more than double to result in an impairment charge for the two CGUs that comprise
the majority of the goodwill carrying value, these being Hamworthy Water Systems Limited and Hamworthy Serck Como GmbH. Company overview Business review Governance Accounts

Warranties are routinely given to customers in respect of certain products. Any costs in meeting claims, for which the warranty provision has
been established, are expected to occur within two years of the balance sheet date. Contract provisions are made where, based upon
management’s best estimate, the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are less than the cost of meeting those contract
obligations. The periods over which these are expected to unwind varies by contract.
The redundancy provision relates to estimated costs of restructuring certain of the Group’s activities in Norway and Korea. It is anticipated that
most of these costs will be incurred in the next three financial years. Company overview Business review Governance Accounts

The options outstanding at 31 March 2008 had a weighted average exercise price of 435.9p (2007: 120.2p), and a weighted average
remaining contractual life of 8.4 years (2007: 7 .4 years). During the year options were granted on 12 July 2007 with an estimated fair value of
115p per share and £291,245 in aggregate, and 33,000 options granted on 4 September 2007 with an estimated fair value of 119p per share
and £34,405 in aggregate. In the prior year options were granted on 26 June 2006 with an estimated fair value of 89.0p per share and £23,361
in aggregate.
In respect of options exercised during the year, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 606p per share (2006: £nil).
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows:
2008 2007
Weighted average share price 436p 120p

Expected volitility 29% 33%
Expected life 3.7years 3.8 years
Risk free rate 4.96% 4.95%
Expected dividend yield 2.01% 4.75%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the actual volatility of the Group’s share price since flotation in July 2004. The expected life
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and
behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £217 ,000 and £202,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2008 and
2007 respectively.
Matching shares
Hamworthy plc operates a complementary co-investment share matching plan, designed to encourage the acquisition and retention of
Hamworthy shares by relevant personnel. Participation is by invitation of the remuneration committee on grant award and is expected to be
the executive managers of the Group. Participants are awarded matching ordinary shares in Hamworthy plc, up to a limit related to basic
annual salary, in the ratio of:
– one for every one share already beneficially owned, and
– one for every two vested but unexercised share options held
Further details are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 25 to 27 . The number of shares acquired by the trust during the year
was 66,550 at a total cost of £396,000. Notes to the accounts (continued)

30 Derivative financial instruments and risk management
The main risks from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk. The board reviews and
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, term loan under a Senior Credit Agreement with Barclays Bank plc and
local loan and overdraft facilities held by subsidiaries. The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its
borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement, upon which interest is paid at a rate of 1 .5% above LIBOR, and to its cash resources which
are invested at variable rates. A 10% increase in interest rates throughout the year would have increased profit after tax by £0.1 million (2007:
£0.1 million) with an equal but opposite effect for a fall in interest rates, all other variables remaining constant.
Liquidity risk
The Group has a strong cash flow and funds generated from operations are managed in a central treasury function under a cash pooling
structure. The Group maintains the most appropriate mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities:

Foreign currency risk
The currencies most important to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were those which are typically linked by monetary
policy at fixed exchange rates to the euro as well as US dollars, sterling, Norwegian kroner and Singapore dollars. The Group seeks to hedge
all its transactional currency exposures arising from sales and purchases by operating units in currencies other than the unit’s functional
currency through the use of forward contracts. The value of forward exchange contracts in the Group’s main operating currencies at the
balance sheet date were as follows:

Net (277 ,503) 5,856 1,387 ,771 27 ,317 48,785
The Group does not hedge balance sheet translation exposures and therefore any foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these
assets and liabilities are taken to the Income Statement of the companies and the Group.
The Group’s operating units hold monetary assets and monetary liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the operating
currency of the operating unit involved. These balances are retranslated at the balance sheet date. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency
risk for these balances for its most important currencies at the balance sheet date was as follows: Company overview Business review Governance Accounts

Sensitivity analysis
A 10% strengthening of sterling against these currencies at 31 March would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit by the amounts
shown below, assuming all other variables remained constant:

Danish kroner (711) (567) (309) (190)
Singapore dollar (868) (640) (156) (78)
An equal but opposite effect would have been the impact of a 10% weakening of sterling.
Credit risk
Exposure to credit risk
The principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments.
The Group exposure to credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with
high credit ratings awarded by international credit rating agencies and these ratings are constantly monitored and are currently all rated at
S&P A rating or above.
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a number of companies across the world.
Policies are maintained to ensure that the Group makes sales to customers with appropriate credit history. Letters of credit or other
appropriate instruments are put in place to reduce credit risk where considered necessary. The credit quality of the Group’s trade receivables
is considered by management to be very good as a high proportion of customers are large global companies with whom the Group trades on
a long-term basis. This is further evidenced by the low rate of impairment provided and amounts written off. Notes to the accounts (continued)

30 Derivative financial instruments and risk management continued
This allowance has been determined by reference to the recoverability of specific overdue debts. No allowance for impairment is made
against Other receivables. The creation and reversal of provisions for impaired trade receivables are included in administrative expenses
in the Income Statement.
Derivatives and financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade
debtors and trade creditors that arise from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s
operations. It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the policy of the Group that no trading in financial instruments shall
be undertaken.
Interest rate caps
The Group has entered into interest rate capping agreements during the year in order to manage its interest rate risk on the Senior Credit
Agreement. Approximately two-thirds of the interest rate payments under the Senior Credit Agreement are covered by these capping
agreements. Under the capping agreements the Group receives from counterparties any amounts by which that LIBOR portion rises above
a cap rate and pays to counterparties any amounts by which LIBOR falls below a floor rate. The current capping agreement provides for a
cap of 6.39% and a floor of 2.93%.
Currency derivatives
Currency derivatives are used to hedge future transactions and cash flows, and the Group’s resultant exposure to movements in foreign
exchange rates. These are primarily in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and options, and are denominated in the currencies of
the Group’s principal operating markets.
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group is committed,
based upon contractual undiscounted cash flows, are as follows:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Foreign currency options 50,580 60,695
Forward foreign exchange contracts 221,747 171,205
All derivative financial instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments
that are designated as effective hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the Income Statement. The Group recognised total gains of £241,000 (2007: £nil) related to ineffective hedging transactions.

At 31 March 2008 contingent liabilities exist in respect of bank guarantees in relation to performance bonds totalling £22,667 ,000 (2007:
£11,652,000).
The Group routinely enters into a range of contractual arrangements in the ordinary course of events which can give rise to claims or potential
litigation against Group companies. It is the Group’s policy to make specific provisions at the balance sheet date for all liabilities including
warranty costs and guarantees which, in the opinion of the directors, are expected to result in a significant loss. The directors have reviewed
the open claims and pending litigation against the Group at the year end and concluded that no material unprovided loss is likely to accrue to
the Group from any such unprovided claims.

Transactions between Group undertakings, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.

T o the shareholders of Hamworthy plc
61 Hamworthy plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of
Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the
Balance sheet, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses
and the related notes. These parent company financial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of
Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual report and the
parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement
of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent
company financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you
whether, in our opinion, the information given in the Directors’ report
is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual report, and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company
financial statements. This other information comprises only the
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s strategy statement, the
Business Review, the Financial Review, the Directors’ Remuneration
Report, the Directors’ Report and the Corporate Governance
statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation
of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent company financial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view,
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2008;
and
– the parent company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
– the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
parent company financial statements.

Accounting policies
63 Hamworthy plc
Statement of accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been
applied consistently throughout the year and, except for changes
noted below, the preceding period, is set out below.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom
Accounting Standards.
T angible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided
on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost or
valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight
line basis over its expected useful life at the following annual rates:
Plant, machinery and equipment 20%–33%
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for any
diminution in value.
T axation
Current UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be
paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in
the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the
Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax
assessments in periods different from those in which they are
recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected
to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is
measured on a non-discounted basis.
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis
over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such
a basis.
Deferred finance costs
Issue costs associated with bank loans are deducted from the gross
proceeds in the balance sheet. Financial Reporting Statement 4
‘Capital Instruments’ requires such costs to be allocated over the term
of the loan at a constant rate on the carrying value using the effective
interest rate. The Company has applied a policy of amortising the cost
over the term of the loan at a constant rate, but this is not materially
different to using the effective interest rate.
Pension scheme arrangements
The Company provides pension arrangements to the majority of full
time UK employees through a money purchase scheme, operated by
Barnett Waddingham LLP . Contributions and pension costs are based
on pensionable salary and are recorded in the period in which they fall.
Foreign exchange
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of
exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet
date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or
at a contracted rate if applicable. Any gain or loss arising from a
change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction
is included as an exchange gain/loss in the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate cap,
floor and swap agreements are recognised in the interest
payable/receivable charge/credit on an accruals basis. The interest
differential amounts due to/from the counterparty on such
agreements are accrued until the settlement date and are recognised
as an adjustment to interest expense.
Share-based payment
The Company operates equity settled share-based compensation
plans through two share option schemes. The fair value of options
awarded is calculated at the time of grant and is charged to the
Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period
based on an estimate of the number of options that will actually
vest. The Group has adopted a Black-Scholes model to calculate the
fair value of options. The Company also participates in the Group’s
complementary co-investment share matching plan, details of which
are given in note 11 . The fair value of these matching shares is
calculated at the date of award based upon the market value of the
issued shares and is charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate of the number
of options that will actually vest.
Related party transactions and cash flow statement
The Company is the ultimate parent undertaking of the Hamworthy
Group and is therefore included in the consolidated financial
statements of that Group, which are publicly available. Consequently
the Company has taken advantage of the exemptions from preparing
a cash flow statement under the terms of Financial Reporting
Standard 1 (Revised 1996) – Cash Flow Statements, and the
exemptions under Financial Reporting Standard 8 – Related Party
Disclosures relating to the disclosure of transactions with other
Group companies. Notes to the accounts

Expected volatility 29% 33%
Expected life 3.7 years 3.8 years
Risk free rate 4.96% 4.95%
Expected dividend yield 2.01% 4.75%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the actual volatility of the Group’s share price since flotation in July 2004. The expected life
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and
behavioural considerations. The Company recognised total expenses of £42,579 (2007: £78,398) related to equity-settled share-based
payment transactions. Subsidiary companies made a cash contribution to the Company of £1 .48 million (2006: £nil)
in the year in respect of share options exercised in the year.
Matching shares
Hamworthy plc has put in place a complementary co-investment share matching plan, designed to encourage the acquisition and retention of
Hamworthy shares by relevant personnel. Participation is by invitation of the remuneration committee on grant award and is expected to be
the executive managers of the Group. Participants are awarded matching ordinary shares in Hamworthy plc, up to a limit related to basic
annual salary, in the ratio of
– one for every one share already beneficially owned, and
– one for every two vested but unexercised share options held
Further details are given in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 25 to 27 . The number of shares acquired by the trust during the year
was 66,550 at a total cost of £396,000.

70 Hamworthy plc Notes
1 . A form of proxy is enclosed for use by shareholders and, if appropriate, must be deposited with the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, Proxy Department,
The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours before the time of the Annual General Meeting (‘ AGM’). Appointment of a
proxy does not preclude a shareholder from attending the AGM and voting in person.
2. A member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a member of the Company) to attend and to speak and to vote
on his or her behalf whether by show of hands or on a poll. A member can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed
to exercise the rights attaching to different shares held by him. In order to be valid an appointment of proxy (together with any authority under which it is executed or a
copy of the authority certified notarially) must be returned by one of the following methods:
– in hard copy form by post, by courier or by hand to the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, Proxy Department,The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham,
Kent BR3 4TU; or
– in the case of CREST members, by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service in accordance with the procedures set out below;
and in each case must be received by the Company not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the AGM and any adjournment thereof
by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have
appointed a voting service provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment, or instruction, made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly
authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (‘EUI’) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in
the CREST manual.The message regardless of whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given previously to the appointed
proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA 10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in
the Notice of Meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST
Application Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner described by CREST . The Company may treat as
invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 . CREST members and where
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages.
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy instructions. It is therefore the responsibility of the CREST member
concerned to take (or, if CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his or her
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that the message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any
particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections
of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
3. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, in order to be able to attend and vote at the AGM or any adjourned meeting (and also for
the purpose of calculating how many votes a person may cast), a person must have his/her name entered on the register of members of the Company by 6.00pm on
12 July 2008 (or 6.00pm on the date two days before any adjourned meeting). Changes to entries on the register of members after this time shall be disregarded in
determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
4. The following documents are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours on any weekday and will be available at the
place of the AGM from at least 15 minutes prior to and until the conclusion of the meeting:
– Directors’ service contracts
– Register of directors’ interests
5. Any electronic communication received by the Company, including the lodgement of an electronic proxy form, that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.

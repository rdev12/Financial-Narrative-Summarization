We are delighted to report that 2013 has been another year of 
significant progress for Tyman plc. 
During 2013 the Group has made further strides towards our 
strategic aim of becoming the leading supplier of components to 
the door and window industry and, following the acquisition of 
Truth, we are now the leading player in the North American 
residential window and door components market. 
This progress has been achieved through a combination of organic 
growth in our core US and UK businesses of Amesbury and 
Grouphomesafe, together with the acquisition of Truth – which has 
increased the size of our North American business by approximately 
40 per cent. As expected, Schlegel International had a more 
challenging year, reflecting difficult markets and the necessary 
investment made in consolidating its manufacturing footprint and 
management structures; however, we are confident that we now 
have the right platform for growth.
Truth has made a strong contribution to the Group in the first six 
months of our ownership, despite Canadian market activity levels 
that were much lower than in recent years, giving us confidence for 
further improvements over the course of 2014. 
Tyman has gone through a great deal of change over the course of 
the last four years and particularly in the last 12 months. The change 
of name in February of 2013 heralded the start of a significant 
period of corporate activity for the Group involving the raising of 
new debt and equity to finance the acquisition of Truth, the move 
from AiM to the Main List of the London Stock Exchange and the 
integration of Truth into our North American business. Since the year 
end we have also completed the acquisition of Vedasil Brasil. 
Managing that change has been a fundamental part of the good 
governance of Tyman and the Board has been closely involved in 
ensuring that the Group’s decision-making processes take into 
account the relevant interests of each of our stakeholders – 
shareholders, providers of finance, employees, customers as well as 
the wider environment.
Corporate developments and strategy 
Four years ago we set out a clear strategy outlining the actions that 
we would seek to take to reshape the Group and rebuild confidence 
with each of our stakeholders. 
A key element of that strategy was to develop our portfolio of 
products in our principal markets. In line with that strategy, we 
announced our intention to acquire Truth, the leading North 
American manufacturer of casement hardware, in May 2013. This 
transaction greatly extended our product offering, enabling us to 
offer a full range of components to our customer base, as well as 
allowing us an operating facility in Canada for the first time.
Chairman’s statement
Our core businesses have continued to deliver a 
solid performance and we have grown our market 
shares in both the US and the UK. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
The acquisition completed on 3 July 2013, and we have been 
pleased with the progress made towards the integration of the two 
businesses, as a result of the commitment of teams from both 
Amesbury and Truth. Substantial progress has been made with 
regard to the delivery of synergies identified at the time of the 
acquisition, such that we now have significantly upgraded these 
synergy targets by some 60 per cent. We now have a single 
leadership team for our North American business, comprising 
individuals drawn from both Truth and Amesbury and a combined 
sales and marketing organisation under the leadership of an 
external hire.
Over the past 12 months we have strengthened the organisational 
and management structures in each of our divisions to reflect the 
increased size of the Group and to accord with the greater scope 
and potential of the enlarged businesses. The extent to which we 
have deepened and strengthened our management team across 
the Group is best illustrated by the fact that nearly half of the 
individuals who were awarded LTIP grants in 2013 joined Tyman, 
whether through acquisition or through recruitment, since the date 
of the last grant in July 2012.
Trading performance
Throughout this transformational period, our core businesses have 
continued to deliver a solid performance and we have grown our 
market shares in both the USA and the UK. 
For 2013 we have reported a 30.3 per cent increase in revenue and 
a 40.9 per cent increase in underlying operating profit. Underlying 
earnings per share have increased by 33.0 per cent to 13.71 pence 
and the Truth acquisition was earnings enhancing in the first six 
months of ownership.
The Group as a whole has delivered a material improvement in its 
return on average capital employed of 180 basis points to 9.0 per 
cent, with Truth making a positive contribution in the first six 
months of ownership, much earlier than we expected at the time of 
its acquisition.
Our cash flow performance in the year was excellent, with the Group’s 
leverage of 1.81x at the year end being significantly below the 
expected leverage of 2.00x we announced at the time of the 
acquisition, and well within our core target range of 1.50x to 2.00x. 
Operating cash conversion of 111.9 per cent (2012 restated: 83.6 per 
cent) reflects the tight management of the working capital cycle by 
the divisions despite the increased investments in capital expenditure 
made during 2013.
Dividend
The Board considers the dividend to be an important component of 
shareholder returns and accordingly, is recommending a final 
dividend for 2013 of 4.50 pence per share (2012: 3.50 pence per 
share) which, together with the interim dividend of 1.50 pence per 
share, gives a total dividend for the year of 6.00 pence per share 
(2012: 4.50 pence per share). 
This represents an increase of 33.3 per cent over the prior year and 
a cover of approximately 2.29x in relation to our 2013 underlying 
earnings per share – in line with our policy of cover of between 
2.00x and 2.50x through the cycle. 
Looking forward
In conclusion, I would like to thank all Tyman’s employees, 
especially those who have joined the Group in the past year, for the 
substantial efforts they have made to deliver these results, in what 
has been a very exciting and challenging year. 
In 2014, we look forward to delivering further significant progress.

Where we source or manufacture
In order to provide our customers with the service they need, the 
manufacturing decision is key. Is the customer best served by 
Tyman manufacturing the product ourselves or can the product be 
provided more efficiently and effectively through Tyman sourcing 
the components the customer needs?
We choose to manufacture products, such as complex balances, 
extrusions and seals, close to our customer base where flexibility, 
variety or complexity are key to the component manufacturing 
process and to the customer. For products that are less complex, 
have a high labour content or more predictable demand levels, 
we may choose to source from lower cost and sometimes more 
remote locations, often using third party manufacturers to make 
or assemble components on our behalf. Examples of sourced 
products would include handles and standard locks.
As part of the manufacturing decision we aim to ensure that we 
have flexibility in how we make or source the product such that 
we have built in redundancy. This may be geographic in the case 
of our own manufacturing plants, or may involve certifying and 
approving more than one potential supplier of a sourced product. 
This flexibility allows us to respond quickly to changes in product 
demand levels and to move manufacture around depending on 
capacity levels.
Substantially all of the components we supply to our customers – 
whether manufactured by us in our own plants or sourced 
externally – are engineering led, value added products made to 
our designs, protected where possible and practical by patents 
and Intellectual Property, and manufactured on our own 
proprietary tooling.
Our business model is built around our customers, 
the products we sell to them and the service we 
provide to them. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Financial statements
Financial discipline
Underpinning our business model is a focus on financial disciplines 
that encompasses margin targets for each of our products, close 
scrutiny of the cost base, optimisation of working capital, and a 
rigorous approach to return on capital and its allocation, both 
internally in the form of capital investment and externally in the 
form of M&A.
Quality and service
The manufacturing decision for Tyman comes back to our desire 
to differentiate our product offering from that of our competitors 
by providing customers with the highest quality product at the 
relevant price point, delivered on time and in full. This focus on 
quality and service leads to deeper customer relations, puts us 
front of mind as new designs are contemplated by Original 
Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and allows us to set the 
benchmark for the industry.
New product development programmes across all of our divisions 
are focused on anticipating future trends within the industry and 
delivering customised engineered solutions to our customers.  
Throughout the downturn we remained committed as a Group 
to the development of our product offering and retained our key 
teams of designers and engineers at a time when many of our 
competitors were cutting back in this area.
Service is at the heart of what Tyman aims to offer its customers.  
For our largest customers we deploy our own engineers on their 
factory floors, allowing us early notice of product or service issues, 
however small, and giving us an early insight into future new 
product development. For our distribution customers we take care 
of critical elements of their supply chain, including inventory 
management, packaging and shipment to distribution hubs. For 
key manufacturing customers we have developed our processes 
such that we can deliver their component inventory on a just in 
time basis and sequenced in the order that they intend to 
consume the product.

This has been a further year of transformation for 
Tyman during which we have made significant 
operating, financial and strategic progress across 
each of our Divisions. 
2014 Priorities
Our key priorities for 2014 are as follows:
1. Completion of the integration of Amesbury and Truth into a 
single customer facing organisation, along with delivery of our 
revised synergy targets.
2. Evaluation of our footprint in our developed markets to ensure 
that it is appropriate for the medium term needs of the business, 
taking into account opportunities for near shoring of those 
products best made or sourced close to the point of 
consumption.
3. Continuing to encourage strong communication, consistency 
of approach and standards of excellence across each of the 
divisions. For our end customer, wherever they are located, this 
should mean the availability of a differentiated product offering 
at an appropriate price, delivered to specification, on time and 
in full. 
4. Key financial objectives for each of our divisions in 2014 remain 
centred on sustained margin improvement and cash generation 
along with continued growth in the Group’s average return 
on capital. We expect developed markets will see pricing 
opportunities arise as markets and volumes recover.
5. Continued investment in and improvement of the businesses; 
in particular in the areas of new product development, people, 
supply chain and capital projects with a focus on automation 
and lean manufacturing to ensure we differentiate ourselves 
from our competitors.
6. Supplementing our organic and self-help initiatives through 
our active acquisition programme, prioritising European 
markets where we currently have a limited hardware range and 
emerging markets where market position can best be obtained 
through acquisition.
The acquisition of Truth, combined with the swift integration into 
Amesbury under a unified management team, provides the Group 
with a strong platform for further growth in North America. Since 
the year end we have completed the acquisition of Vedasil Brasil, 
giving us a seal manufacturing platform in South America for the 
first time. 
The current year has started well and in line with expectations 
across each of the divisions. Continued recovery in our key end 
markets, combined with share gains and the delivery of further 
synergy benefits in North America underpin our confidence for 
the future. Tyman plc

Outlook
The current year has started well and in line with our expectations 
across each of the Divisions. Currency movements are expected to 
have a greater impact on reported numbers in 2014 than in recent 
years however continued recovery in our key end markets, combined 
with market share gains and the delivery of further synergy benefits 
in North America, underpin our confidence for the future. 
We expect continued improvement in our North American markets 
this year with new build in the US forecast to increase further, 
supported by a continued gradual acceleration in repair and 
remodelling expenditure. The Canadian market is forecast to be flat 
in 2014, which would be a significant improvement compared with 
the decline seen in 2013. Delivery of our synergy targets, together 
with opportunities for market share gain should lead to further 
growth and good momentum in North America this year. 
The first two months have seen extreme weather conditions in 
North America, however despite this our businesses have traded 
ahead of the equivalent period in 2012, giving us confidence that 
once weather conditions improve, the recovery in the overall market 
seen in 2013 should continue.
Coming into this year, there appears to be greater confidence in 
the sustainability of the recovery in the UK and, for the first time 
in a number of years, we are forecasting growth for the UK market. 
In 2014, we will aim to increase Grouphomesafe’s market share 
through organic growth and new product introductions, together 
with a more structured approach to the distribution market. The 
first two months have seen continued good momentum in our 
UK businesses. 
For Schlegel International, 2014 should see an improved 
performance as the investments we have made to date start 
to deliver. Material profit improvement however will depend on 
significantly increased volumes, which in turn will depend on a 
sustained recovery in European markets, which are not expected 
to come through until at least 2015. Trading in the first two months 
is marginally ahead of the equivalent period last year. We expect 
continued growth in Australasia, South East Asia and Brazil where 
the acquisition of Vedasil Brasil gives us a market leading position 
and local manufacture for the first time.

Key performance indicators
The Group monitors and measures performance against its 
KPIs, highlighted below. These KPIs are in line with the 
strategic priorities of the Group and provide a means of 
evaluating how well the Group is working together to deliver 
the long-term strategy. 
Purpose
To identify the directional trend in sales revenue and evaluate 
the ability of the Group to grow its customer base and improve 
its margins. 
Target
To improve revenue growth. 
Performance
Revenue has increased by 6.3 per cent in 2013 on a like for like 
basis, due in large part to the strong top line performance from 
Amesbury.
Purpose
To evaluate the profitability and financial health of the Group. A 
relative measure of each GB£ of revenue remaining after all direct 
manufacturing costs have been incurred.
Target
To maintain and improve gross margin. 
Performance
Gross margins from continuing operations improved by 60bps, 
reflecting a full year contribution from Fab & Fix and a six month 
contribution from Truth, offset by lower margins seen in Schlegel 
International as a consequence of lower European trading levels. 
Purpose
To evaluate the profitability and financial health of the Group. A 
relative measure of each GB£ of operating profit remaining after all 
direct manufacturing and administrative costs have been incurred. 
Target
To maintain and improve operating margins through the 
management control of the Group’s overhead and administrative 
costs. 
Performance
Operating margins from continuing operations improved by  
90bps, reflecting a strong performance by Amesbury, a full  
year contribution from Fab & Fix and a six month contribution  
from Truth, offset by a poor margin performance in Schlegel 
International as a consequence of lower European trading  
levels.

Purpose
To evaluate the ability of the Group to generate sufficient cash 
flows to cover its contractual debt servicing obligations.
Target
To maintain a core leverage ratio of between 1.50x to 2.00x 
through the cycle.
Performance
The year end leverage was 1.81x. The KPI increased in 2013 due  
to the drawdown of net borrowings to part-fund the acquisition of 
Truth Hardware; however it was back within our core target range  
of 1.50x to 2.00x approximately 12 months earlier than we had 
expected. 
Purpose
To evaluate how efficiently the business’s capital and controllable 
capital are being employed to improve profitability.
Target
To maintain and steadily improve ROCE and ROCCE.
Performance
The Group as a whole has delivered a material improvement in  
its return on average capital employed and return on controllable 
capital employed, with Truth making a positive contribution in  
the first six months of ownership.

Financial strength and capital discipline continued
Other strategic financial and non-financial KPIs
Purpose
Evaluation of the cash flows generated by the business operations 
to pay down debt, return to our shareholders and invest in 
acquisitions.
Target
Core target is 100 per cent conversion of operating profit into 
operational cash flow across a 12 month period. 
Performance
Given the significant investment in capital expenditure made during 
the year (1.3x depreciation), cash conversion of 111.9 per cent is 
considered to be an excellent performance. 
Purpose
To determine the improvement in underlying earnings per share for 
our shareholders. 
Target
To improve underlying EPS performance.
Performance
The increase in the underlying earnings per share before property 
provision releases reflects the improvement in the underlying 
operating profit from Amesbury and Grouphomesafe, the 
incremental impact of the Truth acquisition, together with early 
delivery of synergies, the reduction in finance charges, and the 
slightly lower effective tax rate for the year, offset by the increase  
in the weighted average number of shares in issue.
Purpose
To evaluate the delivery of consistent and balanced returns to 
shareholders in the form of dividends. 
Target
To grow dividends annually at least in line with underlying earnings. 
Performance
Dividends have grown consistently and by 33.3 per cent in 2013.

Performance
The on time delivery rate decreased to 81.5 per cent from 93.0 per cent 
in 2012. OTIF performance for the Group was impacted by factory 
moves in Europe and North America during the year. Core OTIF

Target
All acquisitions target an annualised Return on Acquisition 
Investment (“ROAI”) greater than 15 per cent in the first two years 
following acquisition. 
Performance
While Overland has not achieved the required return, it had a much 
improved second year under our ownership, generating a ROAI 
close to the target level. Fab & Fix has performed very strongly for 
the Group since acquisition and has already significantly exceeded 
the required return threshold within 18 months of acquisition. Truth 
has made a strong contribution in the first six months and looks well 
positioned to exceed the required return within 12 months of the 
date of acquisition.  Tyman plc

Amesbury
Performance
Amesbury’s revenues increased by some 10.2 per cent to US$207.1 
million (2012: US$188.0 million) with consistent gains across all 
product lines and strong performance from our hardware and 
sealing products in particular. Underlying operating profit increased 
by 25.0 per cent to US$22.8 million (2012: US$18.2 million) and 
underlying operating margins improved from 9.7 per cent to 11.0 
per cent. 
We saw particularly strong growth in the year from the mid to large 
customer range with those customers who have vinyl offerings in 
their portfolio demonstrating incremental volume growth compared 
with the higher end timber window manufacturers. We continued to 
grow our commercial presence during the year with a number of 
new customer wins and made further progress in Canada.
Business developments
During the year we announced the reorganisation of Amesbury into 
a functional structure as a precursor to the integration of Truth. We 
implemented our new ERP system for the first time at our Foamtite 
plant in Amesbury MA and completed the integration of the Unique 
balance business into our Statesville plant.
Operational review
Markets
The housing market in the USA continued to recover through 2013 
with residential housing starts up 18.3 per cent in the year to 
923,400 and completions (our most relevant in year indicator) up 
17.4 per cent to 762,200. Single family housing starts increased by 
approximately 15.4 per cent across the year and completions by 
17.6 per cent. Repair and remodelling saw the first signs of a return 
to sustained growth in the second half of the year and overall we 
believe the USA market for our products improved by approximately 
8.0 per cent in 2013.
The Canadian market was more difficult in 2013. The first half of 
the year saw total housing starts fall by 16.8 per cent and single 
family starts fall by 9.7 per cent. The second half of the year was 
stronger than the first with a degree of recovery and, over the year 
as a whole total housing starts fell by some 12.5 per cent with single 
family starts down 8.1 per cent. Overall, we believe that the 
Canadian market for our products contracted by approximately 
10.0 per cent in 2013.

T ruth Hardware
Performance under Tyman ownership
Truth had a strong first six months under Tyman ownership. Despite 
slower growth in revenues than Amesbury, a function of a greater 
proportion of the business being weighted towards Canada, Truth 
delivered a significant improvement in its operating profit and 
margins with no loss of momentum in the business as a result of the 
acquisition.
In the period since completion, Truth reported revenues of US$67.1 
million (2012: US$64.5 million) and underlying operating profit of 
US$12.0 million (2012: US$9.5 million) after allocation of Tyman 
central costs of approximately US$1.1 million. The reported 
performance for Truth in the six months benefitted from US$0.9 
million of early delivery of synergies, as discussed further in the 
integration section below.

Products Premiere 3000 
multi-point lock
Amesbury’s new patented P3000 multi-point 
lock (“MPL ”) system is a perfect solution for 
today’s consumer. The system is oriented with 
the thumb-turn above the handle, more similar 
to the standard front entry door configurations 
today.
In addition, the dead-bolt operates independently from the 
other locking points, allowing a user to secure the door when 
unfamiliar with MPL technology. The misuse device is buried 
within the gearing mechanism, eliminating protruding buttons 
and the damage they can cause on strike plates.
This system incorporates a pull and twist latch design and is 
constructed of corrosion resistant materials throughout. 
Standard configurations are available as well as customisable 
configurations to best fit your application.

Business developments
Truth has continued to invest in the automation of its 
manufacturing processes to improve the operational environment 
for employees, increase production capacity, reduce costs and 
to optimise plant layouts. Four automation projects were 
commissioned and delivered during 2013 and a further four 
projects are scheduled for delivery by the summer of 2014.
Integration and structure
In our first six months of ownership, we have made considerable 
progress with the integration of Truth into the Amesbury business. 
On completion we formed an integration steering committee 
comprising the CEO and CFO of Tyman and the two CEOs of 
Amesbury and Truth, to co-ordinate and direct the integration 
process. We also established a clear integration plan with allocated 
milestones and responsibilities cascaded down the organisations.
This level of focus has enabled us to commence the delivery of 
synergy benefits earlier than expected, with some US$0.9 million 
of cost synergies delivered in the first six months of ownership. In 
addition, we have revised our synergy targets and now expect to 
deliver US$5.0 million of synergies in 2014 and a total of US$8.0 
million of synergies in 2015 – an increase of 60 per cent over our 
original 2015 synergy target.
Since the acquisition, we have made substantial changes to the 
operational footprint of the Truth sites in North America. Two 
external warehouses in Owatonna have been closed, with one sold 
and the other handed back at the end of the lease term. In Toronto, 
a new lease on a reduced and more appropriate footprint was 
entered into from the start of 2014.
From January 2014, Amesbury and Truth have been combined as 
a single business, with Amesbury as the umbrella brand for all our 
North American businesses and Truth designated as our premium 
North American hardware brand. We now have a single leadership 
team for our North American business, comprising individuals drawn 
from both Truth and Amesbury, and a combined sales and 
marketing organisation under the leadership of an external hire.
North American outlook
We expect to see further recovery in the USA new build market in 
2014, supported by the continued gradual acceleration in repair and 
remodelling. The Canadian market is expected to be broadly flat in 
2014 compared with 2013. Delivery of our synergy targets, together 
with opportunities for market share gain, should lead to further 
growth and good momentum in North America this year.
2014 initiatives include the completion of the integration process 
for Amesbury and Truth, further ERP implementations across a 
number of sites, the commencement of targeted automation 
projects within Amesbury and a structured evaluation of our 
medium term North American manufacturing footprint.
New energy specifications and 
requirements for increased window 
performance has necessitated the need 
for sashes to contain triple pane  
or laminated glass. 
This, combined with the move towards larger windows, 
has expanded the boundaries on what standard duty 
concealed casement windows can handle. Truth’s High 
Performance Casement Hinge is capable of supporting 
a 140 lb sash, allowing manufacturers to build operable 
windows that meet these demanding new 
requirements.
Additional features of the High Performance Casement 
Hinge include:
 > Innovative patented shoe design with a built-in roller 
to reduce friction during operation, thereby 
providing smoother travel even under maximum 
load. This “super shoe” is able to withstand up to 
240 lbs of pull-out force in open position and also 
acts as a shipping block to help protect the hinge 
from damage during shipping and handling.
 > Larger adjustable brass stud to provide more 
adjustment and weight carrying capacity. Nearly 
1/8th of an inch of adjustability of the sash helps to 
ensure a consistent reveal and optimum weather 
seal while helping to reduce sash drag.
 > Available in 300 Series stainless steel, which offers 
corrosion protection.

After a slow first quarter, the UK market saw good momentum 
across the remainder of the year. New build activity in 2013 
increased by approximately 23.0 per cent and RMI, which comprises 
substantially all of the UK market, increased by an estimated 4.5 
per cent. Overall, we believe that the market for our products grew 
by approximately 5.0 per cent in the year, which was significantly 
ahead of our expectations coming into 2013.
Performance
Grouphomesafe had a strong year with good financial performance 
backed up with significant market share gains in hardware.
Revenues in the UK increased by 17.3 per cent to £86.0 million 
(2012: £73.3 million). On a like for like basis, revenues in the UK 
increased by 3.9 per cent to £76.2 million (2012: £73.4 million). 
Lower steel pricing through the year at our reinforcer business 
impacted our reported revenues somewhat, however we saw strong 
gains in volumes across all of our UK hardware businesses. 
Underlying operating profit increased by 17.0 per cent to £10.5 
million (2012: £9.0 million) reflecting a full year contribution from 
Fab & Fix and our continued focus on margin management across 
the Grouphomesafe portfolio. Reported like for like profitability is 
affected by the fact that overall synergy benefits arising from the 
integration of Fab & Fix into Grouphomesafe have all been captured 
in Fab & Fix rather than spread across the whole of 
Grouphomesafe’s operations. 
We reported good growth at ERA, Fab & Fix and Balance – with 
notable share gains in the door hardware segment where we 
benefitted from being able to sell the high quality Fab & Fix product 
to a wider customer base.
Our routes to market saw solid performance from the builders 
merchants and the signs of recovery from our core OEM fabricator 
customers. The general distribution channel was broadly flat in the 
year following our exit from low margin retail distribution business 
in 2012.
Ventrolla, our sash window refurbishment business, repurchased one 
further franchise during the year and has an encouraging pipeline 
of projects for 2014.
Business developments
During the year we completed the integration of Fab & Fix into 
Grouphomesafe, with Fab & Fix now positioned as the premium 
quality product within our portfolio and with a single sales force.
We moved certain legacy hardware products out of individual sites 
to consolidate elements of our general hardware offer at our 
Wolverhampton distribution site and closed our small distribution 
centre in Falkirk.
We have also continued to improve our supply chain, identifying 
and pre-qualifying a number of additional potential manufacturing 
partners in the Far East, and have diversified the Fab & Fix supplier 
base; which was a key objective identified at the time of acquisition.
UK outlook
Coming into this year, there appears to be greater confidence in the 
sustainability of the recovery in the UK and, for the first time in a 
number of years, we are forecasting growth for the UK market.
2014 initiatives include the development of a full service 
e-commerce platform for the UK market, the completion of the 
integration of Fab & Fix, further rationalisation of obsolete SKUs as 
we refine the product offering, a number of new product launches 
and further investment in the supply chain. We also intend to target 
the distribution sector in a more structured manner in 2014 and we 
continue to evaluate our UK footprint. Tyman plc

Schlegel International
Market
European markets were very subdued in 2013 with the key 
geographies of Northern and Eastern Europe all showing significant 
declines. Adverse weather conditions in Q1, general destocking of 
inventories and lack of end user demand meant that the sales 
environment was particularly challenging. The market in Australia 
saw a strong first half, however eased off somewhat in the second 
half to end the year broadly flat. The Brazilian market continued to 
perform strongly in the year and we believe the market improved by 
around 15.0 per cent in 2013.
Performance
Schlegel’s revenues decreased by some 1.6 per cent on a constant 
currency basis to £36.8 million (2012: £37.4 million), with difficult 
trading in Europe offset in part by stronger performances in Brazil 
and Australia. These difficult trading conditions, combined with the 
impact of the factory moves undertaken in the first quarter and the 
investment made in the business, meant that Schlegel only broke 
even at the operating level and made a small loss after the 
allocation of central costs.

Building on rapid growth over the past 
three years, the market for bi-fold doors 
in the UK is forecast to double in value 
by 2016. 
To capitalise on this trend, Grouphomesafe has worked 
in close partnership with leading PVCu and aluminium 
system companies to develop a complete range of 
bi-fold door hardware. This has called upon every 
aspect of Grouphomesafe’s expertise and includes 
bespoke locking systems, rollers and hinges from ERA, 
seals from Schlegel, reinforcement from EWS and 
decorative hardware from Fab & Fix.
The ability to produce all of these components under 
one roof means that they work in perfect harmony. 
This, coupled with market leading features and 
benefits, has lead to PVCu system companies extruding 
new profiles specifically to take advantage of the 
package. Typically profile development leads hardware 
design; this turnaround is testament to the quality of 
the system and Grouphomesafe’s growing reputation 
for innovation.

Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
All our European geographies had a very tough opening quarter, 
although as the year progressed trading did improve, with the 
exceptions of Belgium and France, both of which saw quarter on 
quarter declines throughout the year. We had a strong 2013 in Italy 
with good market share gains against a very low base, due to two 
competitors exiting the marketplace and in Poland new dedicated 
sales resource on the ground enabled us to win back some lost 
customers.
Australia had a strong year as a whole, taking market share and 
benefitting from continued penetration of new products. Brazil had 
another strong year, with new product introductions in the second 
half of 2012 giving a boost to first half 2013 comparatives and 
Singapore had a solid first year as a stand alone entity.
Business developments
We made significant changes to the Schlegel International business 
in 2013. In the first quarter we closed our Belgian Building Products 
facility and moved production to our Newton Aycliffe and Barcelona 
plants. These moves give the Group clearly defined centres of 
excellence for sealing manufacture in Europe. We also recruited a 
number of new senior managers to the Schlegel team with new 
hires filling the roles of Sales Director, Development Director and 
Operations Director, together with a number of new recruits and 
promotions at individual site locations.
This rebalancing of our European footprint, combined with the 
strengthening of the Divisional team, positions Schlegel well for 
growth as and when European markets recover. 
Australia saw a number of new hires as well as a reconfiguration of 
the Sydney facility in order for it to become the Australasian 
distributor of Truth products from 2014. From 1 January 2013, 
Singapore was constituted as a separate legal entity, and during the 
year was moved to a new location reflecting its growing importance 
to the division. Again, Singapore will become our South East Asian 
hub for the distribution of Truth’s products.
Acquisition of Vedasil Brasil
On 26 February 2014, Schlegel International completed the 
acquisition of Vedasil Brasil (“Vedasil”), the market leader in the 
manufacture and supply of pile weatherseals in Brazil.
Established in 1978, Vedasil has grown to be one of South America’s 
leading providers of pile weatherseals. In addition, Vedasil 
manufactures and supplies polypropylene extruded seals under 
the Eco-PDM brand and other seal and screen components to 
the Brazilian door and window market. In 2013, Vedasil reported 
revenues of approximately BR19.3 million (£5.7 million) and Tyman’s 
existing Brazilian business reported revenues of approximately 
BR6.6 million (£2.0 million).
 
Vedasil is based near Valinhos, 90km from Sao Paulo where Schlegel 
Brazil is located. We intend to integrate the two businesses at the 
Valinhos site, under the Schlegel brand, with a management team 
drawn from both businesses.
We expect that the combination of the two businesses will bring 
Schlegel International significantly increased opportunities in Brazil 
and across South America, as well as the advantages of local 
manufacturing.  
Outlook
2014 should see an improved performance from the division as 
the  investments we have made to date start to deliver. Material 
profit improvement however will depend on significantly increased 
volumes, which in turn will depend on a sustained recovery in 
European markets, which are not expected to come through until 
at least 2015.
Across Europe as a whole we expect to see broadly flat markets in 
2014 with some pockets of growth. We expect to see continued 
improvement in Australian markets, where we will benefit from 
selling Truth products direct for the first time, and further growth in 
Singapore and in Brazil where we will benefit from our increased 
share following the acquisition of Vedasil. Tyman plc

James Brotherton
Chief Financial Officer
Financial review 
Group revenues increased by 30.3 per cent, in large 
part due to the consolidation of Truth from the 
half year and the strong top line performance from 
Amesbury. 
Revenue and operating profit
Group revenues increased by 30.3 per cent to £298.1 million (2012: 
£228.8 million), in large part due to the consolidation of Truth from 
the half year and the strong top line performance from Amesbury. 
On a constant currency, like for like basis, Group revenues increased 
by approximately 6.3 per cent year on year. 
Gross margins improved by 60 basis points to 33.3 per cent (2012: 
32.7 per cent), reflecting a full year contribution from Fab & Fix and 
a six month contribution from Truth, offset by lower gross margins 
seen in Schlegel International as a consequence of lower European 
trading levels.
Underlying administrative expenses increased by 34.6 per cent 
to £66.9 million (2012: £49.8 million), principally reflecting the 
overhead acquired as part of the Truth acquisition made and the 
levels of investment made in the business. 
Underlying operating profit increased by 40.9 per cent to £32.3 
million (2012 restated: £23.0 million), and increased marginally on a 
constant currency like for like basis; again as a result of the greatly 
reduced underlying operating profit contribution from Schlegel 
International. 
Finance costs
Despite the Group’s increased levels of gross indebtedness, 
interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts decreased slightly 
to £3.5 million (2012: £3.6 million). This reduction reflects the 
Group’s improved margin grid on both of its facilities and strong 
cash generation. 
The reported net finance costs of £3.5 million (2012: £4.6 million) 
benefitted from an exceptional foreign currency gain of £1.2 million 
which arose on the conversion of the equity proceeds into dollars to 
finance the acquisition of Truth. 
In 2013 the component of the net finance charge that relates to 
the unwinding of discounts on provisions was negligible (2012: 
£0.3 million).
Interest rates 
The Group has entered into interest rate contracts to swap around 
41.0 per cent of the Group’s outstanding debt from floating rates 
to a weighted average fixed rate of 1.1 per cent until maturity. 
As at 31 December 2013, the Group’s portfolio of swap contracts at 
fair value amounted to a liability of £0.8 million (2012: £0.6 million). 
Any changes in fair value until maturity, classified as an effective 
hedge, will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income, 
with only the ineffective portion taken through the income 
statement.
Taxation 
The Group incurred an underlying tax credit on profit before 
taxation of £0.2 million (2012: 3.7 million). Taxation before deferred 
tax rate changes, amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangibles and exceptional items amounted to £7.6 million, which 
represents an effective underlying rate of 26.7 per cent (2012 
restated: 30.1 per cent) and the Group paid £6.2 million (2012: 
£4.9 million) of corporate taxes in the year.
Several factors impact the Group’s taxation charge or credit, 
including:
 > The Group’s operations are international in nature. In 2013, 
67.2 per cent of the Group’s trading profits before central cost 
allocations were generated in the USA, 32.3 per cent generated 
in the UK and 0.5 per cent in Schlegel International’s overseas 
territories (depressed in 2013 by the trading losses made in 
Europe). Each division is therefore exposed to different country, 
state and local taxation rates and allowances. 
 > The Group has a proactive capital investment programme in 
each of its divisions. These investments are amortised for tax 
purposes in accordance with the laws relating to capital 
allowances in each country, which may not match with the 
Group’s depreciation policy.
 > Group companies sometimes generate losses, in 2013 most 
notably in certain European jurisdictions. Where these losses can 
be relieved or carried forward to be relieved in future periods, the 
Group does so in accordance with the relevant laws, however this 
treatment is broadly dependent on sufficient eligible taxable 
profits being generated in the relevant jurisdiction. 
 > Certain losses, most notably those related to the amortisation 
and impairment of intangible assets and the write off of 
goodwill arising on acquisition cannot be relieved against 
taxable profits. As the Group has developed through acquisition, 
these charges have a material impact on the Group’s statutory 
tax charge as a proportion of pre-tax profits.
 > Group share options and LTIPs will generate varying levels of tax 
relief to the Group dependent on the vesting outcomes of 
awards and the share price as at the date of vesting. Given the 
share price appreciation over the life of the 2010 and 2011  Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
23
Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
awards, LTIP tax relief had a material impact on the Group’s 
overall, tax charge in 2013.
 > The Group does not make material use of special incentive 
arrangements that might impact the tax charge such as research 
and development tax credits or patent box structures. 
The Group conducts its tax affairs in accordance with the law and 
arranges its tax affairs in line with its commercial activities 
worldwide. As such, it follows the terms of double taxation treaties 
and relevant OECD guidelines in dealing with issues such as transfer 
pricing, repatriation of profits and the establishment of a taxable 
presence in countries where it trades. The Group seeks to engage 
proactively with tax authorities in each of its key jurisdictions in 
order to ensure that the Group’s tax affairs are clearly 
communicated. As far as practical, the Group aims to keep its legal 
and commercial structures straightforward in order to reduce risk 
and minimise compliance costs. 
The Group’s key transfer pricing arrangements comprise commercial 
agreements relating to trade between Group entities, intra-group 
financing and the recharging of shared-service administrative costs. 
Where Group entities do trade with each other, transfer pricing 
arrangements are appropriate for the territories involved and are 
enacted on a consistent basis.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share increased by 19.3 per cent to 13.71 
pence (2012 restated: 10.31 pence). The increase reflects the 
improvement in underlying operating profit from Amesbury and 
Grouphomesafe, the incremental impact of the Truth acquisition, 
together with early delivery of synergies, the reduction in finance 
charges, and the slightly lower effective tax rate for the year, offset 
by the increase in the weighted average number of shares in issue. 
Underlying earnings per share for the year were also impacted by 
the six week delay between the raising of the equity finance and 
the date of completion of the Truth acquisition.
Ringfenced underlying earnings per share, excluding the results of 
the Truth acquisition and associated financing, were 13.02 pence 
per share; implying that the Truth transaction was earnings 
enhancing in the first six months of ownership – again well ahead 
of schedule.
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 0.63 pence 
(2012 restated loss per share: 17.07 pence).
Dividends
A final dividend of 4.50 pence per share (2012: 3.50 pence), 
equivalent to £7.5 million, will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting. In 2013, the Group declared and paid an interim dividend 
of 1.50 pence per share (2012: 1.00 pence per share).
The total dividend declared for the 2013 financial year is therefore 
6.00 pence per share (2012: 4.50 pence per share), an increase of 
33.3 per cent which equates to dividend cover of 2.29x. 
In accordance with IFRS, only dividends paid during the year have 
been charged in the 2013 financial statements.

Exceptional items of £10.9 million were incurred during the year 
(2012: £2.6 million). These charges are regarded by the Group as 
exceptional as they are significant and non-recurring in nature. The 
exceptional items principally concern the acquisition of Truth, the 
associated transaction costs – including anti-trust fees – and the 
costs associated with the integration. 
Of the £1.4 million Truth integration costs, £0.9 million comprise 
non-cash write downs of discontinued products and product lines. 
The write-off of Truth inventory fair value adjustment relates to the 
IFRS requirement that finished goods held in inventory must be 
revalued to their market value on acquisition. As the inventory 
acquired at the date of acquisition has been substantially sold in 
the subsequent six months, this uplift in the book value has been 
written off as exceptional as the cost is considered to be of a 
one-off nature and is of a magnitude that would distort the 
underlying trading result of Truth in the period.
Redundancy, restructuring, inventory obsolescence alignment 
and warranty costs primarily relate to the restructuring of the 
European footprint and the changes made to the North American 
management team. They also include a charge of £0.8 million 
relating to changes made to the Group’s provision estimate for 
slow-moving inventory held for greater than one year and followed 
a review of the Group’s overall inventory provisioning methodology 
undertaken on acquisition. The Group believes that aligning 
Tyman’s inventory obsolescence calculation with that of Truth is 
appropriate given the enlarged Group’s experience of slow-moving 
and obsolete inventory. 
Materials and input costs
The raw material pricing backdrop was more benign in 2013 than 
we had expected coming into the year. We track the pricing of all 
raw materials closely within the divisions in order to ensure we are 
procuring at the best price for the quantities we consume. Within 
each major category of purchase we also monitor weekly at a Group 
level the direction of pricing of certain specific purchases – UK 
galvanised steel, European polypropylene and USA zinc. Each of 
these key raw materials will also form a significant part of the raw 
materials that go into the manufacture of those products we source 
from third parties. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
24
Steel (pro forma Group 2013 purchases: c. £31.0 million) is our 
largest raw material purchase across a number of different types 
and grades. Within this category, pricing of UK galvanised steel 
increased by c. 4.0 per cent in the year. Oil derivatives (2013 
purchases: c. £26.0 million), are key to the manufacture of our seal, 
extrusion and injection moulded products. Within this category, 
European polypropylene pricing increased by approximately 1.0 per 
cent. Zinc (pro forma 2013 purchases: c. £8.0 million) has increased 
significantly as a raw material and component for the Group since 
the acquisition of Truth. In addition, we purchase around £12.0 
million of zinc based hardware from third party suppliers. Within this 
category, USA zinc pricing decreased by approximately 1.0 per cent 
in the year. 
In addition, we track closely the pricing of a representative basket of 
those products we source from the Far East into the UK – which will 
be influenced by local labour and overhead rates, raw material price 
changes and the exchange rate. Over the course of 2013, the pricing 
of the basket decreased slightly – with the strengthening of the 
Pound masking significant underlying local inflation.
We were broadly successful with our continued policy of full input 
cost recovery; other than in Europe where overall market conditions 
in 2013 were not conducive to price recovery beyond raw material 
cost increases.
Acquisitions
The Group acquired Truth on 3 July 2013 for a consideration of 
US$204.7 million. The total costs of acquiring Truth were £8.2 
million of which £2.4 million related to the raising of equity finance 
and have been offset against share premium and £1.5 million 
related to bank facility arrangement fees which will be amortised 
over the two year life of the facility. The remaining £4.3 million of 
costs relating to the Truth acquisition are included within 
exceptional items.
Annualised Returns on Acquisition Investment (“ROAI”) for the three 
businesses of size acquired since 2011 are as follows:

Truth
1
Jul 2013 $206,438 13.7% 13.7%
1 Truth ROAI for 2013 has been annualised.
The Group requires that all acquisitions target an annualised ROAI 
greater than 15 per cent in the first two years following acquisition.
 
While Overland has not achieved the target in this timeframe, it had 
a much improved second year under our ownership generating a 
ROAI close to the target level and stampings remain a core part of 
our North American product offering. Fab & Fix has performed very 
strongly for the Group since acquisition and has already significantly 
exceeded the required return threshold within 18 months of 
acquisition. Truth has made a strong contribution in its first six 
months and looks well positioned to exceed the required return 
within 12 months of the date of acquisition.
Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets
Amortisation of £16.6 million (2012: £10.8 million) represents the 
annual charge relating to the Group’s intangible assets, with the 
increase due to the first six months’ amortisation of the intangible 
assets created as a result of the Truth acquisition. In 2012, 
alongside various adjustments to intangibles and goodwill relating 
to discontinued operations, we also recorded an accelerated 
amortisation charge of £12.6 million and an impairment charge of 
£20.3 million.
In accordance with accounting standards, the Board has reviewed 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets across the 
Group in the light of current trading and prospects and progress 
towards achieving the divisions’ strategic plans. The Board 
concluded that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible 
assets remained appropriate and that no impairment had occurred. 
Segmental analysis
During 2013, the Board, in its capacity as the Group’s Chief 
Operating Decision Maker, reviewed the continuing appropriateness 
of the Group’s operating segment disclosures. The Group operates 
through three clearly defined divisions – Amesbury, Grouphomesafe 
and Schlegel International – each headed up by a Divisional CEO 
and each reporting to the Board, via the CEO and CFO, on a regular 
basis. Accordingly, the Board has concluded that the most 
appropriate segmental analysis for stakeholders is based on the 
three reporting divisions with an allocation of Group central 
overheads made to each division.
For 2013, the Board believes that it is appropriate that Truth should 
be disclosed as an additional segment given its size and the fact 
that throughout the year it was managed as a stand alone entity 
with its own CEO and management team. 
From January 2014, our North American businesses have been 
managed as a single entity with an integrated management team. 
Accordingly, Truth has been incorporated into the Amesbury 
operating segment from the start of 2014 and the 2014 results will 
therefore not include Truth as a distinct operating segment.
In the opinion of the Board there is no material difference between 
the Group’s operating segments and segments based on 
geographical splits. Accordingly, the Board does not consider 
geographically defined segments to be reportable.

Liquidity and covenant performance
At 31 December 2013 the Group had gross outstanding borrowings 
of £124.6 million (2012: £72.8 million), cash balances of £43.6 
million (2012: £35.9 million) and undrawn working capital facilities 
of £29.7 million (2012: £29.6 million).
Underlying net debt was £80.9 million (2012: £37.0 million). Under 
IFRS, which reduces gross debt by the unamortised portion of 
finance arrangement fees, net debt at the year end was £78.7 
million (2012: £35.2 million). 
At the year end, the Group had headroom on its banking covenants 
ranging from 39.5 per cent to 60.5 per cent. Leverage, calculated on 
the same basis as our banking covenant tests, was 1.81x (2012: 
1.22x), well within our target range of 1.50x to 2.00x and 
significantly ahead of the 2013 year end leverage target of 2.00x 
that we announced at the time of the Truth acquisition.
The Group maintains sufficient cash balances and undrawn 
borrowing facilities to finance all investment and capital 
expenditure included in its strategic plan, with an additional margin 
for contingencies. 
Shares in issue
The acquisition of Truth was part funded through a fully 
underwritten placing and open offer of 32.8 million shares, which 
increased the total number of shares in issue to 170.1 million. The 
basic weighted average number of shares in issue for 2013 was 
152.8 million (2012: 129.6 million) and the fully diluted weighted 
average number of shares in issue for 2013 was 155.1 million (2012: 
131.8 million). As at 31 December 2013 the Group had 0.6 million 
shares in treasury (2012: 7.4 million) and the Tyman Employee 
Benefit Trust held 2.2 million shares (2012: 0.9 million).
Cash flow
The Group saw very strong conversion of profit into cash during the 
year, with operating cash conversion of 111.9 per cent (2012 
restated: 83.6 per cent), reflecting the tight management of the 
working capital cycle by the divisions and despite the increased 
investments in capital expenditure made during 2013. 
Capital expenditure
In 2013 we continued our programme of targeted investment 
across each of the businesses. Overall net capital expenditure 
increased to £8.1 million (2012: £6.8 million) or 1.3x depreciation 
with notable projects including the reconfiguration of our UK 
distribution centre at EWS, the factory moves in Europe and North 
America and further investment in automation projects at Truth. 
Of this amount, intangible capital expenditure comprised £1.3 
million (2012: £1.4 million) principally as a result of our investment 
in Amesbury’s ERP system.
Working capital
We retained our strong focus on management of working capital 
within each of the divisions, with the aim of achieving an 
appropriate balance between commercial priorities and financial 
efficiency. Each division is allocated specific cash targets which are 
monitored throughout the year and flexed according to demand 
levels and the divisions are encouraged to seek out opportunities to 
secure permanent reductions in working capital.
Despite increased levels of trading and the impact of the Truth 
acquisition, the overall movement of working capital in 2013 was 
a net cash inflow of £12.4 million (2012: £2.3 million) of which 
US$13.9 million related to Truth, which was acquired at the peak 
of its working capital cycle. While we will need to work through a 
complete 12 month trading cycle at Truth before drawing absolute 
conclusions, we were pleased with the significant reductions in trade 
working capital we were able to secure at Truth when compared 
with the prior year end position.
Net trade working capital to revenue at the year end improved by 
90 basis points to 13.2 per cent (2012: 14.1 per cent). Inventories 
on the balance sheet increased to £40.7 million as a function of 
the acquisition (2012: 27.6 million) with inventory turns improving 
slightly to 4.8x (2012: 4.6x), assisted by targeted inventory reduction 
programmes that were put in place at a number of sites.
Our credit management processes remained robust with bad debts 
written off amounting to only 0.1 per cent of revenues (2012: 0.3 
per cent). Continued proactive management of customer credit, 
which starts at the point of sale, will remain a priority for the 
businesses in 2014 as mature markets recover and customers’ 
working capital needs increase.
Pensions and post-retirement medical benefits
The Group’s gross pension and post-retirement medical benefit 
obligations under IAS 19 at 31 December 2013 were £21.1 million 
(2012: £24.2 million) with the majority of the movement over the 
course of the year being due to actuarial gains following 
reassessments of discount rates. The principal schemes are located 
in North America where the pension scheme is closed to new 
entrants and post-retirement healthcare benefits are capped.
Cash contributions made to the schemes during the year were £0.9 
million (2012: £1.0 million).
The 2013 revision of IAS 19 increased the net pension charge in the 
income statement for 2013 by approximately £0.4 million, with a 
corresponding increase in other comprehensive income. The 2012 
financials have also been restated to take account of the IAS 19 
revision, which increased the comparative’s net pension charge in 
the income statement and reduced the charge to other 
comprehensive income by £0.2 million.
No pension or post-retirement medical benefit obligations were 
transferred to Tyman as a result of the Truth acquisition. Tyman plc

Property
On expiry of the lease on the Montreal facility in the first quarter 
of 2013, Unique Balance production was transferred to Statesville. 
In 2013, Schlegel International disposed of approximately one 
quarter of the surplus Gistel site and is exploring potential options 
for the remainder of the site.
Our small Falkirk distribution facility was closed during the year. The 
lease runs until 2016 and efforts are underway to sublet the vacant 
space. 
We have also greatly reduced the footprint of the Truth business 
since acquisition, as further detailed in the Truth integration section.
Since the year end we have disposed of surplus property in Sioux 
Falls, South Dakota for net cash consideration of US$1.7 million, 
realising a book profit on disposal of US$0.7 million.
Summary 2014 guidance
Underlying tax rates for the Group for 2014 are expected to be 
c. 27 – 28 per cent as a result of the continued reductions in the UK 
corporation tax rate. The final rate for the year will depend on the 
Group’s mix of taxable profits. Cash taxation rates are expected to 
broadly be in line with the Group’s underlying tax rate.
Capital expenditure for the year is expected to be in the range 
£10.0 – £12.0 million.
Interest payable on borrowings for the full year under the existing 
facilities is expected to be c. 3.0 – 3.5 per cent – dependent on 
leverage. Subject to market conditions, the Group intends to move a 
portion of its borrowings into longer dated funds during the course 
of 2014 in order to diversify its financing structure. This will increase 
the blended interest rate payable on the Group’s borrowings.
Working capital trough to peak for the year is expected to be 
c. £15.0 million.
2014 exceptional costs in respect of the integration of Truth into 
Amesbury are expected to be in the range of US$1.0 million to 
US$1.5 million. Cash costs incurred in connection with integration in 
2014 are expected to be in the range US$2.25 – US$2.75 million.
LTIP purchases by the employee benefit trust are expected to be 
£2.0 – £3.0 million.
Currency
As an international group, Tyman’s reported results will be impacted 
by exchange rate movements – most notably the US Dollar. Had the 
Group’s 2013 results been reported on the basis of exchange rates 
as at 28 February 2014, the impact would have been as follows:
£’million unless stated
Currency US $ Euro Aus $ Other Total
Average rate 2013 1.5646 1.1780 1.6224
Rate at 28 February 2014 1.6665 1.2179 1.8634
% movement (6.5) % (3.4) % (14.9) %
Revenue impact (7.8) (0.8) (1.1) (0.7) (10.4)
Underlying operating profit impact (0.9) (0.1) (0.1) (0.1) (1.2)
The 2014 translational impact on the 2013 underlying operating 
profit for Amesbury (including Truth for the full calendar year) for a 
1 US cent change in the exchange rate would be c. £200,000; a 
1 Euro cent change in the exchange rate for the European 
businesses of Schlegel International would be c. £3,000, and a 
1 Australian cent change in the exchange rate for the Australian 
business of Schlegel International would be c. £10,000. In addition 
there are transactional exposures for those divisions that purchase 
or sell products in currencies other than their functional currency.
The Group aims to mitigate the translational impact of exchange 
rate movements by denominating a proportion of total borrowings 
in those currencies where there is a material contribution to 
underlying operating profit. 
Financial reporting
This financial information has been prepared under IFRS and in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. There have been 
no changes to the Group’s accounting policies during the year 
ended 31 December 2013.
Going concern 
The Directors are confident, on the basis of current financial 
projections and facilities available, and after considering 
sensitivities, that the Company and the Group has sufficient 
resources for its operational needs and will enable the Group to 
remain in compliance with the financial covenants in its bank 
facilities for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly, the Directors 
continue to adopt the going concern basis.

During 2013 Schlegel celebrated its  
50th anniversary in manufacturing  
for the Australian market.  
In April 1963, Schlegel Australia commenced 
production in a small warehouse in Ultimo, Sydney. In 
the ensuing five decades, the company’s products have 
become an integral part of the Australian window and 
door industry. 
In addition to being Australia’s first, and now only, 
manufacturer of woven pile weatherseals, the company 
also designs and manufactures foam weatherseals, 
extruded seals, window and door hardware, and 
window and door operating systems. 
Having grown with the industry, Schlegel Australia has 
built an enviable reputation in the manufacture and 
supply of sealing solutions and high end hardware 
products to the local market.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk Description Mitigation
Market conditions
Demand in the building products sector is 
subject to the usual drivers of construction 
activity, including general economic 
conditions, interest rates, inflation, 
availability of credit, business/consumer 
confidence levels, unemployment, and 
population growth. This demand can be 
unpredictable and the Group has a low 
visibility of future orders from its customers. 
The recent recessionary economic 
environment experienced in Europe has 
resulted in reduced demand for some of 
our businesses. 
Maintaining significant headroom between the 
Group’s net debt and its available banking facilities, 
with the £30m revolving credit facility committed 
until March 2016, helps the Group to withstand 
future downturns in its markets. The geographic 
spread of our business and our ability to flex our 
cost base helps to mitigate some of this risk. For 
example, our European operations account for 9 per 
cent of total Group sales. Management prepares 
regular forecasts that focus on remedial action plans 
required to deliver the desired performance during 
the balance of the year. Continuing to measure our 
performance enables us to offer industry leading 
customer service which improves customer retention 
and wins new customers. The continuing investment 
in ERP systems will enhance management visibility 
of operational performance and drive continuous 
improvement in customer service and product 
quality. 
Risk Description Mitigation
Competitors
The Group may face significant 
competition, both actual and potential, 
including competition from global 
competitors with large capital resources. 
Competition in the industry is based on: 
range and quality of products offered, 
geographical reach, product development, 
reputation and client relationships. The 
building products market has become 
increasingly competitive, particularly where 
overcapacity has been exacerbated by the 
economic recession. Aggressive pricing 
from our competitors could cause a 
reduction in our revenues and margins.
Some of our markets are relatively concentrated 
with two or three key players, while others are highly 
fragmented and offer significant opportunities 
for consolidation and penetration. The Group 
differentiates itself by its wide range of products, 
a focus on setting industry leading standards for 
delivery on time and in full, its geographical spread, 
strategic focus and reputation. We aim to minimise 
the impact of aggressive pricing by competitors 
through a low cost manufacturing strategy 
supported by our programmes of continuous 
process improvements and building long-term 
relationships with our customers based on value, 
quality, service and added value technical support.
Risk Description Mitigation
Loss of major 
customers
The success of the Group will, to some 
extent, be dependent on the continuation 
of satisfactory commercial relationships 
with the major customers of the Group.
The Group aims to build long-term relationships 
with our customers based on value, quality and 
range of products, industry leading service and value 
added technical support. The Group continues to 
focus on a broad range of customers in a number of 
geographic markets. The top 10 customers account 
for less than 32 per cent of total Group sales. Tyman plc

Risk Description Mitigation
Raw material costs 
and supply chain 
failures
The raw materials used in the Group’s 
businesses include commodities that 
experience price volatility (such as oil 
derivatives, steel, aluminium and zinc) 
caused by changes in supply and demand, 
and commodity market fluctuations. The 
Group’s ability to meet customer demands 
depends in large part on obtaining timely 
and adequate supplies of components and 
raw materials on competitive terms. Failure 
by any of the Group’s suppliers could 
significantly limit the Group’s sales and 
increase its costs.
The Group continues to invest in and improve its 
sourcing and procurement capability. The Group 
manages the risks associated with raw material 
costs and supply chain failure through strong 
long-term relationships with suppliers, economies 
of purchasing, multiple suppliers and inventory 
management. In addition, the Group will mitigate 
this risk by increasing selling prices or applying 
surcharges to recover unavoidable input cost 
increases.
Risk Description Mitigation
Business integration
The Group will continue to make strategic 
acquisitions in the future, which will impact 
the performance and the risk profile of the 
Group. The subsequent integration of 
acquisitions involves further risks such as 
the diversion of management, disruption of 
operations and the retention of key 
personnel in the acquired business.
The Group mitigates this risk by extensive due 
diligence prior to the acquisition and the 
preparation of a detailed integration plan following 
acquisition, covering all key areas of activity. The 
Truth integration process is led by the Executive 
Directors and supported by dedicated project teams 
that include specialised management from the 
wider Group. Rolling out our ERP investment and our 
internal audit programme helps to establish best 
practise in governance and control procedures.
Risk Description Mitigation
Key executives  
and personnel
The Group’s future success is substantially 
dependent on the continued services and 
performance of its Executive Directors and 
senior management and its ability to 
continue to attract and retain highly skilled 
and qualified personnel.
The Remuneration Committee and the Tyman 
Management Committee mitigate the risk of losing 
key personnel through robust succession planning, 
strong recruitment processes, long-term 
management incentives and retention initiatives.
Risk Description Mitigation
Funding and  
financial risks
The Group operates on a global basis and is 
therefore exposed to transactional and 
translational foreign exchange risk against 
Sterling. 69 per cent of the Group’s 
underlying operating profit are derived from 
US operations. The Group is also exposed 
to interest rate risks, liquidity and credit 
risks.
The Group denominates some of its debt in foreign 
currency to match some of its exposure to the 
translational balance sheet risks associated with 
overseas subsidiaries. Ancillary bank facilities are 
available to manage some of the foreign exchange 
transactional risks and interest rate exposure 
through the use of derivative financial instruments. 
The Group maintains adequate cash balances and 
credit facilities with sufficient headroom and 
tenure to mitigate credit availability risk. Further 
information on these risks is given in note 25 to 
the Group’s financial statements. Tyman plc

Employees
Diversity
All Tyman employees have the right to work in an environment that 
supports diversity and fosters a culture of dignity and respect.
The Group is committed to supporting employment policies and 
practices that support equal opportunities, non-discrimination, and 
that comply with relevant local legislation and accepted 
employment practice codes.
Policies and practices of equal opportunities and non-discrimination 
will ensure that an individual’s ability, aptitude and talent are the 
sole determinants in recruitment, training, career development and 
progression opportunities rather than on the grounds of age, beliefs, 
disability, ethnic origin, gender, marital status, race, religion or 
sexual orientation.
In considering appointments to the Board and senior management 
positions, it is the Group’s policy to make an appointment on the 
basis of the candidate’s knowledge, skills and experience with due 
regard for the benefit of diversity. Set out below is an analysis of the 
number of employees by gender as at 31 December 2013.
Male Female Total % Male % Female
Tyman plc Board 5 1 6 83% 17%
Senior managers 100 18 118 85% 15%
Other employees 1,622 977 2,599 62% 38%
Total Tyman Group 1,727 996 2,723 63% 37%
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had a female representation of 
15 per cent in senior management positions and 17 per cent at the 
Board level. This proportion is higher across the total workforce, with 
37 per cent of the profile being female.
Senior manager is per the definition in Section 414C of the UK 
Companies Act 2006.
Training, development and retention
The Board recognises that the long-term growth and enduring 
success of the Group depends on its ability to attract and retain 
talented and skilled employees. Operational efficiencies across the 
Group are enhanced by building and developing the skills, 
competencies and motivation of all employees.
Each of the Group’s operating units are encouraged to implement 
comprehensive employment policies designed to attract, retain and 
motivate high calibre employees and to determine ways of applying 
their knowledge and skills in a manner that best contributes towards 
the success of the business.
The Group encourages and supports the continuing professional 
development and training of all its employees. Employees are 
provided with training to acquire and develop skills that will enable 
them to perform their duties and where appropriate allow for career 
progression. The Group also invests in a range of development 
activities including National Vocational Qualifications and 
apprenticeship schemes.
The Group operates the Tyman Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) in 
which senior employees are invited to participate in the long term 
future of the Group through share ownership and intends to explore 
other all-employee share plans. The conditional annual awards of 
shares under the LTIP are at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee.
Communication
In order for our employees to gain an understanding of the role 
they play within their local operations and that of the Group, 
employees are regularly kept informed on matters relating to their 
employment, recent business developments and other activities of 
the Group and its divisions. These communications are effected 
through management briefings, internal communications, as well as 
external announcements and press releases posted on the Group’s 
website.
Health and safety
The Group is committed to ensuring a safe, clean and healthy 
working environment for all employees, customers and other 
persons with whom the Group has contact. The Group actively 
promotes a strong health and safety culture as well as encouraging 
the collective pursuit of continuous improvement in health and 
safety standards across all operations.
Management and accountability
The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) holds the overall responsibility 
for the Group’s health and safety performance. Through the Tyman 
Management Committee (“TMC”), local management are tasked 
with the responsibility of creating a health and safety management 
system, and are held accountable for their:
 > health and safety performance;
 > adherence to the Group’s health and safety policies; and
 > compliance with local health and safety regulatory requirements.
Health and safety performance is reviewed at each weekly TMC 
meeting. A Health and Safety Report is prepared and presented by 
the CEO to the Board at each of its meetings.
Health and safety management system
It is essential that awareness is raised amongst all employees as to 
the importance of health and safety in creating a safe and healthy 
working environment. Local management’s health and safety 
management system:
 > identifies and assesses risks;
 > takes actions to reduce risks;
 > develops safe working practices; and
 > emphasises training and development.
As part of the health and safety management system, each 
location is audited to identify and assess the impact of any risk 
areas, institute corrective actions and put the necessary plans in 
place to address any deficiencies. The Group requires that all

accidents, dangerous incidents and near-miss situations are 
promptly and thoroughly investigated. The details of such incidents 
as well as the remedial and preventative measures taken are shared 
between sites as a means of raising awareness and reducing the risk 
of repetition. There is a requirement that any incidents involving lost 
time of greater than one working day are reported to the TMC and 
the Board.
Operations representing 49 per cent of the value of total Group 
sales in 2013 have achieved accreditation for OHSAS 18001 (Health 
and Safety) or for OSHA SHARP (the Safety & Health Achievement 
Recognition Program run by the Occupational Safety & Health 
Administration of the United States Department of Labor). Most of 
the other Group operations have programmes in place with the 
objective of achieving accreditation.
2013 performance
The KPIs used to evaluate the Group’s health and safety 
performance are the lost time injury rate and the number of lost 
time injuries.
Both KPIs show a considerable improvement in the Group’s health 
and safety performance and the Group remains committed to a 
programme of continuous improvement in health and safety, 
targeting further injury reductions in 2014.
Ethics, anti-corruption and compliance
The Group is committed to conducting its business with integrity 
and demands high standards of professional and ethical conduct 
throughout its operations. This will ensure compliance with the laws 
and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Group operates, protect 
the business from unforeseen liabilities and maintain a relationship 
of trust between the business and its stakeholders.
In all relationships and dealings, employees and other persons 
acting on behalf of the Group are expected to:
 > engage in honest and ethical conduct, including the avoidance 
and reporting of any conflicts of interest;
 > maintain effective procedures to prevent confidential 
information being misused or used for personal gain;
 > advance the legitimate interests of the Group, having regard to 
the Group’s values and standards;

 > encourage the use of those suppliers who operate with values 
and standards equivalent to those of the Group.
The Group requires that formal and confidential whistleblowing 
procedures are in place at its operating units and that these are 
advertised locally. Employees are encouraged to report any 
suspected incidence of non-compliance in accordance with local 
whistleblowing procedures.
Environmental
The Board recognises its responsibilities as a manufacturing concern 
to continue to reduce the environmental impact of its activities. In 
addition, the Group aims to develop and supply products to help 
customers meet their own environmental objectives and the 
demands of their customers and of government.
The most significant areas of environmental impact associated with 
the Group’s operations are energy consumption, waste to landfill, 
the use of outer packaging and transport.
 > Process development: the Group strives to design manufacturing 
processes that are as environmentally efficient as possible and 
monitors developments in alternative materials and production 
processes which may reduce the environmental impact of its 
products. Operations across the Group are encouraged, through 
internal development and investment, to:
 > make use of recycled materials where possible;
 > minimise resource consumption and waste generation 
through re-use and recycling;
 > reduce harmful emissions;
 > reduce their global carbon footprint from transportation.
 > Energy consumption: the Group continues to invest in energy 
efficiency measures such as lighting, improved heating and 
cooling systems.
 > Waste to landfill: the Group acts to minimise the amount of 
waste sent to landfill by selling for recycling any waste that 
cannot be used internally.
 > Outer packaging and transport: the Group minimises the use of 
outer packaging where appropriate and encourages the use of 
returnable outer packaging formats. The Group reduces the 
environmental impact of transport through vehicle efficiency 
measures such as improved load fill, reductions in empty running 
and route optimisation.
The Group is committed to the introduction of environmental 
management systems such as ISO 14001. Currently 15 of the 
Group’s manufacturing sites have achieved accreditation to the 
environmental management systems standard ISO 14001. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Greenhouse gas emissions
The greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions generated by the Group’s 
operations present considerable risks to both the Group and the 
environment. These risks include:
 > The agricultural impact of the Group’s dependence on extraction 
and use of raw materials.
 > The potential disruption of the Group’s operations and those of 
its customers and suppliers.
 > Changes in the nature or distribution of consumer demand as 
a result.
These risks can be mitigated through the Group’s conscious efforts 
in minimising its release of GHG, through its environmental 
initiatives.
The Group applies the World Resources Institute/World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol: 
A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, 
as the basis for reporting its emissions and includes the facilities 
over which it has operational control. This is the internationally 
recognised standard for corporate carbon reporting.
As 2013 is the first year the Group reported detailed GHG emissions, 
no comparative information has been provided. The Group has 
compiled and disclosed emissions data relating to those emission 
sources that are considered to be within the Group’s operational 
control and over which the Group has responsibility. Emission 
sources falling outside the Group’s operational control and other 
Scope 3 emissions have not been collated and reported. Emission 
data for businesses acquired during the year has only been included 
from the date of acquisition.
Data on the actual consumption of combustible fuels (Scope 1), and 
purchase of externally provided energy services (Scope 2) has been 
collected from all material locations operated or controlled by the 
Group. In addition, process emissions arising from other “Kyoto” 
gases have also been identified and included within Scope 1. The 
consumption data has been converted into CO
2
e by using emission 
factors specific to each identified Scope 1 source and by using 
specific geographic emission factors for each identified Scope 2 
source.
The Group has used revenue as its intensity ratio as this is the most 
appropriate and relevant factor associated with our activities and 
should provide an appropriate basis on which to compare trends 
over time.
The following tools were used in converting the Group’s 
consumption data into CO
2
e:
 > World Resources Institute (2008). GHG Protocol tool for 
stationary combustion. Version 4.0.
 > World Resources Institute (2012). GHG Protocol tool for emissions 
from purchased electricity. Version 4.4 August 2012.
 > World Resources Institute (2008). GHG Protocol tool for mobile 
combustion. Version 2.5 June 2013.

Community
The Group understands the importance of being a contributing 
member of society and its impact on the long-term development 
and sustainability of the business. The Group policy on donations 
and community involvement is to support local educational and 
charitable causes.
Each operating unit is tasked with the responsibility of managing its 
relationship with its local community. This responsibility involves 
the positive engagement and support of worthwhile projects and 
programmes as a company as well as the volunteering activities 
and efforts of its employees.
Operating units and their employees participate in a variety of local 
activities including projects with local schools and charity events. 
Some examples of Group community activities include:
In North America:
 > Monetary donations totalling US$59,000 to local charities and 
initiatives such as Local Chambers of Commerce, United Way, 
Volunteers for America, Make A Wish Foundation.
 > Local involvement and support of Habitat for Humanity, 
participation in Red Cross blood drives, donation of gifts to the 
Community Christmas Wish Tree, a community-sponsored gift 
drive for needy families.
In Europe:
 > In the UK, sponsorship of Macmillan Cancer Support through a 
series of coffee mornings across all sites, raising £1,000 as well 
as donations to various other cancer charities including Lennox 
Children’s Cancer Fund and the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation.
 > A donation by Tyman plc to Lupus UK, the only national charity 
supporting people with systemic or discoid Lupus, of £5,000 to 
mark the end of the Group’s association with the word Lupus.
 > In Spain, a donation of €1,000 to the San Juan de Dios children’s 
hospital in Barcelona for cancer research.
In 2013, the Group made donations of £44,000. No political 
donations were made.

Human rights
Human rights is not considered to be a material risk for the business 
owing to the fact that the Group’s activities are substantially carried 
out in developed countries that have strong legislation governing 
human rights. The Group is considered to be in compliance with 
appropriate legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
In working with and during regular reviews of our suppliers, the 
Group always seeks to encourage suppliers to operate with values 
and standards equivalent to those of the Group.
Whilst the Group does not have a specific human rights policy at 
present, careful consideration will be made as to whether a specific 
human rights policy is required in the future.
Product integrity
The Group seeks to be honest and fair in its relationships with 
customers and suppliers, to source and supply goods and services 
in an efficient manner, in accordance with specifications, without 
compromising quality and performance.
By providing customers with standards of goods and service that 
have been agreed and by paying suppliers and sub-contractors on 
agreed terms, the Group aims to:
 > maintain and grow market share through customer satisfaction;
 > achieve cost efficiencies through effective supply chain 
management;
 > source and supply goods and services that are reliable, safe to 
use for their intended purpose and meet industry standards.
Relationships with suppliers
Each division is responsible for negotiating the terms and conditions 
of trade with suppliers. In the UK and North America, a large 
proportion of product sourcing is conducted through the combined 
activity of the Group’s Chinese operating unit.
Through its Chinese sourcing operations, the Group conducts 
annual quality assessments of its Asian supplier chain. The quality 
assessments are conducted by suitably qualified employees and 
involves the scoring of strategic suppliers’ procedures and 
efficiencies in respect of procurement, manufacturing and quality 
control.
Quality management standards
It is Group policy to maintain accreditation to the quality 
management standard ISO 9001 and encourage operating units 
to gain accreditation to any specific standards required by the 
markets served.
ISO 9001 certification will ensure that operations maintain and 
adopt efficient quality management systems that save time 
and cost, improve efficiency, and ultimately improve customer 
relationships.
Currently, operating units comprising 92 per cent of the Group’s 
turnover have ISO 9001 accreditation.
Two of Amesbury’s Sioux Falls companies 
were recently recognised as a SHARP 
work site. 
SHARP, which stands for Safety and Health 
Achievement Recognition Program, is an OSHA 
Cooperative program that recognises small business 
employers who operate an exemplary injury and illness 
prevention program. 
Amesbury partnered with OSHA consultants out of 
South Dakota State University (“SDSU”) to achieve this 
goal. As a partner with Amesbury, SDSU does 
inspections of the floor and record keeping. Upon 
receiving SHARP recognition, OSHA exempts the work 
site from OSHA programmed inspections during the 
period of the SHARP inspection. 
As at December 2013, there were only three certified 
companies in South Dakota, of which two were 
Amesbury’s Sioux Falls facilities.

Principal activities 
The principal activities of the Group are unchanged from last year.

A description of the Group’s strategy and business model is given on

performance, including financial performance and the key financial 
performance indicators during the year ended 31 December 2013,

report. 
Results and dividends 
The total Group profit for the year after taxation amounted to 
£956,000 (2012: £15,241,000 restated). 
The 2012 final dividend of 3.50 pence per ordinary share, which 
amounted to £4,511,000, and the 2013 interim dividend of 
1.50 pence per ordinary share, which amounted to £2,528,000, were 
paid in the financial year ended 31 December 2013. The Board is 
recommending a final dividend of 4.50 pence per ordinary share 
(2012: 3.50 pence) to be paid on 21 May 2014, subject to approval  
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the 
Company on 16 May 2014, to shareholders on the register on 22 
April 2014. The ex-dividend date will be 16 April 2014. This brings the 
total dividends for 2013 to 6.00 pence per ordinary share 
(2012: 4.50 pence).
Directors
The names and biographical details of all the current Directors are 
set out on pages 34 and 35. There were no changes to the Board up 
to the date of this report and all the Directors served throughout the 
period.
Except for their shareholdings, the Non-executive Directors are 
entirely independent. There were no contracts subsisting during or 
at the end of the year in which a Director was or is materially 
interested. The Company maintains a policy of insurance against 
Directors’ and Officers’ liabilities. 
A description of the Board’s method of operation, its work during 
the year and that of its committees, is given in the report on 
Corporate governance on pages 40 to 44. Details of the Directors’ 
remuneration, notice periods under their service contracts or terms 
of appointment and their interests in the share capital of the 
Company are shown in the Remuneration report on pages 48 to 65. 
The service contracts for Executive Directors and terms of 
appointment for Non-executive Directors are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office and at the AGM.
Re-election of Directors 
The Company’s Articles of Association (“Articles”) require that any 
Director who has been appointed by the Board since the last AGM 
must retire from office but is eligible to submit themself for election 
by the shareholders. The Articles require that all Directors are 
subject to re-election at intervals of no more than three years. 
However, in accordance with best practice under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, each Director will stand for re-election at each 
Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, Mr Pike, Mr Eperjesi, Mr 
Brotherton, Mr Tench, Dr Westerwelle and Mr Towers will offer 
themselves for re-election at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. 
Share capital
On 23 May 2013, the Group completed the fully underwritten firm 
placing and open offer of ordinary shares as part of the funding for 
the acquisition of Truth Hardware (“Truth”). Gross proceeds of £73.4 
million were raised through the sale of 6,864,000 treasury shares 
and the issue of 32,816,904 new ordinary shares at the issue price 
of 185 pence per share. Share issue costs of £2.4 million were 
incurred and netted against share premium. 
On 8 July 2013, the Company’s shares were admitted to the 
premium segment of the Official List and to trading on the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange. Trading in the Company’s 
ordinary shares on AiM was cancelled simultaneously.
The Company had 170,104,385 ordinary shares of 5 pence each in 
issue at 31 December 2013. Full details of the Company’s issued 
share capital, including the rights, obligations and restrictions 
attaching to the shares, are set out in note 22 to the financial 
statements.
Financing
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained 
profits, equity and borrowings. The Group does not trade in financial 
instruments.
On 1 July 2013, the Group drew down US$100 million under a new 
multicurrency loan facility for the purposes of funding the Truth 
acquisition. The facility extends to and is repayable in full on 30 
June 2015 and is unsecured. Full details of the Group’s borrowing 
facilities are set out in note 17 to the financial statements.
The main risks arising from the Group’s borrowings are market risk, 
interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. 
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these 
risks and the policies, which have been applied throughout the year, 
are set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
Acquisition
On 3 July 2013, the Group completed the acquisition of Truth for a 
net cash consideration of US$204.7 million from Melrose Industries 
plc. Truth is a manufacturer of operating hardware for residential 
and light commercial windows and doors in North America and

Minnesota), where the business is headquartered, and the 
Canadian-based Atlas (located in Brampton, Ontario). Full details of 
the Truth acquisition are set out in note 24 to the financial 
statements.
The acquisition was funded from a combination of the net proceeds 
of the firm placing and placing and open offer of ordinary shares, 
new borrowings and the Group’s existing cash reserves.
Directors’ report Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Purchase of the Company’s own shares 
A resolution concerning the purchase of the Company’s own shares 
was approved at the AGM on 24 June 2013. The Directors believe 
that the Company should continue to have an authority to purchase 
shares of the Company. They will therefore propose a special 
resolution, in accordance with best practice, at the forthcoming 
AGM to obtain authority to make market purchases up to the date 
of the AGM in 2015. The authority will be limited to 14.99 per cent 
of voting shares in issue (that is, excluding shares held in Treasury). 
Allotment of shares 
The Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”) provides that the Directors 
may not allot ordinary shares unless authorised to do so by the 
Company in general meeting or by its Articles. At the forthcoming 
AGM the Directors will seek renewal, for a further period expiring at 
the earlier of the close of the next Annual General Meeting or 16 
August 2015, of the authority previously granted to the Directors at 
last year’s Annual General Meeting held on 24 June 2013. 
The Act gives holders of ordinary shares, with limited but important 
exceptions, certain rights of pre-emption on the issue for cash of 
new equity securities. The Directors believe that it is in the best 
interests of the Company that, as in previous years, the Board 
should have limited authority to allot some shares for cash without 
first having to offer such shares to existing shareholders. The 
Directors’ current authority expires at the close of the forthcoming 
AGM and, accordingly, will seek to renew this authority on similar 
terms for a further period, expiring at the earlier of the close of the 
next Annual General Meeting or 16 August 2015.
Substantial shareholders 
In addition to the holdings of the Directors described in the 
Directors’ remuneration report, at the latest practicable date before 
publication of this report the Company had been notified of, or had 
identified, the following direct or indirect interests comprising 3% or 
more of its voting share capital (the issued share capital less shares 
held by the Company in Treasury):

practice. The Board is committed to improving the impact on the 
environment from any of its operations and to incorporating the 
principles of sustainable development. A full description of the

Employees 
The Group’s excellent performance would not be possible without 
employees of the highest calibre with the motivation to perform to 
their full potential. The Group operates on a decentralised structure, 
reflecting the organisation of the Group. This underscores our belief 
that localised teams, operating under common principles, are best 
equipped to deal with the varying cultures, operating structures and 
geographic locations that exist in the Group. 
Each operating entity in the Group is encouraged to implement 
comprehensive employment policies designed to attract, retain and 
motivate the highest quality of staff and to determine ways in 
which their knowledge and skills can best contribute towards the 
success of the business. 
We are committed to ensuring that all our employees are treated 
equally, regardless of gender, age, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, 
race, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or religion. We are 
committed to regular communication and consultation with our 
employees and we encourage employee involvement in our 
performance. Each company in the Group endeavours to provide 
equality of opportunity in recruiting, training, promoting and 
developing the careers of disabled people.

The Group’s current activities, and the factors likely to affect its 
future development and performance are discussed in the Business 
review on pages 10 to 26 and the principal risks are set out on pages

liquidity risk.
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budget and cash flow 
forecasts. On the basis of this review, and in the light of the current

believes it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts, as stated in the 
Directors’ responsibilities statement on page 43.

audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

their willingness to continue in office, and a resolution that they be 
re-appointed will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

In accordance with the Financial Conduct Authority UK Listing Rules a statement describing how the Company has applied the Main 
Principles contained in the September 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) 
(available at www.frc.org.uk) and the statements required by sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules are set out in 
this report together with the Directors’ report, Business review, Corporate social responsibility report and the Remuneration report.
Statement of compliance
The Company has applied the main principles of the Code and complied with its detailed provisions throughout the period under review. 
We detail below how, in practice, the Company has applied these principles and complied with the detailed provisions.
The Board 
How the Board operates 
The Board meets regularly and is responsible for the overall leadership, strategy, development and control of the Group in order to achieve 
its objectives for continued earnings growth and to enhance shareholder value. The Board sets the Group’s strategic aims, ensures that the 
necessary financial and human resources are in place for the Group to meet its objectives, reviews management performance and ensures 
that high ethical standards of behaviour are followed. The Board also ensures that there is an effective system of controls to safeguard the 
Company’s assets and to enable risks to be properly assessed and managed. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for it and this includes the following:
 > Responsibility for the overall management of the Group, including monitoring the Group’s operating and financial performance.
 > Approval of the Group’s long-term objectives, commercial strategy and annual budgets.
 > Making changes to the Group’s capital, legal and corporate structure.
 > Approval of the half-yearly report, interim management statements, the preliminary results announcement of the final results and the 
Annual Report and Accounts.
 > Approval of the dividend policy and declaration of any interim and final dividends.
 > Approval of accounting and treasury policies, the Group’s internal control systems and risk management strategy.
 > Approval of significant acquisitions and disposals and material capital investments.
 > Approval of significant borrowing facilities and other material contracts and transactions.
 > Approval of resolutions to be put forward for shareholder approval at a general meeting and all communications with shareholders and 
the market.
 > Managing membership and approving adequate succession planning for the Board.
 > Responsibility for the Group corporate governance, determining the remuneration policy of the Group and determining Directors’ 
remuneration.
 > Approval of the Group’s health and safety and sustainability and environmental policies.
Matters not specifically reserved for the Board and the day-to-day management of the Group are delegated to the Executive Directors. 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely information. The Company Secretary distributes 
briefing papers to all Directors in advance of Board meetings. All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. 
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole. In addition, procedures are in place to 
enable the Directors to obtain independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense. 
Board composition 
The Board comprises two Executive and four Non-executive Directors and the names and biographical details of all the current Directors 
are set out on pages 34 and 35. All the current Directors served throughout the year ended 31 December 2013 and there were no changes 
to the Board.
Both Mr Eperjesi and Mr Brotherton are engaged exclusively on the Company’s business and have no outside interests that conflict with 
their responsibilities to the Company. The Board considers all the Non-executive Directors to be independent. 
The Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board (including skills, knowledge, 
experience, independence and diversity) and making recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes. The Board actively 
encourages diversity and equal opportunities throughout its business and applies the same principles to Board appointments. Diversity in 
all areas be it gender, race, skills or background are a key part of strong and effective achievement. There is currently one female Director 
on the Board and the Nominations Committee will consider boardroom diversity in future succession planning and will establish a formal 
policy for this in the coming year.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer are clearly defined and approved by the Board. The Chairman is responsible for 
the leadership and effective running of the Board and its decision-making processes, for setting the highest standards of corporate 
governance, for setting its agenda and the style and tone of Board discussions. The Chairman’s role includes:
 > leading the Board in determining the strategy and the overall objectives of the Group, while ensuring that the Board determines the 
nature and extent of the significant risks associated with implementing this strategy;
 > creating the conditions to maximise overall Board and individual Director effectiveness;
 > ensuring effective communication with shareholders and safeguarding their interests;
 > ensuring that Directors keep their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Group up to date while ensuring they receive accurate, timely 
and clear information; and
 > regularly considering succession planning and the composition of the Board. 
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Group, provides leadership for the executive team and  
develops and implements the Group’s strategic objectives. He is assisted by the Tyman Management Committee. The Chief Executive does 
not have any external directorships.
The Chief Financial Officer
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the financial reporting and management of the Group. In addition to the finance, audit, tax 
and treasury functions, he is also jointly responsible with the Chief Executive Officer for the Group’s M&A strategy, and investor relations. 
The Chief Financial Officer does not have any external directorships.
The Senior Independent Director
Mr Towers was the Senior Independent Director throughout the year under review and up to the date of this report. The Senior 
Independent Director is available to enable shareholders to voice any concerns which may not be appropriate for discussion through the 
normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. The Senior Independent Director also leads the Chairman’s 
appraisal, serves as an intermediary for the other Directors with the Chairman as necessary and acts as a sounding board for the Chairman 
as required. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Non-executive Directors
Independent Non-executive Directors comprised 60 per cent of the 
Board, excluding the Chairman. The Board believes that the 
Non-executive Directors possess strong independent character and 
judgement and bring a wide range of business experience in some 
areas related to and in other areas complementary to the activities 
of the Group. The Board considered that all the Non-executive 
Directors met the criteria for independence set out in provision B.1.1 
of the Code and there were no other relationships or circumstances, 
including other common directorships among the Directors, which 
were likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the Directors’ 
judgement.
Directors’ insurance cover
The Company maintains, at its expense, a Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance policy to afford an indemnity in certain 
circumstances for the benefit of Group personnel including, as 
recommended by the Code, the Directors. This insurance policy 
does not provide cover where the Director or Officer has acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly.
Board performance 
Following the admission of the Company’s shares to the Official List 
and to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, 
the Board reviewed and revised its Board performance appraisal 
process. A review of the Board’s performance and that of the 
individual Directors commenced in January 2014, with the help of 
an external facilitator, Independent Audit Limited, a firm of 
specialist board governance consultants. Independent Audit 
Limited do not have any other connection with the Company.
The review is based on a combination of questionnaires and 
interviews. Independent Audit’s Thinking Board questionnaire 
platform was initially used to gauge the views of the Directors and 
certain key executives (and to provide a benchmark for next year’s 
review). Interviews were subsequently held to follow up this exercise. 
Independent Audit also observed a Board meeting and considered 
the quality of Board papers.
The review covered key areas of Board performance including:
 > the Board’s role;
 > composition, skills and dynamics;
 > the focus of the Board’s work;
 > meetings;
 > information and decision-making; and
 > internal and external communications.
The Board review was undertaken during February and March 2014 
and Independent Audit Limited will report back their findings at the 
May 2014 Board meeting. Any recommendations made will be 
considered by the Board and actions undertaken to improve the 
effectiveness of the Board will be periodically reviewed thereafter.
Drawing on the Board review and using individual Director 
questionnaires, the Chairman will undertake a review of the 
performance of each of the Directors. The Senior Independent 
Director will undertake a review of the performance of the 
Chairman after taking into account the views of all the Directors. 
The results of these individual reviews and any improvements or 
personal objectives will be discussed with the relevant Directors on a 
one-to-one basis.
The Board intends to engage an external facilitator again in three 
years’ time. Reviews in the intervening years will be conducted 
internally, with the focus being on progress against the Thinking 
Board assessment and the areas identified for improvement in this 
year’s review.
Relations with shareholders 
We maintain an active engagement with our key financial 
audiences including institutional shareholders and sell side analysts 
as well as potential shareholders. During the year the Executive 
Directors had regular presentations to, and meetings with, 
institutional investors and analysts to discuss the Company’s past 
performance and strategy. The Board is provided with brokers’ 
reports, surveys on shareholders’ views and regular feedback from 
shareholder meetings. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors 
have the opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders 
and expect to attend meetings at their request.
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with 
private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. 
Details of resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
can be found in the Directors’ report. The Company has set up a 
website www.tymanplc.com which shareholders, investors and other 
interested parties may access. The website permits users to 
download copies of published financial reports, press releases and 
Stock Exchange announcements. 
Board committees 
The Board has an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee 
and a Nominations Committee, each comprised of all three 
Non-executive Directors. The Chairman is also a member of the 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees. The existence of the 
committees ensures that time is allocated on a formal basis to 
consider relevant issues. Terms of reference for the Board and each 
of the Board committees are available for inspection on the Group 
website.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee considers and approves the 
remuneration and benefits of the Directors. The Committee also 
determines the remuneration of the members of the Tyman 
Management Committee and the Company Secretary and of the 
service providers contracted to perform executive functions for the 
Group as well as long-term share incentive and share option 
schemes for all employees. 
The membership and work of the Committee during the year ended 
31 December 2013 and details of the remuneration policy and 
Directors’ remuneration packages are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 50 to 65. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are to monitor the 
integrity of the financial statements and any formal 
announcements relating to the Company’s financial performance, 
to review any changes in accounting principles and consider the 
appropriateness of accounting policies adopted by the Company, 
review the Group’s internal and external audit activity and review 
and monitor the effectiveness of the risk management and internal 
control systems within the business. The membership and work of 
the Committee during the year ended 31 December 2013 is 
described in detail in the Audit Committee report on pages 45 to 47.

Internal control 
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal controls and for reviewing the effectiveness of 
those controls. The Board, including the Executive Directors, reviews 
the internal control framework on an ongoing basis. 
Procedures have been developed to safeguard assets against 
unauthorised use or disposition of assets and to maintain proper 
accounting records to provide reliable financial information both for 
internal use and for publication. In accordance with the revised 
version of the Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control, the procedures 
are regularly reviewed in the light of an ongoing process to identify, 
evaluate and manage the significant risks faced by the Company. 
The process has been in place for the full year under review and up 
to the date of the approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. The 
procedures are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
Internal financial controls
The Group operates an effective group reporting and consolidation 
system. During the year further enhancements and updates were 
made to the Group reporting and consolidation system which have 
further strengthened the financial reporting and control process in 
the Group. 
The Group has an established system for assessing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal financial controls. 
This includes strategic business planning and monthly monitoring 
and reporting of financial performance. A detailed annual budget, 
prepared by senior management, is reviewed and formally adopted 
by the Board. The budget and other targets are regularly updated 
and regular business review meetings are held monthly involving the 
Tyman Management Committee to assess performance. The results 
of these reviews are in turn reported to and discussed by the Board 
at each meeting.
Going concern
In order to satisfy themselves that the Group has adequate 
resources for the future, the Board reviewed the Group’s committed 
funding and liquidity positions, its ability to generate cash from 
trading activities and its ability to raise external funding in the 
future. The operational performance, as described in the Financial 
review on pages 22 to 26, the future plans for the Group and the 
risks facing the Group, described on pages 10 and 11, and 28 and 
29, were also reviewed. In addition, notes 17, 18 and 25 to the 
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s policies and 
processes for managing capital, liquidity and credit risks as well as 
details of its financial instruments and hedging strategies.
In performing their reviews, the Board acknowledged the current 
level of growth prospects in global markets and has considered 
various sensitivity analyses when assessing the forecast funding 
and headroom requirements of the Group.
Consequently, based on the reviews outlined above, the Board 
concluded that both the Group as a whole and Tyman plc have 
adequate resources to meet their operational needs for the 
foreseeable future, and that it remains appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee identifies and nominates candidates 
for the office of Director of the Company. It meets as and when 
required and is chaired by Mr Pike, except that Mr Pike would not 
chair the Committee or attend it if it were to consider the 
appointment of a successor Chairman. 
The Committee is responsible for the following:
 > review and make recommendations to the Board on the 
structure, size and composition of the Board;
 > succession planning for Directors and other senior managers;
 > evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the 
Board;
 > prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for a 
particular appointment;
 > identify and nominate for the approval of the Board, candidates 
to fill Board and senior management vacancies as and when 
they arise;
 > review the time required from Non-executive Directors and 
evaluate the membership and performance of the Board and its 
committees; and
 > recommend the re-appointment of Non-executive Directors and 
re-election of Directors. 
During the year, as part of a Board meeting, the Nominations 
Committee discussed and reviewed Board composition and 
succession planning and reviewed the plan to restructure the North 
American management organisation.
Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”) and the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable laws). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 > make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
 > state whether IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and 
parent Company financial statements respectively. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Corporate governance continued
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website (www.tymanplc.com). Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 34 and 35, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
 > the financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU with respect to the 
Group and UK GAAP with respect to the Company, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group and Company; and 
 > the Strategic report and Directors’ report contained in the 
Annual Report and Accounts includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces.

Financial statements
The Audit Committee is made up of the three Non-executive 
Directors and meets at least three times a year. The Executive 
Directors, the Chairman and representatives of the external and 
internal auditors also attend upon invitation, certain meetings of 
the Committee. The Chairman of the Committee meets separately 
with the external auditor, the internal auditor and the Group CFO 
and his team during the course of the year.
The Committee’s primary responsibilities are to monitor the 
integrity of the financial statements and any formal 
announcements relating to the Company’s financial performance, 
to review the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory 
requirements, to review any changes in accounting principles and 
consider the appropriateness of accounting policies adopted by the 
Company, review the performance and independence of the 
Group’s internal and external audit activity and review and monitor 
the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control 
systems within the business. The Board is satisfied that Mr Towers, 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, has both current and relevant 
financial experience.
The Committee receives and reviews regular reports from the 
external auditor, the internal auditor and the Group CFO. The 
Committee is authorised to seek independent advice should it wish 
to do so, however it did not require this in 2013.
The Audit Committee also reviews any non-audit services provided 
by the auditors. In accordance with best practices and FRC 
guidelines, the Company policy in relation to non-audit services is 
kept under regular review, it outlines which non-audit services are 
pre-approved, which services require prior approval of the Audit 
Committee and which services the auditor is excluded from. The 
prohibited non-audit services include bookkeeping and accounting, 
internal audit, design or implementation of financial information 
systems, payroll, actuarial, legal and recruitment services. Permitted 
non-audit services requiring pre-authorisation include due diligence, 
tax planning, advice on IT projects and advice on corporate and 
reporting structures. The Committee is satisfied that the provision 
of such services does not in any way prejudice the objectivity and 
independence of the auditors. Professional firms other than the 
auditors also provide tax compliance work and tax advice. Fees for 
permitted non-audit services can be pre-authorised by the CFO for 
fees up to £100,000 and by the CFO, after consultation with the 
Chair of the Committee, for fees up to £400,000. Where fees for 
permitted non-audit services exceed £400,000 or where the 
aggregate of such fees in a financial year exceeds 100 per cent of 
estimated Group audit fees for that financial year, the Committee 
will review and approve these non-audit services.
Non-audit fees and services are reported to the Committee 
regularly. During 2013 total non-audit fees paid to PwC were 329 
per cent of the annual Group audit fee, principally reflecting the 
work done by PwC in connection with the acquisition of Truth 
Hardware where the use of the external auditors was necessary and 
specifically approved by the Committee.
The Committee was chaired by Mr Towers and while the 
Committee’s terms of reference state that meetings shall be held 
not less than four times a year, the Committee met three times 
during 2013 and considered this appropriate to enable it to 
complete its work in 2013. The composition of the Committee 
remained unchanged during 2013. The work of the Committee 
during the year included consideration of the following matters:
(1) Monitoring the integrity of the financial statements 
including significant judgements
 > The appropriateness of Group accounting principles, practices 
and policies and changes to, and compliance with, accounting 
standards on an ongoing basis. 
 > Prior to recommending the publication to the Board of the 
prospectus issued related to the acquisition of Truth Hardware, 
the Committee reviewed the financial and legal due diligence 
related to the acquisition and approved the contents of the 
prospectus.
 > Prior to recommending their publication to the Board, the 
Committee reviewed the half-year results for the six months 
ended 30 June 2013 with the external auditor and compared the 
results with management accounts and budgets, focusing on key 
areas of judgement. 
 > The review, prior to advising the Board on whether the 
Committee believes the Annual Report and Accounts for the year 
ended 31 December 2013, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. In undertaking this review, the following 
critical accounting policies and judgements were discussed with 
management and the external auditor:
Acquisition accounting
On 3 July 2013, the Group completed the acquisition of Truth for a 
net cash consideration of US$204.7 million. IFRS 3 requires assets 
and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value and to separately 
identify intangible assets from goodwill, initially measuring each 
group of intangible assets at fair value. Groups of intangible assets 
include purchased brands and customer relationships. There is 
judgement involved in estimating fair value, particularly in relation 
to identifiable intangible assets, which requires the Directors to 
estimate the useful economic life of each asset and the future cash 
flows expected to arise from each asset and to apply a suitable 
discount rate. Given the size of the Truth transaction the Committee 
engaged BDO LLP to assist in performing the fair value exercise over 
the opening balance sheet. The auditor provided the Committee 
with their review of the fair value exercise and following discussion 
the Committee was satisfied that the assumptions used were 
appropriate and that the resultant fair values were reasonable. 
Details of how this acquisition has been accounted for are set out in 
note 24 to the Group financial statements.
Carrying value of goodwill and intangibles
As set out in notes 10 and 11 to the Group financial statements, as 
at 31 December 2013, the Group had goodwill of £244.8 million 
with intangible assets amounting in total to £109.6 million. In order 
to satisfy itself that these balances were appropriately stated, the 
Committee considered the impairment reviews carried out by 
management. These reviews involve the discounting of the 
forecasted cash flows of each cash generating unit, using 
appropriate discount rates relative to the Company’s cost of capital. 
These assumptions are then subjected to sensitivity analysis. The 
auditor provided the Committee with their review of the impairment 
review process and, following discussion, the Committee was 
satisfied that the assumptions used were appropriate and that there 
was significant headroom on all calculations thus obviating the 
need for any impairment.

Audit Committee report continued
Provisions
The Group has provisions of £9.7 million as at 31 December 2013 as 
outlined in note 19 to the Group financial statements which, by their 
nature, are uncertain and highly judgmental in nature. The 
Committee considered the nature of the provisions, the potential 
outcomes, any developments relating to specific claims, and the 
prior history of lease obligations, provisions and claims in order to 
assess whether the provisions recorded are appropriate and suitably 
conservative. The Committee discussed with management and with 
the auditor the key elements of judgement to assure themselves as 
to the adequacy and appropriateness of the provisions. Following 
this discussion, the Committee was satisfied that the judgements 
exercised were appropriate.
Carrying value of inventory
As set out in note 13 to the Group financial statements, as at 31 
December 2013, the Group had gross inventories of £47.0 million 
and provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventories of £6.3 
million. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value, with due allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-moving items. 
Group management exercises judgement in assessing net realisable 
value and provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory which 
is based on current assessments of future demand, market 
conditions and new product development initiatives. The auditor 
provided the Committee with their review of inventories and 
following discussion, the Committee was satisfied that the inventory 
valuation was consistent with our accounting policy and previous 
practice and that the resultant valuation was reasonable.
Carrying value of trade receivables
As set out in note 14 to the Group financial statements, as at 
31 December 2013, the Group had gross trade receivables of 
£32.0 million and provisions for bad debts of £2.1 million. Trade 
receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction 
costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method, less appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. Provision against trade 
receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group 
will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with 
the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-
down is determined as the difference between the carrying amount 
and present value of estimated future cash flows. Group 
management exercises judgement in assessing the amount of any 
write-downs required which is based on current assessments of the 
creditworthiness of current customers. The auditor provided the 
Committee with their review of trade receivables and following 
discussion, the Committee was satisfied that the book value of 
trade receivables was consistent with our accounting policy and 
previous practice and that the resultant valuation was reasonable.
Following discussions with the auditor, and the deliberations set out 
above, we were satisfied that the financial statements dealt 
appropriately with each of the areas of significant judgement. The 
auditor also reported to the Committee on any misstatements that 
they had found in the course of their work and confirmed that no 
material amounts remained unadjusted.
In accordance with the Code, we also reviewed the Annual Report 
and were able to confirm to the Board that, in our view, the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and 
understandable and provided the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
(2) Review the Group’s internal and external audit activity
PwC were appointed for the first time as the Group’s auditors in 
2012, following a competitive tender process. The 2013 year end 
audit is the second full audit that PwC have conducted. The 
Committee is satisfied with PwC’s performance, independence and 
effectiveness and their fees are regularly compared with peer 
companies by the Committee. Accordingly, the Committee has 
recommended to the Board that PwC should be reappointed as the 
Group’s auditors at the AGM. There are no contractual restrictions 
on the Group with regard to PwC’s appointment.
The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent on 
appropriate audit risk identification at the start of the audit cycle. 
The Committee reviews a detailed audit plan from PwC LLP, 
identifying their assessment of these key risks. For the 2013 
financial year the primary risks identified were in relation to 
acquisition accounting, the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangibles. The Committee reviews the work performed by the 
auditors to test management’s assumptions and estimates around 
these areas and assesses the effectiveness of the audit process in 
addressing these matters when reviewing the audit plan prepared 
by PwC. For the 2013 financial year, the Committee was satisfied 
that there had been appropriate focus and challenge on the 
primary areas of audit risk and assessed the quality of the audit 
process to be good. 
The Chairman of the Committee also meets with the external lead 
audit partner outside the formal committee process during the year 
to provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback 
from the auditor without management being present. Matters 
typically discussed include the auditor’s assessment of business risks 
and management activity thereon, the transparency and openness 
of interactions with management, confirmation that there has been 
no restriction in scope placed on them by management, 
independence of their audit and how they have exercised 
professional scepticism.
PwC, as auditor, report to the Committee on their compliance with 
the fundamental principles of objectivity, integrity and professional 
behaviour, including independence. PwC use a global independence 
system which provides real time identification of independence 
issues. They have confirmed to the Committee that they have not 
identified any threats to independence that would impact on their 
ability to perform their audit work. The Committee reviews the 
policy on auditor independence and non-audit services, and the 
consideration of the nature, scope and appropriateness of non-
audit services supplied by the external auditor. Tyman plc

Financial statements
During 2013 the Committee considered it appropriate to augment 
internal resources with external resources to establish an internal 
audit programme. A specialist team from BDO provided internal 
audit services to the Group to complete an internal audit 
programme, visiting 10 operating units in the Group. The 
Committee have reviewed reports from BDO detailing their audit 
findings together with divisional management responses and action 
plans. Progress completing these action plans will be reviewed 
regularly by the Committee. Future internal audit programmes will 
be reviewed and approved by the Committee and will be structured 
to ensure that every operating unit will have an internal audit visit at 
least once every three years, with the largest operating units being 
audited at least once every two years. 
(3) Review the effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control systems in the Group
The Board as a whole is responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control, however, the Committee assists the Board in 
meeting its obligations in this regard. The Committee’s review of 
risk is driven primarily by the Group’s assessment of its principal risks 
and uncertainties, as set out on pages 28 and 29. The Tyman Risk 
Committee assesses the Group’s significant business risks identified 
at both operating entity and Group levels and how these are 
managed. The Chief Executive Officer in turn reports back to the 
Audit Committee who discuss and review the work of the Tyman 
Risk Committee. The Tyman Risk Committee, whose members 
comprise the Tyman Management Committee, discuss and review 
the various risk registers compiled by each reporting segment within 
the Group.
In order to ensure that the Committee fulfils its role relating to the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal control system, 
the Committee receives reports from the internal auditors. A major 
element of the current internal audit programme is the assessment 
of the Group’s internal control system throughout the Group. The 
recommendations for improving internal controls are reviewed and 
the follow-on action plans to implement improvements are 
monitored on an ongoing basis by the Committee.
Committee effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed on an annual basis 
by both the Board and the Committee itself and the Committee is 
considered to continue to operate effectively and efficiently.

Remuneration report letter
Dear Shareholder
It is my pleasure to present the Directors’ remuneration report for 
the year ended 31 December 2013.
Background to the Group’s remuneration policy
Our remuneration policy seeks to achieve a balance between the 
interests of our employees and those of our shareholders. The 
Group operates a simple remuneration structure for Executive 
Directors comprising base salary and benefits, a bonus plan 
incorporating deferral of half of any bonus award for three years 
and a single long-term incentive plan, which provide a clear link 
between pay and our key strategic priorities. 
In addition, our Executive Directors are also required to hold Tyman 
shares to the value of at least one year’s salary and a significant 
proportion of their remuneration is paid to them in the form of 
Tyman shares though our Executive Share Plans.
Our senior management teams around the world have 
remuneration structures derived from those of the Executive 
Directors to ensure a clear line of sight between local performance 
and Group objectives.
Activities of the Remuneration Committee
The main activities of the Committee since the last report were as 
follows:
 > assessed performance of Executive Directors and determined 
annual bonuses for 2013;
 > established the Executive Directors’ bonus arrangements and set 
bonus targets for 2014;
 > consulted with shareholders and shareholder bodies on the 
structure and targets for 2013 LTIP awards and made the awards 
to Directors and key senior management; 
 > consulted with shareholders and shareholder bodies on 
amendments to historic LTIP awards following the acquisition of 
Truth and the associated placing and open offer;
 > reviewed and revised the Directors’ service contracts to reflect 
best practice for a Main List company;
 > reviewed remuneration benchmarking and set 2014 base 
salaries and benefit packages for Executive Directors;
 > codified the treatment of share awards for senior managers who 
leave the Group and who are viewed as good leavers; 
 > considered remuneration market trends and corporate 
governance developments; and
 > reviewed the revised remuneration reporting regulations and 
prepared the Directors’ remuneration report.
In addition, the Committee participated in the March 2013 FRC 
Reporting Lab on the reporting of pay and performance – the only 
AiM company to participate.
Remuneration for 2013
Details of the remuneration decisions for 2013 are set out in the 
Directors’ annual remuneration report. 
As highlighted in the Chairman’s letter, Tyman demonstrated solid 
financial performance in 2013, with good growth in the US and the 
UK, and our key strategic initiatives progressing well. Group PBTA 
performance during the year was robust with achievement of £17.9 
million for 2013. This was ahead of the target range, resulting in 
85.1 per cent of the bonus relating to PBTA becoming payable.
The Group’s cash collection in the period was very strong and was 
significantly ahead of the Group’s expectations at the time of the 
announcement of the Truth transaction. Accordingly 100 per cent 
of the bonus relating to cash flow became payable. Overall, this 
resulted in the Executive Directors receiving a bonus equal to 89.6 
per cent of 2013 salary for the year, of which 50 per cent will be 
deferred until March 2017 under the rules of the Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan. 
The announcement of the Group’s results for the year ended 
31 December 2013 was the trigger event for the vesting of the 
2010 and 2011 LTIP awards. Cumulative EPS over the period for 
both the 2010 and the 2011 awards was 34.15 pence against 
targets of 32.40 pence and 34.20 pence respectively. Therefore 
100 per cent of the 2010 awards and 99.44 per cent of the 2011 
awards will vest.
Key remuneration decisions for 2014
The Committee consulted major shareholders holding c.50 per cent 
of share capital on proposed increases to Executive Director base 
salaries and the CFO’s cash allowance in lieu of pension. Some 
common themes emerged from these discussions; there was 
widespread acknowledgement that the Company had made 
considerable progress under the leadership of the current Executive 
Directors; that the Company had grown significantly in size and 
complexity since their appointment in early 2010; and that as there 
had been no substantive adjustment to Executive Director pay to 
date, a substantial gap had developed between Tyman base pay 
and market median levels. 
Following consultation with major shareholders, the Committee has 
decided to phase-in salary increases to closer to median over two 
years, subject to an annual review of each executive’s performance 
and Company performance. In line with these discussions, the 
Committee set the CEO’s base salary at £334,000 per annum (c.25 
per cent increase) and the CFO’s base salary at £226,000 per 
annum (c. 11 per cent increase) from 1 January 2014. The 
Committee also increased the pension allowance for the CFO from 
c. 5 per cent of salary to 15 per cent of salary (the CEO’s cash 
allowance remains 20 per cent of salary). 
The second phase will be considered at the next salary review date, 
which is in January 2015, and will take into account both individual 
and Company performance. This will include an assessment of the 
successful integration of, and delivery of the anticipated benefits 
from, the Truth acquisition which completed in 2013.
To further strengthen alignment with shareholders, the Committee 
intends to extend the time horizon of future LTIP awards to 
Executive Directors through the introduction of a two-year holding 
period on vested LTIP shares (net of tax). Tyman plc

Remuneration policy report
Introduction
The Group’s policy is to provide remuneration that reflects the contribution of senior executives to the business, the performance of the 
Group, the size and complexity of the Group’s operations and the need to attract, retain, and incentivise executives of the highest quality. 
The Committee seeks to provide remuneration packages which are straightforward and easily comprehensible and which align the 
interests of the Directors with those of the shareholders. The general principles underpinning the Group’s remuneration policy are that the 
policy should support and incentivise the delivery of the Group’s strategy while providing an appropriate balance between fixed and 
variable rewards.
The key components of the remuneration policy and associated arrangements for Board members are shown below. This policy statement 
will be submitted for approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting scheduled to be held on 16 May 2014. If approved, the 
policy will take effect from the conclusion of the 2014 AGM and remain in effect until the 2017 Annual General Meeting, or earlier if 
amended by the shareholders.
Remuneration at a glance
Current salary CEO – £334,000 and CFO – £226,000
Pension allowance Maximum contribution of 20 per cent of base salary.
Benefits Typically life assurance cover, critical illness cover, private medical and dental cover, car allowance and 
professional tax and financial advice.
Annual bonus 100 per cent of base salary, with 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent in shares deferred for three years. Targets 
are usually 100 per cent financial but can have up to 20 per cent targeted on individual personal objectives.
LTIP Normally nil cost options up to 100 per cent of base salary, but exceptionally 150 per cent. Performance metrics 
based on cumulative underlying EPS measured over a three-year period, with a discretionary underpin. Typically, 
25 per cent vests for threshold performance (zero per cent below threshold) increasing pro rata to 100 per cent 
vesting for stretch performance. From 2014 new LTIP awards to be retained for two years after vesting, thereby 
making a five-year holding period for an LTIP award from date of grant to permitted disposal.
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
Base salary
To pay Executive Directors at a level commensurate 
with their contribution to the Company and 
appropriately based on skill, experience and 
performance achieved.
The level of salary paid is considered appropriate for 
motivation and retention of the calibre of executive 
required to ensure the successful formation and 
delivery of the Group’s strategy and management 
of its business in the international environment in 
which it operates.
Base salary is paid monthly in cash in the currency specified in the employment 
contract.
The Executive Directors’ salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee which 
takes into account: 
 > prevailing market and economic conditions;
 > scope of the role;
 > pay levels at companies of a similar size, internationality and complexity; and 
 > company and individual performance.
In normal circumstances, annual increases in salary will be limited to the general 
annual salary increase received by Group employees in the relevant Director’s 
country of residence.
The Committee may consider it appropriate and necessary to award larger 
increases, for example, in circumstances where the nature or complexity of the 
Group has increased materially or if an individual assumes significantly more 
responsibility. If there were a material change in business size or complexity (up or 
down), then this would be reflected in the market comparability. Tyman plc

Benefits
To provide a range of market competitive benefits to 
encourage retention and which enable an Executive 
Director to perform his or her duties.
Executive Directors are eligible for a range of benefits that may include:
 > life assurance cover;
 > critical illness cover;
 > private medical and dental cover for Executive Directors and their dependants;
 > car allowances;
 > professional tax and financial advice.
Additional benefits may also be provided in certain circumstances which may 
include relocation and associated expenses.
Other benefits may be offered if considered appropriate, reasonable and necessary 
by the Committee.
Pension
To provide a market-competitive benefit for 
retirement which rewards sustained contribution 
and encourages retention.
Eligible to participate in the relevant pension arrangements offered by the Group or 
to receive a cash salary supplement in lieu of pension entitlement.
The maximum opportunity, either by way of a contribution to a Group pension 
arrangement or payment of a cash salary supplement, is 20 per cent of base salary.
The Committee may amend the form of any Executive Director’s pension 
arrangements in response to changes in legislation or similar developments, 
provided that the amendment does not materially increase the cost to the 
Company of the pension provision.
Annual bonus
To reward achievement of annual financial goals 
consistent with the strategic direction of the 
business.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors is 100 per cent 
of salary.
Performance targets are set annually and relate to the achievement of financial 
and strategic objectives.
In normal circumstances, the Committee would expect to set annual bonus targets 
100 per cent dependent on the achievement of defined financial performance 
targets, however there may be circumstances where the Committee feels it is 
appropriate and necessary to have not more than 20 per cent of maximum bonus 
weighted towards the achievement of individual personal objectives.
Annual financial performance targets to date have been focused on profit and cash 
metrics, however the Committee may elect to use different financial performance 
measures in future years.
The Committee retains the discretion to revise any formulaic bonus award 
downwards or upwards in the event that an exceptional negative or positive event 
occurs during the bonus year in question, however in practice would not expect to 
revise any formulaic bonus upwards.
Any bonus payable to Executive Directors under the annual bonus scheme is paid 
50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent in shares deferred for three years under the 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP”) and is not pensionable. Tyman plc

Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
Long term incentive plans
To align interests of senior executives and those of 
shareholders in developing the long-term growth 
of the business and execution and delivery of the 
Group’s strategy. 
To facilitate share ownership by Executive Directors 
and other senior management to provide further 
alignment with shareholders.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate (subject to selection by the 
Committee) in long term incentive plans approved by shareholders.
Awards made under long term incentive plans are not pensionable.
The Tyman Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”)
The LTIP was approved by shareholders on 30 November 2010 and has a 
maximum life of 10 years.
Awards are determined by the Committee at its discretion, with a maximum annual 
performance share award under the current plan of 100 per cent of salary or 
150 per cent of salary in exceptional circumstances. Such circumstances typically 
include recruitment or the retention of critical talent on a targeted basis.
Awards are subject to the Company meeting defined financial targets over three 
financial years, starting with the financial year in which the grant takes place.
A percentage of the award, typically 25 per cent, vests for threshold performance 
(0 per cent below threshold) increasing pro rata to 100 per cent vesting for stretch 
performance.
LTIP vesting depends on the aggregate underlying EPS of the Group over the three 
year life of an award. More recent LTIP awards have incorporated a discretionary 
TSR underpin and the Committee considered and has extended the number of 
performance parameters it considers when assessing the underpin. These are set 
out in the annual report on remuneration.
The Committee reviews the LTIP performance measures in advance of each LTIP 
grant to ensure their ongoing appropriateness and consults with shareholders over 
both the measures and their associated targets.
The Committee retains the discretion to adjust the financial targets in the event of 
any material acquisitions, disposals or other corporate events in order to maintain 
an equivalent level of difficulty.
The LTIP provides for the grant of: (i) performance shares or nil-cost options; and/or 
(ii) fair-market value options, vesting on the satisfaction of stretching performance 
criteria over three years (subject to a maximum annual award of 200 per cent of 
salary). If awards are a mix of performance shares and market value options, then 
the aggregate fair value would be no higher than the fair value of an award of 
100 per cent of salary in performance shares. Awards under the LTIP to date have 
been made in the form of nil-cost options; however, the Committee retains the 
flexibility to consider other forms of award (such as fair-market value options) for 
future cycles as it is mindful that alternative forms of award remain prevalent in 
some of the geographies (eg the USA) in which the Company competes for senior 
executive management.
From 2014, awards made under the LTIP will normally require Executive Directors 
to retain any awards that vest, net of tax, (whether held as shares or options) 
for a minimum of two further years from the date of vesting. This will make the 
aggregate holding period for an LTIP award five years from date of grant to 
permitted disposal.

Minimum shareholding requirement
To require Executive Directors to retain a minimum 
shareholding in the Company to ensure alignment 
with shareholders’ interests as a whole.
Executive Directors are expected to retain a minimum shareholding equivalent to 
100 per cent of basic salary. 
Executive Directors are required to retain 50 per cent of shares vesting (after any 
disposals necessary to pay associated tax charges) under both the deferred share 
plan and the LTIP until the minimum shareholding is reached.
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios
The charts below set out an illustration of the remuneration policy for 2014 in line with the remuneration policy. The charts provide an 
illustration of the proportion of total remuneration made up of each component of the remuneration policy and the value of each 
component.
Three scenarios have been illustrated for each Executive Director:
Below threshold 
performance
 > Fixed remuneration
 > No annual bonus payout
 > No vesting of LTIP awards
At target 
performance
 > Fixed remuneration
 > 50 per cent annual bonus payout
 > 25 per cent of LTIP awards vest
Stretch performance > Fixed remuneration
 > 100 per cent annual bonus payout
 > 100 per cent of LTIP awards vest
The fixed pay element is based on the following elements:
 > Base salary is the base salary effective for the year ended 31 December 2014, as set out on page 50.
 > Benefits are the value of benefits paid in the year ended 31 December 2013, as set out on the table of Directors’ remuneration on 
page 57.
 > Cash contribution in lieu of pension and benefits effective for the year ended 31 December 2014, which is 20 per cent of base salary for 
the CEO and 15 per cent of base salary for the CFO.

Fees
Attract and retain high calibre Non-executive 
Directors.
Fees are reviewed annually, taking into account time commitment, responsibilities 
and fees paid by companies of a similar size and complexity. 
Fee increases, if applicable, for Non-executive Directors, will take effect from 1 July.
Additional fees may be paid to Chairmen of Board Committees and to the Senior 
Independent Director.
Aggregate annual fees to Directors are limited to £500,000 under the Articles of 
Association.
No eligibility to receive bonuses, retirement benefits or to participate in the Group’s 
long term incentive plans or employee share plans.
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not have service agreements but the terms of their appointment, including the time 
commitment expected, are recorded in letters of appointment.
Non-executive Directors are employed for terms of three years’ duration, terminable on a month’s notice by the Company or the Director. 
All Non-executive Directors are required to undertake that they will submit themselves for re-election at each Annual General Meeting 
occurring during their term of office and no Non-executive Director will serve more than three terms of three years without prior 
shareholder approval.
Non-executive Directors’ shareholding guidelines
Non-executive Directors do not have a minimum shareholding requirement, however are expected to acquire and retain a shareholding in 
the Group for the duration of their appointment.
Other policies
Recruitment of Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors who are recruited to the Board will be employed on a letter of appointment of three years’ duration, terminable on 
a month’s notice by the Company or the Director.
The remuneration for Non-executive Directors consists of annual fees for their services as members of the Board and, where relevant, for 
their work on selected committees. New Non-executive Directors recruited to the Board will be paid the same rates and be subject to the 
same provisions concerning annual re-election and shareholdings as the then current Non-executive Directors.

Recruitment of Executive Directors
The Committee’s general policy on recruitment remuneration is that new Executive Directors should be offered a contract on similar terms 
to the existing Executive Directors. 
In exceptional and unforeseen circumstances it may prove necessary for the Committee to exercise discretion and offer a variable pay 
opportunity (excluding buyouts) in the first year of employment to a new Executive Director that contains elements of variable 
remuneration which are in excess of the normal maxima stated in the policy table, however, the overall total variable pay opportunity on 
recruitment (excluding buyouts) would remain within the overall limit on variable pay of 250 per cent of base salary.
For a new CEO or CFO, their annual bonus framework and LTIP awards will normally be no more than those available to the current CEO or 
CFO, as applicable, at the date of recruitment. The Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and associated 
expenses of a new Executive Director, subject to circumstances.
In circumstances where individuals are promoted to the Board from within the Group, the terms and conditions of their existing share 
grants or awards will not normally be amended, however any new grants or awards would be subject to the same framework as the other 
Executive Directors.
In certain circumstances, and in order to secure the services of an outstanding candidate, it may be necessary to make an award to a new 
Executive Director to “buyout” unvested performance plan share or cash awards forfeited on leaving their previous employment. Any such 
reimbursement would be subject to independent confirmation of the existence, forfeiture on departure and probability of these historic 
awards vesting had the new Executive Director remained in post. In doing so, the Committee will seek to do no more than match the fair 
value of the awards forfeited, taking account of performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being 
met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining. 
Any such reimbursement would be made in cash or in shares in Tyman plc, and may be subject to performance conditions attached to 
Tyman. 
No incentives were paid in connection with the recruitment of Mr Eperjesi or for the promotion of Mr Brotherton to their respective roles, 
both of which occurred in 2010.
Exit payment policy for Executive Directors
The service agreements of the Executive Directors entitle them on termination of their contract by Tyman to payment equal to salary and 
the value of benefits, pension benefits (including life cover), health cover, dental cover and car allowance (but not annual bonus or grants 
under long term incentive plans) until the earlier of 12 months from notice of termination or the Director obtaining full-time employment, 
with an obligation on the part of the Director to mitigate. 
Payments will normally be made monthly, although the Committee retains discretion to agree settlement terms, which may include a 
bonus in respect of the period worked by the Executive Director up until the date of termination.
Executive Directors who are categorised as “Good Leavers” by the Committee will generally be eligible to receive historic awards under the 
LTIP and DSBP (the “Executive Share Plans”) as they vest in future years. Awards that vest under the LTIP post-employment may be 
pro-rated to reflect the fact that the Executive Director was not employed for the entire period under measurement. For LTIP awards made 
after the 2014 AGM, the Committee retains discretion to waive the extended holding period requirement for Good Leavers depending on 
circumstances.
In the event that an Executive Director is dismissed for reasons constituting gross misconduct, no unvested awards under Executive Share 
Plans may vest and the Committee retains no discretion in this regard. 
Policy on external appointments
Executive Directors are allowed to accept external appointments as a Non-executive Director of one other company, subject to Board 
approval, provided that these are not with competing companies and are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest. Executive Directors would 
normally be allowed to retain the fees paid from these appointments. Executive Directors may not serve as the non-executive chairman of 
another quoted company.
As at 11 March 2014, neither Louis Eperjesi nor James Brotherton held any external directorships.
Other share plans
The Executive Directors may participate in any all employee share plans on the same basis as other employees in their country of 
residence. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Consultation with employees
Although the Committee does not consult directly with employees on the Directors’ remuneration policy, the Committee does consider the 
general basic salary increase, remuneration arrangements and employment conditions for the broader employee population when 
determining remuneration policy for the Executive Directors.
Consultation with shareholders and shareholder bodies
The Committee is committed to regular engagement with shareholders and shareholder bodies and enters into extensive consultations in 
advance of implementing any material changes to the Executive Directors’ remuneration, as well as on the measures, duration and targets 
for each of the annual grants under the LTIP. 
All Committee members attend the Annual General Meeting and may also be contacted through the Group’s Registered Office to answer 
any questions shareholders or shareholder bodies may have in relation to the Group’s remuneration policy.
Dilution
The general principle that the Group operates is that the vesting of share awards under Executive and Employee Share Plans should be 
satisfied either by the issue of shares out of treasury or, subject to Trustee consent, through the issue of shares acquired on the market by 
the Tyman Employee Benefit Trust. 
Certain jurisdictions require that new shares are issued to employees to settle vesting under share arrangements. Where new shares are 
issued in these circumstances it is the Group’s intention to match the new shares issued with an equal purchase of shares on the market 
either into Treasury or into the Tyman Employee Benefit Trust.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises all Non-executive Directors of the Company. The Executive Directors may, by 
invitation, attend meetings and provide advice to the Committee, except when their own remuneration is discussed. During 2013 the 
Committee was chaired by Mr Tench and met four times.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for:
 > setting, reviewing and recommending to the Board for approval the Company’s overall remuneration policy and strategy;
 > determining and reviewing the terms of appointment and the remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors of the Company 
and the Chairman;
 > determining and reviewing the terms of appointment and the remuneration arrangements of the members of the Tyman Management 
Committee of the Company; and
 > approving any Company share, share option or cash-based incentive plan, and the grant, award, allocation or issue of shares, share 
options or payments under any such plan.
The Committee continues to receive advice from Kepler Associates, an independent firm of remuneration consultants appointed by the 
Committee after consultation with the Board.
During the year, Kepler advised the Committee on developments in market practice, corporate governance and institutional investor views 
and in the development of the Company’s incentive arrangements. Total fees for advice provided to the Committee during the year were 
£30,510. Kepler are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group, and as such, voluntarily operate under the Code of Conduct which 
sets out guidelines to ensure that its advice is independent and free of undue influence.
The Committee also took advice from the Group’s legal advisers, Pinsent Masons LLP, as well as advice from a number of law firms around 
the world relating to local laws and regulations surrounding the granting, vesting and exercise of awards made to senior divisional 
management. Total fees for legal advice provided to the Committee during the year were £56,316.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice they have received has been objective and independent.

Additional disclosures for single figure for total remuneration table
Base salary
Base salaries for the Executive Directors were increased by 2.0 per cent from 1 January 2013 which was the same level of increase as was 
awarded for 2012 and reflected the general level of salary increases in the Group’s UK businesses.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus for Executive Directors increased by 34 per cent and reflected the improvement in underlying earnings of the Group 
during 2013. The annual bonus for the Group’s UK businesses increased by 176.0 per cent, reflecting the improvement in the underlying 
earnings of the Group’s UK businesses in 2013. This increase in bonus payments for UK employees does not reflect any change in the level 
of bonuses as a result of recruitment or promotion.

Non-cash benefits
The benefits provided to the Executive Directors included private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, and life assurance. The 
Executive Directors are not members of any of the Group pension schemes. There were no changes to the benefits policies or levels during 
the year.
Cash payments in lieu of pension and other benefits
In 2013, Louis Eperjesi was paid £54,000 (2012: £53,000) and James Brotherton was paid £10,000 (2012: £10,000) as a salary supplement 
in lieu of pension and other benefits. These amounts were non-bonusable.
Performance related remuneration
Annual bonus
For 2012 and 2013 the annual bonus scheme for Executive Directors was based 70 per cent on profitability (“PBTA”) targets and 30 per 
cent on free cash flow. The actual target ranges for the two bonus components have not been disclosed as this is considered by the Board 
to be commercially sensitive information; however the 2013 targets for both of the bonus components were increased by some 26 per cent 
and 50 per cent respectively during the year to take account of the acquisition of Truth.
Under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, 50 per cent of Executive Director bonuses that would otherwise have been payable are delivered in 
the form of nil-cost options, to strengthen alignment with shareholders’ interests. These awards will normally vest (together with dividend 
equivalents in cash or shares) after three years and are not subject to any performance conditions. Other senior employees are also 
required to defer a proportion of their bonuses pursuant to the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
2013 bonus outcome
As highlighted in the Chairman’s letter, Tyman demonstrated solid financial performance in 2013, with good growth in the US and the UK, 
and our key strategic initiatives progressing well. Group PBTA performance during the year was robust with achievement of £17.9 million for 
2013. This was ahead of the target range, resulting in 85.1 per cent of the bonus relating to PBTA becoming payable.
The Group’s cash collection in the period was very strong and was significantly ahead of the Group’s expectations at the time of the 
announcement of the Truth transaction. Accordingly 100 per cent of the bonus relating to cash flow became payable.
While none of the 2013 bonus was subject to the achievement of strategic or personal objectives, in approving the 2013 bonus amounts 
the Committee took into account the strategic achievements of the Group during the year and the individual contributions of the Executive 
Directors in securing those achievements.
Overall, this resulted in the Executive Directors receiving a bonus equal to 89.6 per cent of 2013 salary for the year, of which 50 per cent will 
be deferred until March 2017 under the rules of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
LTIP awards vesting
The announcement of the Group’s results for the year ended 31 December 2013 was the trigger event for the vesting of the 2010 and 
2011 LTIP awards.
The 2010 awards were made in December 2010 and the 2011 awards were made in July 2011. Both awards covered the performance 
period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013. Awards were dependent on the cumulative underlying basic EPS from continuing 
operations for the three years measured against a defined target range. 
Following consultations with institutional shareholders, the target ranges for both awards were restated following the disposal of Gall 
Thomson in 2012, however due to the proximity to the end of the measurement period the target ranges were not restated following the 
acquisition of Truth Hardware. Instead, the 2013 performance year was ringfenced for the effects of the Truth acquisition and its 
associated financing. The underlying basic EPS achieved is set out below.

The Tax effect is calculated using an effective tax rate of 38 per cent, which is a combination of a US tax rate on the Truth earnings and a UK tax rate on the interest charge.

The Remuneration Committee has satisfied itself that the recorded underlying cumulative EPS is a genuine reflection of the underlying 
business performance of the Group over the performance period and accordingly has approved the vesting of the 2010 and 2011 awards 
at their respective calculated percentages. Awards were adjusted for the impact of the bonus element of the open offer as a result of which 
a total of 1,836,954 awards, excluding dividend shares, vested in March 2014.
The number of awards that have vested for the Executive Directors and the senior managers, including dividend shares where eligible, is as 
follows.

Awards will be satisfied in accordance with Group policy through the issuance of shares from the Tyman Employee Benefit Trust, shares out

LTIP awards granted in 2013
On 14 November 2013 the Remuneration Committee granted nil or nominal cost options over 925,217 ordinary shares in the Company to 
around 32 senior managers, executives and Executive Directors (“2013 Awards”). Vesting of the 2013 awards is based on the Company’s 
three year cumulative underlying for the financial years 2013 to 2015.
If, over the three financial years 2013 to 2015, cumulative underlying EPS is less than 45 pence, no 2013 awards will vest; 25 per cent of 
2013 awards will vest for cumulative underlying EPS of 45 pence, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for cumulative underlying EPS 
of 51.5 pence or higher.
In addition, if and to the extent that it considers the recorded EPS is not a genuine reflection of the underlying business performance of the 
Company over the EPS performance period, the Committee may reduce the number of Vested Award Shares accordingly (the “Financial 
Underpin”). Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
60
In applying this Financial Underpin, the Committee shall (without limitation) have regard to:
 > Tyman’s TSR relative to the FTSE All-Share Index and the TSR of the median company in a list of comparator companies, in order of 
their TSR performance over the three calendar years 2013, 2014 and 2015, using such methodology for TSR calculations as the 
Committee shall consider appropriate; and
 > the EPS achieved in financial year 2015 and the extent to which this exceeds the EPS achieved in financial year 2012; and
 > whether, in the Committee’s opinion, any inappropriate risk taking has occurred; and
 > whether, in the Committee’s opinion, the three year cumulative EPS target has been achieved simply through increased and 
inappropriate gearing of the balance sheet.
The 2013 awards are expected to vest in March 2016, following the announcement of the Company’s results for the year ended  
31 December 2015.
LTIP awards granted in 2012
As the acquisition of Truth completed at an early point in the 2012 LTIP cycle (c. 1.5 years into the three-year performance period ending in 
December 2014), the Committee felt it was important for the incentive to capture the Group’s overall performance over the remainder of 
the performance period (rather than ring-fence the effects of the acquisition). In light of this, the Committee decided to:
 > make no adjustment to the existing EPS targets (25 per cent vesting at 33 pence up to 100 per cent vesting at 45.6 pence) for the Truth 
acquisition, but,
 > re-state the existing EPS targets for the capital raising completed as part of the Truth acquisition, as this was at a discount to the 
prevailing market price, based on the standard theoretical ex-offer price adjustment factor (c. 0.98).
Dilution limit 
Generally, it is the intention that LTIP awards will be satisfied through the transfer of existing shares by the Company’s employees’ benefit 
trust unless the Remuneration Committee, in its discretion, feels that a new issue of shares would be more appropriate. In the event that 
LTIP awards are satisfied through new issue shares, the Company will operate within the Association of British Insurers’ (“ABI”) guideline 
dilution limit of 10 per cent in 10 years for all share-based incentive schemes (excluding awards to the former Executive Chairman granted 
in 2004 and 2008). Expected dilution should not exceed the 10 per cent dilution limit, even if the awards made to the former Executive 
Chairman are taken into account. 
The Remuneration Committee has the flexibility to operate outside the ABI guideline of 5 per cent in 10 years dilution limit for 
discretionary share-based incentive schemes to accommodate LTIP awards for a broader employee population. In managing dilution, the 
Company will nevertheless be mindful of the 5 per cent in 10 years guideline and will be prudent in managing the flow rates, keeping 
shareholders informed of actual and anticipated dilution levels over time. The majority of the 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTIP awards are likely 
to be satisfied through the transfer of existing shares rather than the issue of new shares. 
Assuming that all performance targets are met in full, the Remuneration Committee currently envisages that a maximum of 1,103,390 of 
the 3,815,232 shares subject to all the Awards outstanding (approximately 29 per cent) will be satisfied through new issue shares to ensure 
that local trusts, tax and securities laws are complied with in certain overseas jurisdiction. 
As at 31 December 2013, shares equivalent to 2.25 per cent of the Group’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) would be 
required to settle all outstanding awards under Employee and Executive Share Plans, assuming maximum vesting. 
Tyman Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”)
The EBT held 2,179,282 Tyman ordinary shares at 31 December 2013. The outstanding LTIP awards at 31 December 2013 are as follows:

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy for the year ended 31 December 2014
Basic salary
As explained in the Chairman’s remuneration report letter, following consultation with major shareholders, the Committee has decided to 
phase-in salary increases to closer to median over two years, subject to an annual review of each executive’s performance and Company 
performance. In line with these discussions, the Committee set the CEO’s base salary at £334,000 per annum and the CFO’s base salary at 
£226,000 per annum from 1 January 2014.
The second phase will be considered at the next salary review date, which is in January 2015, and will take into account both individual and 
Company performance. This will include an assessment of the successful integration of, and delivery of the anticipated benefits from, the 
Truth acquisition which completed in 2013.
The review of Executive Director base salaries took into account the executives’ performance, experience and responsibilities, the overall 
impact of any salary adjustment on total remuneration and changes to pay across the Group, in addition to market competitive 
positioning. Comparators included international building products comparators and companies of similar size and complexity. The 
Committee wishes to emphasise that if there were a material change in business size or complexity (up or down), then this would be 
reflected in the market comparability.
Pension and benefits
As explained in the Chairman’s remuneration report letter, the Committee also increased the pension allowance for the CFO from c. 5 per 
cent of salary to 15 per cent of salary (the CEO’s cash allowance remains 20 per cent of salary). 
Annual bonus
The maximum opportunity for the two Executive Directors under the annual bonus plan is 100 per cent of basic salary. The performance 
measures for 2014 remain 70 per cent profitability (PBTA) and 30 per cent free cash flow. Targets for the annual bonus plans are not 
disclosed because they are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive.
LTIP awards
The maximum opportunity for the two Executive Directors under the LTIP is 100 per cent, or 150 per cent in exceptional circumstances,  
and further awards are expected to be made in 2014. The measurement period for the 2014 awards will be from 1 January 2014 to 
31 December 2016. 
2014 Awards are expected to vest (to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied) in March 2017, however in line with 
the Group’s amended policy on vesting of LTIPs, Executive Directors will ordinarily be required to hold all vested awards under the 2014 
Awards for a further two years until March 2019.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of T yman plc
Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion  
In our opinion the Group financial statements defined below:
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements, which are prepared by Tyman plc, comprise:
 > the Group statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013;
 > the Group income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
 > the Group statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and
 > the notes to the Group financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union.
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit involves 
obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
 > whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed;
 > the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
 > the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”) to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited Group financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to 
evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be £1.5 million. This 
represents approximately 0.5 per cent of revenue. In our view revenue is the most appropriate benchmark of underlying performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £75,000 as well as 
misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group is structured along four business lines being Amesbury, Schlegel International, Grouphomesafe, and Truth Hardware. The Group 
financial statements are a consolidation of 49 reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating businesses which map into the four 
business lines and centralised functions. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the reporting 
units by us, as the Group engagement team, or component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Where 
the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those 
reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
Group financial statements as a whole. 
Accordingly, of the Group’s 49 reporting units, we identified 13 which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, 
either due to their size or their risk characteristics. Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were performed at a 
further three reporting units and rotational visits to two additional small reporting units were made.  Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
67
Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
This provided coverage of 71 per cent of Group revenue. We have considered the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the 
remaining reporting units which comprise a large number of small units in which we considered the risk of material misstatement to the 
Group to be low and performed analytical procedures on their financial information. Together with additional procedures performed at the 
Group level on balances such as goodwill and intangible assets, this gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole. 
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused 
our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating 
the disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all risks or 
areas of focus identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. Their report on those matters that they 
considered to be significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on pages 45 and 46.
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Impairment assessment  
We focused on this area because the determination of whether or 
not an impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets was 
necessary involved significant judgements about the future results 
of the business.
(Refer to note 10 to the financial statements).
We evaluated the Directors’ future cash flow forecasts, and the 
process by which they were drawn up, including comparing them to 
the latest Board approved budgets, and testing the underlying 
calculations. We challenged:
 > the Directors’ key assumptions for long term growth rates in the 
forecasts by comparing them to historical results, economic and 
industry forecasts; and
 > the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the 
Company and comparable organisations. 
We also performed sensitivity analysis around the key drivers of the 
cash flow forecasts; being revenue growth rates and EBITDA 
margins. Having ascertained the extent of change in those 
assumptions that either individually or collectively would be 
required for the goodwill to be impaired, we considered the 
likelihood of such a movement in those key assumptions arising.
Accounting for business combinations 
The Group acquired Truth Hardware Inc. during the year. This 
acquisition was significant to the financial statements of the 
Group and accounting standards require that all assets and 
liabilities are recorded at their fair value on acquisition. The 
identification and valuation of intangible assets and valuation of 
inventory, property, and provisions in particular required significant 
judgement.
(Refer to note 24 to the financial statements).
We evaluated the nature of intangible assets identified considering 
the rationale for the acquisition and the methodology and 
assumptions used by the Directors in valuing these assets. In 
respect of the customer relationship and brand intangible assets, 
we evaluated the cash flow forecasts used by the Directors and 
challenged key assumptions which included customer attrition 
rates, sales growth, and implied royalty rates.
In respect of inventory valuation, we assessed the margin uplift 
against historic actual margins earned and tested the calculation of 
obsolescence provisions based on inventory ageing. In respect of 
the property, management obtained an independent third party 
valuation and we have evaluated the work performed by the 
valuers, and in respect of provisions we evaluated the judgements 
made around potential future liabilities and challenged the 
assumptions made by management in calculating the provisions. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Independent auditors’ report to the members of T yman plc
continued
Fraud in revenue recognition   
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition because of the pressure management may feel to 
achieve the planned results. 
(Refer to note 3 to the financial statements).
We evaluated the design of controls over revenue and receivables 
and used a combination of automated data analysis to check that 
either a receivable was created or cash received upon recognising a 
revenue transaction and manual testing of product delivery and 
cash collection to check that revenue transactions were 
appropriately recorded. 
We tested accounts receivable through a combination of third party 
confirmations and testing of cash received after the year end date.
We also tested journal entries posted to revenue accounts to 
identify unusual or irregular items. 
Risk of management override of internal controls   
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this.  
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including 
the arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” inappropriate actions 
and interviewed senior management. We examined the significant 
accounting estimates and judgements relevant to the financial 
statements for evidence of bias by the Directors that may represent 
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We also tested journal 
entries.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 43, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s financial statements using 
the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, 
and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.
As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Opinions on matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the Group financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.

us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

 > is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Tyman plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRS IC”) as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS on a going concern basis. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modified by financial assets and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed 
in note 2.22.
2.1.1 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and 
have a material impact on the Group:
Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’ regarding other comprehensive income. The main change resulting from these 
amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ on the basis of whether they are 
potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments).
IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was revised in June 2011. The main change for the Group’s accounting policies is to replace the interest cost 
and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit 
liability. The implication of this is that the expected return on assets credited to the income statement (previously calculated based on the 
expected long-term return on plan assets) is now based on a lower corporate bond rate, being the same rate used to discount the pension 
liability. The impact of the amended IAS 19 is as follows:
 > Profit/(Loss) before tax was approximately £0.4 million and £0.2 million lower for the full year 2013 and 2012 respectively, with a 
corresponding pre-tax increase in other comprehensive income. The results for 2012 have been restated.
 > Basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share for 2013 decreased by approximately 0.25 pence (2012: a decrease of 0.14 pence).
 > No impact on cash flows or the balance sheet at 31 December 2013, 31 December 2012 or 1 January 2012. As such, the impact of the 
IAS 19 amendments have not been presented at 1 January 2012.
IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a 
single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely aligned 
between IFRSs, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already 
required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 
2013, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected to have material 
impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 
was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of 
financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value 
and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity’s business 
model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the 
standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial 
liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the 
income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact. The Group will also consider 
the impact of the remaining phases of IFRS 9 when completed by the Board. 
There are no other IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have material impact on the Group.

2.2 Consolidation
2.2.1 Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a 
subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest 
issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of 
the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a 
change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity.
The excess of the consideration transferred and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair 
value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the 
net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement 
(note 2.3).
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses 
are also eliminated. Where necessary amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the Group’s accounting policies.
2.2.2 Disposal of subsidiaries
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is 
lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of 
subsequently accounting for the retained interest in the financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. 
This may result in amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income being reclassified to profit or loss.
.
2.3 Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Cash Generating Units 
(“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the 
goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value 
less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
2.4 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. On acquisition of Group companies, the Group 
recognises any separately identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill, initially measuring the intangible assets at fair value.
Purchased intangible assets acquired through a business combination, including purchased brands, customer relationships, trademarks and 
licences, are initially measured at fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
 > Acquired brands – 5 to 20 years.
 > Customer relationships – 9 to 15 years.
 > Computer software – 3 to 4 years. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
76
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the 
Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
 > it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
 > management intends to complete the software product and use it or sell it;
 > there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
 > it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
 > adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; 
and
 > the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an 
appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense 
as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Computer 
software development costs recognised as assets are amortised when the intangible assets are in the location and condition necessary for 
it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are 
amortised over their estimated useful lives, which does not exceed five years. 
The estimated useful lives of acquired intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a 
change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. Any amendments to the estimated 
useful lives of intangible assets are recorded as a change in estimate in the period the change occurred.
2.5 Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets, including goodwill, that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortisation 
and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of 
disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely 
independent cash inflows (cash generating units). Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible 
reversal at each reporting date. Goodwill previously impaired cannot be reversed at a later date.
2.6 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the specific asset will flow to the Group and 
the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance 
are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on all other property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the 
cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, at the following annual rates:
 > Freehold land – Not depreciated.
 > Freehold buildings – 2% to 5%.
 > Plant and machinery – 7.5% to 33%.
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are 
reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
2.7 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined in accordance with the first-in, first-out method. Cost 
includes the cost of materials determined on a purchase cost basis, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal levels of activity. It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Where necessary, a provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard to the nature and condition of 
inventory, as well as its anticipated saleability.

2.8 Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument and are generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified 
as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “trade and other receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents” in the 
balance sheet.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or 
less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-
current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it 
in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the 
carrying amount and present value of estimated future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows and balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with 
banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade and other payables, and interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the 
business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.9 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
 > hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
 > hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
For those instruments designated as hedges, the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The 
Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 18. The full fair value of a hedging 
derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or 
liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised immediately 
in the income statement. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
78
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or 
loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is 
immediately transferred to the income statement.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement 
when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
2.10 Employee benefits
The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans.
Pension obligations
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into publicly or privately administered pension 
insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group recognises contributions as an employee benefit expense when 
they are due and has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The Group has no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee 
service in the current or prior periods. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund in the future is 
available.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension 
benefit an employee will receive on retirement. This amount is usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service 
and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates 
of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates 
on government bonds are used.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
Other post-employment obligations
Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually 
conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected 
costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit 
pension plans.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates:
 > when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and
 > when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
79
Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of 
employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to 
their present value.
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit 
attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or 
where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
2.11 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
 > the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event;
 > it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
 > a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised in the income statement within net finance costs. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
2.12 Leases
Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a finance lease. 
Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the present value 
of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as 
to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income statement.
Assets held under finance lease are depreciated over the lower of the useful lives and the term of the lease.
All other leases are treated as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
2.13 Share-based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based compensation plan (Long Term Incentive Plan, “LTIP”) for certain employees under 
which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (share options) of the Group. The fair value of 
the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the 
impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 
that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, 
with any changes in estimate recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of awards 
granted under LTIP is measured using a probability model to predict target EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.
2.14 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s owners until the shares are 
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s owners.
2.15 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-makers. The 
chief operating decision-makers, defined as the Board of Directors, are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of 
the operating segments. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
80
2.16 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents the amounts receivable for goods 
supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and when the amount of 
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods 
have been substantially transferred to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods.
2.17 Current and deferred taxation
Income tax credit comprises current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity; in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity.
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. No deferred tax liabilities are recognised if it arises from the initial recognition of:
 > goodwill;
 > an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except for deferred 
income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the extent 
that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
same tax entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.18 Exceptional items
Where certain income or expense items recorded in the period are material by their size or incidence, the Group reflects such items as 
exceptional items within a separate line on the income statement, except for those exceptional items that relate to net finance costs and tax.
Separate presentation of exceptional items provides an improved understanding of the elements of financial performance in the year so as 
to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance.
Exceptional items, as disclosed in note 6, include one-off redundancy and restructuring costs, and transactions costs associated with 
merger and acquisition activity.
2.19 Foreign exchange
2.19.1 Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, 
which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group.
2.19.2 Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when 
deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. These are recognised 
directly in equity, other than the ineffective element, until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the 
income statement.

Directors’ report
Financial statements
2.19.3 Group companies
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange 
rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated into Sterling at the average rates throughout the year.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets of Group companies, together with differences arising from the 
translation of the net results at average or actual rates to the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, are taken to other 
comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative translation differences recognised in other comprehensive income 
relating to that particular foreign operation are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
2.20 Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets and all assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less 
costs to sell.
Non-current assets and all assets and liabilities, or disposal groups, are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is met only when a sale is highly probable, the asset or 
disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and management is committed to the sale which is expected to 
qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
2.21 Non-GAAP measure accounting policy
The Directors believe that the “underlying” profit and earnings per share measures provide additional useful information to shareholders on 
the underlying performance of the business. These measures are consistent with how business performance is measured internally. The 
adjusted profit before tax measure is not recognised under IFRS and may not be comparable with “underlying” profit measures used by 
other companies. The adjustments made to reported profit before tax is to include the following:
 > Exceptional items – these are largely one-off in nature and therefore create volatility in reported earnings.
 > Amortisation of borrowing costs, amortisation and accelerated amortisation of intangible assets, impairment of intangible assets and 
goodwill, and unwinding of discount on provisions – these are non-cash in nature and the events giving rise to them are expected to be 
infrequent.
2.22 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
2.22.1 Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following areas represent the key judgements made by management in order to facilitate the preparation of the Group’s financial 
statements:
Acquisition accounting
IFRS 3 requires assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value and to separately identify intangible assets from goodwill, initially 
measuring each group of intangible assets at fair value. Groups of intangible assets include purchased brands and customer relationships. 
There is judgement involved in estimating fair value, particularly in relation to identifiable intangible assets, which requires the Directors to 
estimate the useful economic life of each asset and the future cash flows expected to arise from each asset and to apply a suitable 
discount rate (note 24). 
Carrying value of goodwill and intangibles
As set out in notes 10 and 11 to the Group financial statements, as at 31 December 2013, the Group had goodwill of £244.8 million with 
intangible assets amounting in total to £109.6 million. An impairment review using a value in use calculation has been performed for each 
cash generating unit. There is significant judgement involved in determining appropriate assumptions to use in the calculations, including 
the forecasted cash flows of each cash generating unit and appropriate discount rates relative to the Company’s cost of capital. These 
assumptions have been subjected to sensitivity analyses. Details of estimates used and sensitivities in the impairment reviews are set out in 
note 10.
Provisions
The Group has provisions of £9.7 million as at 31 December 2013 as outlined in note 19 to the Group financial statements which, by their 
nature, are uncertain and highly judgemental. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the balance sheet date based on the nature of the provisions, the potential outcomes, any developments relating to 
specific claims, and previous experience. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Carrying value of inventory
As set out in note 13 to the Group financial statements, as at 31 December 2013, the Group had gross inventories of £47.0 million and 
provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventories of £6.3 million. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with 
due allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-moving items. Group management exercises judgement in assessing net realisable value and 
provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory which is based on current assessments of future demand, market conditions and new 
product development initiatives. 
Carrying value of trade receivables
As set out in note 14 to the Group financial statements, as at 31 December 2013, the Group had gross trade receivables of £32.0 million 
and provisions for bad debts of £2.1 million. Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, less appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it 
in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the 
carrying amount and present value of estimated future cash flows. Group management exercises judgement in assessing the amount of 
any write downs required which is based on current assessments of the creditworthiness of current customers. 
2.22.2 Other key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions. The key assumptions 
concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit schemes
The benefit obligation is calculated using a number of assumptions including future salary increases, increases to pension benefits, 
mortality rates and, in the case of post-employment medical benefits, the expected rate of increase in medical costs. The present value 
of the benefit obligation is calculated by discounting the benefit obligation using market yields on high-quality corporate bonds at the 
balance sheet date. The plan assets consist largely of listed securities and their fair values are subject to fluctuation in response to changes 
in market conditions. Effects of changes in the actuarial assumptions underlying the benefit obligation, effects of changes in the discount 
rate applicable to the benefit obligation and effects of differences between the expected and actual return on the plan assets are classified 
as actuarial gains and losses and are recognised directly in equity. Further actuarial gains and losses will be recognised during the next 
financial year. An analysis of the assumptions that will be used by management to determine the cost of defined benefit plans that will be 
recognised in the income statement in the next financial year is presented in note 21.
Deferred tax assets
Estimation is required of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences but, where deductible temporary differences exist, management’s 
judgement is required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits. It is 
possible that the deferred tax assets actually recoverable may differ from the amounts recognised if actual taxable profits differ from 
management’s estimates (note 20).
3. Segment information
The reporting segments reflect the manner in which performance is evaluated and resources allocated. During 2013, the Board, in its 
capacity as the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, reviewed the continuing appropriateness of the Group’s operating segment 
disclosures. The Group operates through three clearly defined divisions – Amesbury, Grouphomesafe and Schlegel International – each 
headed by a divisional CEO and each reporting to the Board via the Group CEO and CFO on a regular basis. Accordingly, the Board has 
concluded that the most appropriate segmental analysis for stakeholders is based on the three reporting divisions with an allocation of 
Group central overheads made to each division.
For 2013, the Board considers it appropriate that Truth Hardware (“Truth”) be disclosed as an additional segment given its size and the fact 
that throughout the year it was managed as a stand alone entity with its own CEO and management team. From January 2014, our North 
American businesses have been managed as a single entity with an integrated management team. Accordingly, Truth has been incorporated 
into the Amesbury operating segment from the start of 2014. The 2014 results will therefore not include Truth as a distinct operating 
segment.
Each operating segment broadly represents the Group’s geographical focus, being the North American (Amesbury and Truth), United 
Kingdom (Grouphomesafe) and International (Schlegel International) operations. The Schlegel International segment includes Schlegel 
Building Products (formerly Linear), the Group’s UK-based manufacturer of pile weatherstrip and extrusions.

Truth integration costs (1,434) –
Write-off of Truth inventory fair value adjustment (2,304) –
(10,903) (2,574)
Redundancy, restructuring, inventory obsolescence alignment and warranty costs
Included within this category is a charge of £887,000 relating to changes made to the Group’s provision estimate for slow-moving 
inventory held for greater than one year and followed a review of the Group’s overall inventory provisioning methodology undertaken on 
acquisition of Truth Hardware (note 24). The Group believes that aligning Tyman’s inventory obsolescence calculation with that of Truth 
Hardware is appropriate given the enlarged Group’s experience of slow-moving and obsolete inventory. The remainder of this category 
relates to exceptional costs incurred as a result of the restructuring of the European footprint and the changes made to the North 
American management team. 
Transaction costs associated with M&A activity
These costs principally relate to the transaction costs, including anti-trust fees, which are directly attributable to the acquisition Truth 
Hardware (note 24).
Truth integration costs
These costs are non-recurring costs incurred as a result of integrating Truth Hardware. Of the £1,434,000 integration costs, £850,000 
comprise non-cash write-downs of discontinued products and product lines.
Write-off of Truth inventory fair value adjustment
This charge relates to the IFRS requirement that finished goods held in inventory must be revalued to their market value on acquisition. As 
the inventory acquired at the date of acquisition has been substantially sold in the subsequent six months, this uplift in the book value has 
been written off as exceptional as the cost is considered to be of a one-off nature and is of a magnitude that would distort the underlying 
trading result of Truth Hardware in the period.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013. Accordingly, the Group’s UK 
profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 23.25% (2012: 24.50%). A tax rate of 21 % from 1 April 2014, and a tax 
rate of 20% from 1 April 2015 were substantively enacted in July 2013. The Group’s UK deferred tax assets and liabilities have been 
remeasured at a rate of 20%, being the rate applicable during the period the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be utilised.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Exceptional adjustments in respect of prior periods arose from the clarification with the tax authorities of the tax treatment of provisions, 
mainly those originally made at the time of the Schlegel acquisition in 2006 and the LSS acquisition in 2007. Tyman plc

Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued 
on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. There is no difference between the basic and diluted loss 
per share for 2012 as the effect of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares outstanding was anti-dilutive.

The Group presents an underlying earnings per share figure which excludes the impact of exceptional items, amortisation and accelerated 
amortisation of intangible assets, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, non-cash finance costs, and certain non-recurring items. 
Underlying earnings per share has been based on underlying earnings for each financial year and on the same weighted average number 
of shares in issue as the earnings per share calculation.

Impairment tests for goodwill
Assumptions
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. Value in use is determined by discounting the future 
pre-tax cash flows generated from the continuing use of the CGU, using a pre-tax discount rate.
Cash flow projections are derived from financial plans approved by the Board and cover a five year period. They reflect management’s 
expectations of revenue growth, operating cost and margin for each CGU based on past experience. Cash flows after the five year forecast 
period were extrapolated using a long-term growth rate of 1.50% in order to calculate the terminal recoverable amount.
Discount rates are estimated using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk profiles of 
the CGUs.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations in each of the Group’s CGUs at 31 December 2013 are as follows:
Average pre-tax  
discount rate
Average revenue growth  
for years one to five
2013 2012 2013 2012
Amesbury 14.1% 12.4% 12.5% 8.1%
Grouphomesafe 10.2% 11.7% 6.0% 3.6%
Schlegel International 12.6% 14.5% 10.0% 9.8%
Truth Hardware 13.7% n/a 4.5% n/a
Impairment review results: 2013
A review of the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets across the Group has been carried out in the light of current trading and 
prospects. As a result of the annual impairment reviews, no impairment losses have been recognised in the year.
Whilst economic conditions in the European markets remain challenging, the goodwill and intangible asset balances are considered 
sustainable based on current projections. If markets continue to deteriorate, this could give rise to a further impairment charge at a future 
date.
Impairment review results: 2012
The results of the impairment review process in 2012 indicated that the carrying value of goodwill in the Schlegel International CGU was 
unsupportable, and that impairment was necessary. An impairment charge of £10.7 million was recognised in administrative expenses in 
the income statement.

Sensitivity to assumptions
Sensitivity analysis was calculated on the basis of lowering the forecast revenues by a constant percentage each year from year one 
onwards in perpetuity until the excess of value in use over the carrying value of the CGU’s assets was reduced to zero. Revenues would need 
to decrease by 5.7 percentage points for each year from year one onwards in perpetuity before any impairment would arise in respect of 
the CGU with the lowest impairment headroom. Given the strengthened management structure and improving economic prospects in the 
markets in which this CGU operates, it is considered unlikely that such a sustained deterioration in revenue will occur.

Impairment
2013 Impairment charge
The impairment charge on customer relations of £529,000 relates to intangibles acquired as part of the Unique acquisition in 2012. The 
impairment was necessitated by the transfer and integration of the Unique business and assets to the Group’s Statesville facility (part of 
the Amesbury division).
2012 Impairment charge
The impairment charge on acquired brands of £6,223,000 relates to a US brand name which is no longer in use.
The remaining £1,510,000 impairment on acquired brands and the £1,837,000 impairment on customer relations relates to intangibles 
acquired as part of the Schlegel acquisition in 2006. As mentioned in note 10, the Group’s European businesses have continued to 
experience challenging market conditions, thus reducing the expectation of the future profitability of products marketed in this segment, 
under the Schlegel brand. As a result, the recoverable amount of these intangible assets fell below net book value, giving rise to an 
impairment loss in 2012. Impairment losses were recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement. Tyman plc

On 1 July 2013, the Group drew down US$100 million under the new multicurrency loan facility for the purposes of funding the Truth 
acquisition (note 24). The facility extends to and is repayable in full on 30 June 2015, is unsecured and guaranteed by Tyman plc and its 
principal subsidiary undertakings.
On 14 September 2011, the Group entered into a debt facility agreement which extends the Group’s committed facilities to 31 March 2016. 
The multicurrency term loan of £110 million, as well as the £30 million multicurrency working capital facility, are unsecured and guaranteed 
by Tyman plc and its principal subsidiary undertakings. Scheduled repayments commenced annually on 31 December 2012 and will 
continue until 31 December 2015, with the balance outstanding payable on the termination date of the facility, being 31 March 2016.
There were no defaults in interest payments in the year under the terms of the loan agreements.

Property related
Property provisions include provisions for onerous leases of £4,210,000 (2012: £5,125,000) and leasehold dilapidations of £1,396,000 
(2012: £1,343,000), and are expected to be utilised by 2018.
For onerous leases, the Group has provided for the rental payments due over the remaining term of existing operating lease contracts 
where a period of vacancy is ongoing. The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which properties 
are likely to remain vacant and any likely sub-lease income on a property-by-property basis. The provision covers potential transfer of 
economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in note 29.2.
The provision for leasehold dilapidations relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of repair. 
The transfer of economic benefits will occur at the end of the leases set out in note 29.2.
In 2012, the Group successfully assigned the lease on Unit A at Peterlee and have been released from all remaining obligations in 
connection with the Peterlee site. This resulted in a release to the income statement of £2,021,000 of property provisions.
Restructuring
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs at restructured business units and are expected to be utilised by the 
end of 2014.
Warranty
The warranty provision is calculated based on historical experience of the ultimate cost of settling product warranty claims and potential 
claims. Warranty provisions are expected to be utilised by the end of 2017.
Other
Other provisions relate to the tax consequences of international intragroup transactions for which the fiscal authorities may be expected to 
adopt opposing treatments in respect of revenue and cost recognition. Other provisions are expected to be utilised by 2014.

Factors that may affect future tax charges
There are estimated tax losses of £16,124,000 (2012: £14,403,000) within the Group, comprising capital losses of £4,581,000 (2012: 
£4,581,000) and trading losses of £11,543,000 (2012: £9,822,000). As the future use of these losses is uncertain, in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policy only a portion of these losses have been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013. Accordingly, the Group’s UK 
profits for this accounting year are taxed at an effective rate of 23.25% (2012: 24.50%).
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21 % (effective from 1 April 2014) and a further reduction to 20% (effective from 1 
April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
These reductions in the UK corporation tax rate are likely to lead to a further reduction in the future UK current tax charge. The deferred tax 
assets and liabilities at 31 December 2013 have been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at 31 December 2013.
The amounts of deferred tax not recognised are as follows:

No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £49,300,000 (2012: £40,500,000) relating to the unremitted earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries. As a result of UK legislation, which largely exempts from UK tax the overseas dividends received, the temporary 
differences arising on unremitted profits are unlikely to lead to additional UK corporate taxes. Furthermore, although the remittance to the 
UK of those earnings could still result in a tax liability, arising as a result of withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in 
which those subsidiaries operate, such jurisdictions provide currently for zero dividend withholding tax in their tax agreements with the UK.
21. Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans
21.1 Defined contribution pension schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held externally to the Group in separate 
trustee administered funds. The costs of the Group’s defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the 
period in which they fall due. The Group had unpaid pension contributions of £Nil (2012: £Nil) included within employee benefit liabilities.

The 2012 comparatives have been restated to take account of the IAS 19 revision, which increased the comparative’s net pension charge in 
the income statement and reduced the charge to other comprehensive income by £0.2 million. Refer note 2.1.1.
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension scheme and post-employment medical benefit scheme are operated in the United States. 
The defined benefit schemes provide benefits to members in the form of guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of benefits 
provided depends on members’ length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. For US plans, pensions in 
payment do not receive inflationary increases. The benefit payments are from trustee-administered funds. Plan assets held in trusts are 
governed by local regulations and practice in the US, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees and their 
composition. Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the Group and 
the board of trustees. The board of trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance 
with the plan’s regulations.
The current service cost, past service costs and expenses relating to the administration of the defined benefit schemes are included in the 
income statement within administrative expenses. Net expense is included within net finance income and costs. Actuarial gains and losses 
from participant experience, changes in demographic assumptions, changes in financial assumptions and net return on plan assets are 
recognised, net of the related deferred tax, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Other defined benefit pension schemes had net liabilities of £Nil (2012: £Nil).

Through its defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most 
significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets 
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The US plans hold a significant proportion of fixed income 
investments, comprising a mixture of government and corporate bonds, and provides an acceptable level of 
investment risk to better match liabilities.
The Group believes that given the long-term nature of plan liabilities, and the strength of the supporting Group, a 
level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Group’s long-term strategy to manage the 
plans efficiently. Equities are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility 
and risk in the short-term. As the plans mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by 
investing more in assets that better match the liabilities.
Changes in  
bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase 
in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Group’s pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities 
(although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against 
extreme inflation).
The majority of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with equities 
inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In the US plans, the pensions in 
payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
Life expectancies The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows:
2013 
£’000
2012 
£’000
Discount rate 4.5% 3.7%
Inflation 2.3% 2.3%
Salary growth rate n/a n/a

7.0% – 4.5% 8.0% – 4.5%
1  The level of healthcare contributions are capped and adopting a higher trend rate does not materially affect the liability. Tyman plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
102
Assumptions regarding future mortality are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in each 
jurisdiction. These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 65:
2013 2012 
Retiring at the end of the reporting year
 –  Male 19.6 19.9
 –  Female 21.5 21.7
Retiring 20 years after the end of the reporting year
 –  Male 19.6 21.3
 –  Female 21.5 22.6
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumption is:
Impact on defined benefit obligation
Change in assumption Increase in assumption Decrease in assumption
Discount rate 0.25% Decrease by 2.9% Increase by 3.0%
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit 
obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same methodology has been applied as when calculating the pension liability 
recognised within the statement of financial position.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous year.
The pension scheme is closed to new entrants; as a result the service costs to the Group will rise in future years. The expected level of 
contributions to the defined benefit pension scheme and post-employment medical benefits in the year to December 2014 is £1,277,000.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 10.9 years.
The expected maturity analysis of undiscounted pension and post-employment medical benefits are as follows:

On 23 May 2013, the Group completed the fully underwritten firm placing and open offer of ordinary shares as part of the funding for the 
acquisition of Truth Hardware (see note 24). Gross proceeds of £73.4 million were raised through the sale of 6,864,000 treasury shares and 
the issue of 32,816,904 new ordinary shares at the issue price of 185 pence per share. The sale of treasury shares resulted in a transfer of 
£6.2 million from the treasury reserve against share premium. Share issue costs of £2.4 million have been incurred to 31 December 2013, 
netted against share premium.
The total authorised number of ordinary shares is 180,000,000 (2012: 180,000,000) with a par value of 5 pence per share (2012: 5 pence 
per share). All issued shares are fully paid.

23. Share-based payments
In 2013, the Group operated the LTIP. The nil cost options awarded under the LTIP were valued using a probability model to predict EPS 
levels. The charge to the income statement in 2013 was £681,000 (2012: £482,000).
LTIP
Conditional, annual awards of shares are granted under the LTIP to certain Executive Directors and senior managers at the discretion of 
the Remuneration Committee. Provided the participant remains an employee of the Group and the performance conditions are met, 
awards will vest three years after the date of the grant at no cost to the employee. The percentage of shares that will actually vest is 
dependent upon the Group’s earnings per share growth over a three year measurement period. The Remuneration Committee also has the 
discretion to adjust the number of shares vesting depending on the Tyman performance during the vesting period. Further information on 
the LTIP and the performance conditions is given in the remuneration report.
The fair value of the awards granted under the LTIP and the assumptions used in the calculation of the share-based payment charge are as 
follows:

24. Acquisition of subsidiaries
On 3 July 2013, the Group completed the acquisition of Truth Hardware (“Truth”) for a net cash consideration of US$204.7 million from 
Melrose Industries plc. Truth Hardware is a manufacturer of operating hardware for residential and light commercial windows and doors in 
North America and comprises the US-based Truth Corporation (located in Owatonna, Minnesota), where the business is headquartered, 
and the Canadian-based Atlas (located in Brampton, Ontario). This acquisition strategically enhances the Group’s position in the North 
American door and window components market where the Group sees significant opportunity for continued growth.

The fair value of financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of £8,790,000 and a gross contractual value of £8,932,000. The 
best estimate at the acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not recoverable is £142,000.
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of £4,340,000 for professional fees paid for due diligence, other general professional fees and 
legal advice. These costs have been included in exceptional costs in the Group’s consolidated income statement.
Revenue included in the consolidated income statement since 3 July 2013 contributed by Truth was £42.9 million. Truth also contributed 
£2.2 million to the profit before taxation from continuing operations over the same period.
Had the acquisition of Truth been completed on the first day of the financial year, an additional £40.3 million of revenue and £6.9 million 
of profit before taxation from continuing operations would have been contributed to the Group.
Fair values remain provisional in relation to this acquisition and the Group will complete this review in 2014. Any adjustment to the carrying 
value is unlikely to be significant to the individual acquisition.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is attributable to the expected profitability of the acquired business and the synergies expected to arise 
after the Group’s acquisition of Truth Hardware.
The estimated value of intangibles, including goodwill, deductible for tax purposes is £Nil.

25.2 Financial instruments: risk profile
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital structure to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern. The capital structure of the Group 
consists of cash and cash equivalents (note 15), interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 17) and equity attributable to the shareholders 
of the parent as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Financial management
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and cash and short-term deposits. The Group has various other financial 
instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. No trading in financial instruments is 
undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each financial instrument risk and they are summarised below.
Liquidity and credit risk
The Group maintains sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of credit 
facilities. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity on the basis of expected cash flow.
The Group manages liquidity risk by the pooling of cash resources and depositing funds available for investment in approved financial 
instruments with financial institutions. Counterparty risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents is managed by only investing in banks 
and financial instruments with independently assessed credit ratings of at least A-2 as published by Standard and Poor’s. Individual risk 
limits are assessed by management based on the external ratings. Management does not expect any losses from the non-performance of 
these counterparties.
Credit risk is also attributable to the Group’s exposure to trade receivables due from customers. Management assesses the credit quality of 
customers taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. In order to mitigate credit risk the Group utilises 
credit insurance in those areas of its operations where such insurance is available. In areas where such insurance is not available, 
management monitors the utilisation of credit limits by customers, identified either individually or by group, and incorporates this 
information in credit risk controls. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk due to the diverse nature of the Group’s client base.
Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management 
based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date. Management 
considers all financial assets that are not impaired for each of the reporting dates under review are of good credit quality, including those 
that are past due.

Interest rate sensitivity
The impact of a 50 basis point movement in floating interest rates on borrowings would have a c. £500,000 (2012: £400,000) impact on 
profits. This impact would be reduced by the tax effect on such a change.
Interest rate risk of financial assets
The Board periodically reviews any exposure the Group may have to interest rate fluctuations. The weighted average interest rate received 
on deposited funds was 0.3 per cent during the year (2012: 1.24 per cent).
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to the US Dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial and financing transactions, recognised assets and 
liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the Group’s functional currency and net investments in overseas entities.
The Group has a number of overseas subsidiaries, whose net assets are subject to currency translation risk. The Group borrows in local 
currencies as appropriate to minimise the impact of this risk on the balance sheet.

Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so as to provide returns to 
shareholders and benefits to stakeholders. The Group defines its capital as total equity plus net debt.
In maintaining the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount paid as dividends to shareholders, issue new shares or dispose of 
assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors its financial capacity by reference to financial covenant ratios, including leverage and interest cover. If the Group fails 
to meet its key financial ratios required by its lenders, this could impact the Group’s average interest rate of borrowings and the future 
availability of credit to the Group.
The Group is in compliance with its financial covenants within its committed bank credit facilities, and has been in compliance throughout 
the financial year.

25.3 Fair value estimation
The Group’s derivative financial instrument used for hedging is measured at fair value. The Group uses the following hierarchy for 
measuring fair value:
 > Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 > Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 > Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Derivatives shown at fair value in the balance sheet have been valued by reference to level 2 techniques described above.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.
Valuation techniques used to derive level 2 fair values
Level 2 hedging derivatives comprise interest rate swaps fair valued using forward interest rates extracted from observable yield curves. 
The effects of discounting are generally insignificant for level 2 derivatives. The fair value of the derivative financial instrument at 31 
December 2013 is a liability of £767,000 (2012: liability of £605,000).
There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year.
Group’s valuation process
The Group has a team that performs the valuations of financial assets required for financial reporting purposes. This team reports to the 
Chief Financial Officer and the Audit Committee.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost
The fair value of borrowings are as follows:
2013

Non-current (116,421) (64,703)

Acquisition
On 26 February 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of Vedasil Brasil (“Vedasil”), the market leader in the manufacture and supply of 
pile weatherseals in Brazil.
Vedasil manufactures and supplies polypropylene extruded seals under the Eco-PDM brand and other seal and screen components to the 
Brazilian door and window market. In 2013, Vedasil reported revenues of approximately BR19.3 million (£5.7 million). In 2013, Schlegel 
América do Sul (“Schlegel Brazil”), Tyman’s existing Brazilian business, reported revenues of approximately BR6.6 million (£2.0 million).
Given the short time period elapsed between acquisition and approval of the financial statements, the acquisition accounting has not yet 
been completed.

Our opinion  
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements defined below:
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of its cash flows for the year then 
ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Parent Company financial statements, which are prepared by Tyman plc, comprise:
 > the Parent Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2013;
 > the Parent Company statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and
 > the notes to the Parent Company financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts (the 
‘Annual Report’), rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are 
identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit involves 
obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
 > whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed;
 > the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
 > the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited Parent Company financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 > The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Parent Company financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Parent Company financial statements.
 > The part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 > the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law have not been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Other information in the Annual Report

of performing our audit; or
 > is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 43, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.

Financial statements
1. Accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by that Act, the 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards (“UK GAAP”).
The financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies, 
which have been applied consistently throughout the year, are set out below.
1.2 Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1.3 Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
1.4 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated recoverable amounts.
Trade creditors are stated at their nominal amount.
1.5 Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred, on an accruals 
basis, to the Company profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
1.6 Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 “Share-based payments”. The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments 
to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the 
impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 
that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, 
with any changes in estimate recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of awards 
granted under LTIP is measured using a probability model to predict EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a 
capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the 
vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity accounts.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself, 
and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
2. Profit attributable to the shareholders of the Company
The Company is an investment holding company. It receives dividend income from subsidiaries and bank interest. It pays loan interest to a 
subsidiary. The majority of administrative expenses are paid by the Company’s subsidiary, Tyman Management Limited, including the 
whole amount of relevant auditors’ remuneration and operating lease costs.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the 
year. The Company reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2013 of £4,242,000 (2012: a profit of £52,870,000). Included 
in the Company’s reported profits for the year ended 31 December 2012 is a profit on disposal of subsidiary of £55,700,000.
3. Employees
Other than the Directors, there were no employees of the Company during the year (2012: Nil). Directors’ emoluments are set out in the 
Directors’ remuneration report in the Group’s financial statements.

Where appropriate “Underlying” is defined as before amortisation and accelerated amortisation of intangible assets, deferred tax on 
amortisation and accelerated amortisation of intangible assets, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, exceptional items, 
unwinding of discount on provisions, amortisation of borrowing costs and the associated tax effect.
“Underlying administrative expenses” is defined as administrative expenses before property provision release, exceptional items, 
amortisation and accelerated amortisation of intangible assets, and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill.
“Underlying net debt” is defined as interest-bearing loans and borrowings, net of cash and cash equivalents, plus unamortised borrowing 
costs added back.
“Underlying operating profit” is defined as operating profit before property provision release, exceptional items, amortisation and 
accelerated amortisation of intangible assets, and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill.
“Continuing operations” is defined as the operations of the Tyman Group excluding Gall Thomson Environmental Limited and its

“Operational cash flow” is defined as net cash inflow from operating activities before income tax paid, pension contributions, proceeds on 
disposal of property, plant and equipment, and exceptional transaction costs associated with M&A activity, and after payments to acquire 
property, plant and equipment and payments to acquire intangible assets.
“Operating cash conversion” is defined as operational cash flow divided by underlying operating profit.
“Return on acquisition investment” is defined as annualised underlying operating profit attributable to the acquired business divided by the

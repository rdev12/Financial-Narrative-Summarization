Group Turnover Chairman’s introduction

InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
In the year ended 31 March 2005
InTechnology has made clear and sustained
progress across all parts of the group. Most
significantly we reduced operating losses
(before amortisation of goodwill) within our
Managed Services division to £2.0m (2004:
£7.8m) achieving the breakthrough into
monthly operating profit (before
amortisation of goodwill) during the second
half of the financial year. Managed Services
division operating losses were reduced to
£4.3m (2004: £10.0m). Revenues in the
Specialist Distribution division increased by
26% to £261.4m (2004 restated: £207.4m).
Through investment in recent years,
InTechnology has developed a range of
managed services which allow organisations
to free up valuable management time by
outsourcing specific areas of IT
infrastructure. This division now has a
portfolio of 10 services, from data backup
and IP telephony to hosting and other
network services, and is a fundamental part
of our long-term competitive strategy.
Despite difficult trading conditions in the IT
market, our distribution business has enjoyed
revenue growth in each of its geographic
territories. Distribution agreements with new
vendors and extensions to existing contracts
have contributed to this growth, with
particularly excellent results coming from
sales of security solutions in the UK and
Continental Europe.
In the final quarter of the year, we began
the distribution of network products, thus
providing a natural link between storage and
security and completing our IT infrastructure
offering.
InTechnology’s corporate objectives remain
consistent and clear – to offer a complete
range of products, solutions and services to
meet the IT challenges organisations face in
today’s network-based computing
environment. We also remain committed to
selling through the IT channel of resellers,
consultants and systems integrators.
Our strategy is serving us well and has put
the business in a strong position to meet the
challenges of the IT market in the year ahead. 
Finally, the energy, technical ability and
enthusiasm of our people never fails to
impress me and I would like to thank all our
staff, as well as our vendor and reseller
partners, for their contributions to
InTechnology in the last year.

Peter Wilkinson
Chief Executive Officer’s report
Overview
We are very pleased with the progress made
by the Group this year, characterised in
particular by significant revenue growth
across our Specialist Distribution business
and, latterly, by reaching monthly operating
profit (before amortisation of goodwill) in
our Managed Services division.
In a challenging trading environment, we
have seen our operating profit (before
amortisation of goodwill) increase to £4.4m
(2004 restated: £1.4m). Group operating loss
was reduced to £0.3m (2004 restated:
£3.0m). We have aggressive plans for future
revenue growth and increased profitability
and we have already restructured our sales
team, brought on board new vendors and,
with the intellectual property in the
business, developed our own service
technologies to support this objective. We
are confident that our strategy remains
sound and that we are on track to meet
market expectations of sustainable profit
before tax.
Managed Services
Our managed services portfolio allows
organisations to outsource specific areas of
IT infrastructure to free up valuable staff
resource, improve service levels, reduce
operational cost and deliver the flexibility to
scale the service according to business
requirements.
The Managed Services division has required
significant investment in the five years since
commencement, culminating this year in an
increase in sales revenue of 52% to £22.1m
(2004: £14.5m). In addition, the division has
moved into monthly operating profit (before
amortisation of goodwill) in the second half
of the year. This positive contribution is a
key factor in the significant reduction in
Group operating loss this year.
During the year, we have seen many new
long-term contracts from blue-chip and
public sector organisations including Jarvis
Rail plc, Balfour Beatty, T-Mobile, Wanadoo
and London Business School. This new
business, together with our existing customer
base, means we have grown our recurring
revenue stream to £23.2m (2004: £18.0m).
We are also delighted that 60% (2004: 58%)
of our customers take 2 or more of our
range of 10 managed services. We expect to
build on this trend with new services
launched during the last year and further
services to be launched in the new fiscal
year. These include:
• IP Voice Connect™: an IP telephony
service for business
• A new version of our successful VBAK®
data backup and recovery service aimed
at the SME market
• Data replication services for Network
Appliance and EMC products
Another major development is an exciting
partnership with IBM Business Continuity &
Recovery Services, which will see our VBAK®
service sold to IBM customers through their
UK sales network. We are already an IBM
Premier Business Partner for hardware and
software distribution and I expect this
extension of our long-standing relationship
to make a major contribution to sales
revenue next year. page 4
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
Specialist Distribution
Despite a difficult trading environment
throughout the IT market, in particular
pressure on margins from vendors and
customers, our Specialist Distribution
division has increased sales by: 
• 16% in the UK
• 73% in Continental Europe
Gross margins have, however, been squeezed
as pressures from vendors and customers
have intensified.
We have seen much success this year in the
Distribution market, including:
• A strong performance in sales of
Network Appliance solutions in the year -
we expect to see the growth continue
• Becoming Europe’s leading distributor of
CheckPoint
• Extending our storage agreement with
Sun Microsystems to Channel
Development Partner for the entire
product range including storage,
enterprise servers and mobile computing 
• Becoming recognised as one of the
leading distributors for Nokia secure
mobile connectivity solutions in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa (‘EMEA’)
Following our acquisition of the specialist
security distributor Allasso on 31 July 2003,
we have now completed the integration of
all its operations across Continental Europe,
maximising the efficiency of the business
with centralised logistics, consistent
processes and a single management
information system. These internal changes
are combined with a focus on developing
customer relationships on a pan-European
basis with large resellers.
We are particularly pleased that our security
expertise was recognised by Microsoft in Q4
when they chose InTechnology to help them
move into the European IT security market.
In a new partnership agreement with
Microsoft and Network Engines, we will be
distributing Microsoft ISA server software on
the Network Engines platform in a 12-
month exclusive agreement throughout the
UK and Continental Europe.
Also, with corporate networks struggling to
cope with exponential increases in network
traffic, we began distribution of network
solutions in H1 to exploit this expanding
market. Our experience in running our own
national ethernet network in the UK
(‘LANnet’) means we can leverage our
existing skills to deliver data networking,
WAN/LAN, VPN, ethernet switching and
wireless networks. To date, we have signed
distribution agreements to sell Nortel and
Juniper network products across the UK and
Continental Europe.
Finally, in June 2004, we acquired the trade
and assets of NetConnect Training from
NetConnect Limited for cash consideration of
£900,000 and contingent consideration to a
maximum of £100,000. The business is fully
integrated into the Group and operates under
the InTechnology name. As a result, we are
the UK’s leading provider of authorised
storage, security and internet training, and
the world’s largest CheckPoint, Nokia and
Clearswift authorised training provider.

Trading and operating performance
We achieved encouraging revenue growth
across all divisions, with Group turnover
increasing to £283.5m this year (2004
restated: £221.9m) 
• £198.2m (2004 restated: £170.8m) for the
UK specialist distribution division 
• £63.2m (2004: £36.6m) for the Continental
Europe specialist distribution division
• £22.1m (2004: £14.5m) for the Managed
Services division
However, against a background of gross
margin erosion across the industry, our UK
storage margins fell by 0.9% and security
solutions margins by 2.4% year-on-year. In
the European market, we experienced a 2.5%
drop in margins but nonetheless won
increased market share.
Meeting customer expectations
In the first half of the year, we carried out a
full review of our customers’ requirements
and have now implemented changes to our
organisational structure in order to meet
these needs and maximise our sales
opportunities.
Customer sales focus on the following:
• Developing the resellers’ market
opportunities from the full InTechnology
range of products, solutions and services.
• Maximising margins by reducing the cost
of sale
• Accelerating the speed at which the sale
is closed by the reseller
In support of customer sales, we have Vendor
teams to maintain our speciality and expertise
around our core competencies in Storage,
Data Management, Security and Networks.
A sea change in the
marketplace
We are experiencing a sea change in the IT
sales channel in relation to the market for
services; traditional reseller business models
which relied solely on sales of hardware to
established end user customers, are no longer
sustainable. End users increasingly want to
outsource parts of their IT infrastructure to
save cost and enable them to focus on their
own core IT objectives. As a result, we are
experiencing strong interest from major
channel reseller partners in our managed
services portfolio and see this as further
confirmation that our strategy is sound.
Outlook
We are optimistic about prospects for our
business in the year ahead. We are confident
that sales volumes can increase to counter
the pressures on gross margin within our
Specialist Distribution division.
The strong performance of these established
businesses, together with increased
recurring revenue streams and exciting
initiatives in our Managed Services division,
give me confidence in our prospects for
future growth and profitability.

Group 283.5 221.9 61.6 4.4 1.4 3.0 (0.3) (3.0) 2.7
Notes:
(i) EBITA comprises earnings before interest, taxation and amortisation of goodwill.
(ii) Distribution includes the Allasso European security software distribution business acquired on 31 July 2003 and
therefore the 2004 comparatives include its trading for 8 months of the year.
(iii) In 2004 a provision of £0.1m was made in respect of property lease commitments in relation to the closure of the
Group’s German subsidiary.
(iv) The 2004 results have been restated to reflect the revised revenue recognition accounting policy, see note 2 to the
financial statements.
UK Specialist Distribution
Turnover growth was the result of the full
year effect of the Allasso acquisition,
together with strong sales in both storage
and security products. Sales growth was also
driven by partnerships with new vendors
such as Network Appliance and fresh
initiatives with existing vendors.
In common with other IT distributors,
increased margin pressure particularly from
vendors contributed to a reduction in
divisional EBITA, a trend witnessed
throughout the marketplace.
In the second half year, the integration of
storage and security businesses was
completed to provide one UK distribution
sales force. The new sales structure is
enabling us to give the maximum priority to
customer satisfaction and offer our full
range of storage, security and network
products and services through 1 focal point. page 7
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
European Specialist
Distribution
Our European Specialist Distribution
business experienced significant revenue
growth, particularly in France and Spain. 
As in the UK, market pressures led to a
reduction in gross margins and hence we
failed to see the revenue gains feed through
to increased divisional EBITA.
We remain committed to expanding these
subsidiaries further by continuing to
increase the portfolio of security and other
network-centric products we offer.
Managed Services
Turnover increased by 52% to £22.1m (2004:
£14.5m) with a resultant increase in gross
margin. Tight control of operating costs
enabled us to see the improved margins feed
through to the bottom line with EBITA losses
significantly reduced to £2.0m (2004:
£7.8m). Indeed, in the second half year the
division achieved the key milestone of
monthly EBITA breakeven. Operating losses
were reduced to £4.3m (2004: £10.0m).
Goodwill
In accordance with FRS 11, we evaluated the
carrying value of the goodwill that arose
following the acquisition of the Allasso
group of companies on 31 July 2003. The
value in use has been derived from
discounted cash flow projections that cover
the 4 years from 1 April 2005. After this 4-
year period, the projections use a long-term
growth rate. Our confidence in the long-
term success of both our Specialist
Distribution division and Managed Services
division indicate that no impairment write
down is necessary this year.
Further to the acquisition of the Allasso
group of companies, based on current
projections we now estimate that an
additional €2,300,000 (£1,582,000 assuming
an exchange rate of £1 to €1.454) of
conditional consideration will become
payable by 31 July 2005 (see note 8 to the
financial statements).
Acquisition
On 18 June 2004, the Group acquired the
trade and assets of NetConnect Training
from NetConnect Limited for cash
consideration of £900,000 and contingent
consideration to a maximum of £100,000
(see note 20). The acquired business has now
been fully absorbed into the UK Specialist
Distribution business, to which it
contributed turnover of £1,260,000,
operating profit of £267,000 and operating
cash inflow of £159,000 during the year.
Revenue recognition
During the year we completed a
comprehensive review of our accounting
policy for revenue recognition in light of the
guidance provided by Application Note G, an
amendment to FRS 5. The review identified
instances where sales of equipment had
been recognised before we had fulfilled all
of our contractual obligations to the
customer. As a result, we have amended our
procedures such that we now only recognise
revenue on the sale of equipment when the
goods are received by the customer and page 8
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
when there are no unfulfilled obligations
that affect the customer’s final acceptance
of the equipment. Previously, revenue was
recognised on shipment of equipment to the
customer. This has resulted in a prior year
adjustment with 2004 comparatives 
restated accordingly (see note 2 to the
Financial Statements).
Cash flow and liquidity
The Group had a net cash outflow from
operating activities of £2.0m (2004: £3.5m
inflow). This was largely as a result of an
increase in working capital requirements as
we grew turnover in our European
subsidiaries and funded unusually high stock
levels with a major storage vendor.
Cash at bank and in hand at the year-end
was £10.5m (2003: £16.4m). However,
funding of working capital to support
European growth together with continuing
capital expenditure in our Managed Services
division contributed to an increase in net
debt to £22.2m (2004: £10.4m).
Taxation
The tax charge of £0.1m (2004 restated:
£0.8m) on the loss on ordinary activities
before taxation of £2.5m (2004 restated:
£4.1m) arises largely because goodwill
amortisation is not a taxable deduction. 
The year’s tax charge has also been reduced
by £0.9m (2004: £nil) due to the recognition
of deferred tax assets, largely in respect of
accelerated capital allowances (see note 
16 to the financial statements). A full
reconciliation of the tax charge is provided
in note 5 to the financial statements.
Financial instruments
The Group’s policy is that no trading in
financial instruments is undertaken. 
The Group’s financial instruments comprise
borrowings, cash and liquid resources and
various items that arise directly from its
operations. The main risks arising from these
are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and
foreign currency risk as the Group trades in
euro and US dollars. The remaining IBM loan
of €4,167,000 (£2,866,000 assuming an
exchange rate of £1 to €1.454) as explained
in note 15 to the financial statements
continues to act as a hedge against the euro
exposure arising from our investment in
Allasso Europe.
Current trading
InTechnology’s distribution marketplace
faces continued margin pressure and foreign
exchange volatility from fluctuations of the
US dollar to euro and sterling.
Having achieved an operating profit before
interest, tax and amortisation of goodwill on
a monthly basis in our Managed Services
division our challenge is to continue to grow
this business through further contract wins
and enhanced recurring revenue streams
which now stand at £23.2m per annum
(2004: £18.0m), by offering new services. 
I am confident our renewed customer focus,
new distributor agreements and ever
expanding portfolio of products and services
will improve both revenue and operating
profits in our distribution divisions both in
the UK and in Europe.

Technology review
The past year has seen a continued focus
on the introduction of new products and
services which offer genuine solutions to
real business IT issues especially in the key
growth areas of Business Continuity,
Network security, Voice over IP, Information
Lifecycle Management and IP convergence.
Organisations of all sizes are facing rapid
increases in their data volumes and
especially spiralling email volumes. In
addition, new regulations require that data
must be kept securely and made available
over longer periods into the future and
effective Information Lifecycle
management is now mandatory.
The ever-present threat of IT system failure
or malicious attack has meant that the need
for data security and business continuity
technology is stronger than ever. IT
departments are under pressure to
responsibly address these business
requirements as well as improving standards
of performance and reducing cost.
At the same time, convergence of data
storage, data security and networking
technologies offers major opportunities for
dramatic improvements and cost savings in
IT infrastructure deployment and we are
now seeing strong evidence of a
widespread shift towards Voice over IP
based telephony.
Our Managed Services have been extended
in scope and range, our core business in
data storage has been augmented with
new vendor technologies, new security and
software solutions have been introduced
and a network products business has been
launched to complete our range of
offerings for today’s networked business
environment.
With this substantially enhanced portfolio,
InTechnology is strongly positioned to
service these exciting growth market
opportunities.
Managed Services
InTechnology’s Managed Services enable
businesses to effectively outsource key but
non-core business IT functions on a ‘pay as
you go’ basis. 
Our automated back up (‘VBAK’) and data
replication services assure the integrity and
security of business critical data and
deliver business continuity benefits. The
quality of the technology has been
recognised with our appointment as IBM’s
first “Data Retention Centre of
Competence” in EMEA. As partners in IBM’s
Total Recovery Services framework and
their adoption of VBAK into the IBM
Business Continuity portfolio, InTechnology
is now able to market VBAK in association
with one of the world’s leading providers of
Business continuity services.
VBAK remains one of our core services and
has attracted many high-profile customers
in the past year, including distinguished
public sector organisations such as King’s
College, Birkbeck College and London
Business School in the University of London. 
Our advanced Data Centre technology for
secure data storage services has also been
recognised in a partnership with EMC
Centera for replication and storage of data
such as x-rays, voice archives, electronic
documents and email archives.
Convergence of network technologies
means that customers who currently
subscribe to our increasingly competitive
VPN, Internet access and Broadband
connectivity services have upgraded to
other Managed Services and 60% of these
customers now take at least two services
from us, a trend we confidently expect to
develop further with the introduction of
new layered IP services.
InTechnology Data Centre page 10
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
New services
We have three new additions to our
Managed Services portfolio – our IP Voice
Connect ™ service, a unique pay per usage
Information Lifecycle Management solution
and a VBAK variant for small and medium
sized businesses. 
The IP Voice Connect ™ service enables
organisations to implement reliable IP
telephony at significantly reduced
telecommunication costs and with
unparalleled user functionality. It is a
hosted, managed service which is layered
over InTechnology’s ethernet network.
Customers have the opportunity to
converge their voice and data networks
into one high-performance, scalable and
cost-effective network.
As organisations grapple with the allied
problems of growing data volumes and
compliance with data regulations,
InTechnology has developed the first
commercial pay as you go model for
Information Lifecycle Management,
providing a world-class policy engine and a
flexible set of storage options depending
on the importance of the data and likely
access requirements. 
We have extended the reach of the VBAK
managed backup service, incorporating new
technology that makes it suitable for the
typical data volumes and budgets of small
and medium size businesses.
Effective data management
As our customers seek new ways of
managing their growing data volumes
effectively, we have provided new
technologies to support them. Our core
data storage distribution business has
grown strongly, with notable development
in our partnership with Sun Microsystems.
In the past year, our partnership with
Network Appliance has proved very
successful, with growth in sales from zero
to £15 million marking the ready adoption
in the market of this advanced and
specialised technology, providing
centralised storage flexibly for open
network environments.
InTechnology Data Centre Control Room page 11
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
Software
Working in close partnership with IBM
Software, VERITAS, HP OpenView and KVS
(now part of VERITAS), we have provided a
range of new standalone and integrated
software solutions to help customers
improve efficiency and extract maximum
value from their data.
Success in our software business has been
underpinned by technical expertise in
consultancy, sales and training support – for
example, InTechnology was presented with
the award for UK VERITAS Top Enterprise
Master Reseller for the fourth consecutive
year by growing the licence revenue for
VERITAS software by 82% over 2003.
Security
Continued strong demand for our security
technology has reflected customer focus on
IT security with requirements for reliable
anti-virus, intrusion detection and firewall
solutions.
New solutions have been introduced to the
European security market, through
partnerships with leading IT security
vendors. An exclusive new pan-European
distribution partnership with Network
Engines and Microsoft ® will bring
innovative security appliances into the
European markets in which we trade.
Network Engines NS Series is a family of
security appliances powered by Microsoft
Internet Security and Acceleration Server
2004 (‘ISA’). Specifically designed to defend
Microsoft server assets, these appliances
provide customers with the best available
perimeter and application firewall
protection for critical Microsoft products
and services, including Microsoft Exchange
Server, Internet Information Services (‘IIS’)
and SharePoint® Portal Server. 
Increasing demands from customers for
wireless technology have led to our new
partnership with security specialists Ironport
to distribute the complete Ironport range of
email infrastructure products and services,
including world-class email security and
messaging gateway appliances. 
InTechnology - Software Consultancy page 12
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
Network products
As businesses increasingly adopt IT
networks to support their IT infrastructure,
we have launched a Network Solutions
division, developing and selling secure
networking solutions across Europe. Nortel
and Juniper are our partners in the new
division, adding high-speed data
networking, Ethernet switches and security
products to our portfolio. 
Our current portfolio demonstrates our
capability to understand, design and deliver
networking solutions - the new division
will draw on networking expertise from
both our Security and Managed Services
Divisions. 
The introduction of InTechnology Network
Solutions completes our proposition and
will ensure our Partners are able to address
the continuing convergence of Network,
Security, Voice and Storage infrastructures
as end-users increasingly look to buy a
complete solution from a single source.

interests
The Remuneration report is set out on pages

including the Directors’ statement on
responsibilities for the preparation of
financial statements, is set out on pages

Substantial shareholdings
At 29 June 2005, the Company had received
notification that the following are interested
in more than 3 per cent of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company:
Percentage of 
shares held
Peter Wilkinson 55.6%
Jon Wood 7.5%
Artemis Investment
Management Limited 7.0%
Andrew Kaberry 5.2%
Canada Life 4.1%
Going concern
Under company law, the Directors are
required to consider whether it is
appropriate to prepare financial statements
on the basis that the Company and Group
are going concerns. As part of its normal
business practice, budgets, cash flow
forecasts and longer term financial
projections are prepared and in reviewing
this information, the Directors are satisfied
that the Company and the Group have
adequate resources to enable them to
continue in business for the foreseeable
future. The Directors have therefore adopted
the going concern basis in the preparation
of the financial statements. page 17
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
Employees
The Group places considerable value on the
involvement of its employees and has
continued its practice of keeping them
informed of matters affecting them as
employees and the various factors affecting
the performance of the Group.
The Directors recognise that continued and
sustained improvement in the performance of
the Group depends on its ability to attract,
motivate and retain employees of the highest
calibre. Furthermore, the Directors believe
that the Group’s ability to sustain a
competitive advantage over the long term
depends in a large part on ensuring that all
employees contribute to the maximum of
their potential. The Group is committed to
improving the performance of all employees
through development and training.
The Group is an equal opportunity employer.
The Group’s policies seek to promote an
environment free from discrimination,
harassment and victimisation and to ensure
that no employee or applicant is treated less
favourably on the grounds of gender, marital
status, age, race, colour, nationality or
national origin, disability or sexual
orientation or is disadvantaged by
conditions or requirements, which cannot
objectively be justified. Entry into, and
progression within the Group, is solely
determined on the basis of work criteria and
individual merit.
The Group continues to give full and fair
consideration to applications for
employment made by disabled persons,
having regard to their respective aptitudes
and abilities. The policy includes, where
practicable, the continued employment of
those who may become disabled during
their employment and the provision of
training and career development and
promotion, where appropriate.
Share schemes
Share ownership is at the heart of the
Group’s remuneration philosophy and the
Directors believe that the key to the Group’s
future success lies in a motivated workforce
holding a stake in the Company. The
schemes are described in the Board’s
Remuneration report and details of the
options granted under the schemes are set
out in note 18 to the financial statements.
All permanent employees are eligible to join
the schemes.
Research and development
The Group continues to undertake research
and development of new products with the
objective of increasing future profitability.
The cost to the Group is charged to the
profit and loss account as incurred. page 18
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
Policy and practice on 
payment of creditors
It is the Group’s policy to agree terms and
conditions for its business transactions with
its suppliers. The Group seeks to abide by the
payment terms agreed with suppliers
whenever it is satisfied that the supplier has
provided the goods or services in accordance
with the agreed terms and conditions.
In the year ended 31 March 2005 average
creditor days for the Group and Company
were 31 days (2004: 38 days) and 33 days
(2004: 37 days) respectively.
Environment
The Group recognises the importance of
environmental responsibility. The nature of
its activities has a minimal effect on the
environment but where they do, the Group
acts responsibly and is aware of its
obligations at all times.
Annual General Meeting
The next AGM of the Company will be held
on 9 August 2005. Details of the business to
be proposed at the AGM are contained
within the Notice of Meeting, which is set
out on pages 58 and 59.

their willingness to continue in office and a
resolution proposing that they be
reappointed as independent auditors and
authorising the Directors to fix their
remuneration will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting.

Corporate governance
InTechnology plc is an AIM listed company
and is not therefore required to comply with
the Principles of Good Governance and Code
of Best Practice, the ‘FRC Combined Code on
Corporate Governance’ issued in 2003. The
following disclosures are made voluntarily.
Principles of Corporate
Governance
The Board recognises the value of good
corporate governance as a positive
contribution to the well being of the
business and believes in applying these
principles, (including those set out in Section
1 of the Combined Code), in a sensible and
pragmatic manner. 
Peter Wilkinson, as majority shareholder in
the Company, has signed an agreement
stating that he will not seek to influence the
Board by reason of his shareholding.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors consists of nine
members, including a non-Executive
Chairman and two other non-Executive
Directors.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer are separated and clearly defined.
The activities of the Group are controlled by
the Board, which meets throughout the year.
There is a formal schedule of matters
specifically reserved for the full Board’s
decision, together with a policy enabling
Directors to take independent advice in the
furtherance of their duties at the Group’s
expense. The Board programme is designed
so that Directors have regular opportunity to
consider the Group’s strategy, policies,
budgets, progress reports and financial
position and to arrive at a balanced
assessment of the Group’s position and
prospects.
The Board is assisted by the Company
Secretary, who provides a point of reference
and regular support for all Directors and
senior managers. He has responsibility for
ensuring that Board procedures are
followed, for establishing the Group’s
corporate governance policies and for
assisting the Board in facilitating
compliance by the Company with its legal
obligations.
The Board has appointed two standing
committees, which are as follows:
The Audit Committee
Comprises the two non-Executive Directors
and the non-Executive Chairman and is
chaired by Lord Parkinson. Its duties include
a comprehensive review of the annual and
interim financial statements before they are
presented to the Board for approval. The
Audit Committee meets at least twice a year
to review the findings of the external
auditors, key accounting policies and
judgements. It has unrestricted access to the
Company’s auditors.
The Remuneration Committee
Comprises the two non-Executive Directors
and the non-Executive Chairman and is
chaired by Joe McNally. It meets at least
once a year and is responsible for making
recommendations to the Board on
remuneration policy for Executive Directors
and for setting salaries, incentive payments
and share options granted. page 20
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
Relations with shareholders
The Company seeks to ensure that all
shareholders are kept informed about the
Company and its activities. A comprehensive
annual report and accounts and an interim
report are sent to shareholders and there is
frequent dialogue with institutional
investors, including presentations following
the preliminary and interim announcements.
The Annual General Meeting is a forum for
shareholders’ participation with the
opportunity to meet and question Board
members including the non-Executive
Chairman and the Chairmen of the Board
committees.
Internal control
The Board of Directors acknowledges its
overall responsibility for the Company’s
systems of internal control and for monitoring
their effectiveness. The Board has control over
strategic, financial and compliance issues and
has introduced a structure of responsibility
with appropriate levels of authority. The Board
as a whole has continued to review the
effectiveness of the Company’s systems of
internal control annually.
The Company’s Directors and varying levels
of management have clear responsibilities in
ensuring that the control environment
operates efficiently. Clear lines of
responsibility are developed through the
Company’s organisation structure. Ethical
policies are communicated through all forms
of personnel training and via appropriate
procedures, in establishing a code of ethics.
Although no system of internal control can
provide absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss, the Company’s
systems are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that problems are identified on a
timely basis and are dealt with appropriately.
The principal features of the Company’s
internal financial control structures can be
summarised as follows:
a. Preparation of budgets and forecasts
approved by the Board.
b. Monthly management accounts,
showing comparisons of actual results
against budget and prior year results,
are reviewed by the Board. Variances
from budget are thoroughly
investigated and discussed at monthly
Board meetings. Where lapses in
internal control are detected, these are
rectified.
c. The Company’s cash flow is also
monitored monthly compared to
forecast.
d. The Board authorises capital
expenditure where this is significant.
The Board has continued to enhance its risk
control programme, in particular, those
elements which relate to ensuring that risk
reviews are formally embedded in control
systems rather than being the subject of
formal annual reviews. page 21
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
Statement of Directors’
responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to
prepare financial statements for each
financial year that give a true and fair view
of the state of affairs of the Company and
the Group as at the end of the financial year
and of the profit or loss of the Group for
that year.
The Directors confirm that suitable
accounting policies have been used and
applied consistently as explained on pages
32 and 33 under the heading ‘Accounting
policies’ with the exception of the change in
accounting policy relating to income
recognition on pages 32 and 33. They also
confirm that reasonable and prudent
judgements and estimates have been made
in preparing the financial statements for the
year ended 31 March 2005, that applicable
accounting policies have been followed and
that the financial statements have been
prepared on the going concern basis.
The Directors are responsible for keeping
proper accounting records that disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and the
Group and to enable them to ensure that
the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of
the Company and the Group and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the
InTechnology website is the responsibility of
the Directors; the work carried out by the
auditors does not involve consideration of
these matters and, accordingly, the auditors
accept no responsibility for any changes
that may have occurred to the financial
statements since they were initially
presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors’ remuneration
Remuneration of non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the non-Executive

the assistance of independent advice
concerning comparable organisations and
appointments. The non-Executive Directors
do not take part in discussions on their

pension or other benefits from the Group,
nor did they participate in any of the bonus
schemes.
The non-Executive Chairman and Directors
have interests in share options as disclosed
on page 25.
Remuneration of Executive Directors
The main aim of the Company’s Executive
pay policy is to secure the skills and
experience needed to meet its strategic
business objectives. Furthermore, the
Company aims to align the interests of all
employees as closely as possible with the
interests of shareholders through share-
based incentives.
The Company’s Remuneration Committee
decides the remuneration policy that applies
to Executive Directors. In setting the policy it
considers a number of factors including:
(a) The basic salaries and benefits available
to Executive Directors of comparable
companies.
(b) The need to attract and retain Directors
of an appropriate calibre.
(c) The need to ensure Executive Directors’
commitment to the continued success
of the Group by means of incentive
schemes.
The Company’s remuneration policy is to:
(a) Have regard to the Directors’ experience
and the nature and complexity of their
work in order to pay a competitive
salary that attracts and retains
management of the highest quality.
(b) Link individual remuneration packages
to the Group’s long term performance
through the award of share options
and incentive schemes.
(c) Provide post retirement benefits
through defined contribution pension
schemes.
(d) Provide employment-related benefits
including the provision of a company
car, (or car allowance), fuel, medical
and life insurance and insurance
relating to the Directors’ duties. page 23

Salaries
The Remuneration Committee meets at least
once a year in order to consider and set the
annual salaries for Executive Directors,
having regard to the needs of the Company,
individual responsibilities, personal
performance and independently compiled
salary survey information.
Pensions (audited)
The Executive Directors are members of
defined contribution pension schemes, the
assets of which are held independently of
the Company. The amounts contributed by
the Company (based on salaries excluding
bonuses) for the year ended 31 March 2005
were £60,000 (2004: £57,000). The Company
does not provide any other post-retirement
benefits to the Directors.

service that can be terminated by the
Company with the following notice periods:
Peter Wilkinson 12 months
Andrew Kaberry 6 months
Richard James 12 months
Steve Pearce 6 months
Bryn Sage 6 months
John Swingewood 12 months
With the exception of the contracts with
Richard James and John Swingewood, if the
Company terminates the contract by notice
but other than on giving full notice, the
contracts of service provide for the payment
of a fixed amount equal to the salary and
other contractual benefits for the unexpired
portion of the appointment or entitlement
to notice, as the case may be.
Non-Executive Directorships
The Remuneration Committee believes that
the Group can benefit from Executive
Directors accepting appointments as non-
Executive directors of other companies. The
Director concerned may retain any fees
related to such employment. page 24

29 June 2005 Independent auditors’ report to the 
members of InTechnology plc
page 26
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005
For the year ended
31 March 2005
We have audited the financial statements
which comprise the consolidated profit
and loss account, consolidated statement
of total recognised gains and losses,
reconciliation of movements in Group
shareholders’ funds, balance sheets,
consolidated cash flow statement,
accounting policies and the related notes.
Respective responsibilities of
Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for
preparing the annual report and the
financial statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards are set out in the
statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial
statements in accordance with the
relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. This report, including the
opinion, has been prepared for and only
for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this
opinion, accept or assume responsibility
for any other purpose or to any other
person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the financial statements give a
true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to
you if, in our opinion, the Directors’
report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or
if information specified by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and transactions
is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained
in the Annual Report and consider the
implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. The other information
comprises only the Chairman’s
introduction, Chief Executive Officer’s
report, the Financial review, the
Technology review, the Management
Team, the Directors’ Report, the Corporate
Governance report and the Remuneration
report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance
with Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. It also includes
an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the Directors in
the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the
Company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so
as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements
are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements
give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group as
at 31 March 2005 and of the loss and
cash flows of the Group for the year then
ended and have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable Accounting
Standards in the United Kingdom. A summary of the main accounting policies which have been applied consistently
(except in respect of revenue recognition, see below for further details) is set out as follows:
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention modified to include the
revaluation of certain fixed assets.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the financial statements of the company and its
subsidiary undertakings up to 31 March. The results of subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated profit and
loss account from the date on which control passes. Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, its assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values.
All gains and losses that arise after the group has gained control of the subsidiary are included in the post acquisition
profit and loss account.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of
the identifiable net assets acquired and is amortised through the profit and loss account over its useful economic life. The
Directors have assessed the estimated useful economic life of goodwill at 20 years from date of acquisition based on the
strengths of the underlying businesses and projected future market growth. The Directors review the level of goodwill for
impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Tangible fixed assets
The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost with the exception of freehold land & buildings (which are held at
valuation), together with any incidental expenses of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the cost of tangible fixed assets less their estimated residual values, on a
straight line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this
purpose are:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold improvements 20%
Office fixtures and fittings 10% to 50%
Vehicles and computer equipment 20% to 50%
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Surpluses arising on the revaluation of tangible fixed assets are credited to a revaluation reserve. On subsequent disposal
of a revaluated asset, the revaluation surplus relating to this asset is transferred to the profit and loss account reserve.
The Directors review tangible fixed assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provisions are made for obsolete, slow-moving and
defective items where appropriate.
Revenue recognition
Previously the Group recognised revenue on the outright sale of equipment and software on invoice at the time of
despatch. In the light of guidance provided by Application Note G, an amendment to FRS 5, the Group has amended its
accounting policy. The Group now only recognises revenue on the sale of equipment when the goods are received by the 
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 page 33
Accounting policies (continued)
customer and when there are no unfulfilled obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the equipment. The
adoption of this revised accounting policy has resulted in a prior year adjustment, further details of which are provided in
note 2.
Service revenues are recognised over the period to which the service relates.
Unrecognised service revenue and associated cost of sale is included as deferred income and deferred cost respectively in
the balance sheet.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the
balance sheet date.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The assets and
liabilities of such undertakings are translated at year end exchange rates. Any resulting exchange differences are taken to
reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. Exchange differences arising on
borrowings in foreign currency financing overseas investments are taken to reserves to the extent they offset exchange
differences in the investment.
All other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Lease agreements
Finance lease arrangements, which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset,
are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright. The assets are included in fixed assets and the capital element of
the finance leases is shown as obligations under finance leases. The finance lease rentals are treated as consisting of
capital and interest elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element
is charged to the profit and loss account in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding. Assets held under
finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Deferred taxation
Full provision is made for deferred taxation resulting from timing differences between profits computed for taxation
purposes and profits stated in the financial statements to the extent that there is an obligation to pay more tax or right to
pay less tax, in the future as a result of the reversal of those timing differences. Deferred tax is not provided where a
timing difference arises from the revaluation of fixed assets for which there is no binding agreement to sell.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be recoverable in the
foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure is written off to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Pension costs
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees and directors. The assets of the scheme are
held separately from those of the Company. The annual contributions payable are charged to the profit and loss account.
The Company provides no other post-retirement benefits to its employees and directors.
Share schemes
The Group grants share options to employees and directors on a discretionary basis. The scheme is ‘unapproved’ and all
employees have agreed in writing to accept liability for any National Insurance contributions that become due on exercise
of options.
Debt issue costs
Debt issue costs are capitalised and offset against the loans to which they relate. The costs are amortised over the term of
the loan.

The acquisition of the trade and assets of NetConnect Training (included in the above tables) contributed £1,260,000 of
turnover, £305,000 of operating profit before goodwill amortisation and £267,000 of operating profit after goodwill
amortisation to the Specialist Distribution division in the period following completion of the acquisition on 18 June 2004.
The net operating cash inflows have not been disclosed since they were not significant.

2 Prior year adjustment
During the year, the Group has completed a comprehensive review of its accounting policy for revenue recognition in light
of the guidance provided by Application Note G, an amendment to FRS 5. The review identified instances where sales of
equipment have been recognised before the Group has fulfilled all of its contractual obligations to the customer. As a
result, the Group has amended its procedures such that it now only recognises revenue on the sale of equipment when
the goods are received by the customer and when there are no unfulfilled obligations that affect the customer’s final
acceptance of the equipment. Previously, revenue was recognised on shipment of equipment to the customer.
The cumulative effect of the changes relating to previous years has been recognised in the results as a prior year
adjustment and comparative figures have been restated in accordance with the revised accounting policy. The effects of
the changes on turnover, cost of sales, gross margin and the tax charge for the year ended 31 March 2004 are summarised
as follows:
Turnover Cost of Gross Tax
sales margin charge
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000

Restated 221,868 (181,331) 40,537 (809)
The net effect of the change in policy in the year ended 31 March 2004 is to reduce turnover by £1,641,000, reduce gross
margin by £266,000, reduce the tax charged on loss on ordinary activities by £80,000 and increase the loss sustained for
the financial year by £186,000.
The net effect of the change in policy in the year ended 31 March 2005 is to increase turnover by £3,823,000, increase
gross margin by £535,000, increase the tax charged on loss on ordinary activities by £160,700 and reduce the loss
sustained for the financial year by £374,300.
The cumulative effect of implementing the revised policy is to reduce Group reserves at 31 March 2004 by £753,000,
summarised as follows:

6 Loss of the holding company
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented in
these financial statements. The parent Company’s loss for the year ended 31 March 2005 was £2,388,000 (2004 restated:
£5,150,000).
7 Loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of £2,575,000 (2004 restated:
£4,889,000) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 139,575,879 (2004:
138,245,916).
The adjusted basic loss per share has been calculated to provide a better understanding of the underlying performance of
the Group as follows:
2005 2004
Basic and diluted Basic and diluted
(Loss) / (Loss) / (Loss) / (Loss) /
earnings earnings earnings earnings
per share per share
(Restated) (Restated)
£’000 pence £’000 pence
Loss attributable to ordinary shareholders (2,575) (1.84) (4,889) (3.54)
Amortisation of goodwill 4,635 3.32 4,403 3.19
Adjusted basic earnings / (loss) per share 2,060 1.48 (486) (0.35)
The loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of
calculating the diluted earnings per ordinary share are identical to those used for basic earnings per ordinary share. This is
because the exercise of share options would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and is therefore not
dilutive under the terms of FRS 14 “Earnings per share” .

The freehold land and buildings occupied by the Company were revalued by external valuers, King Sturge LLP, at 31 March
2005 on the basis of existing use value, in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors in the United Kingdom.
The valuation has been incorporated into the financial statements and the resulting revaluation adjustments have been
taken to the revaluation reserve. The revaluation resulted in a surplus of £1,754,000 (note 19).
No deferred tax is provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets unless, by the balance sheet
date, a binding commitment to sell the asset has been entered into and it is unlikely that any gain will be rolled over.

On 1 November 2003 the trade and net assets of Allasso UK Limited were transferred to InTechnology plc at book value,
following which the net investment held by InTechnology in Allasso UK Limited was £10,800,000. As the trade of Allasso
UK Limited was transferred to InTechnology, the value of the investment held was only supported by the net assets and
future cash flows of Allasso UK Limited’s trading subsidiaries, Allasso GmbH and Allasso Benelux bv. Since the transfer
does not impair the future profitability of the Company £949,000 (2004: £8,000,000) has been transferred from
investments to goodwill in the InTechnology company balance sheet. This represents the additional conditional
consideration that the directors now estimate will become payable (note 8).
Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost.

15 Financial instruments
The main financial risks faced by the Group include interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The Board
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, liquid resources and various items, such as debtors and creditors that
arise directly from its operations. It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading
in financial instruments shall be undertaken. The year end position reflects these policies and there have been no changes
in policies or risks since the year end.
Although the Group has net debt of £22,200,000, £12,325,000 has been agreed at a fixed rate of interest of 8% thus
reducing the levels of interest rate exposure. Group policy is to continue to monitor financial markets and to repay
outstanding loans in line with agreed repayment schedules.
Financial asset returns are maximised by ongoing review of the Group’s cash flow requirements. Any funds surplus to
short-term working capital requirements are placed on interest bearing deposit.
InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 page 47
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
15 Financial instruments (continued)
Liquidity risk is further managed by agreeing separate borrowing facilities for any additional working capital and
investment requirements. In accordance with this policy, the Group has negotiated a sterling invoice discounting facility of
£26,728,000 with IBM, of which £14,953,000 was used as at 31 March 2005. This facility is provided on a rolling basis and
is subject to 60 days notice by either party.
Short term trade debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures with the exception of the
Currency exposure analysis.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets
The interest rate profile of the financial assets of the Group comprise cash of £10,488,000 as follows:
Currency Floating Rate

The sterling, US dollar and euro financial assets relate to cash at bank and bear interest based on GBP LIBOR, US Dollar
LIBOR and EURIBOR respectively. There are no fixed rate financial assets (2004: £nil).
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities
The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group is as follows:

InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 page 48
15 Financial instruments (continued)
Deferred shares are excluded from the ‘weighted average period to maturity on which no interest is paid’ calculation as
there is no specified maturity date.
Financial liabilities include secured loan arrangements with IBM and Peter Wilkinson and finance leases and are detailed in
note 14. The floating rate sterling and Euro loans bear interest by reference to GBP LIBOR and EURIBOR respectively and
are repayable as set out in note 14.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it. The undrawn committed facilities available as at 31 March, in
respect of which all conditions have been met at that date, were as follows:
2005 2004
£’000 £’000
Expiring within one year 11,774 4,669
Non-equity shares
A proportion of the Group’s share capital is attributable to non-equity interests, in the form of deferred shares of 1p each.
The rights and restrictions attaching to the deferred shares are described in note 18 to the financial statements.
Fair value
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between
informed and willing parties, other than by a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest. The fair values of
financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2005 approximate to the book value at those dates based on comparison
with similar instruments available from alternative providers.
Currency exposure
The Group seeks to mitigate the effects of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas by borrowing
as far as possible in the same currencies as the operating currencies of its main operating units. Gains and losses arising
on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the
statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their
local currency. Foreign exchange differences on translation of earnings are taken to the profit and loss account of the Group.

Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which
timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet dates.
The deferred tax asset is included in debtors and is analysed as follows:
Group Amount recognised Amount not recognised
2005 2004 2005 2004
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 969 - - 410

Short term timing differences 136 210 - -
Losses carried forward - - 892 892
1,105 210 892 1,302
In addition, in the light of medium term forecasts prepared, the Group does not at present consider it more likely than not
that suitable taxable profits will be available to offset the losses carried forward, hence no deferred tax asset has been
recognised in respect of losses carried forward. In accordance with FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’, the Directors will continue to
assess whether deferred tax assets should be recognised in respect of these items.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on revalued property. The tax on the gains arising would only become
payable if the property were sold without rollover relief being available. The tax which would be payable under such
circumstances is estimated to be £526,000 (2004: £nil). These assets are expected to be used in the continuing operations
of the business and, therefore, no tax is expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.

The number of allotted, called up and fully paid shares increased in the year as the Company issued 2,696,948 shares
(2004: 313,478 shares) in respect of the exercise of employee share options.
Deferred shares differ to ordinary shares in that they do not entitle the holder to receive any dividend or other
distribution; do not entitle the holder to vote at any general meeting of the Company; do entitle the holder on a winding
up to repayment of amounts paid only after payment in respect of each Ordinary Share of the capital paid up and a
further payment of £10,000 on each Ordinary Share and are treated as non-equity shares.

20 Acquisition

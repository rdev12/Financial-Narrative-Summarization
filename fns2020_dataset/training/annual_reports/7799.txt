Ilika at a glance
Ilika’s unique process is far quicker and more efficient than traditional materials 
discovery processes. 
Ilika uses high-throughput, or combinatorial, techniques which involve the rapid 
synthesis of a large number of different structurally related materials  
in a few automated steps.
How we generate growth
Early	 engagement	 	
of	 large	 multinational	
partners	 which	 	
co-	 fund	 the	 route	 to	
commercialisation
Rapid	 discovery	 of

Our key differentiators
High throughput materials discovery
>  10–100x faster and more reliable than traditional discovery methods
>  Creates output equivalent to 100s of individual materials
> Unique patent-protected platform
>  Rapid identification of materials suitable for industrial scale-up
Combinatorial synthesis
Ilika’s High Throughput Physical 
Vapour Deposition (‘HT-PVD’) facility 
can deposit large numbers of films 
of different composition in one 
automated experimental run. The 
deposition of all elements occurs 
simultaneously and the composition 
profile can be carefully varied across 
the substrate in a controlled manner.
Characterisation/screening
Large numbers of samples are 
screened and characterised using 
automated, high throughput 
techniques. Unique sample 
arrays allow the many different 
compositions synthesised to be 
analysed in a rapid manner for 
specific, sought-after, behaviours.
Informatics
A range of specialised, 
in-house software controls the 
instrumentation associated with 
our workflows and also enables 
the rapid, simultaneous collection 
of large datasets which are then 
processed, analysed and presented 
so that meaningful conclusions 
about material properties can  
be drawn. 03

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
 > In most developed countries, 1/3 
of total domestic energy demand 
is required for transport 
applications
 > Hydrocarbons used for transport 
fuel have an attractive energy 
density, making them difficult to 
replace with low-carbon 
alternatives
 > Battery technology is the most 
widely used method of storing 
low-carbon portable energy, 
currently mainly in consumer 
electronics, but also to an 
increasing extent for hybrid and 
electric vehicles.
QUESTION
How much energy can a battery hold?
The most widely sold batteries are the 
lead-acid batteries used to power 
start-motors in motor cars. These hold 
60–75 Wh/L (watt-hours per litre, or 
energy per standard volume), which is 
about 1/100th of the energy contained 
in a similar volume of petrol or diesel. 
Lithium-ion batteries can pack more 
energy into the same volume and hold 
about four times the amount of energy 
stored in the same volume of lead acid 
battery, but this is still only about 
1/25th of the energy stored in the 
same volume of hydrocarbon. 
QUESTION
Are batteries safe to use in a car?
There have been incidents of batteries 
catching fire in consumer electronics, 
electric vehicles and, in the full glare of 
publicity, in high profile new aircraft. 
Although these incidents are rare, they 
are very costly for manufacturers 
because of the damage to corporate 
reputation, the cost of product recall 
and the loss of market share. There are 
many more vehicle fires due to petrol 
tanks exploding during accidents  
and engines catching fire, but car 
manufacturers are keen to go to 
extreme lengths to ensure the safety 
of batteries in hybrid and electric 
vehicles. This is one of the principal 
reasons for Toyota’s interest in solid-
state battery technology.
QUESTION
How can the capacity of a battery  
be improved?
The amount of energy that can be 
contained in a battery can only  
be significantly improved by changing 
the materials from which the battery  
is made. A battery is a package of cells 
controlled by a battery management 
system. Each cell is a sealed unit 
containing two electrodes in a 
common electrolyte, usually separated 
by a polymer separator. Much of the 
development work related to batteries 
is concerned with the improvement of 
the ability of the electrode materials to 
hold charge, which defines the capacity 
of the battery. Solid-state batteries can 
also result in higher energy densities  
by replacing the separator and liquid 
electrolyte with a thin solid electrolyte. 
QUESTION
What will batteries look like in  
the future?
Substantial progress has been made in 
recent years in the miniaturisation of 
batteries since the commercialisation 
of lithium-ion batteries. However, the 
term 'lithium-ion' is an umbrella term 
covering many different material types. 
Work is still ongoing to refine and 
improve lithium-ion technology. Ilika is 
working on these improvements with 
some of the world’s leading materials 
suppliers and battery manufacturers. 
However, orders of magnitude 
improvements in battery capacity will 
only be achieved by radical new 
concepts such as lithium-air designs, 
which are currently in their infancy. 05

Market for lithium-ion batteries
The 2012 market size for lithium-ion 
batteries was $11 billion, with growth 
largely driven by portable consumer 
electronics. In 2012, many of the  
hybrid electric vehicle manufacturers 
switched from nickel metal hydride 
technology to lithium-ion batteries. 
This switch has given new impetus  
to the market growth because even  
a small market for hybrid and electric 
vehicles will be a very large market  
for batteries.
Lithium-ion supply chain
Japan’s dominance of the lithium-ion 
battery market peaked in 2000, when 
85 percent of lithium-ion batteries 
were produced there. Since then China 
and, more rapidly, Korea, have been 
gaining market share. In 2012, Korean 
companies held about 40 percent of 
the market while Japanese companies 
held 36 percent, with China holding 
the rest. The growth of the market has 
attracted large chemical companies 
from around the world, including the 
US and Europe, to the supply chain. 
Customer relationships
Ilika now has customer relationships 
with materials manufacturing 
companies, battery manufacturers and 
automotive original equipment 
manufacturers ('OEMs'). Toyota has 
sold by far the most hybrid vehicles 
through the success of its Prius model, 
and is regarded by the industry as the 
leader in this sector. Ilika has had a very 
productive commercial relationship 
with Toyota since 2008 and holds joint 
patents on some of the novel materials 
and production methods that have 
been jointly invented.
IP commercialisation
In 2012 Ilika secured a £4.6 million 
placing to commercialise the jointly-
held IP in solid-state batteries. Since 
then, Ilika has made strong progress 
with the selection and testing of 
optimum material combinations, the 
deposition of active electrochemical 
cell structures and testing of cell 
performance. Grant funding for the 
scale-up facility has been secured, 
creating a clear pathway for 
prototyping and technology transfer  
to a manufacturing partner.

Chairman
Chairman’s  
statement
These are our third set of full year results as a public company. 
During the year we have seen significant operational progress 
with our IP development programmes and this is outlined in 
the Chief Executive’s review. We also experienced a number of 
challenges during the period, including delays with a number of 
potential contracts and the decision by Energizer to close one of 
its business units, which impacted on our development 
collaboration. This has been reflected in the reduced revenues 
for the Company and has, no doubt, had a significant impact on 
our share price.
Notwithstanding the above, we believe that the Company’s 
strong relationships with existing development partners should 
mean that contracts which were delayed in 2013 will be 
converted or replaced in 2014. Furthermore, the Company 
generated a significant number of new leads with major 
companies during the period. This should allow us to continue 
to broaden our commercial pipeline, further diversify our global 
customer base and deliver significant financial growth over the 
coming years. 09

Disposal of non-core wound care 
business
In December 2012 we disposed of our 
wound care operations allowing us to 
focus on our core activities of developing 
energy conversion and storage materials. 
This resulted in a reduction in overheads 
and the discontinued revenues in the  
7 months to 30 December 2012  
of £0.10 million (2012: £0.16 million) 
which are not included in the reported 
figures below. I would also like to thank  
Dr. Werner Braun, who has been a 
Director of Ilika since May 2007 , for his 
contribution to the Company over the 
years. Dr. Braun, who has extensive 
experience in the medical device sector, 
has stepped down at the end of his fixed 
term in office following the disposal  
of Altrika.
Financial results 
In line with the guidance provided in our 
statement from 16 April 2013, revenues 
from continuing operations for the year 
ended 30 April 2013 fell to £1.00 million 
(2012: £1.85 million), for the reasons 
explained above. Revenue in the year 
does not include any grant income  
(2012: £0.17 million) as the Carbon Trust 
funding was provided as a direct equity 
investment of £0.15 million rather than 
as a grant. 
Gross profit reduced to £0.44 million 
(2012: £0.81 million) and with 
administrative expenses increasing  
to £4.0 million (2012: £3.4 million) as  
a result of increased research and 
development activities, and zero grant 
income (2012: £0.17 million), we 
recorded an increased loss before tax on 
continuing operations of £3.5 million 
(2012: £2.4 million), resulting in a loss per 
share of 0.07p (2012: Loss of 0.07p).
Cash
As at 30 April 2013, the Group’s cash 
position was £1.9 million (2012: £5.3 
million). Post period end, we raised an 
additional £709,000 through a share 
placing which, coupled with securing and 
commencing a number of contracts with 
customers presently being finalised will 
provide sufficient cash to fund our 
requirements for the foreseeable future. 
Additionally, this placing has improved 
our shareholder register with new 
investors whose investment horizons are 
better aligned with our long-term 
corporate objectives.
Outlook
Although last year’s financial results did 
not meet market expectations, the new 
financial year has already seen the 
conversion of one of the delayed 
contracts and we hope to see other 
opportunities convert throughout the 
year. Whilst development work in Japan 
remains the largest contributor to 
revenues and we are encouraged by a 
strong pipeline of opportunities through 
our recently appointed business 
development director based in Frankfurt, 
Germany, as well as further 
opportunities in the US.
The development of our solid-state 
battery technology, co-developed with 
Toyota, for man-portable applications 
has progressed through the first phase  
of the programme in-line with our 
expectations and we have submitted a 
proposal to the US army for the funding 
of technology to full development  
and whilst this assessment process is 
ongoing we are also exploring additional 
commercial support for the technology 
in the consumer electronics and 
automotive sectors.
Finally I would like to thank the staff and 
Board for their hard work over the last 
year and their undoubted contribution to 
the growth of the business. I look forward 
to reporting on the developments of the 
Group over the coming year.

materials
This year has been one in which Ilika’s 
portfolio of technology and intellectual 
property ('IP') has matured in a number 
of key markets around the globe.  
The company’s IP can be divided into  
2 broad categories: 1) its platform 
technology for high throughput 
materials development and 2) the  
IP defining the materials, which have 
been developed using that platform.  
At the start of our last financial year,  
in May 2012, the Company received 
confirmation that its patent 
applications covering its core PVD 
patents had been granted in the US, 
Canada and Japan. The PVD technology 
was originally developed at the 
University of Southampton prior to the 
spin out of the Company in 2004. This 
technology has underpinned much of 
the materials innovation which the 
Company has undertaken since its 
formation and still provides the means 
by which the majority of the new 
materials being developed are initially 
made. Hence, in securing granted 
patents for this technology, the 
Company has secured the foundations 
for continued future growth.
The Company considers its core 
technology in high-throughput 
techniques to be a key differentiator 
from other providers of materials 
innovation. Ilika monetises this core 
technology through the development 
of the materials developed using that 
platform. Hence, continued progress 
made in securing IP, which defines  
the materials generated using the 
platform, and commercialising those 
materials is important to the Company. 
This past year has seen important 
milestones achieved across the 
Company’s portfolio, but particularly  
in the key area of energy storage  
and conversion.
The energy conversion materials, which 
are the most mature in Ilika’s portfolio, 
include the low-cost fuel cell electrode 
materials. Reducing the cost of fuel cell 
technology is widely acknowledged as 
a key priority for enabling its adoption 
for both transport and stationary 
applications. Ilika’s materials are 
suitable for use in so-called PEM fuel 
cells, which are of primary interest to 
transport applications. PEM fuel cell 
technology is also being used for 
stationary power applications, 
particularly for domestic power in 
Japan. 40 percent of the cost of a PEM 
fuel cell stack is currently associated 
with the use of platinum as the 
electrocatalyst. Platinum is a scarce 
precious metal and therefore its price 
is sensitive to supply and demand 
pressures. In 2012, the price of 
platinum varied between £28 and 
£35/g. At a typical loading of 11 g/kW, 
this means that an 80 kW fuel cell, 
which might be suitable for a small car, 
requires £2,500–£3,000 of platinum.  
In comparison, the total cost of buying 
an internal combustion engine lies  
in the range £500–£1,000. Ilika’s 
electrocatalysts cost 1/3 of the price, 
on a $/kW basis, of platinum-based 
equivalents. In September 2012,  
Ilika received a ca. £150,000 equity 
investment from the Carbon Trust  
to allow Ilika to complete the 
commercialisation of this technology. 
Since then, Ilika’s patents covering its 
technology have been granted in the 
US and Japan. In addition, Ilika’s 
development partner, ITRI of Taiwan, 
has delivered the first 1 kg of the 
catalyst for testing, primarily with 
OEMs in US and Japan, where Ilika has 
strong patent coverage. Materials 
transfer agreements have been put in 
place and initial samples have been 
made available for confirmatory 
testing at the OEMs. Initial feedback is 
encouraging and further testing is 
expected in this financial year.
In April 2012 Ilika announced that it 
had completed an equity round to fund 
the co-development of its solid-state 
battery technology, which it had 
co-developed with Toyota. Technical 
progress through Phase I of its 
development programme has been  
as expected, with optimisation of 
cell-based data continuing. An open 
channel of communication has been 
maintained with the US army, who 
expressed a strong interest in 
accessing this technology for man-
portable applications. Ilika is also 
pursuing commercial support for the 
technology from the consumer 
electronics and automotive sector.  12
Ilika plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Chief Executive’s 
review continued
Toyota is actively supporting Ilika 
within the automotive sector by 
co-presenting in June 2013 at a 
technology summit, the Advanced 
Automotive Battery Conference  
in Strasbourg.
An important streamlining of the 
business was completed in the last 
financial year. In December 2012, Ilika’s 
wholly-owned biomedical subsidiary, 
Altrika, was disposed of. The transaction 
involved the transfer of the cell-based 
burns treatment products Myskin®  
and Cryoskin® as well as the staff  
and facilities in Sheffield. The high-
throughput polymer platform was 
retained and operations were 
consolidated in Southampton. The 
transaction had a net positive effect 
on Ilika’s balance sheet and allowed 
Ilika to focus on its activities in the 
energy and electronics sector. At the 
end of his term as Non-Executive 
Director, Dr. Werner Braun, stepped 
down from Ilika’s Board in June 2013. 
Dr. Braun has particular expertise in 
the marketing of medical devices 
through his executive role at Biotronik.
The split of Ilika’s revenues across the 
globe continues to have an emphasis  
in Japan, with 78 percent coming from 
Japan, 9 percent from US and 13 
percent from Europe. In 2012, deal 
timelines and conversion rates 
deteriorated, causing the drop in 
reported revenues initially flagged in 
Ilika’s trading update in April 2013. 
Since then, the policy of quantitative 
easing pursued in Japan appears to 
have renewed corporate confidence, 
leading to an improved robustness in 
commercial outlook. Ilika’s core 
customer base has continued to renew 
relationships, as demonstrated by the 
contract renewals announced in 
December 2012 and February 2013. 
Further renewals of these relationships 
are expected in 2013. The Company 
has expectations of growth of the 
contribution of revenues from both  
the USA and Europe. The front end of 
the emerging opportunities in Europe 
was shown by the announcement of  
a new customer in the field of battery 
materials optimisation in April 2013. 
The need for improved energy storage 
and conversion continues to be  
a strong business driver for Ilika,  
which fits well with the Company’s 
core capabilities in being able to  
deliver optimised materials within  
accelerated timelines.

to 13 percent from  
1 percent in 2012.”
Stephen Boydell
Finance Director
Revenue from continuing activities for 
the year ended 30 April 2013 was  
£1.04 million (2012: £1.85 million). 
Discontinued revenues generated in 
the wound care business of Altrika in 
the seven months to December 2012 
were £0.10 million (2012: £0.16 million). 
There was no grant income recognised 
in the period for continuing operations 
as the Carbon Trust supported the 
company’s fuel cell catalyst programme 
by way of a direct equity investment  
of £0.15 million (2012: grant income 
£0.17 million).
Revenues relate to the payments made 
by Ilika’s partners for research and 
development activities. Japan-based 
customers continue to fund the 
majority of the Group’s projects, but 
the appointment of a German-based 
business development resource at the 
end of last financial year helped to 
increase the revenue generated  
from European based customers to  
13 percent of the total from 1 percent 
in 2012. 
Gross margin on customer funded 
programmes has remained at around 
44 percent for the year. Administration 
expenses have increased from  
£3.37 million in 2012 to £4.02 million  
in 2013. An accounting adjustment  
for a share-based payment calculation 
is included within administration 
expenses. In 2012 there was a share-
based payment charge of £0.2 million, 
whilst in 2013, because a number of 
options lapsed in the year, there was a 
credit of £0.25 million. The underlying 
increase in administration expenses in 
the year, after taking into account for 
this accounting adjustment, is 
therefore £1.1 million.
The vast majority of this increase 
relates to the company’s increased 
research and development 
expenditure, primarily on its own 
funded solid-state battery project,  
but also on the grant body supported 
projects like the low-cost fuel cell 
catalyst material and the company’s 
contribution to shared development 
programmes with customers. Total 
spend on research and development 
projects, including depreciation on 
assets attributable to these projects, 
was £2.4 million in 2013, up from  
£1.7 million in 2012. The balance of  
the administrative expenses increase 
relates to expanded business 
development activity and the one-off 
costs associated with the company’s 
laboratory expansion to increase 
capacity and accommodate staff and 
equipment transferred from the  
Altrika business. 
 
The increase in internally funded 
research and development activity, 
coupled with the support from the 
Carbon Trust by way of equity 
investment rather than by grant, has 
resulted in a significantly increased 
Research and Development tax credit 
up from £0.1 million in 2012 to  
£0.24 million in 2013.
Investment in facilities expansion in 
the year was £0.2 million and spend  
on laboratory and IT equipment was 
£0.4 million (2012: total spend on fixed 
assets £0.2 million).  Fixed assets with a 
net book value of £20,000 were disposed 
of with the sale of the Altrika business.
The year end cash position was £1.9 
million (2012: £5.3 million). With the 
group restructuring and investment  
in facilities now complete, this cash 
balance, together with the contracts 
currently being finalised and the post 
year end placing, is sufficient to fund 
the company’s cash requirement for 
the foreseeable future.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Directors' report
“  T h e p r i n c i p a l a c t i v i t y 
of Ilika and the Group 
is the discovery and 
development of novel 
materials for mass 
market applications.”
Graeme Purdy
Chief Executive
The Directors present their report and 
the audited financial statements  
for Ilika plc (‘Ilika’) and its subsidiaries 
('the Group’) for the year ended  
30 April 2013.
Principal activities
The principal activity of Ilika and  
the Group is the discovery and 
development of novel materials for 
mass market applications.
Business review
A detailed review of the business, its 
results and future direction, together 
with the key performance indicators  
of turnover by geographical market, is 
included in the Chairman's and Chief 
Executive’s review.
Directors 
The Directors who served on the Board 
of Ilika during the year and to the date 
of this report were as follows:
Executive
Mr. S. Boydell (Financial Director  
and Company Secretary) 
Prof. B. E. Hayden (Chief Scientific 
Officer) 
Mr. G. Purdy (Chief Executive) 
Non-Executive
Mr. J. B. Boyer (Chairman)

Prof. Sir W. Wakeham 
Details of the Directors’ remuneration 
and share options are shown in note 5 
of these accounts.
The Group maintained Directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance cover 
throughout the period.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Commercial risk
The Group is subject to competition 
from competitors who may develop 
more advanced and less expensive 
alternative technology platforms, 
both for existing materials and for 
those materials currently under 
development. The Group is largely 
dependent on its partners to 
commercialise the end-products 
containing the Group’s materials.
Financial risk
The Group is reliant on a small number 
of significant customers and partners. 
Termination of these agreements could 
have a material adverse affect on the 
Group’s results or operations or 
financial condition. The Group expects 
to incur further operating losses as 
progress on development programmes 
continue. There can be no assurance 
that the Group will ever achieve 
significant revenues or profitability.
Intellectual property risk
The Group faces the risk that 
intellectual property rights necessary 
to exploit research and development 
efforts may not be adequately secured 
or defended. The Group’s intellectual 
property may also become obsolete 
before the products and services can 
be fully commercialised.
Regulatory risk
The Group’s materials and products are 
subject to various European and other 
legislative and regulatory 
requirements. Regulatory issues could 
lead to delays in development which 
take time and investment to resolve.
Post balance sheet events
On 22 May 2013, 100,000 Convertible 
Preference Shares were converted to 
Ordinary Shares and 2,375,000 Ordinary 
Shares were issued for a total 
consideration of £712,500 with total 
issue costs incurred of £3,500.
Supplier payment policy
It is the Group’s policy to settle debts 
with its creditors on a timely basis, 
taking best advantage of the terms and 
conditions offered by each supplier. As 
at 30 April 2013, the number of 
creditor days outstanding for the 
Group was 16 days (2012: 27 days). 
Financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial 
instrument comprises cash and this is 
used to finance the Group’s operations. 
The Group has various other financial 
instruments such as trade credit 
facilities that arise directly from its 
operations. The Group places deposits 
surplus to short-term working 
requirements with a range of reputable 
UK based banks and building societies. 
These balances are placed at fixed 
rates of deposit with maturities 
between 1 and 9 months. See  
note 18 for IFRS7 disclosure regarding 
financial instruments.  17

Auditors
All the current Directors have taken all 
the steps that they ought to have taken 
to make themselves aware of any 
information needed by the Company’s 
auditors for the purposes of their audit 
and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of that information. The 
Directors are not aware of any relevant 
audit information of which the 
auditors are unaware.
A resolution to reappoint BDO LLP will 
be proposed at the next Annual 
General Meeting.

Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare the 
Group and Company financial 
statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group and Company for 
that period. The Directors are also 
required to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the 
rules of the London Stock Exchange for 
companies trading securities on the 
Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’).
In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for 
ensuring the Annual Report and the 
financial statements are made 
available on a website. Financial 
statements are published on the 
Group's website in accordance with 
legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Group's website is 
the responsibility of the Directors. The 
Directors' responsibility also extends to 
the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.

Corporate  
governance  
statement
“  The Board is accountable 
to the Company’ s 
shareholders for good 
corporate governance 
and it is the objective  
of the Board to attain  
a high standard of 
corporate governance.”
Jack Boyer
Chairman
The Board is accountable to the 
Company’s shareholders for good 
corporate governance and it is the 
objective of the Board to attain a high 
standard of corporate governance. As an 
AIM listed company full compliance 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published in May 
2010 ('the Code’) is not a formal 
obligation. The Company has not 
sought to comply with the full 
provisions of the Code, however it has 
sought to adopt the provisions that are 
appropriate to its size and organisation 
and establish frameworks for the 
achievement of this objective. This 
statement sets out the corporate 
governance procedures that are in place.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors ('the Board’) 
consists of a Non-Executive Chairman,  
3 Executive Directors and for the year to 
30 April 2013, 3 Non-Executive Directors.
The responsibilities of the Non-
Executive Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer are clearly divided. 
The Chairman is responsible for 
overseeing the running of the Board, 
ensuring that no individual or group 
dominates the Board’s decision-making 
and ensuring that the Non-Executive 
Directors are properly briefed on 
matters. Prior to each Board meeting, 
Directors are sent an agenda and Board 
papers for each agenda item to be 
discussed. Additional information is 
provided when requested by the Board 
or individual Directors.
The Chief Executive Officer has the 
responsibility for implementing the 
strategy of the Board and managing 
the day-to-day business activities of 
the Group through his chairmanship of 
the Executive Committee.
The Non-Executive Directors bring 
relevant experience from different 
backgrounds and receive a fixed fee for 
their services and reimbursement of 
reasonable expenses incurred in 
attending meetings. 
The Board retains full and effective 
control of the Group. This includes 
responsibility for determining the 
Group’s strategy and for approving 
budgets and business plans to fulfil 
this strategy. The full Board ordinarily 
meets bi-monthly. 
The Company Secretary is responsible 
to the Board for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed and that the 
applicable rules and regulations are 
complied with. All Directors have 
access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, and independent 
professional advice, if required, at the 
Company’s expense. Removal of the 
Company Secretary would be a matter 
for the Board. 
Performance evaluation
The Board has a process for evaluation 
of its own performance which is 
carried out annually.
Board Committees
As appropriate, the Board has 
delegated certain responsibilities  
to Board Committees as follows:
i) Audit Committee
The Audit Committee currently 
comprises Clare Spottiswoode CBE 
(Chairman), Professor Sir William 
Wakeham and Jack Boyer. 
The Committee monitors the integrity 
of the Group’s financial statements and 
the effectiveness of the audit process. 
The Committee reviews accounting 
policies and material accounting 
judgements. The Committee also 
reviews, and reports on, reports from 
the Group’s auditors relating to the 
Group’s accounting controls. It makes 
recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment of auditors and the audit 
fee. It has unrestricted access to the 
Group’s auditors. The Committee keeps 
under review the nature and extent  
of non-audit services provided by the 
external auditors in order to ensure 
that objectivity and independence  
are maintained. 19

ii) Remuneration Committee
Until 30 June 2013, the Remuneration 
Committee comprised Dr. Werner Braun 
(Chairman), Clare Spottiswoode CBE and 
Jack Boyer. With the departure of Dr. 
Werner Braun, Professor Sir William 
Wakeham has joined the Committee 
and Jack Boyer has become Chairman. 
The Committee is responsible for 
making recommendations to the Board 
on remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors and the terms of their service 
contracts, with the aim of ensuring 
that their remuneration, including any 
share options and other awards, is 
based on their own performance and 
that of the Group generally. 
iii) Nomination Committee
Until 30 June 2013, the Nomination 
Committee comprised Jack Boyer 
(Chairman), Professor Sir William 
Wakeham and Dr. Werner Braun.  
Dr. Werner Braun has been  
replaced on the Committee by  
Clare Spottiswoode CBE.
It is responsible for providing a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure for 
the appointment of new Directors to 
the Board and reviewing the 
performance of the Board each year.
Attendance at Board meetings  
and committees
The Directors attended the following 
Board and committee meetings  
during the year:

Prof. Sir W. Wakeham 6/7 2/2 1/1 –
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for the 
systems of internal control and for 
reviewing their effectiveness. The 
internal controls are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk and 
provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Audit 
Committee reviews the effectiveness 
of these systems primarily by 
discussion with the external auditor 
and by considering the risks potentially 
affecting the Group.
The Group does not consider it 
necessary to have an internal audit 
function due to the small size of the 
administration function. Instead there 
is a detailed Director review and 
authorisation of transactions. The 
annual audit by the Group auditor, 
which tests a sample of transactions, 
did not highlight any significant system 
improvements in order to reduce risk.
The Group maintains appropriate 
insurance cover in respect of actions 
taken against the Executive Directors 
because of their roles, as well as 
against material loss or claims of the 
Group. The insured values and type of 
cover are comprehensively reviewed  
on a periodic basis.
Employment
The Board recognises its legal 
responsibility to ensure the well-being, 
safety and welfare of its employees 
and maintain a safe and healthy 
working environment for them and for 
its visitors. A health and safety report 
is reviewed at each Board meeting and 
policies and procedures are 
independently reviewed to ensure 
compliance with best practice.

Corporate social  
responsibility
“  We have formed an 
Outreach Department 
and have been working 
collaboratively with 
local schools and 
colleges.”
Ilika continues to recognises the 
importance of approaching its 
responsibilities to corporate social 
responsibility ('CSR') in a co-ordinated 
and committed fashion and we aim to 
ensure our approach to creating business 
growth manages environmental and 
social issues whilst delivering value for 
the Company and continued benefit for 
society. This statement acknowledges 
our ambition to include CSR in all parts  
of our business.
Overall responsibility for developing 
and implementing our CSR policies on 
social, ethical and environmental 
matters and for reviewing their 
effectiveness lies ultimately with the 
Ilika Board. The Board regularly reviews 
the scope of the Company strategy and 
reports to stakeholders to ensure we 
remain focused on the material issues 
for the business.
Ilika’s policies and procedures, which 
includes those related to CSR aspects are 
well researched, clearly thought out and 
communicated to all employees and 
those connected with our activities to 
ensure commitment and understanding 
throughout the Company.
The Main areas of CSR at Ilika are:
• Values and ethics
• Health and safety 
• Employee rights
• Contribution to society
• Environment and sustainability
Values and ethics
Ilika supports the principles of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
through its business practices. This 
means that we support freedom from 
torture, unjustified imprisonment 
without fair trial and any other 
oppression. In addition, we support the 
right of any individual to have freedom 
of expression and religion, political 
representation or in respect of any 
other matter. Accordingly, we will not 
support or work with organisations 
which fail to uphold basic human 
rights within their influence, which are 
involved in the manufacture or transfer 
to an oppressive regime, or are involved 
in the manufacture of equipment used 
in the violation of human rights. We 
will not work with organisations which 
are involved in the funding or carrying 
out of terrorist activities or which do 
not conform to the most widely 
accepted standards for minimum 
labour rights or which do not cover the 
use of under-age or forced labour.
Health and safety
We recognise our responsibility to 
ensure the well-being, safety and 
welfare of our staff and to maintain a 
safe and healthy working environment 
for everyone who is affected by our 
activities. We understand that health 
and safety has positive benefits for the 
Company and that a commitment to a 
high level of safety makes good 
business sense. Health and safety is 
considered at the highest level in the 
Company with the ultimate 
responsibility resting with the Board. 
Employee rights
We uphold the dignity of the individual 
by ensuring not only compliance with 
the laws relating to employment rights, 
equal opportunities and non-
discrimination but by going further to 
ensure we provide a safe, supportive 
and dignified working environment.

Contribution to society
Ilika accepts and acknowledges that we 
have a corporate responsibility towards 
society not only by paying taxes and 
creating and maintaining jobs but also 
by using our unique research skills to 
develop knowledge, skills and products 
which will ultimately benefit society. 
We actively support and encourage the 
study of science at all levels from 
pre-GCSE through to doctorate level. 
Environment and sustainability
Ilika continues to make a real and 
sustainable positive impact on the 
broader community by adopting 
environmentally responsible policies and 
operate in an environmentally conscious 
manner. Our objective is to minimise the 
impact of our business activity on the 
environment wherever possible. 
Our ongoing objectives are to:
• Consider environmental issues in all 
of our decision making processes.
• Evaluate future energy usage to see 
how we can use low energy 
systems.
• Advise staff on the efficient use of 
energy and other utilities.
• Reduce travel on business where 
possible by the use of video and 
telephone conferencing. 
• Use the most environmentally 
friendly mode of transport 
consistent with business needs. 
• Encourage use of bicycles by 
offering our employees access to the 
HMRC Workcycle scheme. 
• Reduce overall the resources we use.
• Reduce waste by recycling or finding 
other uses of by-products whenever 
viable.
• Reduce our letters and 
correspondence by using alternative 
electronic mechanisms. 
• Use either recycled or FSC paper for 
all hard copy correspondence, 
wherever possible. 
• Consider environmental criteria 
when choosing services and goods.
• Develop relationships with suppliers 
and contractors so that we all 
recognise our environmental 
responsibilities.
• Fundamentally Ilika will reduce its 
impact on the environment and ask 
that its employees, suppliers and 
customers do likewise.
Review 
Highlights of the CSR work undertaken 
in the year include:
Environment: Energy usage has been 
fully reviewed in both our offices and 
laboratories and has led to new 
laboratory procedures which require 
tighter co-ordination of the use of 
equipment to ensure cost efficient use 
of our resources. Improved equipment 
usage scheduling has resulted in longer 
periods of shut down thereby reducing 
energy usage.
In our offices we have significantly 
reduced the amount of copying and 
printing undertaken and have set all 
copying equipment to default to 
double-sided, black and white copying. 
Health and Safety: We have invested 
in equipment and training to improve 
working conditions and as a result of 
our ongoing efforts, there were no 
reportable injuries.
Values and ethics: We have requested 
our suppliers’ CSR policies and 
statements to ensure that they are 
aligned with our core business 
principles to carry out business 
honestly, ethically and with respect for 
the rights and interests of others. We 
develop relationships with our suppliers 
to improve quality and efficiency and 
we settle our bills promptly.
Contribution to society: We have 
formed an Outreach Department and 
have been working collaboratively with 
local schools and colleges to create a 
one year programme of lectures, 
competitions and laboratory visits for 
children aged 16 years to 18 years. Our 
programme will proactively support 
and encourage the study and 
enjoyment of science in general and 
Chemistry in particular. In addition our 
Outreach department provides careers 
guidance for children wishing to enter 
into the world of science and we have 
provided 6 month and 12 month 
placements to Masters students.
Outlook
For the year ahead, we have ambitious 
plans to create a system whereby we 
can monitor and quantify our energy 
savings. We will continue to build upon 
our CSR efforts and look forward to a 
mutually rewarding year for our staff, 
the company and all those affected by 
our activities. 22

Capital restructuring reserve
The capital restructuring reserve arises on the accounting for the share-for-share exchange. It represents the difference 
between the value of the issued equity instruments of Ilika Technologies Limited immediately before the share-for-share 
exchange and the equity instruments of Ilika plc along with the shares issued to effect the share-for-share exchange.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies which apply for the financial year to 30 
April 2013 and in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of International Financial Reporting Standards 
('IFRSs') adopted by the European Union.
The individual financial statements of Ilika plc are shown on page 44 to 48.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company made up to the reporting date. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which the Directors believe continues to be appropriate. The 
Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through existing cash resources which, at 30 April 2013, amounted 
to £1,863,062. The Directors have prepared projected cash flow information for the period ending 12 months from the date 
of their approval of these financial statements. On the basis of this cash flow information the Directors believe that the 
Group will be able to continue to trade for the foreseeable future. 
(a) New standards, amendments to standards or interpretations adopted early
In the current year, there were no new or revised standards or interpretations that have been adopted and affected the 
amounts reported in the financial statements.
(b) New standards, amendments to standards or interpretations not yet applied
The following standards, interpretations and amendments, which have not been applied in these financial statements, will or 
may have an effect on the Group’s future financial statements:

Revenue comprises the fair value for the sale of goods and services, net of value added tax and is recognised as follows:
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered 
material in relation to the financial information. 28
Ilika plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1 Accounting policies continued
Revenue
Sales of goods
Sales of equipment and skin based products are recognised when products are delivered to a customer, the customer has 
accepted the products and collectability of the related receivables is reasonably assured.
Sales of services 
Sales of research and development services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, by 
reference to completion of the specific transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the 
total services to be provided.
Leases 
Where a Group company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an 
asset, the lease is treated as a 'finance lease'. The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and 
is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Future instalments under such 
leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, 
which is charged to the consolidated income statement, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation 
for future instalments. All other leases are accounted for as 'operating leases' and the rental charges are charged to the 
consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Financial income and financial expense
Financial income and financial expense is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective  
interest method.
Pension and other post retirement benefits 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to all employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest 
and adjusted for the effect of market-based and non-market based vesting conditions. 
The fair value of market-based options granted by the Group is measured by use of the stochastic valuation model taking into 
account the following inputs: the exercise price of the option; the life of the option; the market price on the date of grant of 
the option; the expected volatility of the share price; the dividends expected on the shares; and the risk free interest rate for 
the life of the option. 
The fair value of non market-based options granted by the Group is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model 
taking into account the following inputs: the exercise price of the option; the life of the option; the market price on the date 
of grant of the option; the expected volatility of the share price; the dividends expected on the shares; and the risk free 
interest rate for the life of the option. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on the research phase is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. Development 
expenditure on new products is capitalised only once the criteria specified under IAS 38, Intangible Assets, have been met. 
Prior to and during the year ended 30 April 2013, no development expenditure satisfied the necessary conditions of IAS 38.
Taxation
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.

1 Accounting policies continued
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items 
of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of 
an item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Leasehold improvements lease term
Plant, machinery and equipment 3–5 years
Fixtures and fittings 3–5 years
Inventory
Inventory comprised the Group’s cell bank from which the Cryoskin® product is derived. Inventory was valued at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. Consumable stock items have been written off as an expense in the year incurred.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Computer software
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific 
software. These costs are amortised to administrative expenses using the straight line method over their estimated useful 
lives (1–3 years).
Intellectual property
Acquired intellectual property is included at cost and is amortised to administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over its 
useful economic life of 15 years. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group’s financial assets are all classified as loans and receivables and carried at 
amortised cost. The Group’s financial liabilities are all classified as ‘other’ liabilities which are carried at amortised cost. Cash 
and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Government grants
Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis in 
the same periods in which the expenses are recognised. Grant revenue is disclosed within other operating income. £16,899 
was received in government grants in the year (2012: £293,297)
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call with the bank. 30

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements, in accordance with IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and 
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Group’s financial statements. The 
Group’s estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
• Revenue recognition
The Group’s revenue substantially comprised revenues from the provision of research and development services. The contacts 
set out defined deliverables the achievement of which trigger milestone payments. Judgement is used to determine the stage 
of completion and the point at which revenue is recognised.
• Share-based payments
The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements underpinning the valuation of the option awards are 
disclosed in note 23.
• Taxation
The current tax receivable is the expected tax receivable on the expenditure for the period using the tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of 
previous years. The ultimate receivable may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon negotiations with the 
relevant tax authorities.
2 Segment reporting
IFRS 8 requires the Group to report on operating segments on the same basis as that used by the chief operating decision 
maker to assess the performance of the business segments and to allocate resources accordingly. For management purposes, 
the Group is analysed by the geographical location of its customer base and business development directors have been 
appointed to cover the Group’s three territories of focus, Asia, North America and Europe. Previously, segmentation analysis 
was provided by the market categories, Energy, Electronics and Biomedical. The disposal of the Altrika wound care business 
and the subsequent reorganisation meant that this segmentation basis was no longer appropriate.
The Group’s activities originate from the production, design and development of high throughput methods of material 
synthesis, characterisation and screening. The Group has materials development programmes for a wide range of 
applications including in the battery, fuel cell, hydrogen storage sectors as well as in capacitors, ferroelectrics, piezoelectrics 
and memory materials.

2 Segment reporting continued
The chief operating decision maker only reviews turnover by operating segment then reviews expenses and profit on an 
aggregate basis. Therefore the segmental loss before tax information, along with the segmental total assets and liabilities 
information has not been split out in this note. 
The loss before tax per the management accounts is the same as the loss before tax on the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income with the exception of the share-based payment expense which is only calculated as a year end 
adjustment. For details of the calculation see note 23. The total assets and liabilities per the management accounts are  
the same as the consolidated balance sheet with the exception of the period end tax adjustment.

9 Taxation 
(a) Tax on profit from ordinary activities
There is no taxation charge due to the losses incurred by the Group during the year. The taxation credit represents research 
and development tax credit claims as follows:
Year ended 30 April
2013
£
2012
£
Current tax on loss for the year 230,000 125,470
Adjustments to prior period 9,741 –
239,741 125,470
(b) Factors affecting current tax charge
The tax assessed on the loss on ordinary activities for the period is different to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 
of 24 percent (2012: 26 percent). The differences are reconciled below:
2013
£
2012
£
Loss on ordinary activities before tax (3,714,714) (2,835,755)
Loss on ordinary activities before tax multiplied by the standard rate of  
corporation tax in the UK of 24% (2012: 26%) (891,531) (737,296)
Effects of:
Expenses not deductible for corporation tax 89,901 25,922
Research and development relief (30,824) (51,566)
Origination of unrecognised tax losses 662,899 579,818
Share options (60,445) 57,652
Under provision in previous years (9,741) – 
Total tax credit for the year (239,741) (125,470)
Unrecognised deferred taxation
There are tax losses available for carry forward against future trading profits of approximately £11,415,000 (2012: 
£9,953,000). A deferred tax asset in respect of these losses of approximately £2,740,000 (2012: £2,389,000) has not been 
recognised in the accounts, as the full utilisation of these losses in the foreseeable future is uncertain.
10 Loss per share
Earnings per Ordinary Share have been calculated using the weighted average number of shares in issue during the relevant 
financial periods. The weighted average number of equity shares in issue and the earnings, being profit after tax, are as follows:
Year ended 30 April
2013 2012
Weighted average number of equity shares 47,431,258 38,525,718
£ £
Earnings, being profit after tax (3,474,973) (2,710,285)
£ £
Loss per share (0.07) (0.07)
Continuing operations (0.06) (0.06)
Discontinued operations (0.01) (0.01)
The loss attributable to Ordinary Shareholders and weighted average number of Ordinary Shares for the purpose of calculating the 
diluted earnings per Ordinary Share are identical to those used for basic earnings per share. This is because the exercise of share 
options would have the effect of reducing the loss per Ordinary Share and is therefore not dilutive under the terms of IAS 33. At 30 
April 2013 there were 16,145,039 options outstanding (2012: 18,514,186 options outstanding) as detailed in notes 19 and 23.

The risks associated with these financial instruments are set out below.
Foreign currency risk 
The Group buys goods and services in currencies other than Sterling. The Group’s non-Sterling liabilities and cash flows can be 
affected by movements in exchange rates. These transactions are not significant and therefore no forward exchange 
contracts have been entered into. It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative trading in financial instruments. Any risk 
is mitigated by sales transactions being denominated in Sterling.
Credit risk 
The Group’s credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and banking deposits. The Group places its deposits with 
reputable financial institutions to minimise credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk for each period is the amount 
disclosed above as total loans and receivables. For the periods above there were no trade receivables which were past due or 
impaired. Risk is further mitigated through the use of credit limits, but also through the nature of the customers, who, for the 
most part, are large multinationals. There is no bad debt provision.
 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s policy is to maintain adequate cash resources to meet liabilities as they fall due. With the exception of its hire 
purchase liabilities, which are disclosed in note 17, all other Group payable balances fall due for payment within 1 year. Cash 
balances are placed on deposit for varying periods with reputable banking institutions to ensure there is limited risk of capital 
loss. The Group does not maintain an overdraft facility. 
Interest rate risk 
The main risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments is interest rate risk. The Group placed deposits surplus to 
short-term working capital requirements with a variety of reputable UK-based banks and building societies. These balances 
are placed at floating rates of interest and deposits have maturities of 1 to 12 months. The Group’s cash and short-term 
deposits are set out in note 16.

18 Financial instruments continued
Fixed-rate financial liabilities comprises of a finance lease which expires in August 2013. It has a weighted average interest 
rate of 13.4 percent The maturity profile is detailed in note 17. Floating-rate financial assets comprise cash on deposit and 
cash at bank. Short-term deposits are placed with banks for periods of up to 12 months and are categorised as floating-rate 
financial assets. Contracts in place at 30 April 2013 had a weighted average period to maturity of 75 days and a weighted 
average annualised rate of interest of 2.01 percent 
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis 
It is estimated that a change in base rate to zero would have increased the Group’s loss before taxation for the year to  
30 April 2013 by approximately £15,000 (2012: £11,000).
It is estimated that an increase in base rate by 1 percent would decrease the Group’s loss before taxation for the year to  
30 April 2013 by approximately £30,000 (2012: £15,000)
There is no difference between the book and fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
Capital management
The primary aim of the Group’s capital management is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, to 
support its businesses and maximise shareholder value. The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments as 
and when it is deemed necessary and appropriate to do so using such methods as the issuing of new shares. At present, other 
than finance leases, all funding is raised by equity. See note 1 for the fundraising that occurred during the year.

amount unpaid in respect of these costs was £2,066 (2012: £6,606).
The Company incurred fees from the University of Southampton in respect of Prof. B. Hayden, a Director of the Company.

23 Share-based payments expense and share options
Share-based payment expense
The Group has incentivised and motivated staff through the grant of share options under the Enterprise Management 
Incentive ('EMI') scheme and through unapproved share option schemes.
The Group has recognised an expense to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income representing the fair value of 
outstanding equity-settled share-based payment awards to employees. The fair values were charged to the consolidated 
statement of total comprehensive income over the relevant vesting periods adjusted to reflect actual and expected vesting levels.
The Group has calculated the fair market value of options which had market-based performance conditions at the time of 
grant, using the stochastic valuation model. Options with no market-based performance conditions at the time of grant, have 
been valued using the Black-Scholes model. 
At a meeting of the Remuneration Committee on 13 July 2011, it was agreed that the market-based performance criteria 
applicable to the options which were granted in May 2010, be amended to reflect a series of Company specific financial and 
commercial milestones.
At 30 April 2013, the following options, whose fair values have been fully charged to the consolidated statement of total 
comprehensive income, were outstanding:

The volatility has been based on the average of the standard deviation of the daily historical share price of the Company since 
its listing on the Alternative Investment Market in May 2010. The prior period volatility was based on the annualised average 
of the standard deviation of the daily historical continuously compounded returns of the share price of three companies listed 
on AIM which had a broadly similar technology risk profile to the Group. The risk free rate was assumed to be the yield to 
maturity on a UK Gilt strip with the term to maturity equal to the expected life of the option.

Expected Term. This is the most likely estimate of the period from grant until the exercise date. For these options, the 
assumption of an expected term of part way between vesting and lapse for each option/tranche. 
Expected Volatility. The normal approach is to look at the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that 
is generally commensurate with the expected award term. However, this approach was not possible here given that the options 
were granted on the date of the Company’s admission to AIM. In such cases, IFRS 2 allows the consideration of the historical 
volatility of other similar entities to determine a proxy for the Company’s volatility. Similar entities, for the purpose of calculating 
volatility, have been chosen as the constituents of the Company’s comparator Index. Volatility for each of these companies has 
been calculated over both 3 and 6 years resulting in median volatilities of 46.7 percent and 42.3 percent respectively. A proxy 
volatility of 45 percent (being midway between these two figures) has been used for valuing these options. 
Expected Dividend Yield: as the Company does not pay, and is not currently expected to pay any dividends, the dividend yield 
has been set to zero. 
Risk-free Rate: calculated based on UK Gilts with a term commensurate with the expected term.

Chairman’s statement
Driving forward
with brand growth.
Ronnie Bell 
Chairman
Dear Shareholders
This is my first report to shareholders since taking over as Chairman 
in October 2010 and I would like to start with a few first impressions. 
 
My early observation is that Premier Foods has a number of strong 
platforms for growth:
• it has a tremendous stable of leading brands with consumer 
franchises developed in many cases by decades of investment. 
These brands account for over two thirds of the Company’s 
revenues and provide an excellent base for long term business 
growth;
• the business has significant scale and excellent operational 
capabilities with generally well invested assets; and
• a strong and capable management team. 
I have spent the last few months getting to know the Company, 
its brands, facilities and people. I have been impressed with the 
capability and commitment of employees at all levels of the Group. 
There is a strong culture of improvement and willingness to adapt 
quickly to the changing demands of the business. 
Progress in 2010 
During the year the Group set out twin strategic priorities:
• an on-going strategy focused on branded growth; and
• a robust financial plan to reduce the Group’s debt.
 
I am fully supportive of this approach and my immediate priority is to 
ensure rapid progress against delivery on both fronts. 
It is clear that we experienced very challenging trading conditions 
in 2010, particularly in the second half of the year. Market growth 
has been subdued as a result of constrained consumer spending 
and increased promotional activity during this period of ongoing 
economic uncertainty. 
However, it is important to recognise that despite this, we have been 
able to make progress on our strategy of delivering branded volume 
growth ahead of the market. While total sales revenue was down 
slightly in line with the market, branded sales were up 3.1% in terms 
of volume. Drive brands in particular made significant progress, 
gaining market share in a number of areas.
Whilst both the Grocery and Hovis divisions made progress in 2010, 
Brookes Avana had a very difficult year suffering a £15m fall in 
trading profit largely as a result of increased commodity costs and 
lower prices. 
In particular, I am pleased to report that through improved 
management of working capital we have increased recurring cash 
generation by £124m exceeding our target of £100m. 
Derisking the Group’s balance sheet 
It is clear that in the current economic climate, investors have 
continued to be concerned by companies with a high level 
of leverage. 
A great deal of progress has been made by the Company in 2010 
to reduce balance sheet concerns. In October we successfully 
restructured the Group’s swap portfolio significantly reducing the 
Company’s risk exposure. Net debt at the year end has reduced by 
£103m to £1,261m and in addition we have obtained a credit rating 
which will allow us to diversify our sources of funding.
Disposals
During the year we assessed our portfolio and took steps to reduce 
our dependence on some parts of our non-branded portfolio which 
were de-prioritised. We have also undertaken a review of our 
business to assess whether there was the potential for the disposal 
of non-strategic businesses which could accelerate our leverage 
reduction. 
In January 2011 we announced we had reached agreement with the 
private equity business, Exponent Private Equity and Intermediate 
Capital Group (Exponent), to sell our Meat-free business which 
manufactures and sells products under the Quorn and Cauldron 
brands for £205m. This disposal was approved by shareholders on 
3 March and successfully completed on 7 March 2011. 
In addition in February 2011, we announced we had reached 
agreement with food producer Princes for the sale of our canned 
grocery operations in East Anglia for £182m. We expect the 
disposal, which is subject to a number of clearances, to complete 
later in 2011.

18550-04  09/03/2011 Proof 13
“We will increase our focus on innovation,  
brand building and consumer marketing to  
deliver branded sales growth.”
The Board believes that these disposals are in the best interests 
of both the Company and shareholders as the net proceeds of 
the sale of around £370m will be used to repay debt. This is an 
important step both in significantly reducing the time it takes to 
reach our target debt level and also in allowing management to 
focus more single mindedly on our key brands within the Grocery 
and Hovis businesses.
Board changes
As referred to above, I joined as Chairman with effect from  
1 October 2010 succeeding David Kappler. On behalf of the  
Board, I would like to thank David for his significant contribution 
to the Group since its flotation in 2004. At the same time as my 
appointment Charles Miller Smith became Deputy Chairman and 
he has been working closely with me on the strategic development 
of the business.
 
At the forthcoming AGM in April, David Felwick will be stepping 
down as a non-executive director. I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank David for the help and support he has provided 
to the Company both as Senior independent director and, until 
2009, as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. Following 
his retirement David Beever will take up the appointment of Senior 
independent director.
I am also very pleased to announce the appointment of David Wild, 
Chief Executive of Halfords plc, as a new non-executive director with 
effect from 7 March 2011. David’s background within the grocery 
and retail industry will be valuable to the Company as we continue 
to develop our strategy.
Focus for 2011
We have made significant strides in achieving a capital structure 
which we believe will be more attractive to investors and hope 
to make further progress in this over the course of the year. With 
balance sheet issues largely addressed, our focus for 2011 will be  
on branded sales growth. 
In order to achieve this I believe it is also important that we increase 
our focus on innovation, brand building and consumer marketing. 
To this end we have now aligned our organisational structure to 
combine the management of our Drive and Core brands and plan to 
put the necessary investment behind accelerating growth.
This new organisational structure is an important step in enabling 
the business to prioritise resources and maximise the return from its 
brand portfolio. The new structure will enable us to: 
• manage all brands together rather than solely by division;
• establish a single Group marketing function to facilitate the 
sharing of consumer insight and aid prioritisation of resources;
• concentrate more resources behind Drive and Core brands; and
• manage the Defend brands and own label businesses 
separately to ensure their contribution is maximised. 
Premier Foods has a good track record of developing innovation 
and new products which reflect changing consumer trends and 
habits. We believe this new structure and increased investment 
will help us to grow the amount of branded sales from new and 
improved products within Grocery as the benefits of our innovation 
pipeline start to come through.
With the current tough general economic environment combining 
with strong pressure from rising commodity prices, 2011 will remain 
difficult from a consumer confidence and trading perspective.
However, as demonstrated in 2010, the Group remains committed 
to the pursuit of share growth behind our strong stable of brands 
across our major markets. Strong marketing programmes and 
increased product innovation will support our share growth 
initiatives. At the same time the Group will continue to leverage cost 
release from its efficiency savings programmes to support gross 
margin achievement. Our improving debt and strengthening balance 
sheet position will allow us to diversify sources of funding. Overall 
we are confident that we can continue to make progress in 2011.

Investment proposition
Investment proposition.
Our business strategy is:
• to grow branded sales faster 
than their respective markets by 
investing in and strengthening 
our brands and their relevance to 
today’s consumers;
• to gain competitive advantage 
through consumer insight 
and scale to deliver value to 
customers and work more 
effectively with suppliers; and
• to deliver efficiency benefits such 
that supply chain costs and 
overheads are held flat or decline 
while volumes grow.
Our financial strategy is:
• to focus on cash generation to 
reduce average debt to EBITDA 
to 3.25 or less; 
• to derisk the swap portfolio and 
pension arrangements; and
• to diversify our sources of funding.
We believe that the successful 
execution of these strategies will in 
turn deliver shareholder value.
We are the UK’s largest branded 
ambient grocery manufacturer.
We are the UKs largest vertically 
integrated bread baker and flour 
miller.
We operate across 15 food 
categories and hold #1 positions in  
11 of them.
Our focus on the UK market makes 
us different and means we have no 
directly comparable competitors 
when looking at either major 
multinationals or other UK food 
companies.
Premier has a large portfolio of over 
40 well known, British brands.
More than 99% of all UK households 
consume a Premier Foods product 
every year.
Our brands have stood the test of 
time — our oldest brand Sarson’s has 
been in existence since 1794.
With such a large portfolio of brands 
it is important we focus our effort in 
the right places to maximise growth 
and profitability.
We have a clear strategy to focus on 
the categories and brands where we 
can grow the fastest and where we 
will invest the most.

Our scale and focus on the UK 
market gives us greater insight on 
the behaviours and needs of UK 
consumers and shoppers. We use 
this to help us decide:
• how brands are positioned in the 
market;
• how we communicate through 
advertising; and 
• how products should look and 
taste.
We have implemented a new 
organisation structure which will:
• establish a Group marketing 
function facilitating the sharing of 
consumer insight and maximising 
value from marketing spend; and 
• concentrate more resources 
behind innovation in our Drive 
and Core brands leading to a 
greater contribution from new and 
improved products. 
Our scale gives us many advantages. 
It enables us to:
• to work with customers over a 
wide range of categories; 
• to consolidate our supplier base, 
building stronger relationships 
with suppliers and driving lower 
per unit input costs;
• to consolidate our manufacturing 
footprint creating fewer, larger 
facilities;
• to drive efficiencies in 
manufacturing;
• to reduce administrative 
overheads; and 
to use this to increase our profit 
margin.
We have a wide customer base 
— supplying all the top retailers, 
convenience and independent stores.
We also supply the foodservice, 
catering and milling channels.
We have demonstrated our ability to 
pass on cost inflation as witnessed by 
the recent increases in wheat prices. 
Our business is stable and robust 
even under the recent challenging 
economic conditions.
The business generates strong free 
cash flow and this in turn allows us to 
pay down our debt.

Grossman, Oxo and many more. The business employs around 15,000 people and operates from over 60 sites across the UK and Ireland.
 
Following the year-end we have announced the sale of our Meat-free and East Anglian canned grocery businesses. On 7 March 2011 
we completed the sale of our Meat-free business to Exponent for £205m. For the purposes of the financial statements, the results of the 
Meat-free business are disclosed within discontinued operations. On 8 February 2011, we announced an agreement to sell our East Anglian 
canning business to Princes for £182m. Together, this will result in the sale of five manufacturing and two distribution sites and the transfer of 
around 2,000 employees.

18550-04  09/03/2011 Proof 13
Last year we set out the Group’s business strategy and in 
addition, at the half year, we provided details of our financial 
strategy. I would now like to report on the significant progress 
we have made in 2010 in implementing these strategies and 
also our plans for 2011. 
STRATEGY
Introduction
Our vision is to be “the best in British food with brands that you 
really love”.
The Group’s business strategy is:
• to grow our branded sales faster than their respective 
markets by investing in and strengthening our brands and 
their relevance to today’s consumers;
• to gain competitive advantage by utilising our consumer 
insight and scale to deliver value to customers and to work 
more effectively with suppliers; and
• to deliver efficiency benefits such that supply chain costs  
and overheads are held flat or decline while volumes grow.
The Group’s financial strategy is:
• to focus on cash generation and to reduce average debt to 
EBITDA to 3.25 or less;
• to derisk the swap portfolio and pension arrangements; and
• to diversify our sources of funding.
Despite the continuing difficult consumer environment, we have been 
able to progress with both our business and financial strategies in 2010.
Note: All financial metrics refer to the continuing Group plus 
the Meat-free business unless otherwise indicated. For the 
purposes of the financial statements the Meat-free business is 
disclosed within discontinued operations.
Branded sales
Branded sales are up 3.1% in volume versus category markets 
down 0.8%. Sales revenue was down 0.3% on 2009 in line with the 
market. Within this total, Drive brands are up 3.0%.
 
Competitive advantage through scale
In the year, procurement gains from working more strategically with 
our suppliers added £16m to the Grocery trading profit. 
Improve efficiency
Grocery manufacturing costs in the year were reduced by 8%, being 
6% from efficiencies, ahead of our 4% per annum strategic target 
and 2% from deflation in energy costs. In Group operating expenses, 
savings of £17m were found chiefly from efficiencies in distribution. 
Cash generation
Recurring cash flow was £124m, versus the £100m target set 
out in our strategy. The outperformance was generated by good 
management of working capital including reducing stock holding 
by five days’ cover to 36. £16m of recurring cash flow was used to 
enable the swap restructure to take place: being £8m of settlement 
of a mark to market liability and £8m of fee for bank approval. After 
other non-recurring items amounting to £5m this left £103m which 
has been used to pay down bank debt. 
Derisking swap portfolio and pensions
The swap portfolio was restructured to remove the elements 
which did not provide an economic hedge to the bank debt. 
These elements were diverting cash flow by increasing short term 
interest rates and were building up a large cash call risk in 2012. By 
restructuring the swap portfolio, these risks have been removed. 
The short term interest cost has been reduced and the cash call has 
been fixed at the then current mark to market and deferred to the 
end of the current financing period, i.e. 2013.
The closure of the final salary pension fund has been agreed with the 
trade unions and pension trustees and will be implemented in the 
second half of 2011. The previous final salary offer is replaced with a 
market competitive career average scheme for existing pension fund 
members and a money purchase scheme for new starters.
In conjunction with the trustees of the pension fund, we have also 
agreed a programme to increase the amount of hedging between the 
fund investments and liabilities. This will reduce the volatility of the deficit. 
Diversifying sources of funds
The swap restructure removed a considerable risk from the Group’ s 
balance sheet which would otherwise have prevented the Group 
obtaining a credit rating. We have now obtained a credit rating of Ba2 
(stable outlook) from Moody’ s and BB (stable outlook) from both Fitch 
and Standard & Poors. It is our intention to access the debt capital 
markets and raise a bond during the course of 2011. This will diversify 
our sources of funding and reduce our reliance on bank debt.
Proposed disposal of Meat-free and Canning 
businesses
After the year end, the Group agreed the sale of its Meat-free 
Chief Executive’s statement

business and its East Anglian canned grocery businesses for a total 
of £387m, equivalent to 7.6 times the combined EBITDA of £51m. 
After costs and pension contributions of around £17m and, subject to 
working capital adjustments on completion, the remaining proceeds 
of around £370m will be used to reduce bank facility borrowings. 
The disposals will leave the Group’ s branded sales percentage largely 
unchanged at 66.4%. But both the gross margin and the trading profit 
margin will be improved. The main effect will be in the Grocery business 
where the branded sales percentage will increase from 74.1% to 
82.3%. The non-branded Grocery sales will be halved and the brands 
sold are largely in the Core and Defend categories. 
The disposal will contribute materially to our objective of deleveraging. 
On a pro forma basis, the Group’ s net debt will be below £900m and 
net debt/EBITDA would be around 2.87 times. In addition, average 
debt/EBITDA would be reduced to around 3.72 times which is well on 
the way to achieving the Group’ s stated target of 3.25 times.
Once the disposals are complete, the Group expects to have 
recurring cash generation of at least £80m per annum. The Group 
believes that the EBITDA growth prospects are largely unchanged 
as the Meat-free business had growth prospects whereas the 
Canning business faced more difficult markets. 
Initially, the effect of the disposals will be to dilute EPS. However, the 
Group believes this is a temporary effect. Firstly, the initial interest 
saving is at the marginal cost of bank funds. Once a bank refinancing 
is undertaken, the saving will increase to the average rate. Secondly, 
the simplification of the business achieved by the disposals will facilitate 
improving processes which will result in cost savings. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
Last year we also published our first stand alone CSR report setting 
out the progress we had made against a number of objectives and 
also setting out our future plans to strengthen our approach to CSR 
in 2010. We have also made significant progress in aligning our 
commitment to CSR with our overall business strategy to deliver 
long-term and sustainable business growth. Details of our key 
achievements are set out on pages 36 to 43.
Plans for 2011
In 2010 we have made significant progress in resolving the balance 
sheet issues which have up until now weighed heavily on the 
business. With the financial path now clear and the journey well under 
way, we can focus our resources more firmly on building our brands. 
To achieve this, we have now  implemented a new organisation 
structure in which Tim Kelly was appointed Chief Operating Officer 
with effect from January 2011. 
This structure will:
• manage all brands together rather than separately by division 
allowing for better prioritisation of resources;
• establish a Group marketing function facilitating the sharing 
of consumer insight and maximising value from marketing 
spend;
• concentrate more resources behind innovation in our Drive 
and Core brands leading to a bigger contribution from new 
and improved products;
• manage the Defend brands and non-branded businesses 
separately to ensure their contribution is maximised; and 
• consolidate back office functions to simplify back office  
processes and facilitate cost reduction.
We will elaborate on these plans at an Investor Conference in  
May 2011.
Outlook
Promotional activity increased significantly in 2010. For 2011, we do 
not believe that it will continue to escalate at the same rate but we 
are cautious about whether it will decline very quickly. 
Commodity inflation has been running at mid single digit 
percentages. This has required us to increase prices for our 
products. At this level, we believe that inflation is manageable. 
In 2010, the most dramatic effect of pricing and commodity inflation  
was felt in the significant fall in profitability in our Brookes Avana 
business. We are talking constructively with Marks and Spencer to  
agree new product ranges and revised pricing and supply arrangements 
which we believe will return the business to profitability in 2011.
Our focus in 2011 will be:
• to continue to take branded market volume share;
• to grow our percentage of Grocery branded sales from new 
and improved products as our innovation pipeline matures; 
• to continue our drive for efficiencies; and
• to generate at least £80m of recurring cash flow.
We would expect our focus to result in the Group showing progress in 
2011 without any further deterioration in the consumer environment.

MARKETS
Grocery
The UK Grocery market proved resilient despite the continuing 
recessionary environment in 2010 and pressure on consumer spending. 
The total UK Food and Drink Market (excluding alcohol) was worth 
£68.0bn in 2010 (2009: £65.8bn) and grew by 3.3% over the year 
(2009: 4.8%). Within this branded sales outpaced retailer brands with 
value growth of 4.5% (2009: 7.0%) compared to 2.6% (2009: 3.3%).

Premier operates in the Ambient Grocery sector which grew by 
3.6% to £25.9bn in 2010 (2009: £25.0bn).
1
 Our principal market is 
the UK accounting for 94.9% of sales (2009: 94.7%). 
Baking and Milling
The total UK Bakery market is worth £3.68bn and is one of the largest 
segments within the food industry.
2
 T otal volume at present is just under 
4 billion units which is equivalent to 11 million loaves and packs sold 
each day.
The industry is divided into three main categories:
 1) Large plant bakers
 2) In-store bakers; and
 3) Local high street bakers
 
The UK milling industry produces 4.5 million tonnes of flour each 
year with a total value of around £1bn. Demand for flour has been 
stable for the last ten years.
The UK milling industry utilises 35% of the 15 million tonne wheat 
crop with a further 1 million tonnes imported. Approximately 40% of 
the supply is vertically integrated. 
COMPETITION
Grocery
Competition is largely split between two categories:
1) major multi-nationals who pursue a global brand strategy and 
focus on categories where their global focus can be achieved; 
and
2) smaller UK companies who are generally more focused on 
retailer branded products. As these businesses are less branded 
they tend to generate lower profit margins.
Due to the large portfolio of brands the Group owns and our focus 
on the UK market we do not have any principal competitors who 
operate over all of the same categories as us.
 
Premier is the UK’s largest ambient grocery producer with a 6.8% 
(2009: 6.8%) share of the £25.9bn Ambient Grocery sector.

Consumer insight
Consumer insight.
Growing the business through branded sales
Much of the last few years since the acquisition of the RHM 
and Campbell’s businesses has been focused on managing the 
restructuring the business. With this completed we are now moving 
to focus on our key strategic priority of growing the business 
through branded sales. 
In-depth understanding of the British consumer
If we are to achieve this it is essential that all our activities and 
initiatives are based on understanding the behaviours and needs 
of our consumers and shoppers. This is the step change that is 
underway that will ensure that Premier Foods achieves its’ goals 
over the coming years.
It is the role of the Consumer Insights team at Premier Foods 
to know exactly what those behaviours and needs are and to 
make sure the business understands them better than any of our 
competitors. Part of their role is to articulate specific consumer 
insights which can feed into a number of activities such how 
are brands are positioned in the market, how we communicate 
through advertising or packaging design, what areas we need to be 
innovating in, how our products should be tasting and so on.
So what is a consumer insight?
There are many textbook definitions but what is common to them all 
is that a good consumer insight requires a deep understanding of a 
consumer’s needs and behaviours that will in turn offer competitive 
advantage. The word deep is highlighted as it is very easy to 
‘observe’ what is on the surface but the job of an insight practitioner 
is to ask why, and why again to get under the skin of what a 
consumer is saying or doing.
The Consumer and Shopper Manifesto
The Consumer and Shopper Manifesto was first published in the 
2009 Annual Report and is a good example of broader level insights. 
The Manifesto was conceived with a view to answering the simple 
question, “what are the things that are most important to consumers 
and shoppers of food today?” On reading the manifesto most of 
those things would appear to obvious, such as ‘Looking and Taste 
Delicious’, ‘Offer Genuine Value for Money’ and ‘Be Natural and 
Wholesome’, but it can be easy to forget the big important things 
when focusing on the day to day running of a business.
“. . . good consumer 
insight requires a deep 
understanding of a 
consumer’s needs and 
behaviours that will in 
turn offer competitive 
advantage.”

Consumer insight in action — Loyd For One
The Consumer and Shopper Manifesto has proved most powerful, 
where one or more of the principles have combined with brand level 
consumer insights. Loyd For One cooking sauces which launched in 
2010 is a good example of this. 
One of the Manifesto principles ‘Make Food Easy’ urges us to think 
about whether we have the right size packs for the consumers who 
use them. Our data shows that meals where four or more people 
are present are three times more likely to be prepared using a 
cooking sauce than a meal where only one person is present. We 
also know that the number of single person occupied households is 
increasing rapidly and busy family lives means that even within larger 
households eating alone is becoming more commonplace.
Armed with this information the Loyd Grossman team set about 
launching a product specifically for one person. 
•	 W e 	 found	that	the	main 	r eason 	 that 	people	eating	on	their	own	
were less likely to use cooking sauces is that invariably, despite 
current jars being re-sealable, half a jar would be used and after 
a few days the remainder of the sauce would be thrown away. 
•	 W e	 also 	know	 fr om	data	that	Loyd Grossman consumers 
specifically are far more likely to be environmentally aware than 
other consumers and avoiding food wastage is very important 
to them. 
•	 Finally , 	 we	know	that	typical	Loyd Grossman consumers are 
‘foodie’ people who like to know what is in their food and where 
is comes from.
As a result Loyd For One was launched addressing all of these 
needs. The portion size is perfect ‘for one’ (we researched this too!), 
using high quality premium ingredients with nothing artificial added 
(as with all of our cooking sauces), packed in lightweight packaging 
(a pouch is approximately 95% less packaging in weight than a 
glass jar) in the flavours that we know our consumers love the most. 
Whilst the original inspiration for Loyd For One was the ‘Make Food 
Easy’ principle, in reality every one of the other seven Consumer and 
Shopper Manifesto principles were employed: 
•	 The	pr oducts	 ar e	only	made	fr om	natural	ingr edients 	and	ar e	
‘Natural and Wholesome’;
•	 By	addr essing 	food	waste	and	with	less	packaging	they	‘Do	The	
Right Thing’;
•	 They	‘Focus	on	the	Nation’ s	Favourite	Food’	as	they	ar e	in	the	
most popular flavours;
•	 They	‘Look 	and 	T aste 	Delicious’	only 	using	the	finest	ingr edients;
•	 They 	ar e	‘Genuine	V alue 	for	Money’,	partly 	because	of	the	
competitive price point but also because there is no waste;
•	 The	pouch 	is 	a	dif fer ent 	size	and	shape	to 	the	r est	of	the	
category which is in jars and so they ‘Shine In Store’; and
•	 Finally	its	launch	TV	advertising	helps	the	pr oduct	and	brand	to 	
‘Be Loved’.
The result is a phenomenal rate of sale for the range and after less 
than a year in the market, this part of the Loyd Grossman range is 
already bigger than some other competitor brands in their entirety.
•	 Loyd For One has already gained a 5% value share of the 
Premium Italian sector
1
.
•	 Contributed 	 to 	 second 	 half 	 sales 	 gr owth 	 of 	 16.7% 	 acr oss 	 the 	Loyd 
Grossman range — delivering total sales of £45m for the year.
Outlook for the future
This is just one example of how understanding the consumer and 
shopper can help ensure success. However, this is just the starting 
point; all Premier Foods employees are now being encouraged to 
think about the consumer and shopper. 
Over the year every member of the Group Executive has spent a day 
meeting a consumer in their home and accompanying them around 
a store and have seen consumer insights in action by attending 
focus groups. There are plans to roll out this kind of activity 
throughout the organisation.

Operating review
2010 has been an important year in the history of Premier Foods. 
During the year we have progressively implemented our financial 
strategy by closing out our interest rate swap exposure, closing 
our final salary pension scheme, generating £124m in a recurring 
cash flow and obtaining a credit rating to allow us to access the 
bond markets. Since the end of the year we have also agreed the 
sale of two businesses which will reduce our debt level to less 
than £900m, compared to £1,365m a year ago.
Our business has proved resilient, with branded volume 
market share growth, increased margin from procurement and 
manufacturing efficiency and lower operating expenses.
All financial metrics refer to the continuing business plus the Meat-
free business unless otherwise indicated. For the purposes of the 
financial statements the Meat-free business is disclosed within

Grocery, Hovis and Meat-free divisions all increased profit in the

to lower volumes, lower prices, poorer mix and higher commodity 
costs. We are in constructive dialogue with our main customer, 
Marks and Spencer, which we believe will result in an amended 
product range and revised pricing and supply arrangements which 
we believe will return the business to profit in 2011.

Total sales fell by 3.5%. Volume contributed 2.7% to the reduction 
with positive mix offset by price contributing 0.8%.
Branded sales were down 0.3% at £1,673m and now account for 
65.2% of total sales, an increase of 2.1pp on 2009. Market share 
for the Grocery division increased by 0.9pp to 20.0% by volume as 
a result of innovation and promotional activity. Market share fell by 
0.2pp to 22.1% by value as the higher volumes were offset by the 
effect of increased promotional activity on net prices. 
Promotional activity continues to escalate in the market. Across 
all grocery categories, during 2010 32.8% of items were bought 
on promotion. In 2009 this was 30.4%. The promotional activity 
increased during the year with Q4 reaching 34.2%. Premier Foods’ 
promotional cost in grocery categories similarly increased by 8% in 
2010 although this was more concentrated in Q4. 
Market share for the Hovis division increased by 0.3pp to 25.2% by 
volume as a result of additional distribution but fell by 0.8pp to 24.9% 
by value as a result of promotional activity.

Non-branded sales, which comprise retailer brand, business to 
business products and milling, were down by 9.1%. 
In the Grocery division, non-branded sales declined by 5.0%. 
This decline largely reflects a decline in the Canning category with 
sales down 10.3% and volumes down 11.2%. Market volumes 
for Canning were down 10.0% as a result of increased brand 
promotions. The contract losses were lapped at the end of Q3 and 
own label volumes were in line with the market in Q4. 
In Hovis, sales of retailer brand bakery products were down 22.1%. 
Volumes were down 21.1% reflecting a retailer brand bread market 
down 13.6% and the exit from certain contracts. The volume lost 
by this decline was partly offset by increased volumes of branded 
bread leaving total bread volumes down 3.4%. 
Also in Hovis, milling, sales revenue was down 11.3%. In volume, 
however, sales were down only 4.9% owing to competition and 
slight declines in market demand. Price deflation accounted for the 
remaining 6.4% of sales decline. The price deflation, however, has 
little effect on profitability as the cost of raw materials is similarly 
reduced. In Q4 this effect reversed with volumes down 4.9% but 
sales revenue up 10.9%. 
In the Chilled division, non-branded sales fell by 4.7% driven by mix 
of contracts and less successful promotional activity.

Drive brands grew by 3.0% to £865m helped by promotional spend 
and new products. Drive brand volumes were up 4.9% compared 
with a category market decline of 2.2%. Hovis, Mr Kipling, Ambrosia 
and Hartley’s all succeeded in gaining volume market share. Loyd 
Grossman benefited from the launch of the Loyd For One range 
which contributed to second half sales growth of 16.7%. Quorn 
sales were down 1.4% as we pulled back on promotional and 
marketing spend particularly in the first half. During the second half, 
the brand returned to growth with sales up 0.4%.
Core brands fell by 2.5% to £391m. Volumes were down 2.0% 
compared with a category market decline of 0.7%. Batchelors and 
Oxo faced strong competition in their markets and Branston beans 
and Bisto had a lighter promotional programme. Cadbury cakes 
sales fell reflecting lower promotional activity. 
Defend brands declined by 4.6% to £417m. Volumes were up 2.6% 
compared with a category market growth of 1.6%. Volumes were 
helped by growth in Crosse & Blackwell beans, Homepride cooking 
sauces and Elephant Atta flour. Price deflation was driven by the 
Ireland market and wheat deflation.

From March 2011 you will be able to buy Bisto gravy and Oxo stock instant pastes in a squeezy tube format. The innovation is 
the first of its kind, in a convenient and modern squeezy tube format. Premiumisation remains a key growth opportunity within 
the category as consumers trade-up for products that offer them great quality and convenience. With a total share of 46% in 
the gravy, stocks & stuffings category, Bisto and Oxo are leading brands and strongly positioned to inject momentum into the 
category with this the new premium offering.
Bisto instant roast gravy is a concentrated paste that allows you to easily create a smooth, deliciously rich, home made tasting 
gravy in an instant. It contains real meat juices and no artificial flavour enhancers or colours. Bisto instant gravy comes in three 
flavours: beef, onion and chicken.
Oxo squeezy stock is a convenient and easy way to bring fresh flavours to your dishes. Made with real meat and vegetable 
extracts, with no artificial flavour enhancers, the new format allows you to add as much or as little as you want to your dish. Also 
in three flavours to choose from: beef, chicken or vegetable.
CASE STUDY
Input costs in some of our largest spend areas were higher in 2010 
reflecting the rises in various commodity markets. Commodities 
particularly affected included cocoa, dairy, diesel and packaging. 
In the second half, we experienced significant wheat inflation with 
consequential increases in other cereals, meat and vegetable oils. 
The Group continues to foresee upward pressures in commodity 
input costs. 
The Group generally expects the effects of input cost changes and 
resulting pricing changes to even out over the long term. However, 
there can be a delay, or stagger, between input costs changing 
and pricing in the market changing to reflect them. This can lead 
to volatility in results within any financial year. In 2010, pricing was 
increased to reflect the input costs but the effect of the negative 
stagger together with the general increase in promotional activity in 
the grocery market reduced Group gross margin. 
In total, the combination of promotional activity, pricing and input 
cost changes reduced Group gross margin by 150bp.
 
The net effect of all these changes was an increase of 50bp in 
Group gross margin.

Operating review continued
Support functions and corporate costs decreased by 1.7% to 
£172m. Pension service costs decreased from £12m in 2009 to 
£9m. As a result of changes in bond yields and inflation assumptions 
current service cost was £21m as expected. However, this was 
offset by a past service credit of £12m which resulted from the 
amendment of future benefit accrual in two of the Group’s pension 
funds. Based on the current levels of bond yields and inflation 
assumptions, we expect the current service cost to be around £20m 
in 2011. Further past service amendments are likely to be seen 
in 2011, the level of which will depend on the way in which new 
benefits are implemented. 
During the year we continued to roll out our SAP system. Over the 
next few years we intend to complete the transition to SAP and to 
simplify our processes. Our aim is to reduce the administrative costs 
over this period sufficiently to fund the increase in marketing costs.
Restructuring costs
In the year, a total of £12m was spent on restructuring compared 
with £14m in 2009. The main project was reducing the size of 
the Irish supply chain owing to a developing trend of retailers 
sourcing products directly from the UK. Of the £12m charge, £2m 
(2009: £5m) is included in Cost of sales and £10m (2009: £9m) in 
Operating expenses. The charge in Grocery is £8m (2009: £1m) and 
in Hovis is £2m (2009: £11m).
Bringing women back to bread with Hovis Wholemeal
Hovis brand ambassador and Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton is fronting our new Hovis Wholemeal campaign which went on 
air in January 2011. Using the strap line ‘Stops me Snacking’, the campaign encourages more women to eat Hovis Wholemeal 
for breakfast. TV was supported by another first, using Facebook as our key digital platform to help drive the campaign and 
engage people in the ‘bread debate.’ This topic was of particular interest during January, when consumers are at their most 
health conscious. 
Caroline Jary, Head of Marketing for Hovis, says: “Victoria is a great ambassador for the Hovis brand and we are proud to have 
her fronting our campaign, which will reinforce that Hovis Wholemeal, with a healthy topping, is a great alternative to cereal. 
Hovis Wholemeal is rich in fibre which can help you feel fuller for longer, a great tool to stop snacking. We want to bring back 
consumers to bread at breakfast and will be utilising our biggest ever digital campaign to engage consumers through healthy 
recipe ideas.”

The strategy is to grow our branded sales without growing operating 
expenses. In the year, operating expenses fell by 3.4% to £478m.
Consumer and in-store marketing was down £2m year on year and 
this was deployed to support the growth in branded sales volumes. 
Our strategy is to increase consumer marketing as we increase 
support to our brands. In the year, marketing spend was increased 
in Grocery but was reduced in Hovis and Meat-free. We decided 
not to increase marketing budgets this year owing to the tough 
consumer environment. However, we expect marketing costs to 
increase in 2011 as we increase innovation activity. 
Distribution costs were down 5.2% to £217m. The reduction 
in volumes allowed costs to be reduced. Lower fuel costs also 
contributed. However, the main reduction was as a result of 
improved efficiency which was equivalent to a 4.7% reduction.

Business review
Grocery.
“In 2010 the Grocery division 
succeeded in growing market share 
by 0.9pp to 20.0% by volume through 
innovation and promotional activity.”
Sales for the Grocery division decreased by 1.8%. Branded sales 
were down 0.6% to £1,146m. Non-branded sales were down 5.0% 
to £401m.
Branded sales volumes increased by 2.7% with negative price and 
mix reducing revenue by 3.3%. 
Branded sales in UK retail channels were up 0.1% in value and up 
2.3% in volume. 
Sales in the catering and specialist channels were down 1.9%. 
Muted market trends owing to consumers eating out less frequently 
was exacerbated by some contract losses in suet and beans.
Sales in Ireland were £81m down 8.8% on 2009 as the market 
suffered with the economic conditions and as the euro weakened. 
On a constant currency basis sales were down 6.0%. The Irish 
grocery retail sector has continued to adapt to the difficult economic 
environment with a substantial increase in sourcing directly from the 
UK coupled with a move to more centralised distribution. In 2010 
we restructured our business in Ireland to reflect these changes and 
anticipate that further restructuring may be required as the retail 
sector continues to adapt. The supply chain savings were sufficient 
to offset the loss of gross margin from the fall in sales.
International sales amounted to £37m, an increase of 15.8%.
Retailer brand sales were down 5.0% in the year with volume decline 
reducing sales revenue by 5.3% with price and mix contributing 0.3%. 
The loss of volume was largely a reflection of trends in the category 
markets which were down 2.2% in the year. This is a steeper fall than 
normal which reflects a switch toward branded goods as promotional 
activity increased. Our performance lagged the market in the first 
three quarters of the year largely as a result of a material retailer brand 
beans contract lost in Q3 of 2009. 
Trading profit increased by 0.4% to £256m.

Divisional review continued
Lower sales volumes were partially offset by a superior product 
mix, with branded sales steady versus non-branded decline. This 
reduced profit by £5m. Our strategy of improving procurement 
efficiency added £16m to profit. 
In the year, input costs increased reflecting commodity markets. This 
was largely offset by pricing but promotional costs were higher in 
the year. These factors combined meant that the business incurred 
a net cost of £18m. 
The increase in promotional costs reflects an increase in the level of 
deal activity across all grocery markets, with retailers competing to 
offer value during the recession. 
There was a £21m net benefit as a result of reduced manufacturing 
costs. This was achieved as a result of increased efficiency from 
various initiatives. For example, better operating practices reduced 
waste and better scheduling reduced the need to use overtime 
or third party manufacturing. This amounted to a 6% reduction of 
controllable costs in line with our strategic target. In addition, in 
2010, deflation in energy prices contributed a further 2% reduction. 
This is liable to reverse in 2011 as fuel prices increase. 
There was a £13m increase in operating expenses. Of this increase, 
£4m of higher bonus costs reflected a return to more normal levels as 
guided in 2009. Pension costs were flat year on year. An additional £8m 
was spent in restructuring costs as the project to decrease the size of 
the Irish supply chain got under way. Additional marketing costs of £4m 
were incurred to support driving market share and the new product 
launches. We expect this cost to continue to increase in the future 
as we refresh our brand ranges. Other costs were reduced by £3m 
particularly owing to lower volumes and efficiencies in distribution. 
In conclusion, in 2010, Grocery’ s results are substantially in line with the 
business strategy. Branded volume market share grew and, despite 
increased promotional investment and subdued consumer demand, 
sales revenue was flat. We grew sales through innovation and improved 
gross margin by better procurement and manufacturing efficiency. 
We found savings to fund increased consumer marketing activity. 
Non-branded sales were lower year on year but this relates to market 
trends and to contracts lost on grounds of profitability in 2009. We are 
confident that our strategy will result in further progress in 2011. Above: Launch of new Frujies range helps Hartley’s to deliver  
sales increase of 8.7% in 2010.
Mr Kipling range refresh
Mr Kipling had retails sales of £136m in 2010 so ensuring the core product range retains its relevancy with consumers is 
extremely important. Our range refreshment programme, launched in 2009, aims to drive new news and interest for consumers in 
our key product sectors. 
2010 saw Mr Kipling’s continued commitment to the programme with the launch of Mr Kipling’s Ice Cream Inspirations in May. 
Recreating some of the best loved ice cream flavours in his most iconic and best loved cakes, Mr Kipling’s Neapolitan Bakewells, 
Raspberry Ripple Slices and Tutti Frutti Pies have been made with the same care and attention to detail that Mr Kipling gives to all 
his cake creations.
The range performed well, particularly over the summer months, finishing the year having delivered £4.5m in retail sales value
The range refresh continues in 2011 with the replacement of the Ice Cream range with the launch of Mr Kipling’s Great British 
Puds: Spotted Dick Slices; Trifle Bakewells; and Rhubarb & Custard Pies. These are proving to be a hit with consumers and are 
already on track to deliver increased YoY sales for the brand.

Hovis.
“Hovis branded volume increased by 
3.5% contributing to a 0.3pp increase 
in volume market share.”
Branded bakery sales grew 1.7% to £376m. Volumes were up 3.5% 
with pricing and mix reducing revenue by 1.8%. This reduction was 
a function of year on year promotional increases and wheat cost 
declines in the early part of the year which was equivalent to a 0.6% 
reduction in revenue. This merely reflects wheat input costs and has 
little effect on profitability. In Q4, this effect reversed as pricing was 
amended to reflect the sharp increase in the market cost of wheat. 
As a consequence, price and mix was 5.5% favourable in Q4. 
Branded sales benefited from the launch of our new Hearty Oats 
loaf and by market share gains in white bread. 
Hovis branded volume increased by 3.5% contributing to a 0.3pp 
increase in volume market share. Volume growth reflected success 
in growing sales of white bread. This volume growth was partially 
offset by pricing and mix as the proportion of bread sold on deal 
was higher in 2010 than in the previous year. As a consequence, 
market share in value terms decreased by 0.8pp to 24.9%.
In retailer brand bakery, sales were down 22.1% reflecting volumes 
down 21.1%. The majority of this fall reflected a 13.6% fall in the 
market volume for retailer brand bread as consumers switched to 
branded bread as increased promotional activity improved value. 
The remainder of the decline was due to exit of bread contracts  
and lower sales of other bakery products.

Hovis Hearty Oats “Sometimes it’s good to be good”
New Hovis Hearty Oats, the first ever loaf to be baked with 50% wholegrain oats and 50% Wheatflour
1
, launched into stores  
in 2010.
It has taken two years to develop this oat packed bread in association with HEART UK — The Cholesterol Charity. Just two slices 
of Hovis Hearty Oats contain 1.0g of beta-glucan, providing a quick and tasty way to get 1/3 of your daily suggested intake. As 
part of a healthy lifestyle and diet low in saturated fat, this has been shown to help maintain normal cholesterol levels.
Jon Goldstone, Group Marketing Director, says, “Hovis has a long history of innovation and a commitment to baking a range of 
healthy breads. We are extremely proud of Hovis Hearty Oats. Not only is it the first bread to be baked with 50% oats and 50% 
wheatflour, helping maintain normal cholesterol, but it is also uniquely approved by HEART UK.”
The launch of Hovis Hearty Oats was supported by a new marketing campaign including a Hearty Oats community website and a 
TV campaign with a new advert.

CASE STUDY
The total volume of bread sold fell by 3.4% with a 3.5% growth in Hovis 
offset by a 24.1% decline in other brands and non-branded bread. 
In Milling, pricing is closely related to raw material costs. The year on 
year decline in wheat cost in the early part of 2010 was thus largely 
mirrored in flour sales value. This effect has little effect on profitability 
and reversed in Q4 which saw a 13.0% contribution from pricing 
and mix. Volumes were down 4.1% owing to the loss of certain 
non-branded flour contracts owing to additional capacity causing 
competitive pricing in the market. Branded volumes were up 7.2% 
reflecting successful promotions of Elephant Atta. 
The lower volume in bread and milling was only partly offset by an 
improved mix of product. The effect was a £10m decrease in profit.
The combination of pricing, promotion and inflation in manufacturing 
costs was partially offset by lower input costs and efficiencies in 
manufacturing and this reduced profit by £9m. 
Operating expenses were £27m lower than in 2009. The main 
reduction was in distribution where efficiencies and lower fuel costs 
contributed to a £11m reduction in costs. Restructuring costs were 
£5m lower since there was high spend in 2009 for additional capacity 
and improved quality, not all of which was recurring. Marketing costs 
were £3m lower as the plans for marketing were scaled back in light 
of the difficult trading environment in the second half. Pension costs 
were £2m lower and other costs were £6m lower.
In conclusion, despite a rise in wheat costs, Hovis had another 
successful year growing trading profit by 25.8% to £39m aided 
by efficiencies. Branded growth continued as we launched our 
100% British wheat across the range. We remain confident of 
making further strategic progress with the brand in 2011 but are 
cautious about the continuing rise in the market cost of wheat and 
competitive pressures in Milling.

Chief Operating Officer
Since the acquisition of RHM the business has operated through a divisional 
structure. We are now returning to a more centralised structure with clear 
brand focus and functional alignment.
The first step in the process was the appointment of Tim Kelly as Chief 
Operating Officer, in January 2011, with responsibility for managing all 
brands across Premier. To ensure greater functional alignment we have 
created two new roles: Group Marketing Director and Group Technical 
Director, both of whom now sit on the Group Executive. This in turn will lead 
to greater focus on brand growth within our Drive and Core brands.

Chilled.
In the year, sales for the Chilled division decreased by 3.6%. In 
Brookes Avana, sales were down 4.7% owing to contract losses 
and lower volumes sold on existing contracts. Meat-free sales 
decreased 1.9%. Cauldron sales fell 9.6% as the market for 
premium and organic products fell 1.1%. Quorn sales decreased 
1.4%, a good result for a premium priced product in a recessionary 
environment. As guided at the half year, as a result of a refresh of 
the Quorn range of products, sales improved in the second half with 
sales up 0.4% versus a decline of 3.2% in the first half. 
Meat-free trading profit increased substantially in the year as better 
margins and lower supply chain costs were realised as a result of the 
changes made in 2009 and early 2010. Marketing costs were lower 
as the difficult consumer environment led us to minimise our activity
Brookes Avana trading profit was down substantially. The business 
operates in an industry characterised by overcapacity and, 
consequently, by decreasing margins. In the past the business 
has offset this by increasing volumes. In 2010, however, lower 
volumes were accompanied by lower margins as pricing on 
retained contracts was reduced by more than could be saved in 
manufacturing and operating expenses in the year. In addition, 
substantial escalations in the market cost of key commodities such 
as wheat, dairy products and packaging could not be recovered. 
Despite this severe downturn in profitability, we believe the Brookes 
Avana business continues to produce excellent quality products and 
that it has innovation credentials. We are in constructive dialogue 
with the main customer, Marks and Spencer, with regard to revised 
product ranges, pricing and supply arrangements which we believe 
will return the business to profitability in 2011.

2010, there was a cash outflow of £7m relating to creditors and 
provisions for exceptional items such as onerous leases which were 
provided in 2009. Disposals of fixed assets and some small defend

of the swap portfolio required us to settle early part of the locked

additional £8m was paid in fees to the bank group to permit the

New Cup a Pasta from Batchelors
To meet the increasing consumer demand for convenient, flexible meals on the go, Batchelors has added an exciting new 
product to its portfolio, Batchelors Cup a Pasta.
Cup a Pasta is a warm, filling pasta snack you make in a cup. Each product in the four strong range has less than 2% fat and 
takes only four minutes to prepare. Just add boiling water and stir! It’s available in Chicken, Tomato, Creamy Cheese and Roast 
Vegetable flavours.
 
Jo Marshall, Batchelors senior brand manager, said: “The new Cup a Pasta range is for the growing number of consumers 
looking for a quick, convenient snack but who are not prepared to compromise on taste. It’s perfect for home or work. Cup a 
Pasta has performed extremely strongly in consumer taste tests and complements our already successful range.” 
Batchelors is the No. 1 brand in the Hot Snacks category with a 44% share and is a trusted brand that consumers actively look 
for in store. This launch demonstrates our commitment to delivering innovation and driving category growth.
CASE STUDY
During the year one lease was converted from an operating lease 
to a finance lease in order to facilitate the sale of the Canning 
operations. This is shown as a £21m acquisition in fixed assets 
and a liability in Bank and other borrowings. No cash changed 
hands in 2010 and the amendment of the lease did not change the 
underlying lease payment profile. The assets were bought from the 
lessor in 2011 and around half were included in the net assets of the 
Canning business which we have agreed to sell.

Business review
“The financial position of the Group was substantially 
strengthened in the year by a reduction in net debt, derisking 
of the swap portfolio and the attainment of a credit rating.”
the non-economic element of the portfolio has been substantially 
reduced. Previously, the long swaps and the digital swaps 
represented an open risk to interest rates which could have resulted 
in a cash outflow of up to £450m in 2012 and 2013. As a result of 
the restructure, this risk has been removed. A settlement amount 
representing the mark to market of the instruments of £78m has 
been agreed for 2013. The remainder of the mark to market is 
accommodated by increasing the interest rate of the swaps from 
5.2% previously to the current 6.2%.
The only remaining non-economic hedging element is the Other 
Financial Instrument which represents a settlement of a previous 
long dated swap which is due in 2012. The terms of this instrument 
have been left unchanged. Unlike the agreed settlement on the 
other swaps, the value of this settlement varies with interest rates 
with the total risk approximately £10m. During the year, £8m of the 
settlement amount on this instrument was paid as part of the swap 
restructure.
The remaining settlement amounts are £32m due in 2012 and £78m 
due in 2013. In the event of a bond issue, part of the proceeds will 
be used to settle the £32m due under the Other Financial Instrument 
and £20m of the 2013 amounts.

The cost of the hedging swaps increased to £54m as interest 
rates fell. The cost of the additional interest on the non economic 
hedging digital swaps increased substantially but was mitigated by 
the swap restructure which avoided the cost in the fourth quarter. 
Nevertheless, the additional interest for three quarters of 2010 
exceeded that paid for the whole of 2009.

At December 2010 leverage is 3.44 times giving 24% headroom 
against the covenant test. Interest cover was 2.85 times giving 19% 
headroom against the covenant. There was adequate headroom 
against both the financial limits at year end. The interest covenant 
headroom was tighter than would normally be the case solely 
because of the additional interest payable under the digital swap for 
the first three quarters of the year. This has now been restructured 
hence reducing this cost for 2011. If this restructuring had been in 
place throughout 2010, interest cost would have been £7m lower 
giving an interest cover test of 3.02 and headroom of 26%. Although 
each will become tighter in 2011, we expect to continue to have 
adequate headroom. The maximum leverage ratio for 2011 is 3.90

Financial review continued
“Cash flow before non-recurring items was £124m, 
ahead of our target to generate at least £100m”.
At the end of 2010, the deficit was £321m on an IAS 19 basis 
which is equivalent to £235m net of deferred tax. This compares 
with £429m and £310m respectively in 2009. The discount rate 
used, which is based on the AA bond yield, decreased from 5.80% 
to 5.45% and the inflation rate assumption decreased from 3.50% 
to 3.45%. As a consequence, the real interest rate assumed fell 
from 2.30% to 2.00%. The size of the reported deficit will continue 
to be volatile based on market returns, movements in bond yields 
and future price inflation expectations. However, ongoing deficit 
contributions and improved hedging should mean that the medium-
term trend should be one of improvement and lower volatility.
The charge to trading profit was £9m versus £12m in 2009. The 
current service cost was £21m for the year versus £12m in 2009 
reflecting a significant reduction in real interest yields between 2008 
and 2009. Past service credits in relation to changes to two of the 
Group’s pension scheme rules reduced the total service charge 
to £9m. We expect the service cost to be around £20m in 2011. 
There are likely to be further past service charges or credits as 
the remainder of the Group’s future pension benefits provision is 
amended in 2011. 
Total cash paid to the pension fund including deficit funding was 
£66m in 2010 versus £65m in 2009. Deficit payments were £38m 
in 2010 versus £33m in 2009. The deficit payment in 2011 will be 
£48m before falling to £42m in 2012 and £38m in 2013.
The movement of the deficit is explained as follows:
Movement in pension fund deficit
     £m
 Gross deficit (Dec 2009)   (429)
 Total return on investment assets  241
 Movements on hedging assets   94

 Employer contributions   66
 Charge to trading profit   (9)
 Unwind of discount rate   (168)
 Expenses   (7)
 Gross deficit (Dec 2010)   (321)
In the year, actual investment return on assets was 13.2%. This 
exceeded expected returns of 7.2%. The benefits of hedging 
added a further £94m to assets. This offset some of the change in 
the liability discount rate which fell from 5.80% to 5.45% following 
the fall in AA corporate bond yields. Other assumptions, such as 
inflation rates, changed slightly and this reduced the deficit by £73m. 
Total contributions, including the additional deficit contributions by 
the Group, exceeded the cost of new benefit accruals and expenses 
paid by the fund.
The sensitivities of the pension funds are as follows:
     Impact on 
     liabilities 
     £m
 +/- 0.1% change in discount rate  (49)/51
 +/- 0.1% change in price inflation  18/(21)
 +/- 0.1% change in real salary growth  2/(2)
 +1 year life expectancy   117
     Impact on 
     assets
     £m
 +/- 10% on equity values   70/(70)
During the year, the Group agreed with the Trustees a programme to 
increase the amount of hedging between assets and liabilities within 
the funds. This should help to reduce the volatility of the deficit.
Discussions with the Trustees regarding the triennial actuarial 
valuations of the four UK pension schemes as at 5 April 2010 are 
continuing and the results should be known in the first half of 2011. 
The discount rate is expected to be based on the yield available on 
appropriate gilts plus 1% p.a. At April 2010 this was equivalent to a 
discount rate of 5.5% p.a. The other liability assumptions have not 
yet been finalised but will in aggregate contain additional prudence 
to those used in the IAS 19 figures given above. We expect the 
technical deficit to be around £550m. 
The Group has agreed with the pension fund Trustees a schedule 
of payments to reduce the deficit. The schedule of payments is 
agreed until 2014 and averages £40m a year. The agreement with 
the Trustees is that deficit contributions after 2014 will depend upon 
the 2013 actuarial valuation. The Trustees and the Group will aim 
to make up any deficit over the subsequent eight years until 2022. 
However, this is subject to affordability and hence the period can be 
lengthened or shortened accordingly. The 2010 valuation result, if 
it were confirmed at £550m, would imply an annual contribution of 
around £40m over the eight years to 2022.

Business review
The Group also took action in the year to reduce the rate at which 
the actuarial liabilities increase. This entailed proposing to close the 
final salary pension funds to future accrual. In its place we will offer a 
market competitive money purchase scheme for new starters and a 
market competitive career average scheme for existing pension fund 
members. These changes have been agreed with the unions and 
will be implemented in 2011. The result of the changes will be to 
leave the annual service charge at around the same level as before 
but to significantly cap the rate at which the defined benefit pension 
liability escalates.

Loss after tax was £99m versus a profit of £25m in 2009. Three 
factors contributed to this change. 
Firstly, 2009 had an exceptional charge for restructuring and 
refinancing. There were no exceptional items in 2010 other than the 
impairment charge discussed below. 
Secondly, in 2010, £125m of goodwill relating to Brookes Avana 
was impaired leaving goodwill for the business at £23m. The 
previous carrying value represents the original amount of goodwill 
based on the purchase price allocated to Brookes Avana when it 
was acquired as part of the RHM acquisition. The goodwill has been 
impaired reflecting the steep fall in profitability which the business 
has experienced this year and our view of the prospects for margins 
and input cost inflation in the near future. There was no equivalent 
impairment in 2009. 
Thirdly, the mark to market on the interest rate swap portfolio and 
other interest deteriorated by £46m whereas it improved by £25m 
in 2009. This volatility is a result of the Group’s not applying hedge 
accounting for the economic hedging portion of the portfolio and of 
the non-economic hedging portion which has now been addressed.

Basic earnings per share on a continuing basis was a loss of 
3.6 pence versus earnings of 1.7 pence in 2009. The reduction 
was caused by the negative mark to market on swaps and the 
impairment of goodwill. None of these items entail any cash flows.
Adjusted earnings per share is a better reflection of the underlying 
business performance. It uses trading profit, regular interest and a 
notional tax charge based on the statutory tax rate. In 2010 adjusted 
EPS was 5.0 pence. The equivalent pro forma figure for 2009 was 4.7 
pence. This accounts for the March 2009 equity issue and refinancing 
as if it had been in place for the whole year. This represents a 6.4% 
improvement driven by a reduction in regular interest.

Corporate social responsibility
Corporate social  
responsibility.
Over the year we have made further significant progress in our 4 
core Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) areas of Marketplace, 
Environment, Workplace and Community involvement. 
Our customers and consumers are increasingly concerned about 
the quality and provenance of the food they eat. They also want us 
to make sure that their food is sourced ethically, with concern for the 
environment, and that generally accepted animal welfare standards 
are practiced. 
2010 highlights 
• Ambrosia has moved to using milk certified by the ‘Dairy 
Assurance Scheme’ and applied the ‘Red Tractor’ logo on its 
core products packaging;
• Continued commitment to UK sourcing — Hovis bread made 
from flour 100% sourced in the UK;
• Environmental targets for reducing energy consumption, CO
2
e 
emissions, delivery miles, water use, waste to landfill and the 
Carbon (CO
2
e) intensity of our packaging all exceeded;
• Employees raised a fantastic £445,000 for our corporate charity 
partner ‘Cancer Research UK’; and 
• As from January 2011, Mr Kipling began using 100% free range 
eggs across the cake range.
A summary of our key achievements is provided in this section of 
the annual report and further details can be found in the CSR report 
which is available on our website.
Doing the right 
thing
Practising good environmental and 
social stewardship is in the best 
interest of stakeholders and also 
aligned with our overall business 
strategy to deliver long term and 
sustainable business growth.

Business review
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA)
Food and Beverage Sector Award: In 2010, RoSPA awarded The Food and Beverage Sector Award for Health and Safety to 
Premier Foods and 48 of our sites were individually awarded Health and Safety Achievement Awards. In addition to this, Premier 
Foods also received a Gold Award for their management of Occupational and At Work Road Risk. 
In winning the Sector Award, Premier Foods successfully demonstrated effective and continuously improving safety performance, 
providing evidence of its innovative approach to reducing risk, particularly through our Total Observation Process (TOPs).
CASE STUDY
We were able to make excellent 
progress in 2010 and exceed all our 
CSR targets. 
We are particularly pleased with the 
reduction of waste to landfill which 
has reduced by 65% since 2008 and 
leaves us well positioned to achieve 
our long term goal of zero waste to 
landfill by 2015.
In addition, our commitment to 
safety has led to another significant 
reduction in reportable accident 
rates.

Performance 
In 2010, we began to develop a Sustainable Procurement Roadmap 
(SPR) which is designed to further strengthen our approach 
to responsible sourcing and factoring in social, economic and 
environmental criteria to our procurement process in order to achieve 
real long term benefits. Our SPR will be delivered through an outcome 
focused action plan, with well-defined deliverables, setting out 
how we intend to embed sustainable sourcing practices within our 
procurement function. 
Our customers and consumers are increasingly concerned about 
the quality and provenance of the food they eat. They also want us 
to make sure that their food is sourced ethically, with concern for the 
environment, and that generally accepted animal welfare standards 
are practiced. 
Across the year, we continued to consolidate our support for UK 
producers. 
In 2010, 100% of the wheat used in our Hovis bread products was 
UK sourced, as were our milk and sugar. In addition to this, 80% 
of all the vegetables used in the manufacture of our great British 
brands came from British farmers. 
Corporate social responsibility continued
Marketplace.
Ambrosia is set to unveil a fresh new design this month and 
be back on prime time TV.
The new look should help consumers understand Ambrosia’s 
natural and wholesome qualities — there is a misconception 
that as Ambrosia sits in the ambient aisle that it is full of 
preservatives, which is untrue. The redesign is a radical move 
from the old look and places the countryside at the centre of 
the design, bringing the world of Ambrosia to life.
We are also introducing the Red Tractor logo onto packs, 
reassuring consumers that all of our milk can be traced back 
to the farms it comes from. This is a first for Premier Foods 
and a first for the ambient desserts category and we’re really 
proud to be registered with the scheme.

Premier Foods is aware of its responsibility to the environment and 
is committed to reducing the overall environmental impact of its 
operations by monitoring, managing and continually improving its 
environmental performance. Our aim is to achieve this by providing 
a comprehensive framework of good environmental management 
practices that are embedded across the Group and extend 
throughout our supply chain.
We will continue our drive to use resources more efficiently, which in 
turn reduces the environmental impact of producing our food, and 
saves money by reducing waste.
Five Star Environmental Award Programme.
The Premier Foods Five Star Environmental Award Programme 
(FSEAP), developed and launched in 2009, is fundamental to the 
delivery of the Premier Foods environment strategy.
The programme has been closely aligned with the environmental 
management standard ISO 14001, but places particular emphasis 
upon a sound practical approach and encourages businesses to 
integrate environmental management within all their operational 
activities. Unlike ISO 14001, the FSEAP incorporates a requirement 
for businesses to achieve specific targets for energy, water and waste.
In 2010 the FSEAP received an excellent response, with measurable 
performance improvement throughout. All our manufacturing sites 
achieved a satisfactory standard as a minimum in all categories, and 
we received an additional 20 gold and 29 silver awards compared to 
last year. 
Environment.
Hovis down-gauged their bread bag film and modified the 
dimensions to improve fit of the product in the bag. The 
project involved consumer group research to analyse ‘quality’ 
perceptions around the use of thinner film compared to the 
original bag.   
Using less material has delivered the following savings:
•	 550	metric	tonnes 	of	plastic	film
•	 1,485 	metric	tonnes 	of	CO

l eadership
Helping our people to deliver our plans and objectives is a major 
responsibility for all our leaders across the business. Therefore, to 
support our leaders we have developed the ‘Premier Way’ which 
highlights what we believe leadership is about at Premier Foods:
• Being passionate
• Delivering on our commitments and accountabilities
• Empowering and developing our people
• Doing the right thing
• Focusing on our customers and consumers
• Striving to be the best
Our rewards and benefits
Premier Foods offers employees a competitive pay and benefits 
package. All of our people are entitled to join the Company Pension 
Scheme, benefit from Company sick pay arrangements, and good 
annual leave entitlement. However in addition there are benefits 
such as Childcare vouchers, an Employee Assistance Programme, 
and an employee Sharesave scheme, which allows employees to 
save over a three year period to purchase shares in the Company 
at a discounted rate. Around 30% of our employees take the 
opportunity to participate in our Sharesave scheme. 
Development and training 
We are committed to providing high quality training and 
development initiatives to ensure we are equipped to deliver 
excellence in all we do. This has been further bolstered in 2010 
through the addition of a coaching and mentoring framework across 
the Group, enabling colleagues, where appropriate to benefit from 
coaching and mentoring. During the year we also introduced a 
broader portfolio of programmes which now includes coaching 
skills training, commercial awareness and many others, along with 
interventions provided functionally.
Career progression
Premier Foods actively encourages development from within. Our 
talent identification and succession planning processes are now 
becoming embedded across the business and our intention is to 
ensure we develop our internal pool of talent so we can resource 
roles internally wherever possible. To support this in 2010 Premier 
Foods further developed specific programmes to develop key 
individuals, this was based on the success of earlier initiatives where 
over 50% of the talent pool had been promoted.
However to anticipate future requirements we will also look to 
bring the right people into the business. As an example in 2009 we 
launched our first Finance Graduate Programme, aimed at giving 
us a pipeline of talented finance professionals for the future and in 
2010 we introduced graduates into supply chain roles across the 
Group to ensure we have a pipeline of talent in this critical area of 
the business.
Employee Assistance Programme
The Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) is a free, confidential, 
telephone and online counselling service for all employees which is 
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, across the entire year.
Occupational h ealth & Wellbeing
Occupational Health & Wellbeing provides professional, specialist 
health advice to employees on the following issues:
• The effects of work on health and of health on work
• Ways to improve physical and psychological well-being within 
the workplace
• Strategies to prevent illness and injury arising from work activity
Recruitment
Premier Foods is committed to a fair but robust approach to equal 
opportunities in all areas of our business. We recruit, train, promote 
and retain skilled and motivated people irrespective of sex, age, 
marital status, disability, sexual orientation, race, religion, ethnic 
or national origin. In line with this commitment we also promote a 
culture of openness and responsibility within our business.
It is our policy to give full and fair consideration to applications for 
employment received from disabled persons, having regard to 
their particular aptitudes and abilities; and wherever possible to 
continue the employment of, and to arrange appropriate training for, 
employees who have become disabled persons during the period of 
their employment. Premier Foods provides the same opportunities 
for training, career development and promotion for disabled as for 
other employees.
Communication
We recognise the value of good communication in engaging our 
employees in order to achieve common goals and we have a 
number of established employee consultation and communication 
mechanisms in place to achieve this goal, including: regular 
communication meetings; specific consultation and involvement 
regarding major changes to the business; the Company’s intranet 
site; and the quarterly Company magazine.

Business review
Following a sustained period of acquisition, integration and 
transformation, we felt it was important to communicate the 
Group’ s vision and strategy to employees during 2010 to ensure 
that the whole Group understood and was aligned with it. 
A route map of the journey Premier Foods was embarking 
on was designed (‘StratNav’) to help employees to navigate 
their way through the strategy, be excited by its potential 
and know their part in it. The cascade process started with 
60 senior managers who became StratNav ‘ambassadors’ 
and created the material. They took a further 600 managers 
through the StratNav at a one day conference in March 2010.
After the conference, this group of employees were given access 
to a micro-site from which they could download the conference 
materials and order StratNav briefing packs for use in onward 
communication to the remainder of our 16,000 employees.
The pre and post conference surveys showed that those who 
participated in the StratNav exercise at the conference not 
only felt informed about the vision (99%), but understand it 
(99%); and believed in it (97%).
Cascading our vision 
and strategy
CASE STUDY
Employee engagement
Premier Foods has surveyed its management population since 2007 
as we are continually striving to make improvements in the way we 
manage and develop our people, how we lead the business and the 
way in which we work. With a response rate of 90% the results in 
2010 demonstrated significant improvements in how we empower 
and develop our people and how proud our employees are of our 
products and brands. The results also highlighted an improvement 
in moving to “one” culture. The results also highlighted some areas 
of focus which we are addressing and we will survey the same 
population in September 2011 before moving to an all employee 
engagement survey in 2012.
Workplace h ealth & Safety
Over recent years, we have achieved very significant and 
demonstrable improvements in the Premier Foods’ Workplace 
Safety programme with 42% of our sites having reported zero 
RIDDOR accidents throughout 2010.
We are passionate about safety within are business and our 
performance compares very favourably with the UK Food 
Manufacturing Sector and UK Manufacturing Industry overall. 
Employee recognition awards
First introduced in 2008, the ‘Employee Recognition Awards’ is now 
in its third year. The awards recognise the huge effort our employees 
go to which contribute to our success and allow employees to see 
and learn about what success looks like. Each year our judges 
are more impressed by the huge number of employees with skill, 
dedication and creativity, despite the tough working environment we 
operate in. From 100 entries in the first year, the 2009 awards had 
180 entries. The 2010 awards have a staggering 230 entries and 
winners will be announced in April 2011.

Corporate h ealth & Safety Plan
The Corporate Health & Safety Plan ensures that a common 
strategy is adopted across our sites, applying a consistent ‘best 
practice’ approach to our Health & Safety management system 
and practice.
Initiatives which support our site teams in their efforts to drive our 
safety performance include:
• Safety Leadership: 585 Premier Foods’ employees have 
successfully completed a 2 day bespoke training programme, 
underpinning their competence in Health & Safety.
• As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) Workshops: 
Throughout our sites ALARP Workshops were run in which over 
200 Lead Risk Assessors were trained. In addition to this, to 
date approximately 500 additional ALARP Risk Assessors have 
been brought into the programme.
 The initiative was designed to ensure a more inclusive approach 
to undertaking the ‘suitable and sufficient’ risk assessments 
which drive our risk elimination and risk control programme. 
• Total Observation Process (TOP’s): During 2010, TOP’s teams 
across the country identified over 34,000 hazards. These were 
resolved thereby avoiding over 34,000 potential accidents to our 
workforce. 
 The TOP’s process demands the active engagement of all 
employees and provides them with a clear mandate to raise 
their health and safety concerns with their management and to 
collaborate with them in developing and implementing effective 
solutions.
 TOP’s, which underlines our fundamental approach to workplace 
safety, was further supported through the launch of a DVD 
detailing our effective preventative approach to workplace safety.

Support for the Royal British Legion’s 
2010 “Poppy Appeal” raised in excess  
of £140,000
5% of our sites completed a local 
community project
Provided 3,500 cartons of surplus food 
for redistribution to those in social need 
within the UK and abroad
Focus for 2011.
To raise £100,000 for our new Corporate 
charity partner “Help for Heroes”
To work in partnership with a number 
of organisations in making surplus food 
donations available to those in social 
need both in the UK and abroad
To develop a structured approach to 
Community Involvement across the 
Group
Community.
Our community and charitable efforts share common traits including 
celebrating all that is good about being “British”, capable of 
“National Reach” and focused on “Service Provision” — these are 
key factors that we look for when identifying which community and 
charitable initiatives to support.
Premier Foods believes that corporate charity sponsorship can bring 
genuine and lasting benefits to our Company, not only improving the 
public perception of our brands, but also improving our employees’ 
motivation.
Many of our sites have long histories with deep roots in their local 
communities. Each of our sites has a Community Champion 
who, along with their colleagues, decides which local charities 
and activities to get involved with and support. We feel that it’s 
important for employees to support local charities, and community 
organisations, because ‘they live there too’ and therefore have a 
personal stake in their communities’ wellbeing. 
In December 2010, our charity partnership with Cancer Research 
UK (CRUK) came to an end. The partnership proved a great 
success, all our employees really got behind fundraising activities 
for CRUK, so much so that employees raised £445,000 against an 
initial target to raise £250,000. 
 
In October 2010, we asked our employees to nominate their 
‘charity of choice’ for 2011. Employees were given 
the opportunity the vote for their favourite charity, either 
on-line, or via an insert included in the Company magazine 
‘Being Premier’. 
The only criteria were that the charity needed to be a 
‘national charity, recognised as British and providing a 
much needed service’. The charity ‘Help for Heroes’ (H4H) 
was the overwhelming choice of our employees, and we 
have committed to raise £100,000 in the first year of our 
partnership.

Risk management and risk factors
Risk management.
Suzanne Wise
General Counsel & Company Secretary
Risk Management at Premier Foods
Effective risk management is an integral part of the overall 
achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives. We have 
established a governance structure that supports the early 
identification and mitigation of key business risks and this has 
continued throughout 2010.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that business risks 
are effectively managed. The Board has considered and approved 
the risk management policy and risk appetite of the Company and 
has delegated the regular review of the risk management process 
to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also receives regular 
reports from the internal and external auditors and monitors 
progress against agreed action plans arising from control reviews. 
It also reviews the results of the Internal Control Self Assessment 
process which is conducted annually across the business. Details  
of this process are included in the section on Corporate 
Governance.
The Finance Committee, chaired by David Beever, non-executive 
director, has continued to meet regularly throughout 2010 to oversee 
the management of financial and financing risks and the activities of 
the Company’s Treasury Committee and Treasury Risk Management 
Committee. It includes as members the Company Chairman, two 
further non-executive directors, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer and Group Treasurer. Further details of the Board and 
its Committees are included in the section on Corporate Governance.
A Policy Steering Group has been established under the 
chairmanship of Suzanne Wise, General Counsel & Company 
Secretary. The Group meets quarterly and considers the effective 
implementation of corporate policies taking into account changes in 
regulation and other business risks. 
Day-to-day risk management is the responsibility of business 
management as part of their everyday business processes and is 
underpinned by the Company’ s policies and procedures to ensure that 
it is fully embedded. There is a structured business review process 
that operates across all divisions and this, along with the corporate 
governance framework as defined by the Board and Committee 
structure, further underpins the ongoing management of risk. 
Each division and Group function is also required to maintain a risk 
register which includes the key risks that have been identified, their 
potential impact and probability of occurrence, the risk owner, action 
and action owner along with timescales for effective mitigation. 
Every six months the risk registers are submitted to the Risk Review 
Group for review.
The Risk Review Group is chaired by Suzanne Wise, General 
Counsel & Company Secretary, and performs the following activities:
• Reviews the effectiveness of the risk management process and 
makes recommendations to the Audit Committee, as appropriate;
• Considers emerging risks and their potential impact on the 
Company, for onward review with the Group Executive; and
• Receives presentations from management and provides challenge in 
relation to risk mitigation actions and their effective implementation.
Every six months the Group Executive reviews the corporate risk 
register and assesses progress on the implementation of mitigation 
strategies along with consideration of new and emerging risks.
The results of each Group Executive risk review are presented to 
the Board for consideration. Additionally, once a year, a separate 
risk session is held with the non-executive directors without the 
presence of management. The purpose of this session is to provide 
additional challenge to the internal risk process by considering risk in 
its widest context, in particular taking account of the following:
• The world in which we operate;
•	 Our market place; and
• Premier Foods specific risks.
The results of the non-executive directors’ discussion form part of the 
overall process for reviewing the corporate risk register at the end of the 
financial year.

Business review
Review of Risks
External
A key risk facing the Group during 2010 has been the continued 
impact of the market downturn in the UK and its impact on our 
suppliers, customers and consumers. Premier Foods has a broad 
portfolio of staple food products and operates over a large number 
of categories and we believe that this makes us relatively resilient in 
periods of recessionary economic activity. As shown by our results 
for the year we have been successful in maintaining volumes despite 
a general slowdown in sales across our categories. However, 
margins have been impacted by an increase in promotional 
activity which has been experienced across our markets. We 
do not anticipate that this slowdown in sales and the increase in 
promotional activity will be a permanent feature but we do expect 
them to continue in 2011. 
We have also experienced inflation both within raw materials we 
use to produce our products and also with indirect supplies such 
as energy and packaging and we expect this to continue in 2011. 
However, we have a centralised procurement function with a 
global sourcing strategy. We have also demonstrated that we can 
successfully pass costs onto customers through pricing, albeit with 
a timing lag. 
Industry and market
To operate successfully in a competitive marketplace and to grow 
our sales we must continue to invest in new product development, 
innovation and marketing. We regularly monitor consumer trends 
and consumption habits and have a good track record of new 
product development. During the year we have introduced a new 
innovation process and increased resources for innovation and 
marketing. We have also moved to align our organisational structure 
to manage our Drive and Core brands together so that innovation 
can be managed as one pipeline. During the year the Board has 
also approved investment for a number of capital expenditure 
projects related to new product development. 
Strategic
The Group’s business strategy is set out on page 12 and our 
progress against this strategy is set out in this annual report. 
As highlighted above there has been an increased strategic focus 
on brand innovation and new product development and a change in 
the Group’s management structure. 
Operational 
The completion of the rationalisation programme within the 
Grocery division in 2009 has reduced a number of risks around 
operational capability in 2010. The rationalisation was one 
of the largest undertaken within the UK food industry and its 
success demonstrates Premier’s ability to manage major change 
programmes successfully. 
Further major projects are ongoing within the business both within 
our operations, systems and organisational structure. However, 
the Group has tested project management processes in place to 
mitigate these risks. 
Financial 
The Group’s financial strategy is set out on page 12. The Board and 
Finance Committee have worked closely with management and 
Premier has made significant progress in 2010 in implementing this 
strategy and thereby reducing financial risk. 
The Group restructured its interest rate swap portfolio in October. 
This acted to shorten the maturity of the swap portfolio, remove 
early termination options and reduce volatility thereby reducing the 
overall risk of the portfolio.
During the year the Group has reviewed the investment strategy of the 
pension funds and established an Investment Forum to foster greater 
dialogue with the trustees and to review and discuss investment 
strategy, performance and risk with the aim of reducing volatility within 
the funds. Following a review of current arrangements the Company 
has also announced the closure of the final salary pension scheme to 
further accrual from existing members from April 2011.
Premier Foods has also obtained a credit rating which will allow us 
to diversify our sources of funding and also stagger the maturity 
of our funding. Post-year end we have announced two significant 
business disposals which will significantly accelerate the Group’s 
debt reduction.
Effective management of risk is critical to achieving 
the Group’s strategic objectives, protecting our 
people and reputation and creating sustainable 
shareholder value.

Corporate governance report
Q. How is the Board structured?
A. On 31 December 2010 the Board consisted of a non-executive 
Chairman, three executive directors and five non-executive directors. 
In accordance with the Code separate individuals held the office

2011 Ronnie Bell, Robert Schofield, David Beever and David Wild 
(appointed on 7 March 2011) will seek re-election. David Felwick will 
be stepping down at the AGM 2011.
The independence, external experience and challenge non-executive 
directors bring to the Board is essential to its effective operation. The 
current non-executive directors bring extensive and broad ranging 
experience covering marketing, sales, commercial, retail, corporate 
finance, general finance and corporate governance. The Board 
considers that the non-executive directors, with the exception of 
Charles Miller Smith (as noted below), are independent in character and 
judgement.
Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement between the 
Company and Warburg Pincus, Charles Milller Smith, a senior 
adviser to Warburg Pincus LLC, was appointed to the Board. 
Under the agreement, Warburg Pincus, (with the agreement of the 
Company) may appoint to the Board a director so long as they 
retain a minimum interest of 239,802,158 shares in the Company.
Ronnie Bell is also chairman of Milk Link Ltd a supplier of milk to the 
Group. The Board reviewed this relationship on his appointment and 
was satisfied that it does not impact on his independence. Ronnie 
will absent himself from any discussions regarding Milk Link at the 
Board. 
Save as disclosed above no director had a material interest at any 
time in any contract of significance with the Company or Group 
other than their service contract. 
Biographies of the current directors and members of the Group 
Executive are provided on pages 48 to 50. Biographies of those

of the Group and for ensuring the implementation of Board strategy 
and policy within the approved budgets and timescales. Jim Smart, 
Tim Kelly and the Group Executive (who head up the Group’s 
principal operations and functions) assist Robert Schofield in 
meeting his responsibilities. 
Q. What are the Chairman’s responsibilities?
A. The Chairman’s responsibilities are primarily the leadership of 
the Board and ensuring its effectiveness. This is achieved by:
l Chairing Board meetings; setting the agendas in consultation 
with the Chief Executive Officer and Company Secretary; and 
encouraging directors’ active participation in Board discussions;
l Leading the performance evaluation of the Board, its committees 
and individual directors;
l Promoting the highest standards of corporate governance 
including compliance with the Code wherever possible;
l Ensuring timely and accurate distribution of information to the 
directors and effective communication with shareholders;
l Establishing an effective working relationship with the Chief 
Executive Officer by providing support and advice whilst 
respecting executive responsibility; and
l Periodically holding meetings with the non-executive directors 
without the executive directors present.
Q. Does the Chairman hold any other appointments?
A. Ronnie Bell is the non-executive Chairman of Milk Link Ltd and a 
director of The Edrington Group Ltd. 
Q. Does the Company arrange new director inductions?
A. Yes, all directors receive an induction on joining the Board, 
covering their duties and responsibilities as directors. Non-executive 
directors also receive a full briefing document on all areas of the 
Company’s business and they may request such further information 
as they consider necessary.
Q. Does the Company have insurance to cover the 
directors?
A. Yes, the Company purchases directors’ and officers’ liability and 
indemnity insurance. This insurance covers the directors and officers 
against the costs of defending themselves in civil proceedings taken 
against them in their capacity as a director or officer of the Company 
and in respect of damages resulting from the unsuccessful defence 
of any proceedings.
Q. How does the Board allocate its time? 
A. Below is a chart which summarises the approximate time the 
Board has spent discussing agenda items during the year to  
31 December 2010:
EFFECTIVENESS
Q. What is the mix between executive and non-executive 
directors on the Board?
A. The directors believe that there should be an appropriate 
combination of executive and non-executive directors on the 
Board. The Code states that at least half the Board (excluding the 
Chairman) should comprise non-executive directors. The current mix 
of directors is shown below (excluding David Wild, appointed on  
7 March 2011).
Q. What is the average length of time directors are 
appointed to the Board? 
A. The Board believes it is important to maintain an appropriate 
balance of length of service to ensure independent judgement and 
also an appropriate level of skills and experience. The Board regularly 
undertakes a review of succession plans for both executive and non-
executive directors. The length of service of the current non-executive 
directors is shown in the graph below against the average length of 
service, which currently stands at four years.
In addition, shareholders must approve the reappointment of the 
directors and accordingly at each AGM one-third of the directors 
(rounded down) will retire by rotation and be eligible for re-election. 
The directors to retire will be those who wish to retire and those who 
have served on the Board the longest since their last appointment or 
reappointment. Under the Current Articles every director must offer 
themselves for re-election every three years.

Corporate governance report continued
Q. Has the Company adopted the UK Corporate 
Governance Code’s recommendations for the annual 
re-election of directors?
A. During the year the Company discussed its policy on the re-
election of directors following the recommendations of the code. 
The Company is reviewing market practice in this area and intends 
to comply with the code requirements and adopt annual re-election 
with effect from the AGM 2012. During the transitional period re-
election will continue to be governed by the Company’s Articles.
Q. Does the Company offer the directors access to 
independent professional advice?
A. Yes, procedures are in place which allow directors to take 
independent professional advice in the course of their duties. In 
addition, all directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. If any director were to have a concern over any 
unresolved business issue they are entitled to require the Company 
Secretary to minute that concern. Should they later resign over this 
issue the Chairman would bring these concerns to the attention of 
the Board.
Q. How do we make sure our Board and its committees are 
effective?
Board and individual performance
Annually the Board carries out a performance review which 
measures its performance and that of its committees. It is the policy 
of the Board to conduct an external Board evaluation every three 
years. In 2009 an independent external review was conducted by 
Boardroom Review which involved one-to-one meetings with the 
Board and attendance at Board and committee meetings. 
For 2010 the review was carried out by way of a questionnaire and 
the findings of this review will be presented to the Board in March 
2011. Where possible the recommendations will be incorporated 
into the operation and practices of the Board and its committees. 
In addition, the Chairman carries out a performance review of 
each director on an annual basis. Appraisals are conducted by 
the Chairman for the Chief Executive Officer and by the Senior 
Independent Director (following discussions with the other non-
executive directors) for the Chairman.
Q. How frequently did the Board and committees meet in 2010? 
A. The Board held 11 scheduled meeting in the year and in addition four meetings were convened for specific business. Meetings are usually 
held at the Company’s head office in St Albans; however, twice a year the Board visits the Group’s operating facilities to see the business in 
action and hold their meetings. Details of the attendance at scheduled Board and committee meetings of all directors who held office during 
2010 are set out below:

Both Ian McHoul and David Beever have recent and relevant 
financial experience, Ian McHoul as the Chief Financial Officer of 
Amec plc and David Beever as a member of the KPMG Advisory 
Board.
Q. How many meetings were held during the year?

met with the internal and external auditors twice in the year without 
the presence of management. During the year the Committee was 
convened on two further occasions to deal with specific business. 
Attendance at the scheduled meetings is shown in the table on 
page 56.
Q. What is the role of the Committee?
A. The Committee has been delegated authority by the Board to:
l Monitor financial reporting including the annual and interim 
reports, preliminary results announcements and formal 
announcements relating to financial performance and reporting;
l Ensure the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and 
risk management systems;
l Review and update the whistle-blowing arrangements;
l Monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function, including the approval of any appointment or 
removal of the head of the internal audit function;
l Consider and make recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of external auditors 
including the setting of their remuneration; and
l Review the external auditors’ independence which includes 
reviewing the impact of any non-audit services provided by the 
Group’s external auditors to the Board.
Q. Who are the Group’s auditors?
A. Since the Company was listed on the London Stock Exchange 
in July 2004 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) have been the 
Group’s auditors. Annually the Committee reviews the relationship 
the Company has with PwC and for the year ended 31 December 
2010 the Committee considered that the relationship was working 
well and remains satisfied with their effectiveness. Accordingly, the 
Committee does not consider it necessary to require PwC to tender 
for the Group’s audit work. 
The external auditors are required to rotate the audit partners 
responsible for the Group and subsidiary audits every five years. 
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s 
choice of external auditors. At the AGM 2011 the re-election of PwC 
as the Group’s auditors will be proposed to shareholders.
Audit 
Committee.
The Committee has responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s financial reporting system and the internal control 
policies and procedures for the identification, assessment 
and reporting of risk. The Committee also keeps under review 
the relationship with the auditors, including the terms of their 
engagement and fees, their independence and expertise, resources 
and qualification, and the effectiveness of the audit process.
  
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website.

Finance 
Committee.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the Group’s financial 
strategy and approving any changes to this strategy, it oversees 
the Group’s treasury operations and policies including the use of 
financial instruments such as interest rate swaps. The Committee 
also reviews the investment strategy and performance of the 
Group’s pension schemes.  
 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website.
Q. What non-audit services were provided by the Group’s 
auditors during the year?
A. There is an established policy governing the engagement of 
PwC for non-audit services designed to ensure that any services 
provided do not impair the objectivity of the external auditors. The 
policy includes a fee limit for the provision of non-audit services, 
above which a formal tender process must normally be undertaken. 
During the year PwC were employed to complete a number of 
projects as part of the Group’s review of financing arrangements, 
most notably in connection with obtaining a formal credit rating and 
the restructuring of the Group’s swap portfolio. Fees incurred during 
the year in relation to this work amounted to £1.2m. 
Before commissioning PwC to undertake this work the Committee 
reviewed the proposal in detail with both management and PwC 
to assess any potential threat to their independence. In the case 
of work carried out during the year it was assessed that PwC were 
best placed to perform these additional services in view of their 
knowledge of the business, the time constraints in completing the 
work and likely cost.
The Committee is aware of the investor guidelines in respect of non-
audit fees and has agreed with management to bring the levels of 
non-audit fees down in subsequent years.
Q. What key issues did the Committee discuss during  
the year?
A. During the year the Committee:
l  Received regular reports from the internal audit function, 
ensured it was adequately resourced, monitored its activities and 
effectiveness, and agreed the annual audit plan; 
l  Conducted a review of the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function including internal control self assessments;
l  Considered the external auditors’ report for the year ended 31 
December 2009 and reappointed the external auditors;
l  Conducted an internal review of the Group’s external auditors 
which included a review of the auditors’ independence, 
objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process;
l  Reviewed the non-audit services spend policy and approved the 
engagement of PwC as an adviser in relation to certain internal 
projects;
l  Approved the Company’s risk management policy and key 
business risks; and

ACCOUNTABILITY
Q. How does the Board ensure internal controls are 
effective?
A. The Board conducts an annual review of the Group’s systems of 
internal control and their effectiveness in accordance with the Turnbull 
guidance. The Board has delegated authority to the Audit Committee 
to regularly monitor internal controls and conduct the annual review. 
This review covers all material controls such as financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk management systems in place 
throughout the year under review and up to the date of this annual 
report. Processes underpinning the financial reporting systems are 
managed and monitored by line and financial management. Following 
the Audit Committee’s review the Board receives a report of their 
findings for discussion and to implement the necessary actions to 
remedy any control weaknesses.
Data in the Group’s financial statements is reconciled to the 
underlying financial systems. A review of the data is undertaken to 
ensure that the true position and results of the Group are reflected, 
through compliance with approved accounting practices.
Q. What are the aims of the internal control system?
A. The internal control systems principally provide an ongoing 
process that identifies, evaluates and manages the risks that 
are significant in relation to the fulfilment of the Group’s business 
objectives. The systems are designed to manage rather than to 
eliminate risk and provide reasonable but not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The system also supports 
management’s decision-making, improves the reliability of business 
performance, and assists in the preparation of the Company’s 
consolidated accounts.
Q. How does the Company’s internal audit  
programme work?
A. Each year the Audit Committee meets to discuss and approve 
the nature and scope of the audit programme for the year. The Audit 
Committee then instructs the internal audit function to undertake 
the agreed schedule of audits during which the effectiveness of the 
controls operating within the business are reviewed. Occasionally 
additional audits are added to the schedule in circumstances such 
as the acquisition or disposal of a business or any other significant 
business development.
In addition, the completion of comprehensive internal control self 
assessment questionnaires are required from senior business managers 
within each business unit. These self assessment questionnaires 
are designed to ensure that any material control breakdowns are 
highlighted and the operation of internal controls are addressed 
within their respective business units. T o ensure their accuracy these 
assessments are tested as part of the Internal Audit Process. The 
results are initially reviewed by the divisional units and then the Group 
Executive prior to formal review by the Audit Committee. 
Further information on risk management and risk factors can be 
found on pages 46 to 47.

Governance
Q. How is the Board updated on the latest shareholder 
information?
A. The Board receive a detailed investor relations update at each 
Board meeting which covers (amongst other things), share price 
movements, shareholder movements and analyst reports. 
Q. What happens at the AGM?
A. The AGM usually takes place in London and is an opportunity 
for all shareholders to ask questions and vote on the resolutions put 
forward by the Board. At least 20 working days before the AGM 
shareholders receive the Notice of AGM, a copy of this Report (if they 
request a copy in writing) and a Form of Proxy. 
The Notice of AGM sets out the proposed resolutions and a brief 
synopsis of each. Shareholders are invited to either attend the AGM in 
person or appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf. Voting at the AGM 
is by poll as this gives a more democratic outcome given that the 
proxy votes are added to the votes cast in person. Details of the proxy 
votes for, against and withheld are made available on the Company’s 
website after the AGM.

Information on the impact to the Company as required by the 
Takeover Directive is given in the directors’ report (see page 53) and

COMMUNICATION
Q. How does the Company engage with shareholders?
A. The primary role of the Board is to represent and promote the 
interests of its shareholders as well as being accountable to them for 
the performance and activities of the Company.
The Board believes it is very important to engage with its 
shareholders and does this in a number of ways through 
presentations, conference calls, face-to-face meetings and the 
AGM. Following the announcement of the Company’s half year 
and year end results presentations are made to analysts and major 
shareholders to update them on the progress the Company has 
made towards its goals and invite them to ask questions. 
Following the announcement of the Company’s trading updates 
and interim management statements conference calls take place 
with analysts and major shareholders to update them on Company 
progress. Full reports on all shareholder presentations are available 
on the Group’s website (www.premierfoods.co.uk). The website also 
contains all London Stock Exchange announcements released to 
the market. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are also 
available to meet with shareholders during the year. The Chairman, 
Deputy Chairman and Senior independent director are available 
to discuss the issues and concerns of shareholders and welcome 
questions posed to the Board and committees.

Directors’ remuneration report
Directors’ remuneration report
PART 1: UNAUDITED INFORMATION
This report, prepared by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) on behalf of the Board, has been prepared pursuant to Schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the Listing Rules issued by the FSA.
Dear Shareholders
This year the Remuneration Committee has undertaken a full-scale review of our approach to remuneration. This is the first time the 
remuneration structure has been fully reviewed since 2007, and the external market and the goals of Premier Foods have clearly changed 
over the past four years.
Although remuneration serves various functions such as attracting and retaining key talent, we approached the review with the intention 
that the outputs should be primarily driven by our corporate strategy. You will see that we have not looked to increase overall levels of 
variable pay as part of this review.
As stated elsewhere in the annual report, our current corporate priorities are:
l Growing our branded sales faster than their respective markets by strengthening our brands;
l Gaining a competitive advantage by utilising our consumer insight to deliver value to customers;
l Delivering efficiency benefits such that supply chain costs and overheads are held flat or decline while volumes grow; and
l Focusing on cash generation and debt reduction.
The combination of sales growth, improvements in margin and increasing trading profit will all help to reduce our debt levels, and this 
should ultimately be positive for shareholder value. As part of the review, our objective was to design a framework whereby management 
would be incentivised towards achieving these corporate goals.
Overall, we have looked to design a cohesive structure — a bonus plan linked to generating profit and cash flow, a deferred share  
bonus which is linked to branded sales volumes to increase our market share, and a long term plan which drives long term EPS growth 
and ultimately delivery of share price growth. Further details regarding the structure are set out in the remuneration report below.
In January 2011, the Committee carried out a consultation exercise with major shareholders and investor bodies and comments received 
as part of this exercise have been reflected in the proposals set out below. As part of the new arrangements the Company intends to 
seek shareholder approval for the new Long Term Incentive Plan at the AGM 2011.
This has undoubtedly been a busy year for the Remuneration Committee; however, we believe that the new remuneration structure will 
help to support the Company to successfully deliver its strategy over the short and longer term.

 Following the retirement of Christine Cross, the number of Committee members temporarily fell below the recommended level of three. It was originally 
anticipated that an additional non-executive director would be appointed to the Board during the year, however this was postponed due to the appointment of 
the new Chairman and it was therefore agreed that David Beever and Ronnie Bell would be appointed in November 2010.
During the year the Committee held five meetings. Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the attendance table on page 56.
Q. Who advises the Committee?
A. Deloitte were appointed by the Committee as their retained 
advisers in 2005 and continue to provide advice to the Committee 
on matters relating to remuneration, including best practice. During 
the year Deloitte also provided tax and organisational consulting 
services to the Group. Additional advice in relation to remuneration 
was provided to the Company’s senior management by HNBS.
Q. What is the role of the Committee?
A. The Committee is committed to principles of accountability 
and transparency to ensure that remuneration arrangements 
demonstrate a clear link between reward and performance. In its 
work, the Committee considers fully the relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements, provisions and recommendations of the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance and associated guidance. 
The Committee has been delegated authority by the Board to: 
l Determine and agree the remuneration strategy for executive 
directors and senior managers — it is vital to our business that 
we retain individuals and reward performance and contributions 
towards the success of the Company;
l Review and approve the remuneration packages for the 
Chairman, executive directors, Company Secretary and senior 
managers;
l Determine the terms of employment including recruitment and 
termination terms of executive directors, ensuring any payments 
on departure are fair to the individual and the Company, whilst 
avoiding payment for failure and recognising the departing 
individual’s duty to mitigate loss; 
l Approve the design of all share incentive plans including all-
employee share schemes and where appropriate oversee any 
subsequent changes; and
l Review and recommend appropriate performance conditions 
and targets for the variable element of remuneration packages 
and determine the extent to which performance targets have 
been achieved.
The full terms of reference for the Committee can be found on the 
Company’s website (www.premierfoods.co.uk) or can be obtained 
from the Company Secretary. 
Q. What key issues did the Committee discuss during  
the year?
A. During the year the Committee:
l Undertook a full-scale review of remuneration arrangements for 
senior executives, designed new incentive arrangements, and 
consulted with shareholders on the changes (a detailed summary 
of the proposed changes is set out below);
l Performed an annual review of executive directors’ and senior 
managers’ base salaries for 2010;
l Approved the 2010 awards under the CIP and LTIP; 
l Reviewed and recommended executive directors’ and senior 
executives’ annual bonuses in respect of 2009 (including where 
appropriate deferral into the Deferred Bonus Scheme) and set 
the targets for the annual bonus in respect of 2010;

REMUNERATION POLICY
Q. What is the overall remuneration policy?
A. The broad policy of the Board and the Committee is to continue 
to set remuneration levels so as to attract and retain high calibre 
executives and to encourage and reward superior business 
performance.
Remuneration for executive directors is intended to reward against 
criteria that are relevant and realistic but also challenging, so that 
superior performance is encouraged. The remuneration policy is 
reviewed annually to ensure performance-related incentives, as 
well as annual salary, are supportive of operating objectives and 
conducive to delivery of shareholder value.
Our policy is to rigorously test, review and set salaries at levels 
not normally exceeding market rates against relevant comparator 
companies taking into account factors such as revenue, market 
share and complexity. In relation to bonuses and long term incentive 
plans, the policy is to provide an opportunity for executives to earn 
more significant levels of total remuneration but only if stretching and 
demanding performance conditions are met.
The remuneration policy in place for senior executives is designed to 
complement the Company’s overall corporate strategy and intended 
to place emphasis on delivery of key performance objectives. 
Executive directors should have sufficient focus on the long term 
performance of the Company and be aligned with the interests 
of shareholders and we are therefore committed to the use of 
equity-based performance-related schemes, and further encourage 
executives to build up meaningful shareholdings in the Company.
In determining the remuneration arrangements for executive 
directors, the Committee is sensitive to the pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining 
base salary increases (if any) and reviews the proposed pay awards 
for the Company at large with the Chief Executive Officer.
During the year the Committee undertook a review of the 
remuneration arrangements for senior executives in the Group. 
The details of the arrangement are set out below. The revised 
remuneration arrangements remain consistent with the broad policy 
set out above.
Q. Are there guidelines for executive directors to own shares 
in the Company?
A. The Committee believes that shareholding guidelines can 
be an effective means of aligning directors’ interests with those 
of shareholders. Since 2006 all executive directors have been 
expected to build a holding of shares within three years of 
appointment at least equal to their annual salary (valued at the time 
of purchase). Details of directors’ shareholdings are set out on  
pages 69 to 71.
Q. What is the balance between fixed and variable elements?
A. Executive directors were remunerated through a combination 
of base salary, annual bonus, pension, benefits and share-based 
performance-related remuneration. The Committee believes that it is 
important for a significant proportion of their remuneration package 
to be performance-related. 
At target performance around 57% of the package for executive 
directors is based on variable elements, increasing to around 71% 
where maximum targets are achieved. For the purpose of this 
comparison, fixed remuneration relates to base salary only, whilst 
the variable remuneration includes both annual bonuses and long 
term incentive arrangements. 
DIRECTOR REMUNERATION: FIXED PAY
Q. What salaries do the executive directors receive?
A. Salary levels are set with reference to the relevant marketplace, 
and incorporate an assessment by the Committee of the 
responsibilities and performance of the individual. Salaries for senior 
executives are generally reviewed annually and any changes take 
effect from 1 April, unless there is a significant change in role or 
areas of responsibility.
The Committee considers that the current salary levels are within 
an appropriate market range based on a review of salary levels 
prevalent amongst companies of a comparable revenue. 
The Committee is sensitive to the pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining any base 
salary increases. Executive directors received no pay increases in 
2010 (or in 2009 in respect of Robert Schofield). Where relevant, 
salary is the only pensionable component of remuneration. Bonuses 
are based on base pay i.e. excluding payments in lieu of pension.

DIRECTOR REMUNERATION: VARIABLE PAY
During the year the Committee carried out a full review of all aspects 
of remuneration for the senior executive population which covers 
about 180 individuals. The main conclusion of this review was that 
the Company should have a new set of incentive arrangements for 
2011 and future years, which better support the corporate strategy 
and are more effective from an HR perspective. 
In January 2011, the Committee carried out a consultation exercise 
with major shareholders and investor bodies and comments 
received as part of this exercise have been reflected in the proposals 
set out below. As part of the new arrangements the Company 
intends to seek shareholder approval for a new Long Term Incentive 
Plan (new LTIP) at the AGM 2011. 
Alignment of incentive arrangement with Group strategy
The proposals for the structure of 2011 incentives for the executive 
directors comprise four elements: annual cash bonus; deferred 
share bonus; new LTIP Performance Shares; and new LTIP 
Matching Shares. The driving factors behind the proposed changes 
are to improve line of sight so that executives can clearly see how 
their actions lead to their reward and to have incentives that have 
specific and clear goals, as described below:
l Annual cash bonus — This element will continue to be based 
on operational and individual performance targets.
l New deferred share bonus (DSB) — This award will be linked 
to a Group-wide strategic measure which for the 2011 financial 
year will be growth in sales volume of branded products. The 
awards will be deferred into shares to provide alignment with 
shareholders as well as enhance retention.
l New LTIP — Awards under this plan are made up of 
Performance Shares and Matching Shares. The new LTIP will 
initially be based on three-year adjusted EPS and absolute share 
growth targets for Performance Shares and Matching Shares 
respectively, which are aligned with the key areas of focus for 
shareholders.
The new structure is intended to support delivery of the corporate 
strategy and the proposals are not intended to increase overall levels 
of variable pay for executive directors. Award levels and participation 
below main Board level will be appropriately calibrated based 
on seniority. However, it is envisaged that the use of consistent 
metrics and targets across grades will harmonise areas of focus for 
the senior executive population as part of a unified remuneration 
strategy.
These proposals and the decision to seek shareholder approval 
for the new LTIP have been arrived at following a comprehensive 
review of remuneration. The proposed policy has the following key 
advantages:
l The new suite of incentives will be focused on the delivery of the 
corporate strategy;
l Participants will be provided with a more tangible and visible link 
between reward and performance which results in creation of 
shareholder value; and
l The structure and balance of incentives is also intended to be 
more conventional in nature and reflective of typical FTSE 350 
market practices.
 Name  Salary 2010 Salary 2011
 Robert Schofield  £606,900 £625,107
 Jim Smart  £430,000 £442,900
 Tim Kelly  £352,275 £399,357
Tim Kelly’s salary was increased to £399,357 which recognised 
both his appointment as Chief Operating Officer with responsibility 
for both the Grocery and Hovis divisions with effect from 1 January 
2011 and a 3% increase from 1 April 2011. All three executive 
directors will receive a 3% pay increase from 1 April 2011.
Q. What pension benefits do the executive directors receive? 
A. All pension figures are set out below in the audited section of the 
report. A brief overview of each director’s benefits is detailed below:
Robert Schofield
Robert Schofield elected for enhanced protection under the Finance 
Act 2004 with effect from 6 April 2006, and thus opted out of the 
Premier Foods Pension Scheme (PFPS) for future service accrual. 
Instead he receives an allowance in lieu of pension accrual which 
increases in line with the increase in the PFPS “earnings cap”. His 
benefit accrued up to 6 April 2006 continues to be linked to his final 
salary, subject to the PFPS “earnings cap”. Robert Schofield has 
80% of salary above the “earnings cap”.
Jim Smart
Jim Smart receives an allowance in lieu of pension accrual, which 
increases in line with the increase in the PFPS “earnings cap”. Jim 
Smart has 71% of salary above the “earnings cap”.
Tim Kelly
Tim Kelly is a member of the RHM Pension Scheme (RHMPS) which 
is a funded, registered scheme that provides benefits on a defined 
benefit basis. Under the RHMPS he is entitled to pension at the rate 
of 1/25th of pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service. 
Pensionable salary for this purpose is subject to an “earnings cap” 
broadly related to that previously imposed by the Finance Act 1989. 
This pension is subject to certain restrictions set down in the Scheme 
Rules. In 2009 the Scheme restrictions applied and his accrual was 
restricted to 1/30th. The restrictions did not apply in 2010, so his 
accrual is 1/25th. He receives a salary supplement in lieu of receiving 
no pension in respect of these earnings above the “earnings cap”. 
Tim Kelly has 65% of salary above the “earnings cap”.
Q. What additional benefits do the executive directors 
receive?
A. Each executive director is entitled to a car allowance and 
fuel cost, private health insurance, telecommunication services, 
relocation, memberships and an allowance for personal tax and 
financial planning.  Premier Foods plc  Annual report and accounts 2010  66

SHORT AND MEDIUM-TERM INCENTIVES
Q. What annual cash bonuses do the executive directors 
receive?
A. Each year the Committee sets individual performance targets 
and bonus potentials for each of the executive directors. Annually 
the Committee reviews the level of achievement against the 
performance targets set and based on the Committee’s judgement 
approves the bonus of each executive director. Annual bonus 
payments are not pensionable.
Performance targets for 2010 were set such that 60% of the 
bonus was based on the delivery of trading profit, 20% was linked 
to the year end debt figure and the remaining 20% linked to the 
achievement of personal performance targets. 
The Committee believes the overall balance of the bonus plan has 
worked well and therefore, for 2011, the metrics and weightings for 
the bonus scheme will remain unchanged save that recurring cash 
flow will replace the target relating to the year end debt figure. The 
Committee believes that the combination of metrics are supportive 
of strategy since, trading profit is driven by sales and margin, while 
cash flow repays debt. 
The annual cash bonus potentials for 2011 will remain at the 2010 
level of 75% of salary for each of the executive directors.  
In previous years, to help directors build up a significant 
shareholding in the Company, directors were provided with a facility 
to voluntarily defer a portion of the cash bonus into Company 
shares. Following the implementation of the DSB and long term 
incentive arrangements, it is not envisaged that any further deferrals 
will be made under this arrangement.
Q. How will the DSB operate?
A. The DSB will operate alongside the cash annual bonus. 
Executive directors can earn an award based on the achievement of 
a Group-wide strategic target which will be set at the start of each 
financial year. If the objective is met, the bonus will be paid at the 
end of the financial year in shares deferred for a period of two years. 
These shares will be subject to forfeiture over the period of deferral. 
All shares for these awards will be sourced in the market.
For 2011 it is proposed that a target based on total volume sales 
of branded products growth is used, as it provides a clear link to 
the strategy of continuous improvement in the sales of branded 
products. For a deferred bonus to be payable the Group trading 
profit target must also be met. For above target payout the 
Committee shall also retain discretion to reduce the payouts for 
reasons of affordability.
For 2011 the maximum award to executive directors under this 
element will be 25% of salary.
In line with best practice, the Committee will also retain the ability 
to adjust unvested awards in the event that the Company’s financial 
results for the relevant bonus year are found to have been materially 
misstated or if the basis for awards is found to have been made on 
inaccurate or misleading information.

LONG TERM INCENTIVES
As noted above, during the year the Committee reviewed the 
structure of long term incentives. As a result of this review, 
it is proposed that a new long term incentive scheme will 
be implemented in 2011, and this plan will be presented to 
shareholders at the AGM 2011. Further details regarding the 
operational features of the new plan are set out in the Notice  
of AGM.
Q. How will the new long term incentives be structured?
A. The awards under the new LTIP will have two elements:
— Performance Shares
— Matching Shares
Performance Shares will be based on adjusted EPS performance. 
The Matching Shares will require participants to make an investment 
into Company shares and will be based on absolute share price 
growth targets.
Under the rules of the new plan, the maximum grant of Performance 
Shares and Matching Shares will be 200% of salary. However these 
limits will not be utilised in the current year. 
In respect of 2011, it is proposed that executive directors will be 
granted a Performance Share award of 75% of salary and will 
be allowed to invest up to 37.5% of salary in order to receive a 
maximum Matching Share award of up to 75% of salary. Overall, 
the maximum incentive opportunity under the long term incentive 
scheme has been reduced from awards granted under the Co-
Investment Plan between 2007 and 2010.
In line with best practice and consistent with the approach taken 
for the DSB, the Committee will also retain the ability to adjust 
unvested awards in the event that the Company’s financial results 
for a relevant performance year is found to have been materially 
misstated or if the basis for awards is found to have been made on 
inaccurate or misleading information. 
Q. What are the performance conditions for the Performance 
Shares?
A. For the 2011 grant, the Performance Share element of the 
new LTIP will be linked to growth in adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS) targets. EPS captures both improvements in the trading 
performance and the earning of cash to pay down debt, thus 
reducing the interest charge. 
The Committee is proposing to set targets which would require 
delivery of outstanding performance in 2013, and considerable 
growth on adjusted EPS for 2010. Achievement of the EPS target 
needed for full vesting would require improvements in operating 
performance and a significant reduction in the Group’s financing 
costs. In future years, the Committee will set targets of an equally 
challenging nature, but which are not likely to have the same high 
percentage growth numbers.

 Pro rata between RPI + 4% and +19% pro rata 25% to 100%
 RPI + 19%   100%
1
  EPS performance will be measured over three financial years commencing 
with the financial year in which a performance share award is granted.
Q. What are the performance conditions for the Matching 
Shares?
A. For the 2011 grant, the Matching Share element will be subject 
to absolute share price growth targets. In order to fully recognise 
value created for shareholders, the targets will include reinvestment 
of dividends paid during the period. The Committee considered 
feedback from the Company’s largest shareholders when selecting 
this metric, and concluded that for the current year absolute share 
price targets were more appropriate than relative performance 
hurdles which have been utilised under previous schemes. 
As with the EPS performance condition, the share price targets will 
ultimately capture both improvements in the trading performance 
and the earning of cash to pay down debt. In addition, the 
achievement of the performance hurdles set for vesting will also 
require the Company’s shares to be re-rated, thus providing a clear 
link with the priorities of the Company’s largest shareholders. The 
Committee will continue to monitor whether this approach remains 
appropriate for grants in future years.
Under the terms of the plan, participants will be able to receive 
a match of up to 2:1 on shares invested into the scheme. The 
proposed targets and vesting schedule for Matching Shares for the 
2011 awards are:
    Vesting 
    percentage 
 Share price in 2014   for maximum 
 (including reinvested   Matching 
 dividends)   Shares
 37p or lower   0%
 Pro rata between 37p and 80p  pro rata 0% to 100%
 80p or higher   100%
The closing share price will be the average share price for the three 
months after the announcement of the 2013 preliminary results. In 
order for awards to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that the 
share price performance is reflective of the Company’s underlying 
financial performance.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Q. What executive share plans did the Company use  
in 2010?
A. In 2010, awards to executive directors and senior managers 
were granted under the Co-Investment Plan (CIP). At more junior 
levels, the Company granted awards under the old LTIP . 
In summary, the CIP was a three year share matching plan based 
on the achievement of performance conditions. Participants pledge 
or purchase shares in the Company which the Company can 
choose to match to reward achievement of performance targets. 
The maximum share match ratio is 3:1, which is only given for the 
achievement of exceptionally stretching targets. For awards granted 
in 2010, the matching award was subject to EPS and relative TSR 
performance. Details of the 2010 CIP award were set out in full in 
the 2009 remuneration report.
It is not anticipated that any further awards would be granted under 
the CIP . Full details of outstanding CIP awards can be found on 
page 71.
Q. Does the Company operate any all-employee share 
plans?
A. The Company runs an all-employee Save As You Earn (SAYE) 
scheme which executive directors can join on the same terms as 
other participants. 
The SAYE scheme is approved by HMRC and is available to all 
employees (including executive directors) who meet certain basic 
eligibility criteria, and are not subject to any performance conditions. 
The SAYE schemes offers employees the opportunity to join a 
regular monthly savings contract for a period of three years at the 
end of which the employees have the opportunity to purchase 
shares in the Company with their savings at the share price set at 
the beginning of their savings contract. 
Due to differences in the applicable share scheme legislation in the 
UK and Ireland the Company offers two SAYE schemes; one to our 
UK employees and another identical scheme to our Irish employees.
Q. What are the terms of the executive director service 
contracts?
A. The Committee periodically reviews its policy on the duration of 
notice periods and termination provisions of its executive directors 
and along with the Company believes that these entitlements 
continue to be appropriate. 
Details of the service agreements of the executive directors of the 
Company appear below:
    Unexpired 
  Notice Contract term 
 Executive director period date of contract
 Robert Schofield 12 months 20 Jul 2004 Rolling contract
 Jim Smart 12 months 11 Feb 2009 Rolling contract
 Tim Kelly 12 months 5 Oct 2009 Rolling contract
Q. Are the executive directors compensated in the event of 
termination of contract?
A. In the event of termination (other than for a reason justifying 
summary termination in accordance with the terms of the service 
agreement) the Company may (but is not obliged to) pay to the 
executive directors, in lieu of notice: salary, benefits and pension 
contributions during the notice period (calculated on a pro rata 
daily basis). Termination payments may be made in instalments and 
to the extent that the executive director receives any sums as a 
result of alternative employment or provision of services while they 
are receiving such termination payments, the payments shall be 
reduced by the amount of such sums. 
On-target bonus payments in lieu of notice are included in the 
service agreements for Robert Schofield and Jim Smart. The 
Committee believes that these entitlements continue to be 
appropriate in certain circumstances when recruiting executive 
directors. However, the Committee continues to monitor this policy 
in the context of evolving market practice in this area. 
The service agreements of executive directors do not provide for 
any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the 
Company.
Q. What is the Company’s policy on executive directors 
holding external appointments?
A. The Company is supportive of executive directors who wish 
to take on a non-executive directorship with a publicly quoted 
company in order to broaden their experience. They are entitled to 
retain any fees they may receive. Tim Kelly was until 31 December 
2010 a non-executive director to CPP Group plc and received fees 
of £47,000 p.a. for this role.

Q. What are the appointment terms for non-executive 
directors?
A. All non-executive directors have entered into letters of 
appointment as detailed in the table below. The appointments 
are subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the 
Company’s Articles, in particular the need for periodic re-election. 
Non-executive directors’ continued appointments are evaluated 
annually, based on their contributions and satisfactory performance. 
There are no provisions for compensation being payable upon early 
termination of an appointment of a non-executive director.
Q. What are the non-executive directors notice periods?
A. During the year non-executive director notice periods were 
reviewed by the Company and it was agreed it was appropriate to 
increase these from one month to three months. Details of non-
executive director appointment periods appear below:

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Pension benefits
For each director, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2010 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual 
retirement of each director. The additional pension earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension (including the 
effect of inflation) when compared with the position at 31 December 2009.
All transfer values have been calculated in accordance with Regulation 7 to 7E of the Occupational Pensions Schemes (Transfer Values) 
Regulations 1996 and subsequent amendments. The transfer values of the accrued pension entitlement represent the value of assets that the 
pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme’s liability in respect of the director’s pension 
benefits. They do not represent sums payable to the director and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in transfer value during the year is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benefits at 31 December 2010 after deducting 
directors’ pension contributions to the scheme. The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits under the Listing Rules is the transfer 
value at 31 December 2010 of the increase in accrued benefits during the period (excluding inflation) less contributions made by the directors 
during the period.
The following table sets out the executive directors’ pension benefits as members of the Company’s defined benefit pension schemes as at 
31 December 2010:

the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements
1.  General information
Premier Foods plc (the “Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies 
Act 1985 (as amended and restated), registered number 5160050, with its registered office at Premier House, Centrium Business Park, 
Griffiths Way, St Albans, Hertfordshire, AL1 2RE. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) are food 
manufacturing, processing and distribution. Further information about the Group’s activities can be found in the Group at a Glance 
section of this annual report.
These Group consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 7 March 2011.
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation 
The Group consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will 
continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future. 
The consolidated financial statements of Premier Foods plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as endorsed by the European Union (“EU”), International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) 
interpretations, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, and on the historical cost basis with the 
exception of derivative financial instruments, defined benefit pension schemes and share-based payments which are incorporated using 
fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree 
of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are 
disclosed in note 3.
The following accounting standards and interpretations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) or IFRIC (as 
endorsed by the EU), are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group:
IAS 1 (Revised) — “First Time Adoption of IFRS”
IFRS 1 (Amendment) — “Additional Exemptions”
IFRS 1/IAS 27 (Amendment) — “Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate”
IFRS 2 (Amendment) — “Share-based Payments — Group Cash-Settled Share-based Payment Transactions”
IFRS 3 (Revised) — “Business Combinations”
IAS 27 (Revised) — “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements”
IAS 39 (Amendment) — “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on Eligible Hedged Items”
IFRIC 15 — “Agreement for the Construction of Real Estate” 
IFRIC 16 — “Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation”
IFRIC 17 — “Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners”
IFRIC 18 — “Transfers of Assets From Customers”
The application of the standards and interpretations has not had a material effect on the net assets, results and disclosures of the Group. 
New standards and interpretations not applied
Up to and during the year ended 31 December 2010, the IASB and the IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations 
with an effective date (as endorsed by the EU) after the date of these financial statements:
   Effective for accounting periods  
   beginning on or after:
 International Financial Reporting Standards
 IFRS 1 (Amendment)  First time Adoption of Financial Instrument Disclosures 1 July 2010
 IAS 24 (Revised) Related Party Disclosure 1 January 2011
 IAS 32 (Amendment) Financial Instruments: Presentation on Classification of Rights Issues 1 February 2010
 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
 IFRIC 14 (Amendment) Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement 1 January 2011
 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments 1 July 2010
These standards will be adopted by the Group in future accounting periods. 
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.

The following standards and amendments to published standards have not been endorsed by the EU:

 IAS 12 (Amendment) Income Taxes on Deferred Tax
2.2 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Premier Foods plc and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The purchase method of accounting is used for all acquisitions.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values as at that date. Any 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. In addition, comparatives are also restated to reclassify 
disposed businesses into discontinued operations.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
All inter-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
2.3 Revenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods net of sales rebates, discounts, value added tax and other taxes directly 
attributable to revenue and after eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue is recognised when the outcome of a transaction can be 
measured reliably and when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue is 
recognised on the following basis:
(i) Sale of goods
Sales of goods are recognised as revenue on transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership, which generally coincides with the time 
when the merchandise is delivered to customers and title passes.
(ii) Sales rebates and discounts
Sales rebates and discount reserves are established based on management’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to meet claims 
by the Group’s customers in respect of these rebates and discounts. The provision is made at the time of sale and released, if unutilised, 
after assessment that the likelihood of such a claim being made has become remote.
2.4 Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The 
Chief Operating Decision Maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. See note 
4 for further details. 
2.5 Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received 
in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, 
profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that 
are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It 
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
2.6 Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling, the Group’s presentational currency, at rates of exchange ruling at the end 
of the financial year. 
The results of overseas subsidiaries with functional currencies other than in sterling are translated into sterling at the average rate 
of exchange ruling in the year. The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the closing rate. Exchange 
differences arising from retranslation at year end exchange rates of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries are recorded in reserves as 
a separate component of equity. When a foreign operation is sold exchange differences previously taken to equity are recognised in the 
income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate.
All other exchange gains or losses are recorded in the income statement.

2.7 Dividends
Dividend distribution to the Group’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Group’s shareholders, and for interim dividends, in the period in which they are paid.
2.8 Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”)
Property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost. Subsequent expenditure is added to the carrying value of the asset when it is 
probable that incremental future economic benefits will transfer to the Group. All other subsequent expenditure is expensed in the period 
it is incurred.
Differences between the cost of each item of PPE and its residual value are written off over the estimated useful life of the asset 
using the straight-line method. Reviews of the estimated remaining useful lives and residual values of individual productive assets are 
performed annually, taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. Freehold land is not 
depreciated. The useful economic lives of owned assets range from 20 to 50 years for buildings, and 3 to 35 years for vehicles, plant and 
equipment.
All items of PPE are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. 
2.9 Business combinations and goodwill 
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill arises 
when the fair value of the consideration for a business exceeds the fair value of the aggregate of the net assets acquired. Goodwill arising 
on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable. 
Items of PPE acquired as part of a business acquisition are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition using a market value or 
depreciated replacement cost model.
On acquisition, the Group undertakes a review of the accounting policies of the business acquired to ensure compliance both with IFRS 
and the accounting policies of the Group.
2.10 Intangible assets
In addition to goodwill the Group recognises the following intangible assets: 
Acquired intangibles
Acquired trade marks, brands, customer relationships, licences, recipes and similar assets that are controlled through custody or legal 
rights and that could be sold separately from the rest of the business are capitalised, where fair value can be reliably measured. A 
reputable independent specialist performs the valuations. All of these assets are considered to have finite lives and are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives that range from 7 to 40 years.
Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Costs incurred in developing a product, typically its recipe or packaging, are charged to income in the year in which they are incurred 
unless the future economic benefits of the project can be regarded as reasonably certain and are in accordance with IAS 38 “Intangible 
Assets” (“IAS 38”), in which case they are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Software development costs
Assets acquired or internally developed, such as software, are capitalised when the future economic benefit is reasonably assured 
and the criteria within IAS 38 are met. Software development costs are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives on a 
straight-line basis over a range of 3 to 10 years. 
2.11 Impairment 
The useful economic lives of intangible assets are determined based on a review of a combination of factors including the asset 
ownership rights acquired and the nature of the overall product life cycle. 
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when an event that might affect asset values has 
occurred. An impairment loss is recognised, in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either 
by selling the asset or by the discounted future earnings from operating the assets in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”.
Intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing on indication of impairment. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. 
Any impairment losses are written off immediately. 
2.12 Interest
(i) Interest expense
Borrowing costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method.
(ii) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal amounts outstanding and the interest rates 
applicable, taking into consideration the interest element of derivatives.

2. Accounting policies continued
2.13 Leases
Assets held under finance leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group, are capitalised 
and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the minimum lease payments or fair value. Each asset is depreciated over 
the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges 
in respect of future periods, are included under borrowings. The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods 
during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period. 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
2.14 Inventories
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Where appropriate, cost includes production and other attributable 
overhead expenses as described in IAS 2 “Inventories”. Cost is calculated on a first-in, first-out basis by reference to the invoiced value of 
supplies and attributable costs of bringing the inventory to its present location and condition.
All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where the estimated selling price is lower than cost.
2.15 Taxation
The charge or credit for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account deferred taxation. 
Deferred taxation is accounted for in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit. Deferred taxation is not provided on the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than in a business combination, if at the time of the transaction there is no effect 
on either accounting or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled based on tax 
rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. It is recognised in the income statement 
except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group 
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.16 Employee benefits
Group companies provide a number of long-term employee benefit arrangements, primarily through pension schemes. The schemes are 
generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds determined by periodic independent actuarial 
calculations. The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. 
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually 
dependent on factors such as age, years of service and compensation. 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for actuarial gains or losses and past 
service costs. Defined benefit obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The 
present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using yields of high-quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating 
to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the 
statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they arise.
Current service costs, past-service costs, administration costs, expected return on assets and interest costs are recognised immediately 
in the income statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified 
period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity, which then invests 
the contributions to buy annuities for the pension liabilities as they become due based on the value of the fund, hence the Group has no 
legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they  
fall due.
2.17 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Where the Group 
expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but 
only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Where material, the Group discounts its provisions.

2. Accounting policies continued
2.18 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will only be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or the amount of 
obligation cannot be measured reliably. A contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 
When an outflow becomes probable, it is recognised as a provision. 
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the Group. Contingent assets are not recognised but 
are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. When inflow is virtually certain an 
asset is recognised.
2.19 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for 
impairment. A provision is made for impairment when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the terms of the receivables. Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered 
material. 
The rights and obligations relating to those trade receivables that have been sold to third parties are de-recognised from the balance 
sheet where the risks and rewards of ownership are considered to have transferred. Cash received from third parties in exchange for 
the transfer of ownership is recorded within cash and cash equivalents with the cost of financing prior to settlement by the customer 
recorded as interest on an accruals basis. Amounts received from customers for receivables in respect of which title has transferred, 
for example under the debtors securitisation programme, represent amounts owed to the transferee and are recorded as short-term 
borrowings.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents, with original maturities at inception of less than 90 days, comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and 
other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash in hand, short-term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a 
residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial 
liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective 
interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs and inclusive of debt issuance costs) and the 
settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy 
for borrowing costs.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade payables and other 
liabilities are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risk and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with unrealised 
gains or losses reported in the income statement. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Movements in fair value of foreign exchange derivatives are recognised 
within other operating income and expense and those relating to interest rate swaps are recorded within the net movement on fair 
valuation of interest rate financial instruments.
Other items at fair value through profit or loss
Other items at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Movements in fair value are recorded within the net movement on fair valuation of interest 
rate financial instruments. See notes 9 and 22 for further details.

Notes to the financial statements continued
2. Accounting policies continued
Net investment hedge
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated 
and qualify as net investment hedges is recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately 
in the income statement within other operating income and expenditure.
2.20 Investment in own shares
Investments in own shares are shown as a deduction in shareholders’ funds.
3.  Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements
The following are areas of particular significance to the Group’s financial statements and include the application of judgement, which is 
fundamental to the compilation of a set of financial statements.
3.1 Pensions
The present value of the Group’s pension obligations depends on a number of actuarial assumptions. The primary assumptions used 
include the discount rate applicable to scheme liabilities, the long-term rate of inflation and estimates of the mortality applicable to 
scheme members.
At each reporting date, and on a continuous basis, the Group reviews the macro-economic, Company and scheme specific factors 
influencing each of these assumptions, using professional advice, in order to record the Group’s ongoing commitment and obligation 
to defined benefit schemes in accordance with IFRS. One such assumption is the assumption of mortality rates and how these are 
expected to change in the future. If the Group’s assumption on the mortality of its members was amended to assume an increase of a 
further one year improvement in mortality, total liabilities would increase by approximately 3.8%. Each 0.1% decrease/increase in bond 
yields would increase/decrease the deficit by a further £51m/£49m. Each 0.1% increase/decrease in the assumed inflation rate would 
increase/decrease the deficit by a further £18m/£21m. Each of the underlying assumptions is set out in more detail in note 25. 
 
3.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets
Impairment reviews in respect of goodwill are performed annually unless an event indicates that an impairment review is necessary. 
Impairment reviews in respect of intangible assets are performed when an event indicates that an impairment review is necessary. 
Examples of such triggering events include a significant planned restructuring, a major change in market conditions or technology, 
expectations of future operating losses, or a significant reduction in cash flows. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units 
(“CGU’s”) are determined based on the higher of realisable value and value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of 
estimates.
The Group has considered the impact of the assumptions used on the calculations and has conducted sensitivity analysis on the 
impairment tests of the CGU’s carrying values. See note 15 for further details.
Acquired trade marks, brands, customer relationships, recipes and similar assets are considered to have finite lives that range from 7 
to 40 years. The determination of the useful lives takes into account certain quantitative factors such as sales expectations and growth 
prospects, and also many qualitative factors such as history and heritage, and market positioning, hence the determination of useful lives 
are subject to estimates and judgement. For further details see note 16.
3.3 Advertising and promotion costs
Trade spend and promotional activity is dependent on market conditions and negotiations with customers. Trade spend is charged 
to the income statement according to the substance of the agreements with customers and the terms of any contractual relationship. 
Promotional support is generally charged to the income statement at the time of the relevant promotion. These costs are accrued on 
best estimates. The actual costs may not be known until subsequent years when negotiations with customers are concluded. Such 
adjustments are recognised in the year when final agreement is reached.
Expenditure on advertising is charged to the income statement when incurred, except in the case of airtime costs when a particular 
campaign is used more than once. In this case they are charged in line with the airtime profile.
3.4 Exceptional items
Exceptional items are not explicitly addressed under IFRS. Accordingly, the Group has defined exceptional items as those items of 
sufficient financial significance to be disclosed separately in order to assist in understanding the financial performance achieved and in 
making projections of future results. Each of these items relates to events or circumstances that are material and non-recurring in nature, 
such as integration of an acquisition, disposal of a business or major asset, material impairments or refinancing related transactions. See 
note 6 for further details.
3.5 Securitisation
The Group has sold the rights and obligations relating to certain of its trade receivable balances under a receivables purchasing 
agreement in order to achieve an overall lower cost of funding and permanently accelerate the generation of cash from working capital. 
Accounting for a sale of this nature is judgemental and dependent on evidence of the substantive transfer of risk and reward from the 
Group to a third party. In this instance, transference of the two primary risks, those of late payment and credit default was achieved at the 
balance sheet date. The Group anticipates that the receivables purchasing agreement will remain in place over the medium term and that 
de-recognition of the receivables subject to it will continue to be achieved, dependent upon ongoing review of the assessment of risk and 
reward transfer.

Financial statements
2. Accounting policies continued
3.6 Financial instruments
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage the risks arising from adverse movements in interest rates, 
commodity prices and foreign currency. 
The Group has a policy of not applying hedge accounting to these derivatives (other than in the case of a Net Investment Hedge against 
euro denominated assets) and taking any gain or loss on the movement of the fair values of derivatives to the income statement.
4. Segmental analysis
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Group’s internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(“CODM”). The CODM has been determined to be the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as they are primarily responsible 
for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments. 
The CODM uses trading profit, as reviewed at monthly business review meetings, as the key measure of the segments’ results as it 
reflects the segments’ underlying trading performance for the period under evaluation. Trading profit is a consistent measure within the 
Group and the reporting of this measure at the monthly business review meetings, which are organised according to product types, has 
been used to identify and determine the Group’s operating segments. Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional 
items, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, the revaluation of foreign exchange and other derivative contracts under IAS 39 
and pension credits or charges in relation to the difference between the expected return on pension assets, administration costs and 
interest costs on pension liabilities. 
The Group’s operating segments are “Grocery”, “Hovis”, “Retailer Branded Chilled” and “Meat-free”. The Group previously aggregated 
and reported the Retailer Branded Chilled and Meat-free operating segments in the “Other” segment, as they did not meet the relevant 
quantitative thresholds and did not have similar economic characteristics and therefore could not be aggregated into their own separate 
reporting segment under IFRS 8. As a result of the Group’s announcement to sell the Meat-free business, results for the Meat-free 
operating segment are presented as discontinued operations in both the current year and prior year comparatives. 
Subsequent to year end, the Group announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its East Anglian canned grocery operations, 
which is part of the Grocery segment. The results of the East Anglian canned grocery operations for the year ended 31 December 2010 
are included within continuing operations as it is not a separate operating segment. 
The Group reports the remaining operating segments on three continuing segments within the business: “Grocery”, “Hovis” and “Retailer 
Branded Chilled”. 
The Grocery segment sells ambient food products. The Hovis segment sells bread, morning goods, flour products and frozen pizza 
bases and the Retailer Branded Chilled segment includes businesses which sell chilled ready meals and cakes. 
The segment results for the year ended 31 December 2010 and for the year ended 31 December 2009 and the reconciliation of the 
segment measures to the respective statutory items included in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

Revenues, on a continuing basis, of approximately £454.0m and £336.9m (2009: £478.3m and £340.2m) are derived from two external 
customers. These revenues are attributable across the three reporting segments above.
Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the same terms and conditions that would be available to unrelated third 
parties. As a consequence of extensive integration of the business, certain operating costs have been incurred centrally. These costs are 
allocated to reporting segments on an appropriate basis depending on the various cost drivers and therefore the total segment result is 
equal to the Group’s total trading profit. 
Segment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, inventories, receivables and retirement benefit 
assets and exclude cash and cash equivalents, derivative assets and certain Corporate assets that are not able to be allocated to the 
Group’s reporting segments. 
Unallocated assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, taxation balances, derivative financial assets and head office assets. In 2010, 
this includes Group-wide software and hardware assets that were previously reported within the Grocery segment. 
The Group primarily supplies the UK market, although it also supplies certain products to other European countries and a number of 
other countries. The following table provides an analysis of the Group’s revenue, which is allocated on the basis of geographical market 
destination and an analysis of the Group’s non current assets (excluding retirement benefit assets) by geographical location.

6. Exceptional items
Up to 2009, the Group was incurring a large amount of spend for restructuring and investment in the business. These items were treated 
as exceptional items and excluded from trading profit. The level of restructuring is now likely to run at a normal level from 2010, and as a 
result, the Group has included the costs of restructuring and investment within trading profit. The comparatives for the year ended  
31 December 2009 have been restated to reflect the change in this classification.
The Group has completed its major integration and manufacturing rationalisation programmes following the acquisitions of RHM and 
Campbell’s. As a result, the Group has not incurred any exceptional expenditure during the year, other than the impairment charge 
recognised against the goodwill allocated to the Brookes Avana CGU (see note 15).

(a) Integration of RHM UK operations
On 16 March 2007, the Group acquired RHM plc. During 2009, the Group completed its factory closure programme, but residual costs 
were incurred in the previous year from the commissioning of equipment and production transferred to remaining Group manufacturing 
sites. Redundancy and restructuring costs were also incurred in the previous year relating to the move of administrative functions to a 
Group-wide share service centre in Manchester and the integration of certain warehousing facilities to other Group warehouses. The 
adverse market conditions during 2009 also resulted in a charge to increase onerous property lease provisions. 
(b) Integration of Campbell’s UK operations
The charge in the previous year primarily related to an increase in an onerous property lease provision to reflect the adverse market conditions. 
(c) Integration of Irish operations
The recession in Ireland has resulted in significant strategic changes by the Group’s Irish customer base, with moves to sourcing 
products directly from the UK and a shift from primarily store-based trading to central purchasing and distribution. In the previous year a 
charge was recognised as the Group announced its decision to rationalise part of its Irish operations.
(d) Impairment of goodwill
An impairment charge of £125.0m has been recognised against the goodwill allocated to the Brookes Avana CGU (see note 15).
 
(e) Refinancing costs
Advisory fees were incurred during the previous year relating to the placing and open offer and firm placing, amended lending 
agreements, renegotiation of interest rate swaps and new pensions framework.

2010
In October 2010, the Group restructured all of its five long dated swaps and its two “other” callable swaps into six new fixed rate swaps all 
maturing in 2013. These new fixed rate swaps are hybrid instruments comprising an underlying host with embedded derivatives and have 
been reclassified as “Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss”. The fair value movements below includes the reclassification 
of fair value from interest rate derivatives to “Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” for those six swaps.
The total facility as at 31 December 2010 was £1,680m and will be amortised by £50m in both June and December of each year until 
December 2013.
2009
On 5 March 2009, the Group announced revised financing arrangements including a share issuance, changes to lending agreements to 
provide greater covenant and liquidity headroom and the extension of the maturity of the facility. These revised financing arrangements 
were approved by ordinary shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on 23 March 2009.
The amendments to the Group’s Term and Revolving Credit Facilities included a rephasing of the facilities to provide additional liquidity 
and covenant headroom and an extension of the maturity date to December 2013. 
In respect of these amendments to the existing facilities and arrangement of the new facilities, the Group incurred costs of £26.1m, 
£3.0m of which were immediately charged to the income statement.
On 5 March 2009, the Group amended the break clauses in one of its long dated swaps to make it consistent with other long  
dated swaps. 
At the same time the Group also restructured two other swaps into one new swap which resulted in an amendment to the payment 
terms and an amendment to the break clauses, being an optional break at August 2012 and a mandatory break at June 2013. The terms 
were also amended such that it will now settle at either break point for a mark to market payment to the counterparty bank. As a result 
of these amendments, a new contract was recognised which comprises both an underlying host as well as embedded derivatives. This 
hybrid instrument was classified within a new class of financial liabilities being “Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss”.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss has increased from a £198.7m liability 
at 31 December 2009 to a £234.5m liability at 31 December 2010 resulting in a net movement of £35.8m for the year. This constitutes 
an adverse change on fair value of £43.3m offset by a £7.5m cash payment relating to the restructuring of one swap within “Other 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” with a nominal value of £150m. The change in fair value in the year is due to a 
change in the yield curve offset by amortisation (refer to note 22). The liability at 31 December 2010 represents the net present value of 
the interest cash flows calculated using the contracted fixed rates compared to the net present value of interest cash flows that would 
arise if the interest was calculated on a floating basis.

The Finance (No. 2) Act 2010, which was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010, includes legislation reducing the main rate of 
corporation tax from 28.0% to 27.0% from 1 April 2011. The 1.0% reduction for the 2011 financial year has been reflected in the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 by restating the deferred tax liability at 31 December 2009 giving a reduction of 
£5.6m. In addition, the movements in deferred tax in the year have been reflected at 27.0%, being the rate at which the liabilities are 
expected to reverse, which has resulted in a £0.4m increase in the income tax credit.
Further reductions to the main rate of corporation tax are proposed to reduce the rate by 1.0% per annum to 24.0% by 1 April 2014. 
However, as these further reductions in the main rate of corporation tax have not been substantially enacted at the balance sheet date 
they are not reflected in the deferred tax recognised on the balance sheet.

Dilutive effect of share options
The dilutive effect of share options is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The only dilutive potential ordinary shares of the Company are share options. A 
calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual 
market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share 
options. 
For the years ended 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009, there is no dilutive effect as the outstanding share options that could 
have been acquired at fair value is less than the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to these options. 
The issue of 1,553,416,776 ordinary shares during the previous year has been included in determining the weighted average for the 
previous year (see note 26).
No adjustment is made to the profit or loss in calculating undiluted and diluted (loss)/earnings per share.

Adjusted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”)
Adjusted earnings per share is defined as trading profit less net regular interest payable, less a notional tax charge at 28.0% (2009: 
28.0%) divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of the Company. 
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, the revaluation of 
foreign exchange and other derivative contracts under IAS 39 and pension credits or charges in relation to the difference between the 
expected return on pension assets, administration costs and interest costs on pension liabilities. 
Net regular interest payable is defined as net interest after excluding non-cash items, namely exceptional write-off of financing costs, 
accelerated amortisation of debt issuance costs, fair value adjustments on interest rate financial instruments and the unwind of the 
discount on provisions.
Trading profit and Adjusted EPS have been reported as the directors believe these provide an alternative measure with which the 
shareholders can assess the Group’s underlying trading performance.

15.  Goodwill continued
Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired. The recoverable 
amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations or fair value less costs to sell, depending on the way in which the 
value of the CGU is expected to be recovered.
An impairment assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the Meat-free business has been undertaken by assessing 
the fair value less costs to sell in light of the decision to dispose of this business. The goodwill assigned to the Meat-free business was 
tested for impairment prior to its classification as held for sale. 
Key assumptions
The key assumptions for calculating value in use are those relating to the cash flows, long-term growth rate and discount rate.
Fair value less costs to sell in respect of the Meat-free business has been determined by reference to the value of the offer received, less 
the expected costs of disposing the business. 
Cash flow assumptions
The cash flows used in the value-in-use calculation are pre-tax cash flows based on the latest approved management forecasts 
in respect of the following five years. Assumptions regarding these future cash flows are based upon actual results in prior periods 
and adjusted for expected developments in the following years with reference to market conditions and reasonable management 
expectations for the businesses. All income and costs are taken into account and an estimate of capital expenditure required to maintain 
these cash flows is also made. 
Long-term growth rate assumptions
The five year management forecasts are extrapolated in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector. The 
growth rate applied is 2.25% (2009: 2.25%) and is not considered to be higher than the average long-term industry growth rate.
Discount rate
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is calculated using a pre-tax rate based on the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) 
which would be anticipated for a market participant investing in the Group. The directors believe it is appropriate to use a single common 
discount rate for all impairment testing as each CGU shares similar risk profiles.
The Group has considered the impact of the current economic climate in determining the appropriate discount rate to use in impairment 
testing. At 31 December 2010, the pre-tax rate used to discount the forecasted cash flows has been determined to be 12.3% (2009: 11.8%).
Impairment
A total impairment charge of £150.0m has been recognised in the year (2009: £nil). 
Included within this charge is £125.0m recognised against the goodwill allocated to the Brookes Avana CGU thereby reducing the 
carrying value of this CGU to its recoverable amount. This impairment has arisen as a result of adverse trading conditions and an 
increase in discount rate (as noted above). Any favourable change in assumptions in future periods will result in additional headroom  
however any adverse change would result in additional impairment. 
A further charge of £25.0m is recognised against the goodwill allocated to the Meat-free business and has been recorded within 
discontinued operations. The residual goodwill attributable to the Meat-free business of £64.6m has been transferred to assets held 
for sale. 
The current economic climate has increased the discount rate adopted by the Group due to the higher level of return expected by 
equity holders (due to the continued perceived risk and volatility in equity markets). The Group has considered this impact on the 
assumptions used and has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the Hovis CGU’s carrying value. This has not resulted 
in any impairment of the carrying value at 31 December 2010 as the CGU’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value by £55.6m. 
However, the CGU’s recoverable amount would be comparable to its carrying value if the discount rate were to increase by 1.0%. Any 
favourable change in assumptions in future periods will result in additional headroom.
With regards to the remaining Grocery CGU, the directors believe no reasonable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment 
testing would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.

(a)  Senior Term Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility Arrangement — 2009
On 5 March 2009, the Group entered into a supplemental agreement with its banks amending certain terms of its Senior Term Credit 
Facility and Revolving Credit Facility Arrangement of 16 March 2007.
This original facility was arranged by Barclays Capital, Bayerische Landesbank, BNP Paribas, Rabobank International, Lloyds TSB Bank 
plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as lead arrangers and underwriters and Lloyds TSB Bank plc as facility agent and security 
trustee.
The Senior Term Credit Facility now comprises £1,180m of Term and a multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility of up to £500m (or its 
equivalent in other currencies). The final maturity date of the above arrangements is 31 December 2013.
(b)  Other unsecured loans
Other unsecured loans falling due within one year includes amounts owed in respect of cash receipts from debtors previously sold under 
the debtors securitisation programme.

22. Financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (arising from adverse movements in interest rates, commodity 
prices, and foreign currency), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage certain 
of these risks. The management of these risks, along with the day-to-day management of treasury activities, is performed by the  
Group Treasury function. The policy framework governing the management of these risks is defined by the Finance Committee, a  
sub-committee of the Board. The framework for management of these risks is incorporated into a policies and procedures manual.
The Group also enters into contracts with suppliers for its principal raw material requirements, some of which are considered 
commodities, and also diesel and energy. These commodity and energy contracts are part of the Group’s normal purchasing activities. 
Some of the risk relating to diesel is mitigated with the use of derivative financial instruments. The Treasury Risk Management Committee, 
a sub-committee of the Finance Committee monitors and reviews the Group’s foreign currency exchange, commodity price and energy 
price exposures and recommends appropriate hedging strategies for each.
(a)  Market risk
(i)  Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s main operating entities’ functional currency and the Group’s presentational currency is sterling although some transactions 
are executed in non-sterling currencies, including euros, US dollars, Canadian dollars, Swiss francs and Swedish kronor. The transactional 
amounts realised or settled are therefore subject to the effect of movements in these currencies against sterling. Management of these 
exposures is centralised and managed by the Group’s Treasury Function. It is the Group’s policy to manage the exposures arising using 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency options. Hedge accounting is not sought for these transactions. 
The Group generates some of its profits in non-sterling currencies and has assets in non-sterling jurisdictions, principally the euro. As  
at 31 December 2010, the Group has euro denominated borrowings of €nil (2009: €22.3m) designated as a hedge of euro denominated 
assets.
The principal foreign currency affecting the translation of subsidiary undertakings within the Group financial statements is the euro. The 
rates applicable are as follows:
          Year ended  Year ended
         31 Dec  31 Dec
 Principal rate of exchange EUR/£     2010 2009
 Year end       1.1601 1.1185
 Average       1.1584 1.1142
The majority of the Group’s assets and liabilities are denominated in the functional currency of the relevant division or subsidiary.
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures as at 31 December 2010 and 2009 that gave rise to net currency gains and 
losses recognised in the consolidated income statement as a result of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the 
functional currency of the subsidiaries involved.

In addition, the Group also has forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at the year-end in order to manage the 
exposures above but also to hedge future transactions in foreign currencies. The sterling nominal amounts outstanding are as follows:

 Australian dollar      (0.2) –
 Total       76.7 88.4
If the US dollar were to weaken against sterling by 20 US dollar cents, with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would 
decrease by £3.3m (2009: £3.4m decrease).
If the US dollar were to strengthen against sterling by 20 US dollar cents, with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would 
increase by £4.1m (2009: £4.9m increase).
If the euro were to weaken against sterling by 10 euro cents, with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would decrease by 
£3.1m (2009: £1.7m decrease).
If the euro were to strengthen against sterling by 10 euro cents, with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would increase by 
£3.0m (2009: £2.7m increase).
This is primarily driven by the effect on the mark to market valuation of the foreign exchange derivatives of the Group where the hedged 
rates differ from the spot rate. 
If the euro were to weaken against sterling by 10 euro cents, the foreign exchange movement taken to equity in relation to the Net 
Investment Hedge would be an additional £nil (2009: £1.6m gain).
If the euro were to strengthen against sterling by 10 euro cents, the foreign exchange movement taken to equity in relation to the Net 
Investment Hedge would be an additional £nil (2009: £2.0m loss).
(ii)  Commodity price risk
The Group purchases a variety of commodities for use in production and distribution which can experience significant price volatility, 
which include, inter-alia, wheat, tinplate, diesel and energy. The price risk on these commodities is managed by the Group through the 
Treasury Risk Management Committee. It is the Group’s policy to minimise its exposure to this volatility by adopting an appropriate 
forward purchase strategy or by the use of derivative instruments where they are available. 
(iii)  Interest rate risk
The Group’s borrowing facilities comprise term debt and a revolving facility, principally in sterling. Interest is charged at floating rates 
plus a margin on the amounts drawn down, and at half the margin for the non-utilised portion of the facility, hence the borrowings are 
sensitive to changes in interest rates.
The Group then seeks to mitigate the effect of adverse movements in interest rates by entering into derivative financial instruments that 
reduce the level of exposure to floating rates. The target of fixed/capped debt is defined in the Group Treasury policy and procedures 
however the amount hedged can be amended subject to agreement by the Finance Committee. Hedge accounting is not sought for 
these transactions.
The gross cash flows on the interest rate derivatives are sensitive to changes in interest rates as they are driven by three month LIBOR 
which is re-set on a quarterly basis. As at 31 December 2010 the re-set rate was 0.7575% (2009: 0.605%).
The weighted average interest rate for these derivative financial instruments is as follows:

Fixed rate derivative financial liabilities constitute one swap with a nominal value of £50m (2009: £175m) which is a conventional interest 
rate swap maturing in 2013. It has a callable option whereby the counterparty bank can cancel the swap at nil cost at certain specified 
dates from June 2011 onwards.
The cap and floor structures have a nominal value of £350m (2009: £350m) with caps set at 6.15% to 6.25% and floor rates between 
4.31% and 4.55%. In addition, when LIBOR rates are beneath the floor strike price, a digital option is triggered which results in the Group 
paying interest at 5.75% on all of these instruments for three months.
In October 2010 the Group restructured all of its five long dated swaps (nominal value £400m) and its two other callable swaps (nominal 
value £275m) into six new fixed rate swaps with a nominal value totalling £675m, all maturing in 2013. These new fixed rate swaps are 
hybrid instruments comprising an underlying host with embedded derivatives and have been reclassified as “Other financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss”. These swaps have an average fixed rate of 6.57% (ranging between 4.55% and 9%). Of these, swaps 
with a nominal value of £400m have callable options whereby the counterparty bank can cancel the swap at nil cost at certain specified 
dates, £250m being currently callable and a further £150m becoming callable in September 2011. 
The other callable swaps classified as “Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” comprise a single swap with an optional 
break at August 2012 and a mandatory break at June 2013. The swap was structured to amortise the fair value at 5 March 2009 over 
the life of the new contract. In addition a derivative element provides for an adjustment to the payments should interest rates rise above 
7%, hence the swap comprises both an underlying host as well as embedded derivatives. The current fair value as at 31 December 2010 
is £32.4m (2009: £36.8m), and based on the current yield curve the mark to market payment in August 2012 would be £29.4m  
(2009: £32.6m).
To compensate for the shorter maturity date these swaps have fixed bullet payments on maturity totalling £82m. A portion of this 
becomes immediately payable (up to a maximum of 25%) if the Group raises a bond before maturity.
Cash and deposits earn interest at floating rates based on banks’ short-term treasury deposit rates. Short-term trade and other 
receivables are interest-free. 
The Group’s provisions of £38.9m as at 31 December 2010 (2009: £46.9m) include £14.1m relating to onerous leases (2009: £16.6m) 
which are considered to be floating rate financial liabilities. These cash flows are discounted where the effect is material. 
At 31 December 2010, for every 50 basis points reduction in rates below the last floating reset rate of 0.7575% (based on three month 
LIBOR), with all other variables held constant, annualised net interest expense would decrease by £1.7m (2009: £2.8m increase). 
At 31 December 2010, if interest rates were 200 basis points higher than the last floating reset rate of 0.7575% (based on three month 
LIBOR), with all other variables held constant, annualised net interest expense would increase by £6.8m (2009: £11.1m decrease). 
The Group’s other financial assets and liabilities are not exposed to material interest rate risk.

(b)  Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with high-credit quality financial 
institutions and trade receivables are due principally from major grocery retailers (though it is the Group’s policy to insure trade debt).
At 31 December 2010, trade and other receivables of £49.9m (2009: £31.3m) were past due but not impaired. These relate to customers 
with whom there is no history of default.
The ageing of trade and other receivables was as follows:

At 31 December 2010, trade and other receivables of £9.1m (2009: £7.7m) were determined to be specifically impaired and provided for. 
The amount of the provision reflects receivables from customers which are considered to be experiencing difficult economic situations. 
The Group does not hold any collateral as security against its financial assets.
Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows:

 At 31 December       9.1 7.7
The Group has benefited from a £90m securitisation programme to allow it to transfer trade receivable balances to one of the Group’s 
primary banks. This programme also allows the Group to de-link its own credit rating from that of the underlying assets and achieve a 
lower cost of funding.
(c)  Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk through both the treasury and finance functions. Cash flow forecasts are prepared and reviewed on a 
weekly basis, normally covering a period of three months.
In addition, cash flow forecasts are prepared as part of the Group’s overall budgeting and forecasting processes and performance is 
monitored against this each month. This is intended to give the Board sufficient forward visibility of debt levels.
The Group’s net debt level can vary significantly from month to month and there is some volatility within months. This reflects trading 
patterns, timing of receipts from customers and payments to suppliers, patterns of inventory holdings and the timing of the spend on 
major capital and restructuring projects. For these reasons the debt levels at the year end date may not be indicative of debt levels at 
other points throughout the year.

The Group has £420.9m (2009: £387.6m) of facilities available and not drawn as at 31 December 2010 expiring between 2 and 3 years.
The borrowings are secured by a fixed and floating charge over all the assets of the Group.
The following table analyses the expected undiscounted cash flows of interest on the floating rate debt to maturity (based on the last 
fixed rate refix of 0.7575% (2009: 0.605%) plus applicable margin).

The above table incorporates the contractual cash flows of the interest rate derivatives with floating rates of interest calculated based 
on LIBOR of 0.7575% (2009: 0.605%) at the balance sheet date. In addition, the cash outflow between 2 and 3 years relating to “Other 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” includes £82m of fixed payments on maturity of the swaps in lieu of the post 2013 
cash flows which have now been restructured. Note that a portion of this becomes immediately payable (up to a maximum of 25%) if the 
Group raises a bond before maturity.
The cash flows above are based on the contractual maturity of the swaps except for one swap within “Other financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss” with a nominal value of £150m which is based on an optional break date of August 2012 where the bank 
can call the swap at its mark to market value. Furthermore, for the purposes of this table, callable features have been reflected where the 
yield curve indicates that a counterparty is likely to call or cancel a contract at nil cost to themselves. We note that no contracts (2009: no 
contracts) are expected to be called at nil prior to their contractual maturity based on the current yield curve.

(d)  Fair value
The following table shows the carrying amounts (which approximate to fair value except as noted below) of the Group’s financial assets 
and financial liabilities. Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction 
between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest. Set out below is a summary 
of methods and assumptions used to value each category of financial instrument.

Fair value estimation
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are marked to market using prevailing market prices. Hedge accounting has not been applied to forward 
contracts and as a result the movement in the fair value of £2.2m has been debited to the income statement in the year (2009: £18.6m debit). 
Commodity derivatives are marked to market using prevailing prices and are also not designated for hedge accounting. As a result the 
fair value movement of £0.2m (2009: £11.7m credit) has been credited to the income statement. 
Interest rate swaps are marked to market using prevailing market prices. Interest rate swaps are also not designated for hedge accounting. As a 
result the movement in the fair value of £133.7m has been credited to the income statement in the year (2009: £75.5m credit). 
Interest rate swaps classed as “Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” are also marked to market using prevailing 
market prices. These are also not designated for hedge accounting. As a result the movement in the fair value of £177.0m has been 
charged to the income statement in the year (2009: £36.8m charge).

Short and long-term borrowings, loan notes and interest payable
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest rate cash flows. The fair value of the floating rate debt 
approximates the carrying value above. 
Finance lease liabilities
The fair value of finance lease liabilities approximates book value.
Trade and other receivables/payables
The carrying value of receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year is deemed to reflect the fair value given their short 
maturity. The fair values of non-current receivables/payables are also considered to be the same as the carrying value due to the size and 
nature of the balances involved.

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain items of plant and equipment under finance leases. The average lease term is two years, the 
longest being 7 years. 
For the year ended 31 December 2010, the average effective borrowing rate was 3.9% (2009: 8.2%).
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date, and thus expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. All leases are on a fixed repayment 
basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. 
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying value. The Group’s obligations under finance leases are 
secured by the lessor’s title to the leased assets.
(f)  Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may vary the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt 
divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity 
plus net debt.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 were as follows:
         2010 2009
         £m £m
 Total borrowings      1,281.9 1,384.5

 Total capital      2,269.5 2,430.0
 Gearing ratio      56% 56%
Under the Group’s financing arrangement, the Group is required to meet two covenant tests which are calculated and tested on a 12 
month rolling basis at the half year and full year, each year. The Group has complied with these tests during the year, and at year end.

23.  Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using the tax rate appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the (asset)/liability arises 
and the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. In all cases this is 27.0% (2009: 28.0%) 
except for an asset of £0.7m (2009: £1.0m) relating to Irish retirement benefit obligations where the local rate of 12.5% has been used.

to capital losses, £9.3m (2009: £nil) relating to UK corporation tax losses, £nil (2009: £0.4m) Irish corporate tax losses and £34.8m 
(2009: £34.8m) relating to ACT. Under current legislation these losses can generally be carried forward indefinitely.

Where there is a legal right of offset and an intention to settle as such, deferred tax assets and liabilities may be presented on a net 
basis. This is the case for most of the Group’s deferred tax balances and therefore they have been offset in the tables above. Substantial 
elements of the Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily relating to the defined benefit pension obligation, are greater than one 
year in nature.
Deferred tax assets in respect of losses are only recognised to the extent that it is anticipated they will be utilised in the foreseeable 
future.

At 31 December 2010, restructuring and redundancy provisions have been raised mainly in respect of the supply chain of the Group’s 
Irish operations. The remaining provisions largely relate to onerous leases raised in previous years. Other than onerous lease provisions, 
which range from 3 to 22 years, it is anticipated that the majority of these provisions will be utilised during 2011.
At 31 December 2009, restructuring and redundancy provisions have been raised in respect of the integration and restructuring of the 
Group’s Irish operations and onerous lease provisions in respect to properties to reflect the current adverse market conditions. Other than 
onerous lease provisions, which range from 3 to 23 years, it is anticipated that the majority of these provisions will be utilised during 2010.
Other provisions at 31 December 2010 and 2009 primarily relate to insurance claims and dilapidations against leasehold properties. 
The costs relating to dilapidation provisions will be incurred over a number of years in accordance with the length of the leases. These 
provisions have been discounted at rates between 4.4% and 5.1%. The unwinding of the discount is charged to the income statement 
under interest payable.
25.  Retirement benefit schemes
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes under which employees are entitled to retirement benefits which are based on 
final salary on retirement. These are as follows:
(a)  Premier schemes
The Premier Foods Pension Scheme (“PFPS”) was the principal funded defined benefit scheme within the old Premier Group which 
also operated a smaller funded defined benefit scheme, the Premier Ambient Products Pension Scheme (“PAPPS”) for employees 
acquired with the Ambrosia business in 2001. As a result of the acquisition of Campbell’s in 2006, the Group inherited the Premier 
Grocery Products Pension Scheme (“PGPPS”) covering the employees of Campbell’s UK business, and the Premier Grocery Products 
Ireland Pension Scheme (“PGPIPS”) covering the employees of Campbell’s Ireland. The Group also acquired two further schemes with 
the acquisition of Chivers Ireland in January 2007, the Chivers 1987 Pension Scheme and the Chivers 1987 Supplementary Pension 
Scheme. These schemes are presented together below as the Premier schemes.
(b)  RHM schemes
As a result of the acquisition of RHM plc, the Group also acquired the RHM Pension Scheme, the Premier Foods Ireland Pension 
Scheme (1994), the Premier Foods Ireland Van Sales Scheme and the French Termination Indemnity Arrangements. These schemes 
are presented together below as the RHM schemes, with the exception of the French Termination Indemnity Arrangements which were 
disposed of with the speciality bakery businesses during the previous year, and the Premier Foods Ireland Van Sales Scheme which was 
wound up during the year. 
The exchange rates used to translate the overseas euro based schemes are £1.00 = €1.1584 for the average rate during the year, and 
£1.00 = €1.1601 for the closing position at 31 December 2010.
Under all the schemes detailed above, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits which vary as a percentage of final salary on 
retirement. The assets of all schemes are held by the trustees of the respective schemes and are independent of the Group’s finances.

The schemes invest through investment managers appointed by the trustees in UK and European equities and in investment products 
made up of a broader range of assets. The plan assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property 
occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group. The pension schemes hold a charge over the assets of the Group.
At the balance sheet date, the combined principal actuarial assumptions used for all the schemes were as follows:

The expected return on pension scheme assets is based on the long-term investment strategy set out in the Schemes’ Statement of 
Investment Principles at the start of the year. 
The actual rate of return on plan assets was a gain of 8.5% (2009: 17.5% gain) for Premier schemes, and a gain of 14.4% for RHM 
schemes (2009: 0.2% loss).

The aggregate deficit has decreased by £107.6m during the year primarily due to an increase in the fair value of plan assets, offset by an 
increase in the defined benefit obligation. This was primarily a result of a fall in discount rate assumption used, which is based on the AA 
bond yield, from 5.80% to 5.45%.

The actuarial loss on liabilities of £109.6m (2009: £376.3m loss) comprises a gain on member experience of £36.8m (2009: £8.9m gain) 
and an actuarial loss due to changes in assumptions of £146.4m (2009: £385.2m loss).
The net actuarial gains taken to the statement of comprehensive income were £46.4m (2009: £468.8m losses). These were £34.2m 
(2009: £336.7m loss) net of taxation (with tax at 27.0% for UK schemes, and 12.5% for Irish schemes).
The Group expects to contribute approximately £77.1m (2010: £66.0m) to its defined benefit plans in 2011, £28.8m (2010: £28.0m) of 
regular contributions and expenses and £48.3m (2010: £38.0m) of additional contributions to fund the scheme deficits.

25.  Retirement benefit schemes continued
Defined contribution schemes
A number of companies in the Group operate defined contribution schemes, predominantly stakeholder arrangements. In addition a 
number of schemes providing life assurance benefits only are operated. The total expense recognised in the income statement of £1.1m 
(2009: £1.1m) represents contributions payable to the plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans. 
Other post retirement benefits
The Group does not provide any other post retirement benefits.
26.  Reserves and Share capital
Share premium reserve
The share premium reserve comprises the premium paid over the nominal value of shares for shares issued.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve comprises the non-statutory premium arising on shares issued as consideration for acquisition of subsidiaries where 
merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 applies.
Other reserves
Other reserves comprise the hedging reserve which represents the effective portion of the gains or losses on derivative financial 
instruments that have been designated as hedges.
Profit and loss reserve
The profit and loss reserve represents the cumulative surplus or deficit and the own shares reserve which represents the cost of shares in 
Premier Foods plc, purchased in the market and held by the Company on behalf of the Employee Benefit Trust in order to satisfy options 
and awards under the Company’s incentive schemes.
Non-controlling interest reserve
The non-controlling interest reserve represents the reserves attributable to non-controlling interests.

2009
On 24 March 2009, the Group raised approximately £379.6m, net of expenses, through the issue of 1,553,416,776 new 1 pence 
ordinary shares. The issue was structured as a placing and open offer of 1,055,756,006 new ordinary shares at a price of 26 pence per 
share, and a firm placing of 497,660,770 new ordinary shares at a price of 26 pence per share. 
Share option schemes
The Company has share option schemes for certain senior executives and key individuals. The employees involved in the schemes hold 
options to subscribe for up to 84.4 million ordinary shares of 1 pence each between 2010 and 2014, granted at prices ranging between  
1 pence per ordinary share and 186 pence per ordinary share. The number of shares subject to options, the periods in which they were 
granted and the periods in which they may be exercised are given below. For 2010, a summary of the Company’s schemes is as follows:
1. The Company adopted an Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) at the time of admission for executive directors. A portion 
of the options granted under the ESOS have now vested and are exercisable between 3 and 10 years after grant as certain 
performance criteria have been met. These options are equity-settled and the number of shares subject to options, the periods in 
which they were granted and the periods in which they may be exercised are given below.
 
2. A Savings Related Share Option Scheme for employees. The employees involved in the scheme have the right to subscribe for up 
to 63.5 million ordinary shares. The number of shares subject to options, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in 
which they may be exercised are given below. These options are equity-settled, have a maximum term of 3.5 years and generally 
vest only if employees remain in employment to the vesting date.
 
3. A Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for senior managers. The individuals involved in the scheme have the right to subscribe for up to 
8.5 million ordinary shares at 1 pence per ordinary share. The number of shares subject to awards, the periods in which they were 
granted and the periods in which they may be awarded are given below. These awards are equity-settled and have a maximum term 
of 3 years. 
 The performance and vesting conditions of the scheme have been aligned with those of the Co-Investment Plan below. Since the 
Company was positioned below the median TSR performance target, the required performance conditions were not met and the 
2007 award lapsed in full in April 2010.

4.  A Co-Investment Plan (“CIP”) for directors and senior managers. The scheme is structured as a share matching plan and the 
individuals involved in the scheme are required to commit and retain a significant amount of capital in the form of Premier Foods 
shares. The number of shares subject to awards, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be 
awarded are given below. These awards are equity-settled and have a maximum term of 3 years. 
 The vesting of matching awards is conditional on achievement against a combination of EPS and TSR performance targets. During the 
year the performance conditions were not met and so the 2007 CIP award lapsed in full.
 As set out in the Directors’ remuneration report the Company is proposing to adopt new Executive remuneration arrangements in 
2011 and no further awards are expected under either the CIP or LTIP . 
During the previous year, the Group modified its outstanding share option and award schemes following the placing and open offer and 
firm placing in March 2009. The Group decreased the exercise price by 4.87% for certain schemes and increased the number of share 
options/awards for all schemes by 5.12%. The incremental fair value granted resulting from these modifications was £0.2m increase 
in charge over the remaining vesting periods of the schemes. The incremental fair value granted was measured using pricing models 
consistent with the Group’s other schemes.

The weighted average fair value of awards granted during the year was 39 pence per award (2009: 49 pence). This was determined 
using a closed-form approach as a proxy for a stochastic Monte Carlo valuation model (which takes into account market based 
performance conditions) except for the Savings Related Share Option Scheme where the Black–Scholes model was used. The significant 
inputs into the model were:
         2010 2009
 Weighted average share price (p)     32 41
 Annual risk-free interest rate (%)     1.7 2.5
 Expected dividend at grant date (%)     – –
 Expected award life (years)      3 3
 Expected volatility (%)      37 37
The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis of daily share prices over 
the last three years.

payment transactions.

The Group has been in discussion with one of the Group Pension Schemes relating to the possibility that it may have to recognise 
some additional liability. The legal position and the potential methods of calculation of the liability is, as yet, uncertain. In the event that it 
materialises, the impact on net assets is not expected to be significant and the cash impact would be spread over several years in line 
with the agreed pension deficit recovery period for the Scheme agreed by the Group and Trustees.
There were no other material contingent liabilities at 31 December 2010. Other contingencies and guarantees in respect of the Parent 
Company are described in note 8 of the Parent Company financial statements.

Financial statements
Notes to the Company financial statements
1.  Accounting policies
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards in the 
United Kingdom (“UK GAAP”), under the historical cost convention, with the exception of share based payments which are incorporated 
using fair value. The profit for the year of £6.7m (2009: £8.1m) is recorded in the accounts of Premier Foods plc. The directors have 
taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented a profit and loss account 
for the Company.
The Company has taken exemption under Financial Reporting Standard 1 “Cash Flow Statements” (“FRS 1”) to not prepare a cash flow 
statement. The Company is also exempt under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 8 “Related Party Transactions” (“FRS 8”) from 
disclosing related party transactions with entities that are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Premier Foods plc Group or investees of the 
Premier Foods plc Group.
Fixed asset investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in their value.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account deferred taxation. The Company provides in full for 
deferred tax arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their inclusion 
in tax computations to the extent that a liability or an asset is expected to be payable or recoverable in the foreseeable future. The 
Company discounts its deferred tax liability as appropriate.
Cash and liquid resources
Short-term cash deposits, which can be called on demand without any material penalty, are included within cash balances in the  
balance sheet.
Share based payments
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using an option-pricing model. In accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 20 “Share-Based Payment” (“FRS 20”), the resulting cost is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period 
of the options for employees employed by the Parent Company, or treated as an investment in subsidiaries in respect of employees 
employed by the subsidiaries where the cost is recharged. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of 
options vesting.
Dividends
Dividend distribution to the Company shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders, and for interim dividends in the period in which they are paid.
2.  Operating profit
Audit fees in respect of the Company are £nil (2009: £nil).
At 31 December 2010, the Company had 3 employees (2009: 3), and their remuneration totalled £2.7m (2009: £3.1m). This excludes the 
Company’s 6 (2009: 7) non-executive directors whose remuneration totalled £0.6m (2009: £0.6m).

On 1 January 2010, the Group undertook an internal reorganisation and the Company entered into a deed of gift under which the 
Company transferred the shares in RHM Limited to a subsidiary undertaking, Premier Foods Investments Limited. 
During 2010, a capital contribution of £6.0m (2009: £2.2m) was given in the form of share incentive awards to employees of subsidiary 
companies which were reflected as an increase in investments. See note 17 on page 100 in the Group financial statements for a list of 
the principal subsidiary undertakings. A full list of subsidiary undertakings is available from the Company Secretary.

In 2008 shareholders agreed that the Company could use its website 
as its main method of communication with shareholders. If you are 
looking for information about our heritage, our social, environmental 
and ethical responsibilities, our approach to governance, financial 
reports or the latest press releases please go to our website  
www.premierfoods.co.uk. 
Furthermore, much of the information requested from our 
shareholder helpline can be found in the investor section of our 
website. Shareholders can also sign up for News Alerts to receive 
an email when news on the Company is released. These include 
additional financial news releases throughout the year, which are not 
mailed to shareholders.
Shareholders can also register at www.shareview.co.uk or contact 
the registrar (contact details below) to receive an email notifying them 
of new Company publications. Shareview also enables shareholders 
to view details of their own shareholding or electronically appoint 
a proxy to vote on their behalf on any poll that may be held at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Information made available on the website does not constitute 
part of this annual report. The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the financial information on our website. 
The information has been prepared under the relevant accounting 
standards and legislation.
ShareGift
Shareholders with a small number of shares, the value of which 
makes it uneconomic to sell them, may wish to consider donating 
them to charity through ShareGift, a registered charity administered 
by The Orr Mackintosh Foundation. Find out more at  
www.sharegift.org or call +44 (0)20 7930 3737.

this group and would like to combine your accounts, please contact

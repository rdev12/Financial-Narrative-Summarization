Chairman’s Statement
Results and strategic progress
This was a transformative year as the new 
management team prepared the business for the 
planned increased pace of expansion and at the same 
time delivered a record sales performance with total 
sales increasing by 51% to £37.1m. I am delighted 
with the progress that has been made so far with 
a number of key milestones being achieved, most 
notably the acquisition, integration and rebranding 
of the Gabbotts Farm Ltd business in H1 and the 
opening of six new Crawshaws stores. Both of these 
growth drivers have contributed positively to our 
EBITDA development and are performing in line with 
our expectations.
I am therefore pleased to report a 45% increase in 
our adjusted EBITDA performance as the strong sales 
growth is being converted into strong profit growth. 
A particular highlight has been the gross margin 
progression which strengthened further to 45.1% 
(2015: 44.4%). EBITDA post accelerated opening costs 
reduced as expected to £1.0m (2015: £1.6m) as we 
increased our overhead to invest in growth.
In the year under review we report a statutory loss 
before tax of £0.3m (2015: £1.2m profit before tax).  
It’s worth reiterating the reasons for this loss. Opening 
in excess of 15 new stores a year is no simple task, 
especially bearing in mind our stores are quite 
complex having both a fresh and food-to-go element. 
So we have built an internal resource in advance 
to allow us to find the retail sites, recruit and train 
the new staff, manage the pre-opening tasks and 
marketing, and to ensure that for each opening we hit 
the ground running.
This resource is now largely in place, and so our 
accelerated opening programme is in full force. But 
this resource cost us £1.6m in the year under review, 
and so it needs to be identified separately so that the 
true underlying performance of the business becomes 
visible. It’s also worth highlighting that new shops are 
expected to trade profitably from day one and, when 
mature, produce, on average, over £1m of sales per 
year, and an EBITDA contribution of £140,000.
Cash
The cash position of the business continues to 
be extremely robust. Operating cash flow and 
movements in working capital generated £2.2m 
which almost entirely funded the £2.3m of capital 
investment in new stores, refurbishments of legacy 
stores and investment in our factory production 
“ Another strong year for the business with 
record sales growth and our accelerated store 
rollout programme very much on track. ”
equipment in the year. The net £4.2m decrease  
in cash balances was a function of our acquisition  
of Gabbotts Farm Ltd, dividend payments and tax 
payments in the year. With a closing cash balance 
of £4.9m and continued focus on working capital 
improvements, we have the funds in place to deliver 
on our growth plan.
People
I would like to thank all of our 562 colleagues for 
their effort and commitment during this exciting 
time for our business. Since Noel joined Crawshaws 
as Chief Executive Officer in March 2015, he has 
successfully and carefully restructured and expanded 
the management team to ensure that we have the 
appropriate balance of expertise and dynamic to 
deliver our growth plan.
Outlook
Since my last statement, we continue to see strong 
sales growth on last year. T otal Group sales for the 
first seven weeks of the new financial period have 
increased by +64%. The cash gross margin in LFL 
stores has increased by 3.8% in the same seven week 
period, 3.7% through an increase in margin rate and 
0.1% through an increase in sales volume.
Our model continues to perform well. The business 
is at a very exciting stage with the strengthening 
of the legacy estate supplemented by the addition 
of a rapidly expanding new store estate. The newly 
opened stores are trading well, and profitably, in line 
with our expectation. The business is in great shape 
to deliver the planned scale rollout at pace and we 
have a strong pipeline of stores for 2016, so we look 
forward to reporting on our progress during the year 
ahead. In fact we have already opened five new stores 
during the current year, and these are also performing 
as expected.
We are pleased to declare the payment of a final 
dividend for the year of 0.47p per share, which 
together with the interim dividend of 0.10p per share, 
paid on 30 October 2015, takes the total dividend for 
the year to 0.57p per share (2015: 0.57p per share). 
Shareholder approval will be sought at the Annual 
General Meeting, to be held on 29 June 2016, to pay 
the final dividend on 5 August 2016 to shareholders 
on the register 8 July 2016. The ex-dividend date will 
be 7 July 2016. As with last year, shareholders will have 
the opportunity to elect to reinvest their cash dividend 
and purchase existing shares in the Company through 
a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”).
In summary, the foundations for our accelerated 
growth are in place and the rollout is very much 
underway. We now have a strong resource that will 
enable us to deliver another year of rapid expansion 
and profitable growth. We are therefore very confident 
and excited about the future.

Chief Executive 
Officer’s Review
“We have successfully delivered across all 
strategic pillars during a transformative 
2015 and we look forward to a year of rapid 
expansion and further profitable growth. ”
Introduction
Since joining the business in March 2015, I continue 
to be extremely impressed with our colleagues who 
are totally committed to maintaining the values of the 
Company and ensuring we consistently offer great 
quality fresh meat and food-to-go at affordable prices.
I have also been impressed by the way the team have 
embraced the changes and challenges during this 
transformative year in developing the infrastructure  
to support our rapid growth strategy. We are now well 
positioned to leverage our unique retail concept and 
accelerate the pace of rollout to establish Crawshaws 
as a national brand.
Transformative year
We have made significant progress during 
2015 in developing the capability, structure and 
discipline throughout the business to channel our 
entrepreneurial spirit in delivering consistent results  
for our customers, shareholders and colleagues. 
The preparations in delivering our growth plans has 
required strategic investments in key roles and skills 
within the Executive T eam to achieve the optimal 
balance in experience and expertise. Our Plc Board 
has been strengthened with the appointment of Alan 
Richardson as Chief Financial Officer and Kevin Boyd 
as Chief Commercial Officer, and our Senior T eam has 
been strengthened with key appointments in HR, 
Training, Facilities, Retail Operations, IT and Finance. 
Additionally, we recruit and train the teams required  
to staff our new stores ahead of each opening with 
the result that each new stores trades profitably from 
its very first day.
These appointments represent an important 
investment ahead of our accelerated growth to 
ensure that we are capable of delivering this plan 
with structure, control and discipline. Given that this 
overhead is exclusively focused around the opening  
of new stores, they are regarded as “accelerated 
opening costs” . It is therefore important to highlight 
and exclude these to show the underlying 
performance when evaluating the profitability and 
returns of the legacy business, which demonstrates 
that our stores continue to be very profitable, with 
each store converting £1m annual sales into an 
EBITDA contribution of 14%.
As we open more and more stores, the accelerated 
opening costs, and indeed the fixed element of our 
central overhead, will become a smaller proportion  
of the whole.
Revenue growth
For the twelve months to 31 January 2016, Group 
revenue increased by 51% from £24.6m to £37.1m. 
This strong growth was supported both by 
contributions from our LFL stores and from our 17  
new stores in the year, which includes the eleven 
stores acquired from Gabbotts Farm Ltd (which  
have been rebranded Crawshaws).
LFL sales were +1.8% for the full year, with H2 LFL sales 
of +2.6% building on the +1% LFL sales in H1. This 
achievement was very pleasing, particularly given the 
disruption and challenging high street footfall patterns 
caused by the prolonged adverse weather conditions 
in the North of England throughout November and 
December. And it was also particularly pleasing given 
that we were able to further increase our gross margin.
We have continued this growth momentum into  
the new financial year with total Group sales in the  
first seven weeks of the new financial year increasing 
by +64% and LFL also performing positively at +0.1% 
for the same period, again with a further improvement  
in gross margin.
New capabilities and opportunities
Looking at the opportunities ahead, we have 
identified the key elements in successfully delivering 
our accelerated rollout: 
(a) Acquiring the right sites at the right price
(b) Converting sites efficiently with a shop fit-out  
 that meets our high operational standards
(c) Ensuring that we have the trained colleagues  
 delivering the great Crawshaws’ customer  
 service
(d) A logistics and production capability to ensure  
 our stores have sufficient product to serve  
 our customers
We have made significant progress in developing  
the capability to deliver on all these fronts through  
our newly strengthened management structure.  
We have also developed and expanded key strategic 
partnerships within the areas of property, facilities, 
recruitment and supply chain. This approach has 
quickly become established in the business and  
is already demonstrating our capability to deliver  
a run-rate target of one new store opening every  
three weeks.
Strategic pillars for 2016
1. Driving profitable sales
We continue to work very hard to give our customers 
great quality fresh meat at affordable prices, 
which drives their loyalty and underpins our sales 
momentum.
During the course of the year we have made great 
progress in developing and standardising our retail 
proposition across the entire estate. This has included 
the successful relaunch of our fresh meat range and 
our legendary fixed price multi-save offers, as well as 
providing extra value to customers through our new 
weekly “Manager’ s Meaty Cut“ promotions.
Strategic pillars for 2016
1. Driving profitable sales
• Successful relaunch of fresh meat range
• Factory producing record levels  
 of premium homemade quality produce

 social media presence 
2. Disciplined growth strategy
• 1 7 stores added in FY 2016
• Expanded geographical coverage

Annual Report           52 weeks  ended 31 January 2016
With our factory now producing record-levels of 
premium quality homemade produce, almost 20 
tonnes per week, we will continue with the capital 
expenditure in our factory production equipment 
to ensure we have the capability to further increase 
our fantastic award winning homemade premium 
fresh meat offer. With this investment and our internal 
butchery expertise, we will introduce a widened 
premium range of lean steak burgers, premium pork 
and apple burgers, a variety of new recipe sausages, 
lean steak meatballs, lean steak kebabs and grill sticks 
and much more. This unique vertically integrated 
production capability allows us to continue to offer 
a very high quality product at value prices in large 
volumes.
In parallel, we plan to further expand and enhance 
our food-to-go range with the introduction of the 
“Butchers Kitchen“ brand, which provides the platform 
to showcase the quality of our fresh meat produce 
presented to our customers, cooked and ready  
to eat on-the-go.
In addition to these profitable sales opportunities,  
we will continue to invest in other key initiatives in 
 the coming year to maintain existing customer loyalty 
and achieve new customer acquisitions, such as new 
marketing activities and developing a social media 
presence.
2. Disciplined growth strategy
The core part of the Group’ s strategy is to rapidly 
increase the number of stores and spread the 
geographical presence of the Crawshaws brand  
in a disciplined manner.
We have successfully added 17 more stores to the 
Group during the last year taking our portfolio to 39 
stores, which has also expanded our geographical 
coverage to the North West of England.
Our pipeline strategy will also see us adding new 
stores in catchment areas across our heartlands of 
Y orkshire and the North West. Furthermore, we will 
be opening small clusters of stores in entirely new 
catchments in the Midlands and Birmingham areas. 
The locations of our stores will continue to be a 
representative spread of our current portfolio, which 
will see us opening a blend of stores on the high 
streets, in shopping centre locations and will include  
a standalone factory shop.
3. New stores performance
Our recently opened new stores are performing in 
line with expectations, contributing profitably from 
day one and are further expected to grow in sales 
and contribution as they mature. The sales profile of 
our new stores is shaped such that food-to-go sales 
reach maturity very soon after opening as passing 
customers quickly build visits into their routines 
enjoying the quality “Butcher’ s Kitchen“ range. On fresh 
meat, we experience a gradual increase as customers 
experiment with the range and build confidence  
and loyalty over a slightly longer time period. 
Our customers are very loyal, and recent customer 
insight data indicates a market leading Net Promoter 
Score (NPS) of 94. This data has indicated that those 
customers who buy fresh meat tend to reward us 
with the majority of their meat spend – we have 
therefore developed a series of new store opening 
marketing initiatives to incentivise customers to try 
the full breadth of our fresh meat offer and accelerate 
the pace with which we are able to convert them 
into loyal fresh meat shoppers. This approach was first 
trialed in our 40th store opening at Birchwood and 
initial results are also very encouraging.
Our people make the difference
As part of our listening, our customers have told us 
that they choose Crawshaws over other destinations 
due to a combination of quality, price and service. 
We are a people business and our 562 colleagues 
continue to be dedicated to creating the environment 
and atmosphere that our customers really value. 
Our achievements would not be possible without 
our colleagues and I am immensely proud of their 
commitment and passion in delivering amazing  
value to our customers every day.
Looking forward
Looking forward to the year ahead, whilst the wider 
economic climate looks likely to remain challenging, 
we have demonstrated that we are well positioned 
to succeed against this backdrop. We will continue 
to manage the business tightly during this exciting 
period of accelerated growth and we will remain 
focused on ensuring our retail proposition delights  
the customers that choose or need to shop with us.
We have already opened five new stores in the current 
year (in Birchwood, Blackburn, Cannock, Warrington 
and Widnes), and have a pipeline at various stages.  
We are therefore confident of meeting our target  
of 15 new stores for the year.
We look to the future with great confidence  
and excitement.

Revenue and gross profit
T otal revenue for the Group increased by 51% to £37.1m (2015: £24.6m) with the growth being supported by 
contributions from our LFL stores and 17 new stores in the year.
Gross profit margins have further developed in the year to 45.1%, a 70bps increase on 2015. The Group’ s gross margin 
was positively impacted by the Gabbotts F arm acquisition and the higher margin through their higher participation 
of food-to-go. In addition, the meat pricing environment has been favourable in the year which has allowed us to 
give value to customers through targeted promotional activity whilst positively contributing to EBITDA.
Presentation of results
T o present a clear view of performance of the Group in total and the costs directly driven by the growth strategy, 
we present an adjusted EBITDA number which excludes accelerated opening costs – adjusted EBITDA is our 
primary internal measure when assessing Group performance.
We define accelerated opening costs as the investments in people, processes and systems in the year to provide 
direct support for our accelerated opening programme. In the year, these costs amounted to £1.6m (2015: £0.2m) 
and are analysed by component of spend in the table below.
Profit before tax “PBT” and earnings per share “EPS”
The Group delivered a loss before tax of £0.3m (2015: £1.2m profit) as we incur additional costs to deliver  
our growth plan and we recognised an IFRS 2 shared based payment charge through the income statement  
of £0.4m (2015: nil). This translated to a negative EPS as expected at (0.342)p per share (2015: 1.301p per share).

Operational overheads
Operational overheads are defined as the administrative expenses of the Group less accelerated opening costs, 
exceptional costs, impairment, depreciation and amortisation and share based payments as this gives a clearer 
reflection on the underlying operational costs performance of the Group. On this basis, the ratio of overhead costs 
as a % of sales has increased to 38% (2015: 37%). This reflects the higher margin, higher cost base model of the 
Gabbotts Farm stores and a small dilution from new stores where initial cost ratios are higher as the stores trade 
through their sales maturity profile.
Control environment and management information
T o deliver the growth plan with the necessary control and discipline requires an appropriate platform. Whilst 
the tools and control environment currently in place have served the business well, they were not sufficiently 
scalable. As a result, we have started to implement Microsoft Navision as our core Enterprise Resource Planning 
(“ERP“) system. We are part way through the implementation of Phase 1 which will deliver a common warehouse 
management and financial accounting/control platform which will be complete in H1 FY 2017. Further 
developments are planned to integrate store ordering and sales reporting.
In addition to our ERP implementation, we are also significantly developing our management information 
capability. All new stores (including the six organic new stores in FY 2016) are being launched with EPOS tills.  
These provide us with the granular transaction and item level detail we need to optimise sales and profit 
performance going forward. 
Cash flow
Our cash flow position remains strong with £4.9m cash at the end of the financial year. Cash control has been a 
significant focus for the business with creditor term extensions being agreed with key strategic partners on both 
meat supply and shop fit out. This has successfully increased creditor days to 59 days (2015: 46 days). Alongside 
the positive working capital benefits of the new stores opened in the year, this has allowed us to broadly fund the 
organic expansion of 6 new stores from operational cash flow with the overall net £4.2m decrease in cash being 
used to fund the Gabbotts Farm acquisition and pay dividends and tax in the year. 
Given the scale of our expansion plans, we have also reviewed our capital allowance position which has resulted 
in a tax repayment of £148,000 in February 2016.
Summary
The Group has made good progress on executing the growth plan in the year delivering both profitable sales 
growth from the legacy operation and successfully adding 17 trading stores to the store estate. We have made 
significant improvements to our cash flow management and business wide systems and control infrastructure 
creating a strong platform to deliver our rapid growth plans.

Business model
Our management team have extensive experience in 
sourcing quality meat products from tried and tested 
local and international suppliers at the lowest possible 
prices. Whilst we do buy longer term to ensure that  
we have a core range of products, we pride ourselves 
on identifying key lines in the spot market that offer 
value to our customers. 
We have our own distribution centres where we 
control additional processing and logistics as well 
as the production of our very own award winning 
sausages. 
Our retail outlets are manned with skilled butchers 
who are happy to help customers with advice on 
choosing the right product, in the right quantities  
as well as how to cook it.
Operational strategy
The Board is focussed on growing the business 
through identifying new profitable store locations 
and investing resources in a controlled expansion 
programme, whilst ensuring the core business 
continues to deliver quality products and excellent 
customer service at competitive prices.
• New store locations are regularly reviewed  
 for suitability to grow/replace our existing  
 retail estate.
• New products are researched, tested and  
 trialled frequently.
• Customer feedback is sought and reviewed  
 on an ongoing basis.
• Key price points from competitors are  
 monitored regularly.
• Our food safety management systems are  
 continually reviewed and updated to ensure  
 our procedures are in line with the highest  
 standards.  
As raw meat is a traded commodity, the business 
operates in an environment where input prices 
can fluctuate based on worldwide natural 
and economic factors such as a growing world 
population, climate change, exchange rates  
and changing dietary habits.
The Company’ s purchasing and sales strategy is 
designed to minimise these risks by ensuring (i) 
we sell a broad range of products and in particular, 
as we split into two complementary retail areas, 
we cover two distinct customer types rather than 
relying on one product, one customer and (ii) we 
use a broad range of tried and tested suppliers 
across the globe rather than relying on any specific 
supplier or region.

Hot and cold cooked food – 38%
We have a wide range of 
products sold either (i) loose 
in a serve over counter for 
the traditional experience 
or (ii) as multi buy packs on 
supermarket style multi deck 
counters which have all been 
cut and packaged in store. 
Traditional raw meat – 62%
Our mission: to use our expertise to source, 
prepare, produce and retail quality fresh meat 
products at a price and a service level that 
continues to delight our customers.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Group continues  
to be the operation of a chain of meat focused 
retail food stores. The Group operates from a head 
office and distribution centre in Rotherham, plus 
39 retail locations across Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, 
Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the North West.
Food safety
We protect our customers and our brand by 
sourcing quality products with full traceability. 
Further to this we invest continually to ensure 
our food safety management systems are 
implemented, delivered and audited at  
every location.
As the only independent retail butchers chain in 
England to have Primary Authority, we continue to 
work with the Environmental Health department at 
Wakefield Council. This gives each of our locations, 
our staff and our customers a level of consistency 
in food safety matters as we are all working to 
the same standards and interpretations of the 
regulations.
Crawshaws continue to recognise the importance 
of food safety and positive consistent progress has 
continued and our Hygiene Ratings have improved 
again in the year with 100% of the business being 
on 4 (Good) and 5 (Very Good) scores; 26% on  
four stars and 74% on five stars. Our factories have 
also consistently maintained standards whilst 
increasing throughput to match the increases  
in sales.
There has been investment in training which 
has not only provided legal compliance but has 
equipped Managers with further knowledge and 
confidence to maintain food safety. Customer 
feedback also indicates consistent quality control 
and that they are happy that their needs are  
being met. 
The maintenance and continued development  
of the Company Food Safety Management System 
has been fundamental in maintaining standards 
across the Company. Whilst the Company will 
continue to face challenges, including changes  
in legislation, we are focused on maintaining  
food safety on a consistent basis. 
The focus on origin and traceability of products will 
continue to be managed as we recognise this as 
being essential if we are to meet the requirements 
of our customers and continue to supply safe and 
legal products.
Our product range is split into two  
distinct areas: Strategic Report Governance

Annual Report           52 weeks  ended 31 January 2016
The principal risks and uncertainties affecting  
the Group include the following:
Raw material availability and prices
The Group monitors raw material sources on a global 
basis and either contracts to buy a set volume of 
goods for a set price for delivering on a specific date  
or contracts to buy a set volume of goods at a set price 
over a short time period, typically from two to four 
weeks. All purchases of goods are made in sterling. 
Whilst the volatility of international currency markets 
and their impact on spot raw material prices in sterling 
is an ongoing issue, the flexibility to source globally 
provides a level of mitigation.
Customer loss and competition
There is an ongoing risk of customer loss from 
enhanced competition. The Group‘s strategy is 
to maintain customer loyalty through: 1) offering 
consistently high quality products at consistently 
low prices, 2) offering customers even greater 
value through a rolling cycle of deeply discounted 
promotional offers and; 3) delivering superior service 
and product expertise at all times. Competitor price 
points are reviewed regularly to make sure customers 
can rely on us to be significantly cheaper than our 
competitors.
Food safety
Compliance with legislation is continually assessed 
with a rolling monthly internal Food Safety 
compliance audit in each store augmenting the 
annual Environmental Health Office inspections.  
Any performance exceptions are discussed as a matter  
of course at the Monthly Plc Board meeting.
Environmental risks
The Group places considerable emphasis upon 
environmental compliance in its business and not 
only seeks to ensure ongoing compliance with 
relevant legislation but also strives to ensure that 
environmental best practice is incorporated into  
its key processes.
Major disruption/disaster
Business continuity planning is reviewed regularly.
The effect of legislation or other regulatory activities
The Group monitors forthcoming and current 
legislation. 
Shrinkage
All retailers are exposed to customer and employee 
theft. The Group has a zero tolerance to theft and we 
continually review internal systems and controls. We 
maximise the use of CCTV surveillance in store and 
aim to prosecute where relevant.

Annual Report           52 weeks  ended 31 January 2016
The Directors present their Annual Report on the affairs of the Group together with audited financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 31 January 2016  
(201 5: 53 week period).
Crawshaw Group Plc (the “Company“) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the Company’s registered office is Crawshaw Group Plc, Unit 4, Sandbeck Way, Hellaby Industrial Estate, Rotherham, S66 8QL.
The Company has its primary listing on AIM, part of the London Stock Exchange.
The Group financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 26 April 2016.
Further information on the activities of the business, the Group strategy and an indication of the outlook for the business are presented in the Chairman’s Statement,  
The Chief Executive Officer’s Statement and the Strategy and Business Model sections of the report.
Results and dividends
Reported under IFRS the Group loss before taxation is (£344,6 1 5) (2014: £1,1 94,398 profit). 
After a taxation credit of £75,21 1 (201 5 charge: £299,804) the Group loss for the year is £269,404 (201 5: £894,594 profit).
The Directors propose a final dividend of 0.47p per share (201 5: 0.47p) to be paid on 5 August 2016, to shareholders on the register at the close of business  
on 8 July 2016. The share price will be marked ex dividend with effect from the 7 July 2016. 
Dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP“) 
As last year, shareholders will have the opportunity to elect to reinvest their cash dividend and purchase existing shares in the Company through a Dividend  
Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”).
Dividend ratification
A technical matter has arisen in respect of the final dividend paid in July 201 5 (final dividend) in respect of the financial year ended on 31 January 201 5 and the interim 
dividend paid in October 201 5 (interim dividend) in respect of the financial year ending on 31 January 2016 (together the dividends).
It has been brought to the Directors’ attention that the dividends were paid in technical breach of the Companies Act 2006 the effect of which is that, while the Company’s 
Group held adequate reserves to cover the amount of the dividends, the dividends were paid at a time when the Company’s relevant accounts for the purposes of the 
Companies Act 2006 did not show sufficient distributable reserves to cover the full amount of the dividends. Subsequent to the approval of the dividends by the Company, 
dividends were paid up to the parent company from the Company’s subsidiaries such that the distributable reserves were then sufficient to cover both the dividends. 
Given that the Company would have had sufficient distributable profits to make the payment, had the upstream dividends from the subsidiaries been paid prior to the 
declaration of the dividends, the Directors believe that neither shareholders nor creditors would have been prejudiced. The Company nevertheless wishes to address the 
matter by way of a ratification resolution to be approved by shareholders at the AGM. This resolution asks shareholders to approve the appropriation of the historic profits 
of the Company to the dividend payments concerned and to release the current and former shareholders and directors from any claim by the Company for repayment of 
the dividends. The purpose of the resolution is to put the shareholders and directors into the position in which they were always intended to be.

Financial instruments
The Company’s financial risk management objectives can be found in notes 1 9 and 20 to the financial statements.
Creditor payment policy
The Group agrees payment with its trade creditors and other suppliers on an individual contract basis at the time the goods and services are ordered rather than following 
a standard code. The policy is to abide by the agreed terms once satisfied that the goods or services have been provided in accordance with the contract terms and 
conditions. The Group’s average creditor payment period at 31 January 2016 was 59 days (201 5: 46 days).
Employee involvement
The Board recognises that the Group’s performance and success is directly related to our ability to attract, train and motivate high calibre employees. We place considerable 
value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed on matters affecting them as employees and on the various financial and economic 
factors affecting the performance of the Group. Strategic Report Governance

Annual Report           52 weeks  ended 31 January 2016
Going concern
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out on page 09. For the purposes of their assessment of the preparation of the Group’s accounts  
on a going concern basis, the Directors have considered the current cash position and forecasts of future trading including working capital and investment requirements.
During the year the Group met its day-to-day general corporate and working capital requirements through existing cash resources. At 31 January 2016 the Group had cash 
on hand of £4.9m (201 5: £9. 1 m).
Overall, the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks success and successful execute the growth strategy. The Group’s forecasts  
and projections, taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should have sufficient cash resources to meet its 
requirements for at least the next twelve months. Accordingly, the adoption of the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements remains appropriate.
Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which 
the Group’s auditor is unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s auditor is aware of that information. 
Auditor
A resolution to re-appoint KPMG LLP as auditors and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will be put to the members at the forthcoming  
Annual General Meeting.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect  
of the Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. As required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock 
Exchange they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
– state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will continue  
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud  
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Strategic Report Governance

Opinion on financial statements

then ended;

with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception

Notes to the Financial Statements
(forming part of the Financial Statements)
1. Accounting policies 
Crawshaw Group Plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and equity account the Group’s interest  
in associates and joint ventures. The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its group.
Both the parent company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“ Adopted IFRSs”). On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial 
statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes  
that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The current financial period is a 52 week period to 31 January 2016. The prior year was a 53 week period.
New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations
The following amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the 52 week ended 31 January 2016, but do not have a material impact on the Group:
– IFRIC 21 , “Levies“;
– Improvements 201 1- 1 3;
– Improvements 2010- 1 2; and
– Amendment to IAS 1 9: Defined benefit plans: Employee contributions.
There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that are effective for financial statements after this reporting period, including IFRS 9 “Financial 
instruments“ effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 201 7 and IFRS 16 “Leases“ effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 201 9.
The Group is in the process of assessing the impact that the application of these standards and interpretations will have on the Group’s financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Change in subsidiary ownership and loss of control
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting  
gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
Joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control. These joint arrangement are in turn classified as:
– Joint ventures whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities; and
– Joint operations whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed  
to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50% of the voting power of another entity. 
Application of the equity method to associates and joint ventures
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment includes 
goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive 
income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence 
or joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition 
of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee. Strategic Report Governance

Annual Report           52 weeks  ended 31 January 2016
1. Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation continued
Joint operations
Where the Group is a party to a joint operation, the consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the joint operations assets and liabilities,  
as well as the Group’s share of the entity’s profit or loss and other comprehensive income, on a line-by-line basis.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.  
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategy and Business Model  
on page 08. In addition, notes 1 9 and 20 set out the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital and exposures to credit and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in note 20, the Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through cash generated from operations and borrowings. Current cash on hand 
totals £4.9m.
The Group’s forecasts and cash projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance as a result of the uncertain economic conditions,  
show that the Group should be able to operate within its cash reserves.
Additional focus has been placed on cash flow management to ensure sufficient funding is in place to deliver our growth strategy. The Board has reviewed cash flow 
projections under a number of scenarios relating to the pace of store rollout and potential performance outcomes of those stores and have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
In applying policies consistent with IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party 
under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number 
of the Group’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed 
number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Group’s 
own shares, the amounts presented in this financial information for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable, or redeemable only at the Company’s option, and any dividends are discretionary. Dividends thereon 
are recognised as distributions within equity upon approval by the Group’s shareholders.
Preference share capital is classified as a liability if it is redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders, or if dividend payments are not discretionary. 
Dividends thereon are recognised as interest expense in profit or loss as accrued.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified  
in equity are treated as distributions and are recorded directly in equity.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables.
T rade and other receivables are recognised at stated cost less impairment losses. It is the Company’s policy to review trade and other receivable balances for evidence  
of impairment at each reporting date. Any receivables which give significant cause for concern are written down to the best estimate of the recoverable amount.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and cash at bank.
T rade and other payables are recognised at stated cost.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.  
Residual values of property, plant and equipment is assumed to be nil. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Freehold property 2%
• Leasehold buildings in accordance with the lease term
• Leasehold improvements in accordance with the lease term
• Plant, equipment and vehicles 3- 1 5 years straight line basis 24 Crawshaw Group Plc
Annual Report           52 weeks  ended 31 January 2016
1. Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets and goodwill
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of businesses. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 1 December 2006, goodwill represents  
the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately  
or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. 
Any impairment is then recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period. The Company elected not to restate business combinations in 
Crawshaw Butchers Limited that took place prior to 1 February 2006. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 February 2006, goodwill is included at 1 February 2006 on the basis 
of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable save that only separable intangibles were recognised and 
goodwill was amortised.
Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill,  
from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
• Brand 20 years
Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication 
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units  
and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates 
cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in  
the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined,  
net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow  
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash 
flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate.
Trade and other receivables
T rade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value and thereafter at amortised cost less impairment charges.

1. Accounting policies continued
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. Cost comprises purchase price  
and an allocation of production overheads. Net realisable value is estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion  
and selling expenses. 
Inventories are primarily goods for resale.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand and cash-at bank. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A provision is recognised for the 
amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result  
of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably
Revenue
Revenue is mainly derived from retail butcher activities, stated after trade discounts, VA T and any other sales taxes. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is the time of retail sale to the 
customer. Where the Group sells to distributors, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised where there are no further obligations on the Group and when the associated 
economic benefits are due to the Group and the turnover can be reliably measured.
The Group does not receive any form of rebate from suppliers.
Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense. Lease incentives are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the associated lease. 
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities, interest receivable on funds invested and dividend income.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the income 
statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are expensed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Taxation
T ax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. T ax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates  
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect 
neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably  
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 26 Crawshaw Group Plc

1. Accounting policies continued
Bank loans, overdrafts and loan notes
Interest-bearing bank loans, overdrafts and loan notes are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable  
on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to  
the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and 
expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. Operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Executive 
Officer to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. The Directors 
consider each location to be a separate operating segment. The Directors have applied the provisions within IFRS 8 for aggregation of operating segments with similar risks 
and markets, to have one reportable segment. The Group’s business operations are conducted exclusively in the UK so geographical segment reporting is not required.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial information in conformity with IFRS required management to make judgements, estimated and assumptions that affect the application  
of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The estimates associated with the assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the 
revision only affects that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date are:
• Share based payments (note 1 7)
• Deferred tax (note 1 3)
• Intangible assets in business combinations (note 10 and note 24)
Share based payments
The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of  
non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of such equity settled share based payments is expensed  
on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting 
conditions (with a corresponding movement in equity).
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects  
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The fair value of the shares issued under the new Long Term Incentive Plan were valued on a discounted cash flow basis in conjunction with a third party valuation 
specialist.

Adjustments for the prior year include a tax rebate of £148,000 due to an increased capital allowance claim following a review of the classification of our capital spend.  
The principles agreed at this review will apply to our future capital investments.
The movement in deferred tax in the period includes the impact of deferred tax attributable to share based payments (note 1 7). 
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 1 9% (effective from 1 April 201 7) and to 18% (effective from 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted in November 
201 5. A further rate reduction to 1 7% (to be effective from 1 April 2020) was announced in the March 2016 Budget and is expected to be substantively enacted later this year.
This will reduce the company's future current tax charge accordingly and reduce the deferred tax asset at 31 January 2016 which has been calculated based on the rate  
of 18% in line with the above.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. 
Acquired brand values were calculated using the royalty relief approach and are amortised over 20 years. The remaining amortisation period is eleven years and two months.

Impairment testing
Goodwill arose on the Group’s original acquisition of Crawshaw Butchers Limited and on the subsequent acquisitions of East Yorkshire Beef Limited in June 2014 and 
Gabbotts Farm Limited in April 201 5. The carrying value of goodwill is allocated against the stores which were trading in each business at the time of acquisition. 
Each store is treated as a separate cash generating unit with the stores trading in each business at the time of acquisition defined as the “relevant group of CGUs“  
for the purposes of impairment testing.
The goodwill supported by the expected future cash flows of each relevant group of CGUs as at 31 January 2016 is as follows:
    2016 2015 
    £ £
Crawshaw Butchers Limited (at acquisition)    7,028,657 7,028,657
East Yorkshire Beef Limited    177,301 177,301
Gabbotts Farm Limited    3,383,705 —
The recoverable amount of Crawshaw Butchers Ltd, East Yorkshire Beef Limited and Gabbotts Farm Limited acquisition has been calculated with reference to their value 
in use. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and projections approved by management for the next five years and 
assuming an estimated long term annual growth rate of 2.0% for the subsequent 25 years (201 5: 2.0%).
The financial budgets and projections are based on past experience and actual operating results. The growth rates for the five year period are based on current 
performance of the existing store and product mix. The Directors believe that the long-term growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate  
for the UK economy, the principal geographic area in which Crawshaws operates.
The Directors estimate the discount rates using the post-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific  
to the cash-generating unit. In the current year the Directors estimate the applicable pre-tax rate to be 1 3.3% (201 5: 1 5.0%).
The Directors modelled a range of different scenarios by applying sensitivities to both the cash flow assumptions and the discount rate. Based on the sensitivity  
analysis there is significant headroom between the value in use calculation and the carrying value of the CGU. 32 Crawshaw Group Plc

Long Term Incentive Plan
Shares were granted under the Crawshaw Group Plc Long Term Incentive Plan on 24 April 201 5 which entitles employees to equity instruments in Crawshaw Butchers 
Limited. The shares are ’growth shares’ in a subsidiary, Crawshaw Butchers Ltd, but have value linked to the market capitalisation of Crawshaw Group Plc. Shareholders are 
entitled to a maximum pool of 10% of the growth in value of the market capitalisation of Crawshaw Group Plc over the hurdle rate, where the hurdle rate is set as a premium 
of 1 5% to market capitalisation immediately prior to the award of the shares.
Shareholders have the option to “put” their Eligible Put Shares on the occurrence of the following events:
– The First and Second Put Dates: shareholders can put 1/6th of their shares from the first anniversary of the date of grant and a further 1/6th of their shares from the 
second anniversary of the date of grant.
– The achievement of the Performance Conditions: shareholders can put 1/3rd of their shares once the market capitalisation of Crawshaw Butchers has increased  
by 50% since the date of grant. In addition, shareholders can put a further 1/3rd of their shares once the market capitalisation of Crawshaw Butchers has increased  
by 100% since the date of grant.
– On a voluntary winding up or change of control of Crawshaw Group Plc.
The fair value of the awards is determined by using the Monte Carlo model and allowance has been made for the following assumptions: Expected exercise date, expected 
volatility of total shareholder return, expected future dividends and the risk free rate of interest. 100,000 simulations were used in the Monte Carlo model and set out below 
is a summary of the key data.
Date of grant     24 April 201 5
Ave share price in period prior to grant     53.1p
Volatility of TSR for the Company     60% pa
Dividend yield     1% pa
Risk free rate of Interest     1.75% pa
Exercise pattern Uniform from two to ten years or when performance condition met if later
The expected Volatility is wholly based on the historic volatility simulated over differing time periods to the date of grant.
The share based payment charge will be adjusted each financial year to reflect expected and actual achievement of non-market based vesting conditions.  
The total expense for the period between 24 April and 31 January 2016, is £347 ,000.
The total share based payment charge recognized in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is £359,592 being £1 2,592 for the share option schemes in operation  
and £347 ,000 for the Long Term Incentive Plan.

19. Financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and trade creditors. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each  
of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The Group has paid all bank facilities mitigating any risk in interest rate variability. 
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and receivables. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables. T rade receivables are included  
in the balance sheet net of a provision for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of current 
economic conditions.
At the balance sheet date, the Directors consider there to be no significant credit risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity  
of funding and flexibility through the use of cash and bank facilities. The cash generative nature of the business is forecast to continue and the bank facilities have been  
paid in full. The Directors are confident that there will continue to be sufficient headroom to cover liquidity risk.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the effect of netting agreements:

20. Capital management
The capital structure of the Group is a mixture of (i) net cash made up of cash balances and (ii) equity comprising issued share capital and reserves as detailed in the 
Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity.
The Group’s primary objective is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance, and to maintain a strong 
credit rating and headroom. The Group manages its capital structure through detailed management forecasts and clear authorisation procedures for significant capital 
expenditure. The Board makes appropriate decisions in light of the current economic conditions and strategic objectives of the Group. 
There has been no change in the objectives, policies or processes with regards to capital management during the periods ended 31 January 2016 and 31 January 201 5. Strategic Report Governance

person or by proxy, will be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For this purpose, seniority will be determined by the order in which the names stand in the register 
of members in respect of the shares.
8.  Any alteration to this form must be initialled.
9.  Returning the proxy form will not prevent you from attending the meeting and voting in person.
10.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) of it by using the 
procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members, sponsored CREST members and CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s) should refer to 
their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action for them. To complete a valid proxy appointment or instruction using the CREST service, the 
CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for 
such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy must in order to be valid, be transmitted and received by Capita Asset Services (Participant ID RA 10) 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting (or adjournment thereof).  
The time of receipt of the instruction will be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which Capital Registrars are able to 
retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to 
the appointee through other means.

necessary action to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by a particular time. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service 
provider(s) should refer to the sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.

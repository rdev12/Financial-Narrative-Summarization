Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report on
another excellent set of trading
results for Hamworthy.
In the year to 31 March 2009
operating profit rose by 42.3%
to £23.0 million (2008 restated:
£16.1 million) with underlying
earnings per share
1
increasing
by 42.3% to 40.0p (2008
restated: 28.1p). Statutory
earnings per share increased
by 30.2% to 36.6p per share
(2008: 28.1p per share).
The closing order book was 16.5% lower at £260.4 million
(2008: £311.8 million) and order intake fell 22.1% to
£177.6 million (2008: £228.1 million). The Group remained
cash generative with closing net funds
2
of £55.5 million
(2008: £48.0 million).
We have made good progress on the strategy outlined in
last year’s annual report. Through a series of targeted efforts
Hamworthy’s progress towards sustainable double digit
operating margin remains on track. We have expanded
our presence in markets outside of new shipbuilding, such
as the offshore market, and we have continued to increase
the pace of investment in new technology particularly in
markets driven by environmental legislation. We have made
two acquisitions during the year and will continue to target
opportunities that will expand our technology base and
strengthen our market positions.
1 Calculated using earnings excluding loss on fair value movements in derivatives.
2 Calculated as the net of cash and cash equivalents less borrowings.

Company overview Business review Governance Accounts
Since the summer of 2008 we have experienced unprecedented
economic and financial conditions and we are seeing the
effects of this on our markets. The Group has been swift
to recognise these challenges and has carried out a detailed
planning exercise to identify and implement actions designed
to mitigate the effects of any potential reduction in demand.
As a result, the Group has already reduced its headcount
by 6%.
The Group maintains a healthy near-term order book and
has a strong balance sheet. We remain confident in the
long-term growth prospects of the markets that the Group
is targeting and are committed to strategies aimed at
delivering long-term shareholder value. Commensurately
we will continue to pursue a progressive dividend policy.
Your directors are therefore recommending a final ordinary
dividend of 5.68p per share, an increase of 7.4% on the
prior year of 5.29p. If approved, this would result in a 10%
increase in the total dividend declared in respect of the year
to 8.73p per share (2008: 7.94p). Subject to shareholders’
approval the final dividend will be paid on 23 July 2009
to all shareholders on the register on 26 June 2009.
On behalf of the board I thank all of our employees for their
contributions to another year of significant achievement.
Our employees play a critical role in the Group’s success
and we recognise that this will be particularly so in meeting
the challenges ahead. We remain committed to recruiting,
retaining and developing the best people.

Chief Executive’s review
Hamworthy has achieved another record
financial performance and we have made
good progress in achieving our strategic
objectives. The Group has delivered strong
growth in profits, improved operating margins
and continues to achieve healthy rates of
profit-to-cash conversion. Operating profit
grew by 42.3% to £23.2 million, partly due
to exchange rate movements during the year.
On a constant currency basis operating profits
grew by 26.0% compared to 2008.

Joe Oatley
Chief Executive
Hamworthy_13082AR 2009_p12_p33:Layout 1  10/6/09  13:57  Page 12 13
Company overview Business review Governance Accounts
Operating margins improved to
9.1% (2008 restated: 7.0%) with
particularly strong performance
from the Pump Systems and
Water Systems businesses.
Order intake slowed in the second half of the year as
our markets felt the impact of the deterioration in world
economic conditions. As a result order intake for the
full year decreased by 22.1% to £177.6 million
(2008: £228.1 million) and the closing order book reduced
by 16.5% to £260.4 million (2008: £311.8 million).
The performance of the individual businesses is reviewed
in the divisional review on pages 22 to 29. The Group’s
Aftersales business operates with a matrix structure, with
capability embedded in each of the operating businesses
and a common network of service centres to provide the
highest level of in-service support to our customers. Aftersales
revenue grew by 23.8% to £36.3 million (2008: £29.3 million),
the constituent parts of which are included in the divisional
revenues on pages 22 to 29.
Strategy
A year ago I outlined our Group strategy, explaining
how we will deliver long-term value to our shareholders.
We have made good progress on the key aspects of this
strategy, a summary of which is given on page 15.
In particular we have achieved successes in the key elements
of improving operating margins and expanding our business
into markets outside new shipbuilding. We have focused
on growing in the offshore and aftersales service markets
and as a result have achieved a better balance to the Group
with significant growth in both areas. In the year 58%
of Group order intake in the financial year 2009 was in
areas outside new shipbuilding, compared to less than 20%
two years ago. We have improved operating margins in
three of our four businesses through a focus on improving
operational efficiency. Whilst some of the margin
improvement in the year was due to beneficial product mix,
we remain on course to achieve our target of sustainable
double digit operating margins.
We continue to increase investment in research and
development across the Group. In the period this investment
increased by 53% to £2.9 million. Our development efforts
are focused on ensuring that we have leading technologies
to maintain our market leading positions and developing
new solutions to meet new market opportunities.
We have made two acquisitions during the year to expand
our technology base. We acquired a majority stake in Baltic
Design Centre in November 2008 which brings both ship
design capability and access to lower cost highly skilled
engineering talent in Poland. Baltic Design Centre has been
integrated into our Gas Systems business. Greenship BV ,
which has developed a leading technology for ballast water
treatment systems for the marine market, was acquired in
March 2009. Such systems will be required to be fitted
to all ships by forthcoming international environmental
legislation. Greenship has been integrated into the Water
Systems business.
Health, Safety and Environment
The safety of our employees is of the highest priority.
Whilst having the correct policies and procedures is important,
safety is also about how people think and act. Our goal is
to eliminate injuries by continually seeking safer workplaces,
processes and behaviour. We have increased our activities
over the past year to raise the awareness of health and
safety throughout the business and have established safety
performance as one of our Key Performance Indicators
(‘KPIs’) as set out on page 21.
The Group takes seriously its responsibilities to the
environment. All principal sites are now compliant with
Environmental Standard ISO 14001 and many of its products
help customers to reduce the impact of their operations on
the environment.
Prior year adjustment
As reported in our half year report for the six months
ended 30 September 2008, the Group has corrected an
overstatement of inventory value in the Inert Gas Systems
business historic accounting. The prior year adjustment
announced at the time has been confirmed and details are
contained in note 5 to the financial statements. The board
confirmed that this was an isolated incident and has taken
action to strengthen the internal controls across the Group
and prevent recurrence.

Chief Executive’s review continued
Markets
The Group operates in a number of specialist markets
predominantly within the oil and gas sector. We target
markets that have long-term growth characteristics, driven
largely by environmental legislation, investment in oil and
gas production and the need to transport gas from the
point of production to the point of consumption.
Whilst our markets have these long-term growth characteristics,
they are not immune to the effects of the current challenging
economic environment and we have seen a slowdown in
ordering activity in many of our markets.
The new shipbuilding market in particular has been affected
by both the deterioration in world economic conditions and
the lack of available finance. Although build activity remains
high and shipyards have significant order books there have
been very low levels of new vessel ordering across all ship
types since October 2008. The level of cancellations seen in
our specialist markets is relatively low and we have suffered
a reduction in our order book of only 1.6% as a result of
cancellations since October 2008.
The Group has experienced strong demand during the
period from the offshore market, in particular for FPSOs and
semi-submersibles. These projects are typically on multi-year
development cycles and therefore tend to be less sensitive
to short-term economic volatility. Enquiry levels for projects
within this sector continue to be robust. However, it is
apparent that some offshore projects are experiencing
delays in part due to an expectation of future deflation
in construction costs.
The field population of the Group’s products continues
to grow and as a result demand for the aftersales market
remains steady.
Outlook
Despite the lower order intake in recent months, the Group
enters the new financial year with a sizeable and robust
order book, giving good near-term visibility and sales
coverage. In addition our Aftersales business, which
operates on short lead times, continues to have steady
order intake. The Board is therefore confident of meeting
expectations for financial year ending 31 March 2010.
We are not immune to the effects of the current economic
slowdown and we expect market conditions to be challenging
for all of our businesses in the year ahead, particularly
with regard to order intake. We have carried out a detailed
scenario and contingency planning exercise to ensure that
we are ready to adjust our cost base to match market
demands if and when this becomes necessary. As a result
of this work we have already taken action to reduce costs
including headcount reductions in our Gas Systems business
of 25% and in Hamworthy Serck Como of 11% as it is
clear that these businesses will have lower activity levels
in the coming year.
In the medium-term we expect the offshore market
to remain healthy but activity levels to fall in the new
shipbuilding market as the current low levels of
contracting for new vessels flow through to deliveries.
In the longer term the Group has exciting growth prospects
with a range of significant new market opportunities driven
by new environmental legislation and increasing demand
for energy and its transportation, in particular LNG. We
remain committed to investing in developing world leading
technologies in order to exploit these future opportunities.
With a strong balance sheet and high rate of profit-to-cash
conversion, measured on a three year average, the Group
expects to strengthen its market positions during the current
challenging economic conditions and be well positioned to
capture new growth opportunities as they arise.

Basis of reporting
The Group financial statements in this report have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), as adopted for use in the EU, together with
the associated International Financial Reporting Interpretation
Council (IFRIC) interpretations and those parts of the Companies
Act 1985 applicable to entities reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements of the parent company have been
presented in accordance with UK GAAP .
Accounting policies
The Group has reviewed its accounting policies in accordance
with IAS 8 and determined that they are appropriate for
the Group. These have been consistently applied.
Prior period adjustment
As reported in the Group’s half year report the valuation
of inventory held in the Inert Gas Systems business was
restated to correct an historic accounting error. This gives
rise to the restatement of the previous year’s consolidated
income statement and net assets. The effect has been
to decrease the value of net assets at 31 March 2008
by £3.2 million, the operating profit for that period by
£0.4 million and the earnings per share for that year
by 0.6p per share.
After a comprehensive review, including both internal
investigative work and a commissioned external report the
Board confirmed that this was an isolated incident and that
there has been no effect on the earnings for the year ended
31 March 2009 and no cash impact.
Details of the restated numbers are provided in note 5 to the
financial statements. Amounts referred to as comparatives
for the previous financial year within the financial statements
are therefore the restated figures.
Acquisitions
On 3 November 2008 the Group acquired 79% of the
issued share capital of Baltic Design Centre, a marine
design company based in Poland, for a cash consideration,
excluding acquisition transaction costs of £0.5 million.
That consideration has been allocated as between
the provisional fair value of tangible and intangible net
assets acquired and goodwill as set out in note 36 to
the financial statements.
On 9 March 2009 the Group acquired the whole of the
issued share capital of Greenship BV for a total expected
consideration, excluding acquisition transaction costs of
£6.5 million. £1.9 million was paid in cash at completion
and a further £4.6 million is payable conditional upon
certain of the company’s products receiving certification
society approvals. This is expected to be completed within
twelve months of the balance sheet date. Greenship is
based in the Netherlands and specialises in the treatment
of ballast water for ships.
As the transaction was completed near the year end the
directors have made only a provisional estimate of the
allocation of the consideration to the fair value of net
tangible and intangible assets acquired and goodwill.
A final review will be completed in financial year 2010.
Details of both transactions are provided in note 36 to
the financial statements.
Results overview
The Group has delivered another excellent set of results.
Revenue increased by 9.1% to £252.8 million
(2008: £231.8 million) and operating profit rose by 42.3% to
£23.0 million (2008 restated: £16.1 million). Group operating
margins increased to 9.1% (2008 restated: 7.0%).
The Group generated 76% of its operating profits
before central costs in reporting currencies other than
sterling, the most significant being euro, Danish kroner,
Norwegian kroner, Singapore dollars and Chinese renminbi.
The weighted average rate for these currencies has
strengthened by 13% compared to the prior year which
had the effect of increasing sterling consolidated revenue
by £24.5 million and operating profits by £2.6 million.
On a constant currency basis revenue decreased by 1.5%
and underlying operating profits increased by 26.0%.
Underlying profit before taxation, excluding the loss on fair
value movement in derivatives, rose 44.1% to £24.5 million
(2008 restated: £17.0 million) or 28.0% on a constant
currency basis. Despite average interest income rates
falling by 1.5% during the year, net interest income rose
to £1.6 million (2008: £0.9 million) as the Group maintained
its healthy net cash position.
The Group’s undelivered order book decreased from
£311.8 million to £260.4 million.

Financial review continued
Taxation
The tax charge of £5.8 million (2008: £4.5 million) represents
an effective rate of 26.0% (2008: 26.6%). The Group
generates taxable profits in a number of jurisdictions where
the rate of corporation tax is lower than the UK. The most
notable differences are in China and Singapore. The net
effect of these lower foreign tax rates is equivalent to 2.9%
of the profit before taxation. Note 13 to the financial
statements provides details of the tax charge.
Earnings per share
Both basic underlying earnings per share
1
and fully diluted
underlying earnings per share
1
increased 42.3% from a
restated 28.1p per share to 40.0p per share. On a constant
currency basis the increase would have been 26.7%.
Note 15 to the financial statements provides details of these
calculations and those of earnings per share on a statutory
basis for the period.
Dividend
The Board are recommending a final ordinary dividend of
5.68p per share. If approved by shareholders this would
result in a total dividend declared in respect of the year of
8.73p per share when added to the interim dividend of
3.05p per share paid in January 2009.
Financing, cash flow and treasury
All the Group’s businesses focus on their cash flows and the
control of working capital requirements. The conversion of
Group profits to cash flow is a key financial performance
indicator, as discussed within the KPI commentary on page 21,
and the Group’s strategy of maintaining a low fixed cost
base helps minimise the requirement for investment in capital
assets. The Group’s cash flows are a combination of regular
patterns in those businesses with smaller unit cost equipment
supply and greater volatility within the larger contract
businesses. The measure of cash conversion is therefore
monitored over a revolving three year period.
A summary of cash flows and the change in net funds is set
out below. Operating cash flow amounted to £12.3 million
(2008: £19.3 million) which is a conversion rate of 53.4% of
operating profit. This follows a two year period of in excess
of 100% conversion and the return to an average of 98%
over the last three years is seen in the working capital
increase in the table below. The net funds position at the
year end was £55.5 million (2008: £48.0 million). Further
detail relating to the cash flows and movements in net funds
of the Group is given in the consolidated cash flow
statement on page 46 and in notes 31 and 32 to the
financial statements.

All businesses are responsible for the management of cash
and working capital locally. Principal operating companies
participate in a cash pooling arrangement under which
surplus cash is transferred to a central treasury function
which manages the most efficient use of funds across the
Group. The Group has historically hedged part of the interest
rate exposure on its term debt. At 31 March 2009 that
exposure relates to a term loan held in the Group’s German
subsidiary with an outstanding balance of £0.8 million. The
interest rate exposure on that debt is fully hedged to a fixed
rate of 3.35%.

Company overview Business review Governance Accounts
Hamworthy plc
The Group’s businesses are global and each can contract in
several currencies. The Group’s policy is to hedge all currency
transaction exposures at the time of entering into the
contractual commitment back to the relevant contracting
business’ local currency. The significant majority of this
hedging is operated through the central treasury function.
The Group’s principal operating businesses are required to
reconcile their exposures and related hedges and report
them to the treasury function as part of their financial
reporting routines. The Group intends that its hedging
procedures qualify for hedge reserve accounting as far as is
practical to do so. This will result in any gain or loss volatility
of hedge derivatives initially being recorded in a separate
component of equity and not through the Income Statement.
Where hedging products do not so qualify the gains or
losses relating to movements in fair values of the derivative
product are recorded in the Income Statement. This has
occurred during this financial year and the effect has been
adjusted in arriving at underlying profit before tax and
underlying earnings per share as shown in the Income
Statement and detailed note 15 to the financial statements.
The Group has renegotiated its primary banking and finance
facilities provided by Barclays Bank plc during the year and
executed a new Facility Agreement on 25 March 2009.
This provides a three year £60 million committed facility
for bonds guarantees and indemnities. This is capable
of being increased to £80 million conditional upon the
reduction in certain levels of mark-to-market of the Group’s
extant foreign exchange hedges. Barclays Bank also provide
the majority of the Group’s foreign exchange hedging
through an uncommitted facility dated 25 March 2009.
In addition the Group has further facilities held directly
by its subsidiaries with local banks. The Group has
not breached any covenant within its banking facility
during the year.
Going Concern
The Group’s activities, together with the factors likely to
affect its future performance are included in this Business
Review and the principal risks are set out on pages 19 to 20.
Notes 24 and 33 of the financial statements set out the
Group’s objectives and procedures for managing capital,
financial, currency and liquidity risk.
The Group has available to it considerable financial resources
including its own net funds which were £55.5 million at
31 March 2009 and its renegotiated committed banking
facilities. The Group’s banking covenants have all been
met comfortably during the past year and the expectation
is that this will continue.
The order book at 31 March 2009 represented a ratio of
1.03 compared to revenue in the last financial year and
the Group’s businesses have relationships and costs bases
in diverse geographic areas.
Whilst the current volatility in financial markets has
created general uncertainty in respect of the current
economic outlook, the long-term nature of the Group’s
business, taken together with its forward order book,
provide a satisfactory level of confidence to the Board
in trading during the year ahead.
Hence, after making appropriate enquiries, the directors
have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Group continues to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing its accounts.
Risks
The Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties
which could have a material impact on its long-term
performance. The directors have identified the following
as being the principal risks.
Contract or product failure
The Group’s businesses contract for the supply of complex,
highly technical and in many cases individually high value
systems. Contracts may be long-term in nature and involve
multi-currency transactions. The delivered systems can be
mission critical to the end user. Failure of a Group business
in the delivery of its contractual commitments or subsequent
failure of the product could expose the Group to unforeseen
losses. The Group’s design, engineering and supply chain
processes are designed to meet high quality and reliability
standards. The businesses invest in the training of project
personnel and conduct regular reviews of contract costs
and progress.
Competition
The Group’s businesses compete with large well established
global companies, local companies and low cost equipment
and service providers. They do so on the basis of technical
expertise, price, timeliness of delivery, previous experience
and reputation for quality and reliability. To remain
competitive the Group invests in its product development,
manufacturing capabilities, sourcing and supply chain
management and market access. The Group’s strategic
objective is to hold leading market positions in its targeted
market segments.
Hamworthy_13082AR 2009_p12_p33:Layout 1  10/6/09  13:57  Page 19 20 Hamworthy plc Business review
Exposure to multi-currency markets
The Group operates globally with the majority of its earnings
being generated outside the UK and contracts taken in
various currencies. Changes in global currency rates can
result in changes to expected earnings and cash flows and
movements in net asset values if unhedged and affect the
competitive position of operating businesses.
The Group’s policy is to fully hedge transactional currency
exposure back to the reporting currency of the operating
unit. Operating subsidiaries report these exposures as they
arise and arrange hedging cover through the Group’s central
treasury function. Competitively the Group has cost bases in
various currencies which limits exposure to any one
particular currency relative to competitors.
New shipbuilding market trends
58% of the Group’s revenue in the year to 31 March 2009
came from the new shipbuilding market. In aggregate
this market is highly cyclical and this can result in volatility
in consolidated earnings and cash flows. The Group’s
strategy is to target a balance of niche markets both within
specialist ship types and outside the new shipbuilding cycle.
Increasingly the Group is targeting the offshore, aftersales
and retrofit markets. As a result, the share of the Group’s
order intake from the new shipbuilding market was reduced
to 42% for the year.
Uncertainty on timing of order placements
Several of the Group’s businesses supply equipment and
services into large bespoke projects the exact timing of order
placement for which can be difficult to accurately predict.
This can result in volatility in cash flows and demand on
resources. The Group aims to maintain a low fixed cost base
flexible enough to accommodate this volatility. It has taken
certain actions during the last financial year to reduce costs
in businesses most exposed to demand volatility.
Counterparty failure
The Group contracts globally with both customers and
suppliers whose performance and financial viability could
have a material impact on the Group’s earnings. The failure
of a key supplier or customer to meet its obligations to
the Group could result in exposure to financial liabilities or
impairment of the value of assets. The Group’s businesses
regularly assess customer credit risk and payment terms are
set accordingly including the use of bank instruments and
credit insurance. Supplier performance is similarly monitored
and, where possible, diversity of supply is integrated into
product design.
Acquisitions
Hamworthy continues to seek acquisition opportunities
as part of its growth strategy. There is a risk that such
acquisitions do not realise their expected benefits.
Acquisition targets are assessed against the businesses’
development objectives and are subject to due diligence
processes. The Group’s senior management have
developed an integration programme to be applied
to all acquired businesses.

The Group aims to deliver long-term growth in
shareholder value through the aggregated effect
of its core strategies and earnings per share is a
key indicator of this. It is also used as a key measure in
determining vesting of awards under the Group long-
term incentive plans. Underlying earnings per share is
calculated as earnings attributable to ordinary
shareholders divided by the weighted average number
of shares in issue during the year.
Performance and measurement
Revenue visibility from the forward order book
is both an indicator of future potential and allows
the Group’s businesses to make better informed
planning decisions. This ratio is calculated as total
forward order book expressed as a multiple of the
previous year’s revenue.
One of the Group’s key strategic objectives is
to increase business operating margins through
improved operational efficiency. Operating margins are
calculated as operating profits expressed as a
percentage of revenue.
The Group aims to maintain a low fixed cost base,
minimising the level of fixed and working capital
required to support the business operations.
The Group’s larger contracting businesses have volatile
cash flows and this measure of the ratio
of cash per share to earnings per share is therefore
calculated over a rolling three year period.
Developing innovative solutions to meet customer
needs is critical to maintaining market leadership
in the Group’s targeted market segments and
achieving growth in emerging markets. The Group
is therefore committed to ensuring that sufficient
investment is made in research and development
to achieve these aims.
The Group is committed to continuous improvement of its safety performance and has now
includedthe accident rate as one of its key performance indicators. Accident rate is defined
as the number of reportable accidents which result in an absence of greater than 3 days
per 100,000 employees. In the year to 31 March 2009 the rate was 1,128 (2008: 1,295).
The Group does not have the historic comparative data prior to 2008.
Definition and rationale
Key Performance Indicators
The Group’s management teams use various performance
measures to help run and assess the performance of
their businesses. The following measures are those which
the board believe best indicate the performance of the
Group as a whole.
Hamworthy_13082AR 2009_p12_p33:Layout 1  10/6/09  15:13  Page 21 Revenue rose by 26.8% to
£84.4 million (2008: £66.6
million). Operating profit rose
by 72.6% to £12.5 million
(2008: £7.3 million).
Order intake fell by 16.9% to £54.4 million
(2008: £65.5 million) and the order book declined by
7.0% to £79.6 million (2008: £85.6 million). Along with
the Water Systems business, Pump Systems results were
heavily influenced by currency translation effects. On a
constant currency basis underlying operating profit rose
by 50.9% to £10.9 million.
Operating margins improved to 14.8% (2008: 10.9%)
due to cost reduction and efficiency improvements and
the favourable product mix and the operational leverage
of the increased volumes. The margins which were
considered exceptional in first half year at 19.1% returned
to more normal levels of 10.7% in the second half year.
Revenue grew strongly for both deepwell and centrifugal
pumps with significant volumes being delivered into the gas
carrier and oil tanker markets. Despite this record revenue
the business improved its on-time delivery performance
and reduced lead times through improved efficiency and
continued focus on outsourcing of the lower added value
steps in the manufacturing process.
Investment in research and development has focused on
developing our range of pumps for the offshore market
and we have had particular success in expanding the
business in this sector. The business secured a strategically
significant order for 30 deepwell pumps to be installed on
the Pazflor FPSO. This is the first contract where Hamworthy
is supplying deepwell pumping systems for process
applications and a significant milestone for the Group in
the offshore FPSO market. Ordering of engine room pump
systems for other offshore installation types has also been
particularly active this year with contracts being received
from all of the key Asian offshore yards.
Demand for the Group’s pump room systems from the oil
tanker market has been robust with strong order intake and
sales in particular for larger ship types. In 2008 Pump Systems
secured a strategically significant multi-ship set order for pump
room systems for ten Suezmax tankers to be built and used
in Brazil and the first of these systems has successfully been
delivered. Further orders have been received for systems for
four shuttle tankers as part of Petrobras’ fleet expansion and
modernisation programme, for which construction of a total
of 42 tankers is forecast.

Revenue decreased by 15.4%
to £83.7 million (2008: £98.9
million) as the business
substantially completed the
LNG reliquefaction system
contracts received during the
period 2005 through 2007.
Operating profit reduced by 32.5% to £3.7 million
(2008: £5.5 million). Order intake fell by 34.4% to
£45.7 million (2008: £69.7 million) and the order book
decreased by 37.4% to £76.3 million (2008: £121.8 million).
Operating margins fell to 4.4% (2008: 5.5%) as improvements
in gross margins were more than offset by the business
continuing to invest in both technology and business
development to ensure that it is well placed to exploit
future opportunities within the LNG market.
The business successfully completed a further 15 installations
of LNG reliquefaction systems to the Q-Flex LNG carriers
that will serve the Qatar gas fields. In total 25 Hamworthy
reliquefaction systems have now successfully completed sea
trials on these vessels. The Group also achieved an important
contract win for a development of its LNG reliquefaction
technology for four Dual Fuel Diesel Electric (‘DFDE’) vessels.
This is the first time that a reliquefaction system has been
fitted to a DFDE powered LNG carrier and opens up this
market segment for Hamworthy’s technology.
24 Hamworthy plc Business review
Hamworthy has recently completed its 25th
reliquefaction system installation on board the
216,000m
3
series of ‘Q-flex’ LNG carriers with low
speed diesel propulsion. In August 2008 the Group
also announced that it had secured a first of type
contract to supply LNG-RS plant on four dual-fuel
diesel-electric powered ships for BG Group marking
its entry into a new market.

Company overview Business review Governance Accounts
Hamworthy plc
Gas Systems entered the small LPG/ethylene carrier market,
securing an order for reliquefaction systems for five such
vessels at a major shipyard in Japan.
Investment in technology development has focused on the
business’ natural gas liquefaction process for both the offshore
and onshore markets. The business has now developed
a higher capacity, higher efficiency system, targeted at
the future opportunity for floating LNG production vessels.
For the onshore market the business has built on the
experience gained from the onshore LNG project completed
in 2008 to refine its offering to provide a natural gas
liquefaction plant where much of the system is delivered to
site fully assembled thus reducing installation time, cost and
risk. The Group was successful in securing a contract worth in
excess of £10 million in Finland to deliver a plant utilising this
concept, which is expected to be completed in 2010.
The acquisition of a majority interest in Baltic Design Centre
was completed in November 2008. The acquisition allows
the Group to offer a broader range of design services to its
customers and also brings access to a lower cost, highly
skilled design engineering resource.
The global economic slowdown and lack of available finance
has exacerbated the anticipated slowdown in ordering of
new gas carriers. Whilst the pipeline of opportunities in
the offshore and onshore gas markets remains healthy,
it is apparent that projects are taking longer to be approved
than had been expected. Order intake has been adversely
affected by this and as a result a decision was taken to reduce
headcount by 25%. This action was taken in March 2009 and
resource levels are now scaled to match current expectations
of activity whilst maintaining the capability to both deliver
existing projects and secure new opportunities.
Hamworthy has secured a contract for an onshore
liquefaction plant on the West coast of Finland
which will produce around 20,000 tonnes of liquefied
natural gas a year for the Kilpilaht industrial area of
Porvoo, 60km east of Helsinki.
Hamworthy_13082AR 2009_p12_p33:Layout 1  10/6/09  13:57  Page 25 Revenue rose by 33.3% to £58.4
million (2008: £43.8m) and
operating profit rose by 53.9% to
£7.7 million (2008: £5.0 million).
Order intake for the year fell by 14.6% to £53.9 million
(2008: £63.1 million) but the order book rose by 0.6%
to £64.8 million (2008: £64.4 million).
Revenue grew in both waste water treatment and fresh
water generation with high levels of deliveries to the cruise
ship market.
Along with the Pump Systems business, Water Systems had
the most marked impact from currency translation gains.
On a constant currency basis operating profit rose by 34.2%
to £6.7 million.
Operating margins rose to 13.2% (2008: 11.4%) as Hamworthy
Serck Como achieved efficiency improvements and the
business benefited from the implementation of improved
project execution processes on its larger advanced waste
water contracts.
Hamworthy was first to market in the previous financial year
with a next generation waste treatment plant approved to
meet new environmental standards coming into force in 2010.
Both order intake and sales for these products were maintained
at the record high levels seen in that year. The first of these
units have been delivered in the period well ahead of the
legislative deadline.

Company overview Business review Governance Accounts
Hamworthy plc
Ballast water is essential to the safe and efficient
operation of modern shipping, providing balance
and stability to un-laden ships. Anything that is small
enough to pass through ships’ ballast water intake
ports and pumps may be carried in the ballast water.
It contains a variety of organisms including bacteria
and viruses and the adult and larval stages of many
marine and coastal plants and animals. Some organisms
may survive ballast discharge and thrive in their new
environment. These non-native species can have serious
ecological, economical and public health impact on
the receiving environment. The acquisition of Greenship
in March 2009 gives Hamworthy early access to an
exciting global opportunity underpinned by strict
international environmental regulations.
The business continues to target the retrofit market for cruise
ships and has secured a number of important orders for
retrofit of advanced waste treatment systems, one for a new
and significant cruise brand in the US. Orders for new ships
included the two UK Royal Navy aircraft carriers (‘CVF’).
In line with the Group strategy of expanding into specialist
non-marine markets, Hamworthy Serck Como achieved a 27%
increase in revenues from condensers for the power generation
market. However, the business has seen few new orders
placed for large cruise ships as cruise companies continue
to review their positions in the current economic climate.
As a result, this business has taken action to reduce its cost
base including a 11% reduction in headcount.
Greenship BV was acquired in March 2009 and has
been swiftly integrated into the Water Systems division.
Greenship has developed a leading technology for the
treatment of ship’s ballast water to remove or neutralise
organisms carried within it.
The transfer of aquatic organisms to areas where they do
not naturally occur is considered one of the most serious
threats to the marine environment. Ships use of ballast
water represents the most common mechanism for the
introduction of non-indigenous organisms to coastal waters
where they may cause irreversible changes affecting human
health and industries as well as the ecological balance
of the seas. These problems are already experienced by
a number of the world’s coastal states and their effects
are well documented.
Recognising the seriousness of this issue, the International
Maritime Organisation (‘IMO’) has adopted legislation that
will require all ships to implement ballast water treatment.
The legislation will be phased in over a number of years to
allow the retrofit of the existing global fleet to be addressed
in a controlled manner.
Hamworthy_13082AR 2009_p12_p33:Layout 1  10/6/09  13:57  Page 27 Revenue rose 16.9% to £26.4
million (2008: £22.5 million)
due to orders from the offshore
sector and a strong performance
in aftersales.
Operating profit rose 85.1% to £1.8 million (2008 restated:
£1.0 million). Order intake was 20.8% lower at £23.6 million
(2008: £29.8 million) whilst the order book remained stable
at £39.7 million (2008: £40.0 million).
Operating margins improved to 6.7% (2008 restated: 4.2%).
The business continued to gain benefits from the move
of manufacturing from Norway to China and benefit from
repeat engineering on ship series contracts. Focus was
maintained on margin improvement with activity now
underway to transfer contract management and processing
functions for the marine range of products to China.
The business was successful in securing a number of
important contracts in the offshore market including the
Pazflor and Usan FPSOs for Total and the PSUM FPSO for
MODEC. Demand for the Group’s Inert Gas Systems has
been strong from the large oil tanker section and the
business won a strategically important ten ship series
order for Suezmax oil tankers to be built in Brazil.
Investment in research and development has been
predominantly focused on improving the competitiveness of
the current product range. As a result, the business has been
successful in increasing both the market share and improving
margins of its nitrogen generation systems through the
introduction of a new lower cost range of designs.
The Group also invested in the development and construction
of an instrumented full-scale test inert gas generator at its
facility in Norway. This test generator is now fully operational
and is being used both for product development and to
provide training to ships crew and technical personnel.
The business has made significant improvements to its
internal structures and control systems following the
restatement to inventory values made in the first half year.

Hamworthy_13082AR 2009_p12_p33:Layout 1  10/6/09  15:14  Page 29 As an international organisation,
Hamworthy plc is very much
aware of its responsibilities to
its employees, the communities
and the environment in each
of the diverse areas in which
it operates.
Our people
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of
its employees and keeps them informed on matters affecting
them as employees and on the various factors affecting the
performance of the Group. There is a well developed Group
intranet that regularly disseminates a significant amount
of employee related information and is accessible at all
our locations for those who do not have personal access.
Employee feedback is encouraged on a range of relevant
matters. The Group seeks to develop a culture of openness
and honesty and, as a matter of principle, to provide an
environment which allows individuals to develop to the
best of their abilities.
Equality
The Group’s employment policies include a commitment to
equal opportunities regardless of sex, age, race or ethnic origin.
Disabled people
It is the policy of the Group to give full and fair consideration
to applications made by disabled persons taking into
consideration the respective aptitudes and abilities of the
applicants concerned. In the event of a member of staff
becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure their
continued employment within the Group and to provide
specialised training where appropriate.
Training
The Group is committed to employee training and retraining
and this year has spent £0.6 million (2008 £0.5 million) in
this respect. This is in addition to the cost of on-the-job
training which, whilst substantial, is impractical to quantify.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Hamworthy plc Business review
Providing a safe working environment is one of
Hamworthy’s core values. The board has introduced
accident rate as one of the Group’s key performance
indicators (see page 21). Accident rate is defined
as the number of reportable accidents which
result in an absence of greater than three days per
100,000 employees. In the year to 31 March 2009
the rate was 1,128 (2008: 1,295).
Hamworthy_13082AR 2009_p12_p33:Layout 1  10/6/09  13:58  Page 30 Whistleblowing
The Company operates a whistleblowing policy which
is publicised both internally and externally via its website.
This provides the necessary access for, and protection of,
employees wishing to bring matters they suspect as
being malpractice or impropriety to the attention of
the relevant person.
Health and safety
The health and safety of Hamworthy employees is of the
highest priority. The Group has strengthened its approach
to safety throughout the Group and nominated a senior
executive to lead its efforts to improve safety. The Executive
Committee reviews the safety performance of each business
every month and has implemented a consistent reporting
system both for accidents and for ‘near misses’ where a
potentially unsafe situation arose but no accident occurred.
Safety performance has now been included as one of the
Group’s key performance indicators as set out on page 21.
All of the Group’s principal business sites have achieved
accreditation under OHSAS 18001 health and safety standard.
Our stakeholders
Suppliers
It is the Group’s policy to agree terms with its suppliers that
are appropriate for the markets in which they operate and
to abide by such terms where suppliers have also met their
obligations. Creditor days as at 31 March 2009 were 46 days
(2008: 49 days).
We seek to engage with our major suppliers and attempt
to understand and, if appropriate, encourage their approach
to environmentally friendly and ethical sourcing of materials.
During the year we created a new position of Group
Operations Director: a major part of this job will be devoted
to improving the Group approach to purchasing, including
consideration of responsible sourcing.
Shareholders
The Company meets with institutional shareholders and
analysts as appropriate and uses its website to encourage
communication with private, existing and prospective
shareholders. Hamworthy plc welcomes feedback
from investors about its published reports and website.
Please address your feedback to our investor relations
team by e-mail to investor@hamworthy.com or in writing
to Hamworthy plc, Fleets Corner, Poole, Dorset BH17 0JT.
Our environmental impact
We are very conscious of the environmental impact that our
activities may have on the communities in which we operate
and we constantly strive to minimise the effect of this.
It has been the Group’s policy to achieve accreditation under
the ISO 14001 environmental standard at all the principal
sites and that has been achieved during the year.
Many of our products have a direct environmental benefit and
they are often designed to ensure that our customers can meet
relevant environmental legislation. Examples include advanced
waste water systems to protect the world’s oceans and gas
handling systems which reduce emissions of volatile organic
compounds or enable cost effective transportation of natural
gas which is the lowest CO2 contributing fossil fuel.
Our communities
We actively encourage our employees to become involved
in the activities of the communities in which they live
and work.
We made direct charitable donations of £600 during the year
(2008: £1,600) comprising the following payments:
Headway Dorset £200
Second Chance £200
Langside School £200
Paul Crompton is a director and trustee of Lewis Manning
Trust in Poole.
The Company made no political donations during the year.
Our ethics
Hamworthy seeks to be an ethical and responsible part of
the business community. We will carry out our business fairly,
honestly and transparently. We have established a group
wide ethics policy with which all employees are required
to comply.

AIM companies are not required to prepare a formal remuneration report in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies act 1985 or
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. However, in line with best practice the Company has prepared this report in order to enable
a better understanding of directors’ remuneration. The information included in this report is unaudited.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists exclusively of independent non-executive directors and its members are James Wilding (Chairman),
Gordon Page and Alan Frost. The committee also consults with the Chief Executive. It meets at least twice per year and has delegated responsibility
for making recommendations to the board regarding the remuneration and other benefits of the executive directors and senior executives.
The full terms of reference of the committee are available on the Company’s website or on request from the Company Secretary.
The committee has access to external remuneration data and professional advice. During financial year 2007 it carried out a full review of the
Group’s executive remuneration structure with assistance from Kepler Associates. Kepler Associates do not undertake any other work for the Group.
During financial year 2009 the committee reviewed the Group’s long-term incentive plans and, despite the change in economic climate over the last
year, concluded that it would retain the existing structure ahead of the next full externally assisted review due to be carried out in the normal course
during financial year 2010.
Remuneration policy
The board’s policy is to recruit, motivate and retain senior executives of high calibre by rewarding them with competitive but responsible salary
and benefit packages. A significant proportion of executive remuneration is performance related both short-term and long-term. This includes
participation in share incentive schemes which are closely aligned with the interests of shareholders.
The remuneration packages for executive directors comprise the following main elements:
– basic annual salary;
– annual bonus payments in respect of the performance of the individual and the Group calculated as a percentage of salary;
– share-based long-term incentives via participation in the Company’s Share Option Plan and Share Matching Plan;
– retirement benefits under the Company’s defined contribution pension scheme;
– other benefits.
The board’s intention is to combine appropriate levels of fixed pay with incentive schemes that provide executives with the ability to earn above
median levels for true out-performance and encourage executive co-investment in the Company’s shares.
Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed by the committee annually to take effect on 1 April. In setting basic salaries the committee assesses individual
responsibilities, experience and performance and considers external market data. The result of the most recent review was to leave basic salaries of
executive directors and senior Group executives unchanged at 1 April 2009 except in cases of changed scope of responsibility. The committee believes
this demonstrates leadership consistent with the Group’s aim to deliver value to shareholders.
Annual bonus payments
Executive directors participate in the annual cash bonus scheme under which bonuses of between 0% and 100% of basic salary are payable.
Bonuses are awarded following consideration of the performance of the Group, achievement of profit and cash targets and the individual’s
contribution to that performance. The principles of this scheme also apply to annual bonuses payable to the Group’s senior executives.
Where an executive has specific responsibility for a division or subsidiary in the Group the performance of that business unit is considered
along with the Group performance.
Long-term incentives
The Company operates long-term incentives for executive directors and senior executive managers in the form of the Share Option Plan and a
complimentary co-investment Share Matching Plan. These Plans aim to encourage participants to contribute to the performance of the Company
and to participate in the Company’s success along with other shareholders.
It is intention of the board to grant share options to reward performance and align the interests of executives with those of shareholders.
Share options are granted at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Exercise of options is subject to the committee’s performance criteria set at the time of award. For awards granted since 31 March 2007 vesting
has been conditional on an equally weighted measure of earnings per share growth and total shareholder return (TSR). The minimum performance
for any vesting is an earnings per share growth of CPI plus 5% and a TSR equal to the average of the UK Industrial Engineering and Oil and Gas
indices over a three year period. The percentage vesting rises from 25% to 100% in proportion to increases in these two performance measures up
to earnings per share growth of CPI plus 20% and TSR of 115% of the above indices. Details of options held by the executive directors under the
plan given in the tables on page 37.
The Share Matching Plan is designed to encourage the acquisition and retention of the Company’s shares. Participation is by the invitation
of the committee on grant award to executive directors and senior executive managers. Awards of matching shares are granted to participants
on the basis of one matching share for each share already owned or for every two vested but unexercised share options held. Vesting of awards
are subject to retention of the participants initial qualifying holding over a three year period and the meeting of performance criteria over
that period. The percentage of awards vesting at the end of the three years is calculated by reference to the growth in earnings per share over
a three year period. The percentage rises proportionally from 25% for earnings per share growth of CPI plus 5% to 100% for earnings per
share growth of CPI plus 20%.
Details of options and awards held by executive directors under the two Plans are given in the tables on page 37.
As indicated above these schemes have been left unaltered for 2009 but will be the subject of a comprehensive review during the next 12 months.

Retirement and other benefits
The executive directors are members of the Hamworthy Pension Scheme, a UK defined contribution scheme. The scheme provides for pension
benefits payable on retirement and for a lump sum benefit payable to dependants in the event of death in service.
The executive directors receive private healthcare insurance and allowances in lieu of company cars and fuel.
Service contracts
Service agreements for executive directors are for no fixed term and are terminable on 12 months’ notice from the Company or 6 months’ notice
from the director. There are no provisions for compensation in the event of early termination. Should such an occasion arise, the Company will
have due regard to all relevant circumstances including the obligation of the departing director to mitigate any loss which may be suffered.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts nor do they participate in any share option plan, long-term incentive plan or pension
scheme. Gordon Page, Alan Frost, and James Wilding have each been appointed under letters of engagement which commenced on 21 July 2004
and which can be terminated by either party giving three months’ notice. Fees payable under the terms of their appointments are shown in the table
below. The fees payable in respect of the appointment of James Wilding were paid to his principal employer for the period to 22 August 2008 and
directly to him from that date.
Consistent with the review of executive salaries fees payable to non-executive directors remained unchanged in the review effective 1 April 2009.
External appointments
It is the Company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold external appointments and to receive payment therefrom provided such appointments
are agreed by the board in advance. During the year no executive director was a director of another public company.

Chairman of the remuneration committee
Hamworthy plc
Hamworthy_13082AR 2009_p34_p43:Layout 1  10/6/09  13:59  Page 37 38
The Company is listed on AIM. Although the rules of AIM do not
require the Company to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (‘the Code’) that was issued by the Financial Reporting
Council in 2006, the board has nevertheless resolved to do so
having regard to the size and specific requirements of the Company.
Accordingly it does not seek to comply with provisions D.1.1 and D.1.2
which deal with communication between major shareholders and
non-executive directors including the Chairman.
The board
The Company has appointed non-executive directors to bring an
independent view to the board and to provide a balance to the executive
directors. The board of directors comprises two executive directors and
three non-executive directors, one of whom is the chairman, Gordon
Page, and another is the senior independent director, Alan Frost.
The board considers that each of the non-executive directors is
independent within the meaning of the Code.
The Chairman meets with the non-executive directors without the
executive directors present at least once each year.
The board meets every two months and in advance of each regular
meeting, receives a board pack with the information necessary for it
to discharge its duties. These packs include financial data, reporting on
health and safety, controls and risk assessments and detailed individual
reports from each executive director. The board has responsibility for
formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, budgets,
major items of expenditure, acquisitions and the directors’ report and
annual and interim financial statements.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary and are able to take professional advice
at the Company’s expense.
The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal
actions against directors as well as against material loss or claims against
the Group, and reviews the adequacy of cover regularly. The Company
has also entered an agreement with each of its directors whereby the
director is indemnified against certain liabilities to third parties which
might be incurred in the course of carrying out his duties as a director.
These arrangements constitute a qualifying third party indemnity
provision for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006.
There is a formal schedule of matters, decisions on which are reserved
to the board. There is also a schedule of the division of responsibilities
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Both schedules are
reviewed by the board at least annually.
During 2008 the board carried out a formal assessment of its performance
and effectiveness using the services of an outside consultant (Edis-Bates
Associates). As a result a number of process improvements have been
introduced to the conduct of the board and its committees and further
actions are planned. It is proposed to hold a further review within the
next 12 months.
Board committees
The board has established three committees: audit, remuneration and
nominations. Each has written terms of delegated responsibilities and
each is chaired by a different non-executive director. The Company
Secretary is secretary to each committee. A copy of each committee’s
terms of reference can be found at the Company’s website
www.hamworthy.com.
Audit committee
The audit committee consists of Gordon Page, Alan Frost and James
Wilding and is chaired by Alan Frost. It meets at least three times a year
with attendance from the external auditors and internal personnel as
required. The committee is responsible for
– ensuring that the appropriate financial reporting procedures are
properly maintained and reported on;
– meeting the auditors and reviewing their reports relating to the Group’s
accounts and internal control systems;
– reviewing and monitoring the independence of the external auditor
and the objectives and effectiveness of the audit process;
– receiving and reviewing all internal operational review reports; and
– reviewing arrangements by which staff may in confidence raise
concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting
or otherwise and receiving and dealing with matters reported under
the Group’s whistleblowing policy.
The Group, because of its size and organisation, does not operate an
internal audit function responsible to the committee. The internal
audit and review function is integrated with the central finance team.
The committee has full access to the work of this function and the
relevant members of the central team have formal reporting processes
to the committee on a regular basis.
The external auditor has carried out non-audit services to the Group
during the year. The committee have considered the effect of this
work on the objectivity and independence of the external auditor.
Having regard to the scale and nature of these services, the committee
concludes that the auditor’s objectivity and independence are
not impaired.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists of Gordon Page, Alan Frost, and
James Wilding and is chaired by James Wilding. It meets at least twice
a year and is responsible for reviewing the performance of the executive
directors and other senior executives and for determining appropriate
levels of remuneration. The Chief Executive is invited to participate in
the committee’s deliberations on all matters except consideration of
his own compensation. The committee’s remuneration report is set out
on pages 34 to 37.
Nominations committee
The nominations committee consists of Gordon Page, Alan Frost, James
Wilding and Joe Oatley and is chaired by Gordon Page. The committee
reviews the size, structure and composition of the board and makes
recommendations on changes, as appropriate. It also gives consideration
to succession planning in the light of developments in the business.
In 2007 the committee organised and led the search process for a new
Chief Executive for the Company.
The attendance of directors at board and committee meetings
throughout the year was as follows:

Shareholder relations
The Company meets with institutional shareholders and analysts as
appropriate and uses its website to encourage communication with
private, existing and prospective shareholders. Hamworthy plc welcomes
feedback from investors about its published reports and website.

Internal control and risk management
The Group operates a system of internal control and intends to develop
and review that system in accordance with the guidance published by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The internal
control system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives. The board is responsible for the
system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. It can only
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The board operates a formal process of risk assessment and reporting.
Each major business unit carries out formal risk assessments annually and
regularly updates these during the year. The assessments are carried out
using, where appropriate, a standard categorisation of risk. Reports on
the assessments and mitigation actions of all significant risks are provided
to the board.
As a result of the overstatement of historic inventory value in the Group’s
Inert Gas Systems business, the board carried out a comprehensive review
including the commissioning of a forensic investigation by Ernst & Young.
The result of that review has led to the strengthening of its control
processes during the year with both additional resources and formal
documenting of controls. A detailed programme of testing those
controls will be carried out during 2009 in conjunction with the external
auditors. The function of internal auditing is integrated with the
central finance team but with independent reporting access to the
chairman of the audit committee to whom the function reports regularly.
The Company undertakes a programme of operational reviews designed
to visit all major businesses on a regular basis. The finance director is
responsible for that programme and its reporting to the audit committee
and it is integrated into the risk assessment programme.
The board recognises that an essential part of its responsibility is the
effective safeguarding of assets, the proper recognition of liabilities and
the accurate reporting of results. The Group has a comprehensive system
for regular reporting to the board. This includes an annual planning and
budgeting system with budgets approved by the board. The financial
reporting system compares against budget and prior year and reconsiders
its financial year forecast all on a monthly basis.
The board has established a formal policy of authorisation setting out
matters which require its expressed approval and certain authorities
delegated to the executive directors.
The Group operates in a multi-currency environment and is exposed
to a number of foreign currency risks. The board has set a policy for
the management and reporting of those risks and this is set out in more
detail in the Financial review on pages 19 and 20 and in note 33 to the
financial statements.
The Company has established a policy and share dealing code relating
to dealing in the Company’s shares by directors, employees and
connected persons.
The Company’s policy with regard to whistleblowing and health and
safety is included in the Corporate Social Responsibility report on pages
30 and 31. The board of directors’ consideration of the adequacy of
the Group’s resources to enable it to continue in operational existence
for the forseeable future is set out on page 19.

Business review
This Business review has been prepared to provide additional information to shareholders to assist in understanding the Group’s strategies and the
potential for those strategies to succeed. The Chairman’s statement on pages 10 to 11, the Chief Executive’s review on pages 12 to 14, the Financial
review on pages 16 to 20 and the Divisional reviews on pages 22 to 29 all contain further information related to this business review and are to be
incorporated into this Directors’ report by reference.
This Business review contains forward-looking statements which have been made by the directors in good faith based on information available to
them up to the time of their approval of this report and must be treated with caution due to the uncertainties including economic, business and other
risk factors inherent in any such forward-looking information.
This Company acts as a holding company and the provider of group management services. The principal activities of the Group are the design,
manufacture and supply of products and systems for marine and oil and gas related industries.

Financial instruments
The Group holds and utilises financial instruments in the management of its operations. It is the policy of the Group that no trading in financial
instruments shall be undertaken. The main risks from the Group’s financial instruments relate to interest rates, liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk.
The board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are set out in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements.
Research and development
During the year the Group expensed to the consolidated income statement, net of amounts capitalised to and amortised from intangible assets,
£2,913,000 (2008: £1,904,000) in respect of research and development on marine and offshore products and systems.
Corporate responsibility
Details of the Group’s policies on employment, environmental, health and safety, ethics, creditor payments, political donations and charitable
payments are contained in the Corporate Social Responsibility report on pages 30 and 31.
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report, the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The directors are required by the IAS Regulation to prepare
the Group financial statement under IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law. The financial statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the company’s financial position, financial
performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with
the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s
‘Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by
compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, directors are also required to:
– properly select and apply accounting policies;
– present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; and
– provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of
particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Disclosure of information to auditors
At the date of this report, so far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 234ZA of the
Companies Act 1985) of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and each of the directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware
of that information.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company will take place at the Hytes Suite, Harbour Heights Hotel, Haven Road, Poole, Dorset BH13 7LW
on 16 July 2009 at 2.00pm. Full details of the resolutions to be put to the meeting are given in the Notice of the AGM to be found at pages 89 to 91
of this Annual Report and Accounts.
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital during the year are
shown in note 27 to the financial statements. The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. Each share carries
the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. There are no specific restrictions either on the size of a holding or on the transfer of
shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.
Details of employee share schemes are also set out in note 27 to the financial statements. No person has any special rights of control over the
Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies Acts and
related legislation and observance of the Combined Code. The Articles themselves may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders.
An ordinary resolution will be put to the shareholders at the AGM to renew the directors’ authority to issue and allot ordinary shares.
The nominal value of ordinary shares to which this authority will be limited is £729,482.
A special resolution will also be put to the shareholders at the AGM which renews the authority of the directors to allot ordinary shares without
first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. This authority is limited to 5% of the issued share capital.
The Companies Act 1985 permits a company to purchase its own shares provided the purchase has been authorised by the members in general
meeting. A special resolution will be put to shareholders at the AGM to authorise the Company to purchase up to 5% of the issued share capital at
a maximum price 5% above the average middle market quotation according to the London Stock Exchange for the five days preceding any purchase.
In all cases the above resolutions will expire at the earlier of the next AGM in 2010 or 15 months after the date of the resolutions.
Articles of Association
A resolution will be put to the AGM to amend the Articles of Association to incorporate changes introduced by the Companies Act 2006.
Auditors
During the year, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP resigned as auditors and Deloitte & Touche LLP were appointed auditors in their place. On 1 December
2008, Deloitte & Touche LLP changed their name to Deloitte LLP . Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and a
resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.

We have audited the Group financial statements of Hamworthy plc
for the year ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the Consolidated
Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income
and Expense, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash
Flow Statement and the related notes numbered 1 to 37. These group
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements
for Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2009.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in our auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members, as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether, in our opinion,
the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the group
financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ report
includes specific information presented in the Chairman’s statement,
the Chief Executive’s review, the Financial review and the Divisional
reviews that is cross referenced from the Business review section
of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial statements.
This other information comprises those reports within the Company
overview, Business review and Governance sections as described in
the Contents section. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend
to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial statements.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the Group
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in
the Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2009 and of its profit for the year
then ended;
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
– the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
Group financial statements.

The maintenance and integrity of the Hamworthy plc website is the responsibility of

of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes
that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented
on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

1 General information
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Hamworthy plc, a public limited company registered and domiciled
in the United Kingdom and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’). The address of the registered office is Fleets Corner, Poole, Dorset BH17 0JT.
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out on page 40.
2 Adoption of new and revised Standards
The following interpretation to an existing standard would be effective for the current year but is not considered relevant to the Group’s operations:
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements – effective from 1 January 2008
Accounting standards not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following relevant Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not been adopted by the EU):
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
IFRS 8 Operating Segments (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).
IAS 1 (revised 2007) Presentation of Financial Statements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009) – introduces changes to the
titles of the main financial statements, although their usage is not required, and the incorporation of a statement of changes
in equity in to the main financial statements.
IAS 23 (amended 2007) Borrowing Costs (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).
IFRS 3 (revised 2008) Business Combinations (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009) – the main anticipated impact is the
requirement that all acquisition-related costs are to be expensed and will therefore no longer form part of the cost of
the investment. In addition, changes to contingent consideration after initial recognition at fair value may potentially
be recognised through the income statement rather than as an adjustment to goodwill.
IAS 27 (revised 2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009).
IFRS 2 (amended 2008) Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes – effective from 1 July 2008.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction – effective from
1 January 2008.
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate – effective from 1 January 2009.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation – effective from 1 October 2008.
IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners – effective from 1 July 2009.
IFRIC 18 Transfer of assets from customers – effective from 1 July 2009.
With the exception of IFRS 3 (revised 2008) for acquisition-related costs and the potential change in treatment of contingent consideration,
the directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial
statements of the Group except for additional disclosures when the relevant standards come into effect.
3 Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently
applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC interpretations
endorsed by the European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of derivative contracts and
retirement benefit obligations which are held at fair value. A summary of the more important group accounting policies, which have been applied
consistently across the Group, is set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements represent a consolidation of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (the ‘Group’) as at the balance sheet date and
for the year then ended. Subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from, or up to,
the date upon which control passed, being the ability to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee entity so as to obtain benefits
from its activities. This is considered to be the effective date of acquisition or disposal, as appropriate.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented within equity
in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from the shareholders equity.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those
used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities
of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over fair values of the identifiable
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired
(i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the Income Statement in the period of acquisition.

3 Significant accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes, and excluding inter company sales.
Sales of goods and services are recognised when goods are delivered or services rendered and title has passed. For bill and hold arrangements,
revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, typically on formal acceptance. Revenue from
construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on construction contracts (see below).
Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion
of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is measured using a matrix of indicators applicable to the contract including costs incurred,
man hours expended, deliveries made and engineering work completed. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included
to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer. Where the outcome of the construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract
revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses
in the period in which they are incurred. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is
recognised as an expense immediately.
Segmental reporting
For reporting purposes the results of the Group are allocated between four reporting product groups. These operate in specific product and
market areas and are described in note 7. The Group accounting policies are applied consistently across the four divisions. Head Office costs
are shown separately.
Foreign currency translation
The functional and presentational currency of the parent company is UK Pounds sterling. Group companies use their local currency as their functional
currency. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of
the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date, with any gains or losses being included in net profit or loss for the period.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are dealt with through
the Group’s reserves, until such time as the subsidiary is sold whereupon the cumulative exchange differences relating to the net investment in that
foreign subsidiary are recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal in the income statement. However, cumulative exchange differences arising
prior to 1 April 2005 remain in equity as permitted by IFRS 1.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks the Group enters into forward contracts and options (see below for details of the
Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments).
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and
translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition
to IFRS as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors which provide written principles
on the use of financial derivatives.
All derivative financial instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains
or losses on re-measurement are immediately recognised in the Income Statement. Where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting,
recognition of any resultant gain or loss will initially be recorded in a separate component of equity (‘Hedging Reserve’).
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being hedged and the
hedging instrument. The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the
hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is performed at each period
end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash flow hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that is either
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as effective hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in
equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. The associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity
and recognised in the Income Statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the Income Statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge
accounting. At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted
transaction occurs at which point it is recycled to the Income Statement. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur the net cumulative
gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the Income Statement.
Derivative instruments qualifying for cash flow hedging are principally forward foreign exchange transactions and interest rate swaps.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics
are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the
Income Statement.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

3 Significant accounting policies continued
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable
amounts. Allowances for irrecoverable amounts are made when there is evidence that the Group may not be able to collect the amount due.
The impairment recorded is the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the estimated future cash flows. Any impairment
required is recorded in the Income Statement in administrative expenses.
Trade payables
Trade payables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation in respect of a past event and it is probable that settlement
will be required of an amount that can be reliably estimated.
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required
to settle the Group’s liability. The estimate is discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are
substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they
are incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and provision for impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable
to the acquisition of the item including the costs of acquiring or constructing the asset and costs incurred subsequently to add to, or enhance,
the asset. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset
on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life at the following annual rates:
Freehold land Nil
Freehold buildings 2%–5%
Leasehold buildings 2%–10% or over the life of the lease if different
Plant, machinery and equipment 20%–33%
Assets under construction Nil
Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted where necessary.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets
and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 April 2005 has been retained at the
previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has
not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment annually or where there are indications that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of
the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated
to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition to IFRS has been eliminated through reserves on transition.
Research and development expenditure – internally generated
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are written off as incurred unless it can be demonstrated that the following conditions for capitalisation, in accordance with
IAS 38 (Intangible Assets), are met:
– the development costs are separately identifiable;
– the development costs can be measured reliably;
– management are satisfied as to the ultimate technical and commercial viability of the project; and
– it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits,
at which point any subsequent costs are capitalised as intangible assets until the intangible asset is readily available for production, and amortised on
a straight-line basis over their useful lives.

3 Significant accounting policies continued
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Group, other than goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible
assets are amortised over the asset’s estimated useful life on a straight-line basis as follows:
Software 3 to 5 years
Development costs 3 years
Customer contracts 1 to 3 years
Customer relationships life of the customer relationship – typically 10 years
Technology based assets life of the product – typically 10 years
Impairment of fixed tangible assets and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the
extent of any impairment loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is
calculated using cash flow projections for the asset (or group of assets where cash flows are not identifiable for specific assets) discounted at the
Group’s cost of capital.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset
(cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense in the Income Statement, unless the
relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before finance or finance expenses.
Retirement benefit costs
The Company provides pension arrangements to the majority of full time UK employees through a money purchase (defined contribution) scheme,
and similar schemes exist across other countries in which the Group operates, except Norway and Germany. Contributions and pension costs are
based on pensionable salary and are charged as an expense as they fall due. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions
have been paid.
Employees in Norway and Germany participate in funded defined benefit pension plans. The cost of benefits accruing during the year in respect
of current and past service is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method and is charged against operating profit. The expected return
on the scheme’s assets and the change in the present value of the scheme’s liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in other finance
costs. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. The balance sheet includes the
surplus/deficit in the scheme taking assets at their year end market values and liabilities at their actuarially calculated values discounted at year end
AA corporate bond interest rates.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the FIFO method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and
distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Taxation including deferred tax
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates
to items recognised in equity in which case it is recognised in equity.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance
sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. In principle deferred tax liabilities are recognised
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets or liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax
profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Tax assets and
liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income
taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
Share-based payment
The Group operates equity settled share-based compensation plans through two share option schemes. The fair value of options awarded is
calculated at the time of grant and is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate of the
number of options that will actually vest. The Group has adopted a Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of options. The Group has also
introduced a complementary co-investment share matching plan, details of which are given in note 27. The fair value of these matching shares are
calculated at the date of award based upon the market value of the issued shares and are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period based on an estimate of the number of options that will actually vest.

Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the same period in which they are fully authorised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three
months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above,
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements, and the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ
from those estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Revenue and margin recognition for long-term contracts
The Group derives revenue and margin from long-term contracts, most of which are normally fixed price and which may extend for a significant
period of time. While long-term contracts are in progress, revenue is recognised based on their expected profitability and extent of completion.
Profit is only taken once the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably, however unforeseen future events may adversely impact the accuracy
of those estimates. Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract
costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Further details are given in note 20.
Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes that provide benefits to a number of current and former employees. The value of the deficit
is particularly sensitive to the market value of the scheme’s assets, discount rates and actuarial assumptions related to mortality. Further details are
given in note 30.
Current and deferred taxation
Legislation related to taxation is complex and its impact on the Group may be uncertain. In preparing the Group’s financial statements management
estimates its taxation liability having taken appropriate professional advice. Determination of an agreed amount of taxation payable may take several
years, and the final amounts paid may differ from the liabilities recorded in these financial statements.
The recognition of assets and liabilities related to deferred taxation also requires the exercise of management judgement, in particular the extent to
which assets should be recognised.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating
units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from
the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Further details are
given in note 17. The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 March 2009 was £13,458,000 (2008: £9,998,000).
Provisions for contract liabilities
The Group makes provision for liabilities related to contracts, including claims made against the Group by a contracting party, in accordance with
IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets. At each balance sheet date the Group recognises such liabilities at the directors’
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the liability.
Fair value of derivatives
The directors use their judgement in selecting appropriate valuation techniques for financial instruments. Valuation techniques commonly used by
market practitioners are applied.
Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s operations expose it to a number of financial risks including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. These risks are
managed centrally by the Group’s treasury function in accordance with board approved objectives, policies and authorities. There are internal review
procedures to ensure local compliance.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business
review on pages 12 to 31. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial
review on pages 16 to 20. In addition these accounting policies include the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital and its
financial risk management objectives. Details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk are
set out in note 33.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with long-term contracts with a number of customers and suppliers across different
geographic areas and industries. It has significant cash balances, little external debt and a significant order book. As a consequence, the directors
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report
and accounts.

4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is subject to foreign exchange risks on future commercial transactions. The principal exposures arise
in respect of variations in the cross rates between sterling, euro, US dollar, Singapore dollar and Norwegian kroner. The Group seeks to hedge
all its transactional currency exposures through the use of forward currency contracts. The Group does not hedge balance sheet or income and
expenditure translation exposures, or undertake trading in financial instruments.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its term loan borrowings which are detailed in note 24.
Approximately 50% of borrowings at 31 March 2009 are subject to interest rate swap arrangements which have the effect of fixing interest rates
at 3.35% p.a. for the term of the loan.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s cash flows and funds are managed in a central treasury function under a cash pooling structure. The Group maintains the most
appropriate mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders. Details of available facilities are set out in note 24.
Credit risk
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a number of companies across the world. Policies are
maintained to ensure that the Group makes sales to customers with appropriate credit history. Letters of credit or other appropriate instruments are
put in place to reduce credit risk where considered necessary.
The Group is also subject to credit risk on counterparties to its liquid funds and its derivative financial instruments which it controls by only dealing
with highly-rated counterparties. The ratings are constantly monitored.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to
shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity structure. The capital structure of the Group consists of borrowings (disclosed in note
24), cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as
disclosed in notes 27 and 28. The Group balances its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues, and the use of
debt facilities.
Details of the Group’s policy regarding employee share ownership and the Group’s share option programme can be found in the Directors’
remuneration report on page 34.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market through an employee benefit trust, and these own shares are intended to be
used for issuing shares under the Group’s Share Co-investment Incentive Plan. The timing of these purchases is at the discretion of the trustees.
The Group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject
to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
5 Prior year adjustment
The Group has restated the valuation of inventory held in the Inert Gas Systems business to correct an historic accounting error. This gives rise to the
restatement of the previous year’s operating profit and the net assets as follows.
Inventory Related Total
and related tax net asset
creditors asset effect
£’000 £’000 £’000
Adjustment to opening net assets 1 April 2007 (3,988) 1,117 (2,871)
Adjustment to the operating profit for the year ended 31 March 2008 (396) – (396)
Adjustment to the tax charge for the year ended 31 March 2008 – 111 111
Adjustment to opening net assets 1 April 2008 (4,384) 1,228 (3,156)
In addition, and in order to enhance clarity for the readers of this financial information, certain customer on account contract receipts which were
previously classified as a reduction in inventories have been disclosed within current trade and other payables following the principles applicable to
deferred income. This has resulted in an increase in both inventories and trade and other payables of £10.6 million at 31 March 2008.

The principal activities of each segment are as follows:
– The Pump Systems Division designs and manufactures a range of cargo and general duty pumps and pump systems.
– The Gas Systems Division’s principal activity is the design and supply of systems which handle the phase change of petroleum products and natural
gas cargos between vapour and liquid.
– The Water Systems Division provides advanced, environmentally friendly solutions for the on board treatment of liquid waste products, the
generation of fresh water through desalination plant and the treatment of ballast water.
– The Inert Gas Systems division provides products which supply oxygen-depleted air to the ship’s cargo tanks to prevent explosion during the
transportation of oil and chemical cargos.
Segment information about these businesses is presented below.

The directors propose the payment of a final dividend of 5.68p per share, amounting to £2,579,308 in respect of the year to 31 March 2009 (2008:
5.29p per share amounting to £2,401,414). The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and
has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. If authorised it will be paid on 23 July 2009 to shareholders who are on the register
of members as at 26 June 2009.
15 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary
shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary
shares where, on options granted, exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.
The measures of underlying earnings per share are calculated using earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders adjusted to eliminate the mark-to-
market of currency derivatives and amortisation of acquired intangibles as adjusted throughout these financial statements for underlying earnings.
The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:

Values ascribed to customer contracts and relationships represent the fair value of acquired customer contracts and related customer relationships,
both contractual and non-contractual, held by the acquired company at the date of acquisition by the Group. Values ascribed to technology based
assets include unpatented technology and represents the alternative cost, via licence payments, of obtaining on the open market the technology
held by the acquired business.
Values ascribed to software represents the fair value of purchased technology and software rights and licences, where it is appropriate to recognise
such items as assets.
Values ascribed to development costs represent the directly attributable costs of internally generated development knowledge from the point at
which an individual project meets the requirements for capitalisation until it is available for utilisation in the business. This is invariably a relatively
short period of time resulting in minimal costs being incurred that qualify for capitalisation.
All of these assets are recognised at fair value to purchase or acquire and are amortised over their estimated useful lives. Fair values of acquired
Intangible Fixed Assets have been assessed by reference to the future estimated cash flows arising from the application of assets, discounted at an
appropriate rate to present value, or by reference to the amount that would have been paid in an arm’s-length transaction between knowledgeable
and willing parties.

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) which principally comprise its individual business operations, as follows:
2009 2008
£’000 £’000
Hamworthy Norway & Singapore subsidiary 5,210 5,210

Hamworthy Serck Como 2,915 2,915
Hamworthy Baltic Design 590 –
Hamworthy Greenship 2,870 –
13,458 9,998
For each CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
No impairment charge was required in the year (2008: £nil) and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date was £nil (2008: £nil).
The key assumptions used in the calculations were:
– The forecast operating cash flows for the next four years based on approved budgets and plans. These budgets and plans are based on past
performance and expectations for the market development of the CGU, taking into account the current economic climate and forecast assumptions
around the relevant product markets.
– An estimate of the long-term effective tax rate for the CGU of between 28% and 30%.
– An estimate of the long-term growth rate for the CGU of 0%.
The resulting cash flows were discounted using a pre tax discount rate of 15.3% (2008: 15.3%).
Sensitivity analysis has determined that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used will result in significant impairment and that there
is sufficient headroom in all of the key assumptions before the carrying value becomes impaired. For instance, the discount rate would have to more
than double to result in an impairment charge for the two CGUs that comprise the majority of the goodwill carrying value.

The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a number of companies across the world.
Policies are maintained to ensure that the Group makes sales to customers with appropriate credit history. Advance payments, payments on delivery,
letters of credit or other appropriate instruments are used to manage and reduce credit risk as appropriate. The credit quality of the Group’s trade
receivables is considered by management to be very good as a high proportion of customers are large global companies with whom the Group
trades on a long-term basis. This is further evidenced by the low rates of impairment provided and amounts written off.
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 47 days. No interest is charged on the receivables balances. The Group does not hold any
collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances nor has the legal right of offset with any amounts owed by the Group to the receivables
counterparty.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. At the reporting date the principal financial assets were:

At 31 March 2009 the Group held committed revolving credit facilities of £60 million for documentary credits, guarantees and ancillaries (2008:
£90 million) at Barclays Bank plc. This facility provides for the limit to rise to £80 million upon meeting certain reductions in the mark-to-market
amounts of the Group’s extant foreign exchange hedging instruments. In addition the Group has uncommitted overdraft and ancillary facilities
of £2.5 million (2008: £1.6 million) held with Den Danske Bank AS, a term loan of £0.85 million (2008: £0.8 million) with Dresdner Bank AG
and overdraft and ancillary facilities totalling £12.5 million (2008: £10.8 million) with Dresdner Bank AG, HSH Nordbank AG and DBV-Winterthur.
All facilities with Barclays Bank PLC are secured by a fixed charge over Group assets under the terms of a debenture. The term loan held with
Dresdner Bank AG is secured by a mortgage over freehold property owned by Hamworthy Serck Como GmbH. Interest on the bank loans is
charged at Inter Bank Offer Rates plus a margin. The Dresdner Bank loan is being repaid by variable instalments to 2018.
Of the Group’s borrowings £1.2 million is denominated in euros and £0.5 million is denominated in Danish kroner (2008: £0.9 million euro;
£0.1 million Danish kroner). All other borrowings are denominated in sterling.
The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows:

Warranties are routinely given to customers in respect of certain products. Any costs in meeting claims, for which the warranty provision has been
established, are expected to occur within two years of the balance sheet date. Contract provisions are made where, based upon management’s best
estimate, the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are less than the cost of meeting those contract obligations. The periods over which
these are expected to unwind varies by contract.
Redundancy provisions of £0.8m relate to the estimated costs of restructuring certain of the Group’s activities. It is anticipated that these costs will be
incurred in the year ended 31 March 2010. Employment provisions are local statutory employment provisions required in certain overseas jurisdictions
payable when employees leave the Group.

tax asset has been recognised in respect of £6.4 million of these losses (2008: £nil) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which
these losses may be offset. These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

In respect of options exercised during the year, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 536.2p per share (2008: 606p per share).
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows:
2009 2008
Weighted average share price 515p 436p
Weighted average exercise price 515p 436p
Expected volatility 33% 29%
Expected life 3.5 years 3.7 years
Risk free rate 5.19% 4.96%
Expected dividend yield 1.77% 2.01%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the actual volatility of the Group’s share price since flotation in July 2004. The expected life
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and
behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £394,000 and £217,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2009
and 2008 respectively.
Matching shares
Hamworthy plc operates a complementary co-investment share matching plan, designed to encourage the acquisition and retention of Hamworthy
shares by relevant personnel. Participation is by invitation of the remuneration committee on grant award and is expected to be the executive
managers of the Group. Participants are awarded matching ordinary shares in Hamworthy plc, up to a limit related to basic annual salary, in the
ratio of:
– one for every one share already beneficially owned, and
– one for every two vested but unexercised share options held.
Further details are given in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 34. The number of shares acquired by the trust during the year was 97,973
at a total cost of £398,000 (2008: 66,550 shares at a cost of £396,000). The number of shares held by the trust at 31 March 2009 was 164,523
(31 March 2008: 66,550).

30 Retirement benefit obligations
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes in Norway. The most recent valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined
benefit obligation were carried out as at 31 March 2009 by an independent qualified actuary. The present value of the defined benefit obligation,
the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were:
At 31 March
2009 2008
Discount rate 3.80% 4.40%
Rate of increase in salaries 4.25% 4.25%
Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.00% 1.75%
Expected return on scheme assets 5.80% 5.50%
Inflation assumption 2.25% 2.25%
Average life expectancy:
Male 84.7 yrs 82.6 yrs
Female 87.1 yrs 84.9 yrs
The sensitivity of the principal assumption of the discount rate used to measure the scheme liabilities is as follows:
Discount rate – decrease by 0.5 % to 3.3% scheme liabilities increase by £1.03 million (8.5%)
Discount rate – increase by 0.5 % to 4.3 % scheme liabilities decrease by £0.91 million (7.5%)
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme in Germany through Hamworthy Serck Como GmbH. A valuation of plan assets and the
present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out as at 31 March 2009 by an independent qualified actuary. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were:
At 31 March
2009 2008
Discount rate 5.70% 5.70%
Rate of increase in salaries n/a 3.00%
Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.00% 2.00%
Expected return on scheme assets 4.00% 4.00%
Inflation assumption 2.00% 2.00%
The mortality assumptions used were in accordance with the ‘Richttafeln 2005 G’ reference tables published by Dr. Klaus Heubeck.
The sensitivity of the principal assumption of the discount rate used to measure the scheme liabilities is as follows:
Discount rate – decrease by 0.5 % to 5.20% scheme liabilities increase by £0.13 million (8.8%)
Discount rate – increase by 0.5 % to 6.20% scheme liabilities decrease by £0.13 million (8.8%)

33 Financial instruments
The main risks from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk. The board reviews and
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest risk and sensitivity
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, term loans and overdraft facilities held by subsidiaries. The Group’s exposure
to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its cash resources which are invested at variable rates. Its borrowings under a term loan
facility are subject to an interest rate swap agreement which has the effect of fixing the interest payable at 3.35% per annum for the term of the
loan. A 10% increase in interest rates throughout the year would have increased profit after tax by £0.1 million (2008: £0.1 million) with an equal
but opposite effect for a fall in interest rates, all other variables remaining constant.
Liquidity risk
The Group has a strong cash flow and funds generated from operations are managed in a central treasury function under a cash pooling structure.
The Group maintains the most appropriate mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities

Foreign currency risk and sensitivity
The currencies most important to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were those which are typically linked by monetary policy at
fixed exchange rates to the euro as well as US dollars, sterling, Norwegian kroner, Singapore dollars and Chinese renminbi. The Group seeks to hedge
all its transactional currency exposures arising from sales and purchases by operating units in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency
through the use of forward contracts. The notional value of forward exchange contracts in the Group’s main operating currencies at the balance
sheet date were as follows:

The Group does not hedge balance sheet translation exposures and therefore any foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and
liabilities are taken to the Group reserves.
The Group’s operating units hold monetary assets and monetary liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the operating currency of
the operating unit involved. These balances are retranslated at the balance sheet date. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk for these
balances for its most important currencies at the balance sheet date was as follows:

Sensitivity analysis
A 10% strengthening of sterling against these currencies at 31 March would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit by the amounts shown
below, assuming all other variables remained constant:
Equity Profit after taxation

Singapore dollar (1,401) (868) (264) (156)
Chinese renminbi (702) (378) (141) (83)
An equal but opposite effect would have been the impact of a 10% weakening of sterling.
Credit risk
Exposure to credit risk
The principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments.
The Group exposure to credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counter parties are banks with high
credit ratings awarded by international credit rating agencies and these ratings are constantly monitored and are currently all rated at S&P A rating
or above.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk on trade and other receivables is set out in note 21.
Derivatives and financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade debtors
and trade creditors that arise from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s operations. It is, and has
been throughout the period under review, the policy of the Group that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Interest rate swap
The Group’s borrowings under a term loan facility are subject to an interest rate swap agreement which has the effect of fixing the interest payable
at 3.35% per annum for the term of the loan.

Currency derivatives
Currency derivatives are used to hedge future transactions and cash flows, and the Group’s resultant exposure to movements in foreign exchange
rates. These are primarily in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and options, and are denominated in the currencies of the Group’s
principal operating markets. At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the
Group is committed, based upon contractual undiscounted cash flows, are as follows:
2009 2008
£’000 £’000
Foreign currency options 35,356 50,580
Forward foreign exchange contracts 269,083 221,747
All derivative financial instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that
are designated as effective hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in
the Income Statement. The change in fair values of effective hedges amounted to a loss of £19,519,000 (2008: gain of £9,578,000). The Group
recognised total losses of £2,193,000 (2008: £nil) related to ineffective hedging transactions and £nil (2008: gains of £241,000) related to hedging
instruments that were cancelled.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments, based upon market prices of comparable instruments, as at the balance sheet date were as follows:

34 Ultimate parent company
The ultimate parent company of the Group is Hamworthy plc. There were no shareholders with overall control of the Company as at 31 March 2009
or 31 March 2008.
35 Contingent liabilities
At 31 March 2009 contingent liabilities exist in respect of bank guarantees in relation to performance bonds totalling £26,827,000 (2008:
£22,667,000). All of these guarantees mature within two years from the balance sheet date. As the conditions of these guarantees are currently
being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no contingent liability provision has been made at the year end.
The Group routinely enters into a range of contractual arrangements in the ordinary course of events which can give rise to claims or potential
litigation against Group companies. It is the Group’s policy to make specific provisions at the balance sheet date for all liabilities including warranty
costs and guarantees which, in the opinion of the directors, are expected to result in a significant loss. The directors have reviewed the open claims
and pending litigation against the Group at the year end and concluded that no material unprovided loss is likely to accrue to the Group from any
such unprovided claims.
36 Acquisition of subsidiaries
On 3 November 2008 the Group acquired 79% of the share capital of Baltic Design Centre Limited in Poland for a total consideration of Polish Zloty
2,279,000. Based in Gdynia in Poland, BDC is a privately owned ship design business providing concept, system and full ship design services to
European ship yards for both new build and conversion. This transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.
On 9 March 2009 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Greenship BV in The Netherlands for a total consideration of B7,000,000. Based
in Groningen in The Netherlands, Greenship BV is a privately owned business specialising in the treatment of ballast water for ships. This transaction
has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.

36 Acquisition of subsidiaries continued
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Baltic Design Centre is attributable to the anticipated future operating synergies derived from integration
in to the Group and the value inherent in the assembled workforce. The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Greenship is attributable to the
anticipated future profits resulting from access to new markets.
Baltic Design Centre contributed £23,000 to revenue and a loss of £55,000 to the Group’s profit before tax for the period between the date of
acquisition and the balance sheet date. The acquisition of Greenship BV did not contribute to the Group’s result due to completion taking place so
near to the Group’s year end.

We have audited the parent company financial statements of Hamworthy
plc for the year ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the Balance Sheet,
the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses and the related
notes 1 to 16. These parent company financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of
Hamworthy plc for the year ended 31 March 2009.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in our auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other then the
company and the company’s members, as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual report and the
parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement
of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent company
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether, in our opinion, the
information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the parent
company financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is
not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited parent company financial
statements. This other information comprises those reports within
the Company overview, Business review and Governance sections as
described in the Contents section. We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the parent
company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent
company financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the parent company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view,
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 March 2009;
and
– the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
– the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
parent company financial statements.

Accounting policies
Statement of accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been
applied consistently throughout the year and, except for changes noted
below, the preceding period, is set out below.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
Accounting Standards.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and provision
for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at
rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of
each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life at the
following annual rates:
Plant, machinery and equipment 20%–33%
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for any
impairment in value.
Taxation
Current UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid
(or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the
future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance
sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s
taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements
that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments
in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the
financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits
from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can
be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected
to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured
on a non-discounted basis.
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over
the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Pension scheme arrangements
The Company provides pension arrangements to the majority of full
time UK employees through a money purchase scheme, operated by
Barnett Waddingham LLP . Contributions and pension costs are based
on pensionable salary and are recorded in the period in which they fall.
Foreign exchange
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates
of exchange prevailing at that date or at a contracted rate if applicable.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to
the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain/loss in the
profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of swap agreements are
recognised in the interest payable/receivable charge/credit on an accruals
basis. The interest differential amounts due to/from the counterparty on
such agreements are accrued until the settlement date and are
recognised as an adjustment to interest expense.
Share-based payment
The Company operates equity settled share-based compensation plans
through two share option schemes. The fair value of options awarded is
calculated at the time of grant and is charged to the income statement
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate of
the number of options that will actually vest. The Group has adopted a
Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of options. The Company
also participates in the Group’s complimentary co-investment share
matching plan, details of which are given in note 27 to the Group
financial statements. The fair value of these matching shares are
calculated at the date of award based upon the market value of the
issued shares and are charged to the income statement on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period based on an estimate of the number of
options that will actually vest.
Related party transactions and cash flow statement
The Company is the ultimate parent undertaking of the Hamworthy
Group and is therefore included in the consolidated financial statements
of that Group, which are publicly available. Consequently the Company
has taken advantage of the exemptions from preparing a cash flow
statement under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1 (Revised
1996) – Cash Flow Statements, and the exemptions under Financial
Reporting Standard 8 – Related Party Disclosures relating to the disclosure
of transactions with other Group companies.

1. A form of proxy is enclosed for use by shareholders and, if appropriate, must be deposited with the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, (Proxies), The Registry,
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours before the time of the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). Appointment of a proxy does not preclude
a shareholder from attending the AGM and voting in person.
2. A member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a member of the Company) to attend and speak at the AGM and to vote
on his or her behalf whether by show of hands or on a poll. A member can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to
exercise the rights attaching to different shares held by him or her. In order to be valid an appointment of proxy (together with any authority under which it is executed or a copy
of the authority certified notarially) must be returned by one of the following methods:
– in hard copy form by post, by courier or by hand to the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, (Proxies), The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU; or
– in the case of CREST members, by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service in accordance with the procedures set out below;
and in each case must be received by the Company not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the AGM and any adjournment thereof by using
the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service
provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment, or instruction, made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly
authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (‘EUI’) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the
CREST manual. The message regardless of whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given previously to the appointed proxy must,
in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA 10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the Notice of Meeting.
For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer’s
agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner described by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances
set out in Regulation 35(5) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. CREST members and where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note
that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of
CREST Proxy instructions. It is therefore the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or
has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that the
message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable their CREST sponsors or voting service
providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
3. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, in order to be able to attend and vote at the AGM or any adjourned meeting (and also for the
purpose of calculating how many votes a person may cast), a person must have his/her name entered on the register of members of the Company by 6.00pm on 14 July 2009
(or 6.00pm on the date two days before any adjourned meeting). Changes to entries on the register of members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of
any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
4. The following documents are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours on any weekday and will be available at the place of
the AGM from at least 15 minutes prior to and until the conclusion of the meeting:
(a) Directors’ service contracts
(b) Register of directors’ interests
(c) a copy of the proposed new Articles of Association of the Company and a copy of the existing Articles marked to show the changes being proposed by Resolution 9.
5. Any electronic communication received by the Company, including the lodgement of an electronic proxy form, that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.
6. A map showing the location of the Harbour Heights Hotel can be found at the Company’s website, www.hamworthy.com/agmmap

Company overview Business review Governance Accounts
1 Articles which duplicate statutory provisions
Provisions in the Current Articles which replicate provisions contained in the Companies Act 2006 are in the main amended to bring them into line
with the Companies Act 2006. Examples of such provisions include those relating to the form of resolutions and the period of notice required to
convene general meetings. The main changes made to reflect this approach are set out below.
2 Form of resolution
The Current Articles provide that, where for any purpose an ordinary resolution is required, a special or extraordinary resolution is also effective and
that, where an extraordinary resolution is required, a special resolution is also effective. This provision is being amended because the concept of
extraordinary resolutions has been abolished by the Companies Act 2006. Therefore, all references in the Current Articles to extraordinary resolutions
have been altered in the New Articles to become references to special resolutions.
3 Convening Extraordinary and Annual General Meetings
The provisions in the Current Articles dealing with the convening of general meetings and the length of notice required to convene general meetings
are being amended to conform to new provisions in the Companies Act 2006. In particular, a general meeting other than an Annual General Meeting
to consider a special resolution can be convened on 14 days’ notice whereas, previously, 21 days’ notice was required.
4 Votes of members
Under the Companies Act 2006, proxies are entitled to vote on a show of hands whereas under the Current Articles proxies are entitled to vote only
on a poll. Multiple proxies may be appointed provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share held by the
shareholder. Proxies may also be deposited electronically. The New Articles reflect these altered provisions.
5 Age of directors on appointment
The Current Articles contain a provision requiring a director’s age to be disclosed if he has attained the age of 70 years or more in the notice
convening a meeting at which the director is proposed to be elected or re-elected. Such provision could now fall foul of the Employment Equality
(Age) Regulations 2006 and so has been removed from the New Articles.
6 Conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 sets out directors’ general duties and these largely codify the existing law. A director must now avoid a situation where he
has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the company’s interests. The requirement is very broad and
could apply, for example, if a director becomes a director of another company or a trustee of another organisation. The Companies Act 2006 allows
directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate, where the Articles of Association contain a provision to
this effect. The Companies Act 2006 also allows the Articles of Association to contain other provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts of interest
to avoid a breach of duty. The New Articles give the directors the ability to authorise such situations and to include other provisions to allow conflicts
of interest to be dealt with in a similar way to the current position.
There are safeguards which will apply when directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict. First, only directors who have no
interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the relevant decision and second, in taking the decision, the directors must act in a way
they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the company’s success. The directors will be able to impose limits or conditions when
giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
It is also proposed that the New Articles should contain provisions relating to confidential information, attendance at board meetings and the
availability of board papers to protect a director being in breach of duty if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest arises. These provisions
will apply only where the position giving rise to the potential conflict has previously been authorised by the directors. The board proposes to report
annually on the Company’s procedures for ensuring that the board’s powers to authorise conflicts are operated effectively.
7 Notice of board meetings
The current provisions have been altered so that a director who is abroad can request that he receives notice electronically as well as or in preference
to it being sent to a nominated UK address.
8 Electronic communications
New provisions have been inserted which allow the Company to take advantage of provisions in the Companies Act 2006 to enable it to agree with
members that they may receive and send certain communications by electronic means.
9 Distribution of assets otherwise than in cash.
The Current Articles contain provisions dealing with the distribution of assets in kind in the event of the Company going into liquidation.
These provisions have been removed in the New Articles on the grounds that a provision about the powers of liquidators is a matter for insolvency
law rather than the articles and that the Insolvency Act 1986 confers powers on the liquidator which would enable it to do what is envisaged by
the Current Articles.
10 Directors’ indemnities and loans to fund expenditure
The Companies Act 2006 has in some areas widened the scope of the powers of a company to indemnify directors and to fund expenditure incurred
in connection with certain actions against directors. In particular, a company that is a trustee of an occupational pension scheme can now indemnify
a director against liability incurred in connection with the company’s activities as trustee of the scheme. In addition, the existing exemption allowing
a company to provide money for the purpose of funding a director’s defence in court proceedings now expressly covers regulatory proceedings and
applies to associated companies.

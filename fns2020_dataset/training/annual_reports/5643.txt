Chairman’s Statement
Business Review
Filtrona remains a well managed 
company intent on constantly 
improving and innovating the  
way it does business
In 2008, Filtrona reported increases in revenue, adjusted 
operating profit and earnings, despite the volatile economic 
conditions experienced globally during the latter part of the 
year, and the recessionary trends which emerged in some  
of the Company’s markets. Whilst these improvements 
benefited from movements in currency exchange rates, 
particularly in the latter part of the year, as sterling weakened 
sharply against both the euro and the US dollar, they also 
reflect the resilience derived from Filtrona’s strong 
international market positions. 
Revenue was up against the prior year by 6.5% at £526.4m 
(2007: £494.2m) and, at constant exchange rates, down 0.9%. 
Adjusted operating profit was up 0.9% to £65.0m (2007: 
£64.4m), after absorbing £1.8m of restructuring costs, and 
down 8.1% at constant exchange rates. The beneficial impact 
of currency translation during the year was £37.1m on revenue 
and £6.3m on adjusted operating profit. A robust profit 
performance and effective working capital management 
helped to maintain a strong adjusted operating cash flow  
at £65.6m. 
The successful completion of the acquisition of the business 
and assets of Lendell Manufacturing Inc., based in St Charles, 
Michigan, reflects the Company’s strategy of acquiring in the 
higher growth, higher margin divisions. The integration of 
Lendell’s speciality foam manufacturing, sales and 
development capabilities into the renamed Porous 
Technologies division is proceeding well. It is anticipated that 
both Lendell and the Fibertec business will secure additional 
growth opportunities through their combination. 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 5.08p per 
share which, if approved at the Annual General Meeting on 
23 April 2009, will make a total dividend of 7.78p per share 
(2007: 7.6p) for the full year. This represents a 2.4% increase in 
the total dividend. The final dividend will be paid on 8 May 
2009 to shareholders on the register at 14 April 2009.
Steve Crummett joined the Board on 19 March 2008 as  
Group Finance Director and his experience and knowledge 
have been key in helping to guide Filtrona through the 
challenges presented by the changes in trading and  
financial market conditions. 
Adrian Auer has confirmed his intention to leave Filtrona as  
a Non‑ executive Director with effect from 30 June 2009 as he 
focuses on his other interests outside of the Group. Adrian has 
been a Director of the Company, and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, since the public listing of Filtrona in 2005, and on 
behalf of the Board I would like to thank him for his invaluable 
contribution. Under the direction of the Nomination Committee, 
the recruitment process for Adrian’s replacement is under way.
The Board held eight scheduled meetings during the year, 
together with a day of strategy discussions. The focus of the 
Board during 2008 was on seeking to secure key strategic 
developments for the Group and a number of additional 
meetings were arranged during the year to accommodate 
those discussions. For the first time, the Board undertook  
an evaluation of its performance under the direction of an 
independent third party. The individual Directors have 
responded well to address the constructive points arising  
from that review in seeking to maximise the Board’s value  
for stakeholders both internal and external to the Company. 
I am pleased to welcome new colleagues to the Group  
who have joined during the year, including those from the 
acquisition of Lendell. Filtrona values its people highly and 
their commitment, enthusiasm and professionalism will be 
key to ensuring Filtrona’s resilience in the face of demanding 
market conditions.
Filtrona remains a strong and well managed company  
intent on constantly improving and innovating the way it  
does business. It is expected that economic conditions will 
remain challenging during 2009 but the Board remains 
confident that Filtrona will continue to demonstrate resilience 
and perform satisfactorily.

26 February 2009
On 3 March 2009, the Company announced that its subsidiary Filtrona 
Extrusion Inc. had entered into a conditional agreement for the sale of 
all the issued and outstanding common stock of the Filtrona Extrusion 
Holding Companies, which operate the North American Plastic Profile 
and Sheet business.
Completion of the sale is subject to a number of conditions, including 
the approval of the Company’s shareholders. It is expected that the  
sale will complete towards the end of March 2009. A circular setting  
out further details of the proposed sale and containing the Notice of  
a General Meeting of the Company to be held on 19 March 2009  
was posted to shareholders on 3 March 2009 and is available on  
the Company’s website at www.filtrona.com. Completion of the  
sale will be an important step in Filtrona’s strategic development. 11  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

Chief Executive’s Statement
Business Review
Our strategy 13  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Overview
Filtrona is an international, market leading, speciality plastic 
and fibre products supplier with activities segmented into 
Plastic Technologies and Fibre Technologies.
From its global network of 37 principal manufacturing 
facilities, 42 distribution operations and four research and 
development centres, Filtrona derives strength through 
serving a wide range of customers, across diverse 
geographies within a broad but targeted range of 
international markets.
In 2008, Filtrona made continued progress in its strategy of 
optimising its portfolio of businesses, including exploring 
acquisition opportunities in the higher growth, higher 
margin divisions. The acquisition of the Lendell business 
was driven by the Company’s view of the growth potential 
for the medical and cosmetic markets in which Lendell 
operates. Lendell is a manufacturer of speciality foam 
products and its specialist markets and proprietary 
technology are highly complementary with those of the 
Filtrona Fibertec business. 
During the fourth quarter of 2008, because of the 
deterioration in global economic and business conditions, the 
Company withdrew from a significant potential acquisition at 
an advanced stage. Accordingly, the Company is reporting 
£1.3m of transaction costs incurred on this strategic 
development activity in 2008, which are presented as an 
exceptional item by virtue of their size and incidence.
In accordance with the Company’s organic growth plans  
and in response to evolving customer demands, investment 
continued in securing operational efficiencies, expanding 
sales and marketing activities and developing new and 
innovative customer solutions. The Filter Products division 
continued the reorganisation of its manufacturing facilities, 
and the distribution capabilities of the Protection and Finishing 
Products division have been further developed. 
The current global recession does not impact the Company’s 
commitment to the pursuit of its strategic goals but will, 
inevitably, affect the pace at which further progress can be 
made. Organic development is likely to progress at a slower 
pace in the recessionary environment, given the sensitivity of 
some of Filtrona’s businesses to consumer demand and gross 
domestic product. The extent to which attractive acquisition 
opportunities may present themselves during 2009 is not 
easy to assess given market conditions but the Company  
will continue to investigate strategic markets and closely 
monitor target businesses that may further drive Filtrona’s 
long‑ term performance.
It is expected that global economic conditions will remain 
challenging during 2009. However, the relatively defensive 
nature of a number of Filtrona’s key served markets, combined 
with the Company’s focus on cash generation, cost control 
and reinforcement of its strong international positions give the 
Board confidence that Filtrona will continue to demonstrate 
resilience and that the Group is well positioned to deliver 
growth as demand recovers.  14  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Business Review
Chief Executive’s Statement
Key Strengths
Strong international  
market positions
Long-term customer relationships
Well invested flexible global 
infrastructure
Experienced management team
Reputation for quality  
and innovation
Operational efficiency
Filtrona’s programme of continuous 
improvement and cost reductions 
across its global manufacturing and 
distribution footprint requires constant 
focus and decisive action
Strategy
Filtrona’s long‑ term objective is to continue to grow profitably 
for the benefit of its shareholders through investing organically 
in each of its divisions and by acquisition within its higher 
margin, higher growth potential businesses. The Company 
will acquire in selected markets within or complementary  
to plastic and fibre technologies. The Company’s strategic 
focus is to invest in and build on its core competencies and 
strong international positions through the investment in,  
and acquisition of, businesses which are engaged in the 
development, manufacturing, sourcing and distribution of 
high volume, low unit cost, small but essential products for 
use in consumer, medical and industrial markets.
The identification and successful exploitation of markets which 
offer significant value addition and growth opportunities 
through product innovation, distribution, service and cost 
improvements are integral to the future development of 
Filtrona as the Company seeks to enhance the competitive 
position of its global businesses.
With a responsible winning culture based on Filtrona Values 
and Key Strengths the reputation of the Company and its 
employees form a sound basis for the successful delivery of 
new business and market opportunities designed to secure 
long‑ term value for Filtrona’s shareholders.
Filtrona’s key served markets are shown in Figure 1 and 
represent important industrial and consumer product 
segments with a bias towards more defensive markets.  
From its broad and flexible manufacturing and distribution 
network, Filtrona is a supplier throughout the world to many 
blue chip, international, market leading customers with the 
top 10 customers in 2008 representing 33.1% of revenue.

Figure 2
Geographical spread of revenue (£m)
in comparison from 36.7% in 2007 is a reflection of the 
Company’s success in broadening its overall customer base.
In 2008, the geographic destination of the Company’s  
revenue was as shown in Figure 2. The Rest of World segment 
includes many of the lower cost manufacturing and higher 
growth regions such as India, Indonesia and China. This 
segment represents 20.6% of revenue in 2008, up from 19.5% 
of revenue in 2007.
Performance
Filtrona secured increases in revenue, adjusted operating 
profit, and earnings during the year despite the challenges 
presented by global economic conditions during the later 
stages of 2008 and the emergence of recessionary trends  
in some of the Company’s markets. Revenue was up against 
the prior year by 6.5% at £526.4m (2007: £494.2m) and, at 
constant exchange rates, down 0.9%. Adjusted operating 
profit was up 0.9% to £65.0m (2007: £64.4m), after absorbing  
£1.8m of restructuring costs, and down 8.1% at constant 
exchange rates.
The beneficial impact of currency translation during the year 
was £37.1m on revenue and £6.3m on adjusted operating 
profit but the improvements also reflect the resilience Filtrona 
derives from its strong international market positions. The 
robust profit performance and effective working capital 
management helped to maintain a strong operating cash 
flow at £65.6m, demonstrating the benefits of Filtrona’s cash 
generative business model.
During 2008, essential steps were taken across the Group to 
manage the cost base in the face of deteriorating market 
conditions and, regrettably, this resulted in a total headcount 
reduction of 8% in the year to 4,292 employees from 4,666 
employees at the end of 2007. The principal reductions took 
place in the Protection and Finishing Products, Plastic Profile 
and Sheet and Filter Products divisions. This enabled the 
Company to increase revenue per employee by 3.5% on a 
constant exchange rate basis. The restructuring of the Filter 
Products division continued during the year and £1.8m of 
restructuring costs are included in the operating results of this 
division in 2008.
The Company will undertake a restructuring programme in 
2009 and 2010, with the focus on the Filter Products division.  
It is estimated that the cash costs of this restructuring will be 
circa £5m in 2009 and £2m in 2010 (with additional non‑ cash 
costs of £3m over the two year period). The restructuring is 
expected to deliver savings of circa £2.5m in 2009 and £6.5m 
from 2010 onwards.
The Company experienced significant raw material  
cost increases in 2008 with polymers, which are used  
in all the Plastic Technologies businesses and the Porous 
Technologies division, and cellulose acetate tow, the principal 
raw material consumed by the Filter Products division, 
particularly severely affected. Pricing action was taken  
during 2008 to offset the raw material and energy cost 
increases. The costs of polymers fell sharply at the end of  
the year due to falling oil based feedstock prices and the  
rapid fall in manufacturing activity globally.
Operating margin declined to 12.3% from 13.0% in 2007 and 
was depressed by the combined effects of the restructuring in 
the Filter Products division, the legal costs associated with the 
intellectual property claims made against FractureCode and 
the impact of the industrial action at Boeing, which is an 
important customer of the Plastic Profile and Sheet division.  16  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Business Review
Chief Executive’s Statement
Return on average operating capital, excluding intangible 
assets, reduced from 26.8% to 24.5% and the return on 
average total invested capital, including intangibles, reduced 
from 13.9% to 12.7%. These ratios were negatively impacted by 
the factors detailed above in relation to the operating margin 
performance, and by the use of average exchange rates for 
the income statement and closing exchange rates for the 
balance sheet. Adjusted earnings per share grew by 8.1% to 
18.6p (2007: 17.2p) and basic earnings per share grew by 13.1% 
to 17.3p (2007: 15.3p).
Net debt increased by £46.9m to £182.1m (2007: £135.2m) due 
primarily to exchange rate movements and the acquisition of 
Lendell. The ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation, amortisation and exceptional acquisition fees 
increased from 1.56 in 2007 to 2.05 in 2008. If closing 
exchange rates were used in both components of the 
calculation, the ratio would have been 1.71.
The Company’s long‑ term funding arrangements comprise  
a sterling denominated multi‑ currency syndicated facility 
totalling £215m, which matures in May 2010, together with 
other uncommitted and overdraft facilities to provide short‑ term flexibility. Additionally, the Company has committed 
bilateral facilities of US$40m, which expire in November 2009. 
Based upon these maturity dates, refinancing is an important 
process for Filtrona and it is one which the Company expects 
to complete shortly. It is anticipated that net finance expense 
could double in 2009 as a result of higher borrowing costs 
and the amortisation of related fees. 
Corporate responsibility
Filtrona has built a strong framework within which corporate 
responsibility activities are managed ensuring that the 
Company maintains the high standards which reflect the 
expectations of the Company’s internal and external 
stakeholders. The success of this framework is demonstrated 
by the various initiatives introduced within Filtrona’s global 
businesses and these are reported on in greater detail in the 
Corporate Responsibility report on pages 34 to 39.
The Company again made good progress in its corporate 
citizenship during 2008 and Filtrona Values remain the 
bedrock upon which the development of the Company’s 
culture rests.
Filtrona’s development of a responsible, progressive and 
winning culture recognises the role which the Company’s 
relationship with its employees, customers, suppliers and 
other stakeholders and its interaction with the environment 
and local communities has in securing competitive advantage 
and business performance across its divisions. The 
strengthening of the international reputation of the Filtrona 
businesses and the quality of their respective brands are 
regarded as real benefits to be derived from the Company’s 
commitment to corporate responsibility in addition to the cost 
savings stemming from initiatives focused on environmental 
benefits and sustainable practices.
The skills and commitment of Filtrona employees across  
the world are fundamental to ensuring the quality and 
These results reflect the strength of 
Filtrona’s international market 
positions and the Company’s cash 
generative business model 17  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

competitiveness of the Company’s portfolio of products and 
services. The Company’s commitment to its employees is 
reflected in the quality and safety of the working environment 
and the personal development opportunities which it seeks  
to provide at each of its locations, without discrimination 
between site or people. There is a recognition across the 
Group of the potential impact of any business restructuring on 
affected employees and communities and Filtrona handles all 
headcount reduction programmes with due responsibility. 
Filtrona made substantial progress in its objective to gain 
OHSAS 18001 health and safety accreditation across all its 
principal manufacturing sites and, at the end of the year, 
accreditation had been achieved at the majority of its principal 
manufacturing locations. Total accidents and lost time 
accidents remain two key performance indicators within the 
Company in recognition of the primary importance of good 
health and safety when securing optimal operational 
efficiency. It was particularly pleasing that, for the first  
time, the Filtrona gold standard for health and safety was 
achieved by no less than four operations. The improvement in 
Filtrona’s health and safety performance and awareness is 
detailed above.
Filtrona’s reputation as an employer is important to ensure the 
attraction and retention of suitably motivated, experienced 
and skilled personnel. The customer and supplier perception 
of Filtrona Values and standards of conduct across a variety of 
regions and cultures can impact on the development of the 
long‑ standing business relationships which the Company has 
Accident trend – injury/illness 12 month lost time accident trend
maintained and continues to foster. Filtrona strives to maintain 
the highest ethical standards at all times in the conduct of its 
international operations.
Filtrona’s drive towards continuous improvement and cost 
reductions across its global manufacturing and distribution

Key Performance Indicators
Business Review
Cash inflow from operations
Cash inflow from operations is defined as the cash flow from 
operating activities of continuing operations as shown  
in the consolidated statement of cash flows. This measures 
the success of the operating businesses and the Group  
as a whole in turning profit into cash through the careful 
management of working capital in the business.
In 2008, the Group has generated cash inflow from operations 
of £80.0m, which represents 123% of operating profit before 
intangible amortisation and exceptional acquisition fees.
Operating margin
Operating margin is an important measure to Filtrona as it 
monitors operating efficiency and reflects the success of the 
businesses in achieving superior margins by operating in 
selected markets and offering strongly differentiated, cost 
competitive products and services. Operating margin is 
defined as operating profit before intangible amortisation and 
exceptional acquisition fees (2007: intangible amortisation 
and exceptional restructuring costs) divided by revenue.
Having increased the Group operating margin from 11.0% to 
13.0% between 2004 and 2007, the Group operating margin in 
2008 reduced to 12.3%. An important driver behind this lower 
margin in 2008 was the incurring of restructuring costs and 
additional central services costs in relation to a specific legal 
matter, not in the ordinary course of business. If these costs 
were eliminated, the Group operating margin would be 12.9%. 
Plastic Technologies produced an operating margin of 15.6%, 
marginally lower than 2007 at 15.7%. In Fibre Technologies, 
operating margin at 13.2%, after adjusting for restructuring 
costs of £1.8m within Filter Products charged against the 
operating results, compared to 13.8% in 2007. 
To assess the overall performance of Filtrona, the 
Company uses five financial key performance 
indicators (‘KPIs’).
As well as being used to measure the performance 
at Group level, the majority of the financial KPIs  
are used as the principal quantitative elements in 
assessing the short-term and long-term 
performance of the operating businesses.
Given the diversity of Filtrona’s range of businesses 
operating across international boundaries, a 
number of other business measures, both financial 
and non-financial and tailored to the individual 
requirements and characteristics of each business, 
are monitored and assessed on a regular basis  
to evaluate how individual divisions are performing 
in response to their key objectives and challenges.

Underlying operating profit growth
The growth in underlying operating profit (‘OP’) is a key 
measure of the underlying performance of the Group over 
time. Underlying OP growth removes the distorting influence 
of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, disposals, the 
costs of restructuring or rationalisation of operations, the 
exceptional costs of acquisition fees and the amortisation  
and impairment of intangible assets. The Group’s underlying 
OP decreased by 7.5% in 2008.
Return on average total invested capital
Return on average total invested capital (‘ROTIC’) represents 
operating profit before exceptional acquisition fees  
(2007: exceptional restructuring costs) as a percentage  
of total invested capital (‘TIC’). TIC is defined as property,  
plant and equipment, intangible assets previously charged 
to reserves, trade and other receivables (excluding the 
Globalpack deferred consideration), and inventories less  
trade and other payables. ROTIC reflects the success of the 
Company in achieving superior returns on its invested capital. 
In 2008, ROTIC reduced to 12.7% (2007: 13.9%).
At the operating division level, goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets are excluded from TIC so that management 
is judged more narrowly on the return achieved on capital 
invested in fixed assets and working capital. This is because 
the operating division management is not directly involved in 
the price negotiations for acquisitions completed within their 
spheres of responsibility.
Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’) measures the benefits 
generated for shareholders from the Group’s overall 
performance. It is calculated as profit before intangible 
amortisation and exceptional acquisition fees (2007: 
intangible amortisation and exceptional restructuring costs) 
less tax relief on intangible amortisation (2007: intangible 
amortisation and exceptional restructuring costs), attributable 
to shareholders, from continuing operations, divided by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue excluding 
shares held in treasury or shares held by the employee 
benefit trust. 
Adjusted earnings, from continuing operations, increased  
by 1.6% to £37.9m in 2008 (2007: £37.3 m). The weighted 
average number of shares in 2008 was 204.1 million  
(2007: 216.3 million) giving adjusted EPS of 18.6p (2007: 17.2p) 
an increase of 8.1%. 20  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

Protection and Finishing Products
Filtrona’s largest profit generating division had another 
successful year driven by its growth strategy of combining 
geographic and range expansion with consistent investment 
in business to business marketing programmes, integrated IT 
systems and supply chain efficiencies. The division operates  
in a highly fragmented global market with a wide range of 
served markets from the oil and gas industry to white goods, 
from hydraulics and pneumatics to automotive, and from 
metal fabrication to furniture. As the division further develops 
in response to customer demands and emerging market 
opportunities, revenue investments continued in the locations 
established in 2007 and a new Moss location was added in 
Madrid, Spain.
The combined operating losses of these new locations  
was £0.9m in the year, but the enhancement of distribution 
capability is integral to the future growth and development  
of the division, and it is anticipated that the benefits of the 
investments will start to emerge in 2009. As further market 
share gains are sought based on the breadth and excellence 
of the product and service offerings, extensive marketing 
programmes led to the opening of over 20,000 new accounts 
in the year and 3,000 product lines were added to the  
range. Across the division, overall utilisation of the internet  
and the use of ‘e’ marketing techniques became increasingly 
important. The division was subject to the impact of the very 
sharp increases in raw material costs but these were offset 
through pricing action.
Moss, the pan‑ European plastic parts supplier, had another 
good year with a further strengthening of the product mix 
towards more profitable proprietary product lines, the sales of 
which increased by over 10%. The UK locations found trading 
conditions difficult for most of the year, whereas performance 
at continental European locations was encouraging but with 
signs of trading deterioration appearing at the end of the year. 
The Moss Express location in Madrid, Spain, which opened in 
May, traded in line with expectations. The new Chinese facility, 
which opened in December 2007, had an encouraging first 
year and sample, quotation and sales activity levels are 
growing as anticipated.

Skiffy, the European specialist small nylon parts producer, 
traded satisfactorily in 2008. A project to install the division’s 
standard IT system was started and the majority of Skiffy 
locations will be operating on this platform by the end of 2009. 
The business continued to expand its marketing activity and 
launched its highly effective catalogue in Italian and Bulgarian 
for the first time. The Skiffy catalogue is now available in ten 
languages and internet ordering now accounts for 29.8%  
of sales. In January 2009, the Company relocated the 
manufacturing capability from the Skiffy, Amsterdam facility 
into the Moss, Kidlington operation which benefits from  
24/7 manufacturing and has been in receipt of substantial 
investment in recent years. This relocation will provide both 
cost savings and risk mitigation benefits due to the superior 
fire protection systems including fireproof storage for business 
critical tooling at the Kidlington site.
Alliance, the US‑ based plastic parts supplier, encountered 
difficult trading conditions but performed in line with 2007  
due to effective cost management. The business continued  
to expand its proprietary catalogue product offering with the 
addition of 800 new items. The Chicago Alliance Express 
location, opened in 2007, has continued to grow well and  
the Alliance facility in São Paulo, Brazil has gone from  
strength to strength as local manufacture has developed.  
In January 2008 a freehold warehouse was purchased  
in Erie, Pennsylvania, contiguous to land previously  
acquired, in preparation for the future construction of an 
integrated facility to further drive operating efficiencies.
Duraco, the US‑ based producer and distributor of adhesive‑ coated foam products, performed in line with expectations  
in its first full year of Filtrona ownership. The integration of the 
business into the division is now complete and the project to 
install the division’s standard IT system is well advanced and 
will be completed in 2009. The Duraco Express operation 
opened as planned in May and is trading successfully.
MSI, the oil country tubular goods thread protector business, 
had an excellent year despite the interruption to production in 
September at the Houston, Texas facility, caused by Hurricane 
Ike. Strong drilling activity was driven by the high prices of oil 
and gas. Sales levels were also assisted by the new contract 
wins which developed as anticipated. Strong volumes helped 
the business manage the rapid escalation in raw material 
prices and continued investment in new production 
machinery and tooling drove unit production costs down. 22  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

Tony Edwards, Managing Director, 
Coated and Security Products Plastic Technologies
Business Review
Looking forward to 2009, the current recessionary environment 
in most manufacturing sectors will inevitably impact on the 
division and the MSI business will be affected by a downturn 
in drilling activity due to recent falls in the price of oil and gas. 
Whilst the Protection and Finishing Products division has a 
robust business model with a broad range of products and 
services across multiple served markets combined with low 
levels of customer concentration, the scale of the downturn in 
conditions in the global manufacturing industry is expected  
to negatively affect demand. The extent of any decline within 
the division during 2009 is very difficult to predict but the 
division is responding by continuing to drive efficiencies  
and reducing costs. 
Coated and Security Products
The Coated and Security Products division continued to pursue 
its strategy of developing new security technologies and 
applications for international markets, whilst sustaining its 
world leadership position in the self‑ adhesive tear tape market. 
The division delivered an improved performance in both 
revenue and operating profit with the tear tape business, in 
particular, demonstrating the defensive qualities of its principal 
end markets in the difficult global environment. The improved 
performance was assisted by the cost, quality and productivity 
benefits which resulted from the restructuring in 2007.
The Payne tear tape business delivered growth in all regions 
and from both the tobacco and other consumer goods 
markets. Sales from recent innovations utilising advanced tear 
tape technology were encouraging with increased sales of 
variable data tape for promotions into the tobacco, biscuits 
and chewing gum markets and strong growth in the product 
authentication technologies, printed on tear tape.

printing markets, made satisfactory progress despite some 
softening in UK passport volumes towards the end of the year. 
Significant new orders were secured for the proprietary Payne 
authentication system and for security labels, the full benefit  
of which will be realised in 2009. The business supplied a 
secure laminate for the press, competitor, coach and officials’ 
passes for the summer games in Beijing and secured a  
share of the cards for the April launch of the English National 
Concessionary Travel Scheme due to an enhanced smart card 
encoding and fulfilment capability. The focus on exploiting 
proprietary authentication solutions to combat counterfeiting 
remains a key growth driver along with further improvements 
to the quality and service offering to customers.
As expected FractureCode made losses in the year and cost 
reduction actions have been taken due to the failure of the 
business to secure additional licensees for the technology.  
An intellectual property dispute has been resolved, but 
FractureCode’s proprietary technology remains subject to  
a further challenge in the Danish courts.
During 2009, it is expected that the Coated and Security 
Products division will benefit both from the defensiveness of its 
core served markets in tear tapes and from the growth in the 
market for solutions to combat the global contraband and 
counterfeit problem. These factors, combined with the full  
year effect of business won in 2008 for the proprietary Payne 
authentication system, provide confidence that 2009 will see 
the delivery of further progress in this division. 24  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

Business Review

Revenue by key markets 
Plastic Profile and Sheet
The Plastic Profile and Sheet division encountered another 
difficult year in 2008 with a further reduction in operating 
performance. Trading was tough in North America throughout 
the year for the US‑ based Filtrona extrusion business and, for 
Enitor in The Netherlands, and demand softness was evident 
in Europe in the last quarter.
Strong revenue growth was generated in the point of 
purchase (‘POP’) market, due to both the capture of new 
business, with a major US discount retailer and a large 
grocery chain, and the strengthening of relationships with 
existing customers. The business’s profile in this increasingly 
important market sector has been raised as it has successfully 
serviced a number of major US national roll‑ outs supported 
by its national multi‑ site capability. 
Sales in the medical sector saw modest growth following the 
expansion of the Mexican medical manufacturing operations 
in 2007 and the consolidation of the Massachusetts sites into 
the Athol facility. The medical sector remains a high priority  
for future growth and the division continues to explore 
opportunities to secure new business.
Sales to the aerospace market declined slightly due to the 
impact of the eight week industrial dispute at Boeing’s 
manufacturing facilities which negatively affected 
performance during the fourth quarter. Activity with this 
important customer has returned to previous levels and  
sales of highly engineered profiles and components to the 
aerospace industry remain an important growth opportunity 
for the division based on its engineering and design expertise 
supported by high standards of quality and service.
Plastic Profile and Sheet – A leading 
manufacturer of proprietary and customised 
thermoplastic profiles, sheet and speciality tubes 
with multiple locations in the US, Mexico and 
The Netherlands. The business serves 3,200 
customers in 40 countries spread across six 
principal markets – aerospace, point of 
purchase signs and displays, medical, traffic 
control, lighting and fence.
Continuing operations 25  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
“ Our manufacturing footprint, lean 
cost base, strategic focus on core 
markets and investment in 
technology enables us to 
outperform our competitors and 
meet customer demands even in 
this challenging economic climate.”
Managing 
costs  
efficiently
Sales in the traffic control sector were softer due to the 
absence of major ‘one‑ off’ projects, as federal road funding 
was constrained, and sales to the fence and custom product 
markets were particularly disappointing as the commercial 
construction, domestic housing and commercial refrigeration 
markets, upon which these sectors rely, were severely 
impacted by the economic slowdown.
Enitor had a challenging year and is continuing to focus on 
cost reduction and productivity improvements.
The difficult end use demand conditions were exacerbated by 
the rapid escalation of raw material prices which reached all 
time record highs during the year. The division had an under 
recovery of raw material prices of £1.1m at the half year, 
improving to £0.8m for the full year.
As a result of difficult trading conditions, cost reduction 
measures were implemented throughout the year, including 
modifications to shift patterns to match output to demand  
and an 11.4% reduction in headcount across the division.
Trading conditions in the Plastic Profile and Sheet division are 
expected to remain difficult throughout 2009. The aerospace, 
medical, POP and traffic control markets are expected to remain 
stable or display low levels of growth, whereas the lighting, 
fence and custom markets are likely to reduce due to their 
sensitivity to construction activity levels. The division will continue 
its focus on operational efficiencies and cost improvement and  
it is anticipated that it will benefit from the sharp reductions in 
polymer prices which occurred at the end of 2008. 26  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

Filter Products – The only global independent 
cigarette filter manufacturer supplies a wide 
range of value adding high quality innovative 
filters from monoacetate to multi‑ segment 
speciality filters with sophisticated adsorbent 
materials. The 12 worldwide locations, including 
a UK based research facility, provide a flexible 
infrastructure strategically positioned to serve 
the tobacco industry.
Fibre Technologies had a challenging 
year. Revenue was up 1.1% to £231.0m 
(2007: £228.4m) with adjusted operating 
profit after charging £1.8m of Filter 
Products restructuring costs, down 8.9% 
to £28.8m (2007: £31.6m). At constant 
exchange rates revenue decreased by 
5.5% and adjusted operating profit 
decreased by 16.5%.
PT Sreekumar, Managing Director, 
Filter Products
Filter Products
The Filter Products division experienced a 7.2% reduction in  
total volumes, primarily due to previously announced customer 
insourcing decisions, with an 11.7% reduction in special filters 
volumes but a 1.4% increase in monoacetate volumes due  
to growth in India. Whilst volumes were down in the mature  
and declining markets of the Americas and Europe, volumes  
in emerging Asian markets increased by 15.2% with strong 
growth in China and India where a change in taxation boosted 
consumption of filtered cigarettes. The Asia region now 
accounts for 44.9% of total volumes, up from 36.3% in 2007 and, 
together with Eastern Europe, provides a key strategic growth 
opportunity for the business.
As the division sought to optimise its global manufacturing 
footprint to provide its customers with cost reduction and 
supply flexibility it absorbed restructuring costs of £1.8m 
during the year relating to headcount reductions in the UK,  
US and Brazil. The closure of the São Paulo operation was 
announced in January 2009.
The new Hungarian facility continued to develop well with  
low levels of waste and good quality performance. Output 
continues to grow on a month by month basis and this low 
cost manufacturing facility will become increasingly important 
in the division’s quest for strategic cost competitiveness and 
expansion into new emerging markets.
With the increasing importance of filters as a product 
differentiator, particularly for lower tar and premium products, 
the division has the opportunity to utilise its extensive research 
and development capability to develop new products which 
meet this market need.

“ Our business has been built upon 
the four cornerstones of Quality, 
Partnership, Innovation and 
Knowledge. Our global reach, 
relationships with key customers 
and skilled employees enable us 
to have the flexibility to adapt, 
improve and develop our products 
and service offerings in a truly 
global market.”
Positioning 
resources 
effectively
The division launched a new range of slim filter variants to 
help exploit the growing international market for slim, lower 
circumference cigarettes which are of increasing importance 
in selected major cigarette markets such as Russia and South 
Korea. The previously announced new volumes with a major 
customer commenced production in the latter part of the year 
within the UK facility. This production, which resulted from a 
customer joint development programme, will help to support 
a significant customer brand relaunch. Further partnering with 
customers in joint development programmes offers attractive 
growth potential for the division.
The business experienced very significant increases in raw 
material prices in the latter part of the year and these 
increases were fully offset through pricing programmes.
The division continued to make significant progress with 
productivity and service improvement programmes. Energy 
consumption was reduced by 11% against a 7% volume 
reduction and on time in full delivery performance improved 
from 93% to 96%. Conversion costs were improved with further 
investment in training and multi‑ skilling.
It is expected that performance in the Filter Products division  
will be broadly stable in 2009. Continued growth and 
development in key Asian markets, such as India and China,  
is expected to offset activity reductions in the mature or 
declining markets of the Americas and Europe. The division 
will continue to focus on productivity improvement and the 
migration of productive capacity towards its lower unit cost 
manufacturing locations in order to secure strategic cost 
competitiveness and satisfy customer needs. 28  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

Porous Technologies
Following a year of growth across all served market sectors in 
2007, the Porous Technologies division delivered mixed results 
in 2008 with overall performance down. Growth was achieved 
in the medical, personal care and printing system segments. 
Writing instrument reservoirs and household products, which 
both have some sensitivity to discretionary consumer 
expenditure, saw reduced volumes with household products 
being impacted in the final quarter. Cost reduction 
programmes were implemented throughout the year.
Long‑ term supply agreements with a number of European 
and North American‑ based writing instrument reservoir 
customers were signed, including an agreement with an 
important new account in Europe. In Asia, the expanded 
sales and marketing team is focused on securing market 
penetration across all product segments in this high growth 
potential region.
The focus on innovation, driven by increasing customer 
demand for high quality and more sophisticated solutions,  
led to two new patent applications being filed during the year, 
further adding to the division’s intellectual property portfolio. 
New technology development facilitated product introductions 
in saliva based medical testing, pipette tip filtration and 
surgical instrument components. 
The exploitation of opportunities in emerging technologies and 
markets remains fundamental to the growth of the division. In 
accordance with the division’s strategy to broaden its porous 
media capabilities based on capillary science, the business 
and assets of Lendell Manufacturing Inc., a speciality 
hydrophilic foam producer based in St Charles, Michigan,  
were acquired in October. Lendell’s products are focused  
on the medical, wound care, and cosmetics sectors and its

“ We are focused on growth through

ability to provide technological

porous technology solutions to highly 
specialised and technical 
applications on a global scale will 
support the long-term success of  
our customers.”
Building 
expertise 
globally
technology and markets are highly complementary with 
Filtrona Fibertec’s. Growth in sales of hydrophilic foam products 
will be driven by customer cross‑ selling and through the 
utilisation of the division’s existing international sales  
and operational footprint. Upon completion of the Lendell 
acquisition the Bonded Fibre Components division was 
renamed the Porous Technologies division.
The renovation of the Reinbek, Germany facility progressed 
well, on time and to budget and will provide significant 
enhancements to operational efficiency, much improved 
energy efficiency and a comprehensive fire protection system. 
These site improvements have also facilitated the installation 
of a state of the art production line, utilising key Fibertec 
proprietary technology, which will become operational early in 
2009. Completion of the renovation will enhance productivity, 
quality and the product offering as well as bringing the facility 
up to the standard of global manufacturing excellence 
achieved by the division’s other facilities.
Looking forward to 2009, the Porous Technologies division will 
benefit from the full year effect of both the Lendell acquisition 
and new inkjet printer cartridge reservoir business secured  
in 2008. In addition, expected new projects in the medical 
products and inkjet printer market should come on stream  
in the first half of the year. It is anticipated the revenues in the 
writing instrument reservoir market will stabilise although the 
ongoing impact of the recession on discretionary consumer 
spending is likely to lead to a reduction in household product 
volumes and particularly air freshener applications. Overall, 
it is anticipated that the division will generate growth in both 
bonded fibre and hydrophilic foam business in 2009 which, 
combined with a continued focus on costs, should deliver 
positive progress. 30  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Financial Review
Business Review
Revenue
Revenue increased by 6.5% to £526.4m. Translated at constant 
exchange rates revenue decreased by 0.9%.
Operating profit
Operating profit before intangible amortisation and 
exceptional acquisition fees (2007: before intangible 
amortisation and restructuring costs) (‘adjusted operating 
profit’) increased by 0.9% to £65.0m. Translated at constant 
exchange rates, adjusted operating profit decreased by 8.1%.
Adjusted operating margin
The overall operating margin, before intangible amortisation 
and exceptional acquisition fees (2007: intangible 
amortisation and restructuring costs) reduced to 12.3%  
(2007: 13.0%). The operating margin in Plastic Technologies 
was 15.6% (2007: 15.7%) and Fibre Technologies’ margin was 
12.5% (2007: 13.8%). Fibre Technologies’ margin in 2008 was 
impacted by restructuring costs of £1.8m incurred in the Filter 
Products division charged in operating results.
Finance expense 
The net finance expense increased to £6.8m (2007: £6.2m) 
primarily as a result of higher average debt levels arising  
from acquisition spend and the impact of foreign currency 
movements on debt levels over the period. Net finance 
expense was covered 9.6 times (2007: 10.4 times) by adjusted 
operating profit. 
Tax
The tax charge of £18.5m represents an effective tax rate of 
33.7% (2007: 34.0%) on the profit from underlying operations. 
This equates to a tax rate of 33.0% on profit before charging 
exceptional acquisition fees. The effective rate is higher than 
the nominal UK rate of 28.5% because most of the Group’s 
profits are in countries with higher tax rates. As Filtrona 
develops in countries with lower tax rates then it is anticipated 
that the effective tax rate will reduce accordingly.
Adjusted earnings per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 
17.3p, an increase of 13.1% from 15.3p in 2007. Adjusting 
for intangible amortisation of £2.0m (2007: £1.5m) and 
exceptional acquisition fees of £1.3m (2007: restructuring costs 
of £5.0m) less tax relief on intangible amortisation of £0.7m 
(2007: intangible amortisation and restructuring costs of 
£2.2m), gives an adjusted earnings per share of 18.6p. 
Dividends
An interim dividend of 2.70p (2007: 2.52p) per share and a 
proposed final dividend of 5.08p (2007: 5.08p) per share  
will deliver an increase of 2.4% at a total cost of £15.9m, with 
dividend cover on adjusted earnings per share of 2.4 times.
Balance sheet
Total assets less current liabilities increased by £86.9m to 
£424.8m. The principal drivers of this increase were the 
acquisition of Lendell and foreign exchange rate movements 
which impact the translation of overseas assets and liabilities 
into sterling.
Return on average operating capital employed before 
intangible amortisation decreased to 24.5% (2007: 26.8%). 
Return on average total invested capital, including intangible 
assets and goodwill previously written off to reserves, on a 
pre‑ tax basis, decreased to 12.7% (2007: 13.9%). These ratios 
were negatively impacted by the use of average exchange 
rates for the income statement and closing exchange rates for 
the balance sheet.
Net debt increased by £46.9m to £182.1m (2007: £135.2m) due 
primarily to exchange rate movements and the acquisition  
of Lendell. The ratio of net debt to earnings before interest,  
tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional acquisition 
fees increased from 1.56 in 2007 to 2.05 in 2008. If closing 
exchange rates were used in both components of the 
calculation, the ratio would have been 1.71.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets increased by £45.0m, reflecting technology, 
customer relationships and goodwill acquired during the year 
of £15.8m, plus a foreign exchange movement of £31.2m, less 
amortisation of £2.0m.
Cash inflow
Cash inflow from operating activities of continuing operations 
was £80.0m, compared to £84.9m in 2007. Additional pension 
contributions of £7.0m were made during the year. Principal 
elements of the £22.8m capital expenditure (2007: £25.0m) 
were the purchase of a warehouse for Alliance Plastics in  
the US and the continued refurbishment of the Porous 
Technologies facility in Reinbek, Germany.
Net cash inflow before financing activities and acquisition/
disposal of businesses was £42.7m (2007: £39.8m). Cash 
outflow for 2008 was £19.6m and, after unfavourable 
exchange movements of £27.3m, net debt increased by 
£46.9m to £182.1m.
Pensions
At 31 December 2008, the Group’s IAS 19 (revised) gross 
pension liability was £37.4m (2007: £22.3m) with a net liability 
of £25.9m (2007: £15.6m) after accounting for a deferred tax 
asset of £11.5m (2007: £6.7m). The next full independent 
actuarial valuation is to be conducted as at 5 April 2009.
Treasury policy and controls
Filtrona has a centralised treasury department to control 
external borrowings and manage exchange rate risk. 
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the 
nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial 
investments that may be employed and the criteria for 
investing and borrowing cash. The Company uses derivatives 
only to manage foreign currency and interest rate risk arising 
from underlying business activities. No transactions of a 
speculative nature are undertaken. The department is subject 
to independent reviews by the internal audit department. 
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed  
by the Executive Directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity 
are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with 
the relevant combination of geographical presence and 
suitable credit rating. Filtrona monitors the credit ratings of  
its counterparties and credit exposure to each counterparty. 31  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Liquidity risk
Filtrona’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity 
of funding and flexibility. The Company is funded by a 
multi-currency syndicated facility from its bankers of £215.0m. 
The syndicated facility matures in May 2010. In addition, 
during the year, the Company put in place additional bilateral 
facilities totalling US$40.0m, which mature in November 2009. 
As at 31 December 2008, the available bank facilities totalled 
£242.8m, of which £198.1m was drawn down. In addition, 
uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to 
provide short-term flexibility.
Foreign currency risk 
The majority of Filtrona’s net assets are in currencies  
other than sterling. The Company’s normal policy is to  
limit the translation exposure and the resulting impact on 
shareholders’ funds by borrowing in those currencies in which 
the Group has significant net assets and by using forward 
foreign exchange contracts. However, in response to the 
significant weakening of sterling against particularly the US 
dollar and euro in the fourth quarter of 2008 and to reduce  
the effect of currency movements on the Group’s net debt, the 
Company temporarily suspended its normal policy, repaid 
substantially all of its US dollar and euro denominated 
financial liabilities and replaced them with sterling 
denominated debt. As a result, at 31 December 2008, 
Filtrona’s net assets were exposed to the impact of foreign 
currency translation.
The Company does not hedge the translation effect of 
exchange rate movements on the income statement.
The majority of Filtrona’s transactions are carried out in the 
functional currencies of its operations and so transaction 
exposure is limited. However, where they do occur, the 
Group’s policy is to hedge a percentage of the exposures  
over a period up to 15 months using forward foreign  
exchange contracts.

Management of Principal Risks
Business Review
The performance, both long-term and short-term, of 
Filtrona’s businesses can be impacted by any number 
of risks and uncertainties not all of which are within 
the Company’s control. Filtrona recognises that the 
ability to monitor, assess and respond to business 
risks can often provide competitive advantage and 
hence resources are carefully managed in this  
area. Filtrona has a risk management process in 
place which is designed to enable the operational 
businesses to identify, manage and mitigate  
strategic, operational and financial risk.
More details of the Company’s risk management 
processes are set out in the Corporate Governance 
Report on page 61.
Outlined below are the principal risks faced by 
Filtrona and its management response thereto. 
There may be other risks and uncertainties which 
are unknown to the Company or which may not be 
deemed material now but which could turn out to 
be material in the future.

Corporate Responsibility
Business Review
In response to the challenges presented by the 
requirements of operating in a global environment, 
Filtrona’s corporate behaviour is founded on the 
fundamental belief that it has a duty to act 
responsibly in seeking to balance the interests 
of internal and external stakeholders
Filtrona recognises the significance of environmental, social 
and governance matters and is committed to being a 
responsible corporate citizen in the workplace, marketplace, 
environment and community. The Company’s global 
operations extend across Europe, Asia and the Americas and 
the Company fulfils its responsibility to record, monitor and 
make publicly available, the potential impact of its activities.  
In pursuing its corporate strategy Filtrona’s aim is to always 
consider the implications of its actions on, and relationship 
with, the people and the environment with which it interacts 
and to take active steps to act responsibly and diligently in the 
management of those actions and relationships. 
In support of its business plans to drive long‑ term profitable 
growth, Filtrona’s corporate responsibility initiatives seek  
to maintain the support of its employees, customers and 
suppliers and assist in the sustainability of the environment 
and communities within which its international operations  
are conducted. The Company’s risk management processes 
include consideration of the potential impact of corporate 
responsibility issues on Filtrona’s performance. The 
Company’s investment decisions take into account as 
appropriate an evaluation of the potential consequences for 
its employees, customers and suppliers and the environment. 
Filtrona Values, which are set out on pages 8 to 9 of this 
Report, help establish the corporate responsibility framework 
within which the Company operates. These Values form the 
core of the Company’s adoption of the highest standards of 
business ethics and integrity that underpin its relationships 
with both internal and external stakeholders. Filtrona believes 
that the responsible winning culture developed with the 
adoption of these Values at each of its international sites adds 
value to the Company’s reputation and performance.
Filtrona is a member of the FTSE4Good Index which is 
designed to measure the performance of companies  
striving to meet globally recognised corporate responsibility 
standards and to facilitate investment in those companies 
where corporate responsibility issues are an influencing factor 
in an investor’s decision‑ making process. The FTSE4Good 
Committee annually reviews the members for continual 
compliance with the criteria as laid down by the Committee.

Workplace
Health and safety
Filtrona’s overriding commitment in the workplace is to the 
health and safety and welfare of its employees and all those 
who visit the Company’s operations. The Board provides 
health and safety leadership and the Chief Executive has 
primary responsibility for setting the fundamental health and 
safety objectives within which the detailed policies operate 
and for reviewing progress against those objectives.
The Company has designed procedures and developed  
a culture which aims for continuous improvement with the 
sharing of best practice in all areas of health and safety 
in addition to strict compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations. The degree of autonomy afforded to local 
management allows them to set the agenda best suited to 
the requirements of individual businesses, but subject always 
to the proper implementation of the core health and safety 
policies and principles which Filtrona has adopted. Health 
and safety considerations form an integral part of capital 
expenditure proposals, with businesses required to ensure 
that the risks of working with new equipment, substances  
or processes are properly evaluated and mitigated prior to 
approval and implementation. 
The Company aims to continuously improve its health and 
safety record and ongoing initiatives are designed to monitor, 
assess and drive performance. Investigations are carried  
out on all accidents that may have resulted in injury or near 
miss incidents. Improved reporting of near miss incidents  
has enhanced the Company’s ability to learn from potentially 
hazardous conditions and to prevent their reoccurrence. 
Businesses undertake extensive training programmes which 
are particularly focused on the key, or most frequent, risks in 
their operations. Training in risk assessment and root‑ cause 
analysis features strongly in health and safety management.
The group‑ wide internet based management reporting system 
facilitates an extensive programme of active monitoring that 
measures in detail exactly how successful the Company is in 
managing the safety of its workplaces at the individual site level. 
The Company believes that the visibility on relevant performance 
statistics provided by the system maintains the fundamental 
focus of management on all health and safety issues. 
The Filtrona Health, Safety and Environment Council (the 
‘FHSEC’) is an international group which includes senior 
operating management from all divisions. The FHSEC  
is responsible for reviewing the health, safety and 
environmental performance, developing appropriate 
standards and procedures and overseeing the Company’s 
internal health, safety and environment auditing process.
The Company manages occupational health by identifying key 
risk activities, undertaking health assessments and, where 
appropriate, implementing health surveillance programmes. 
The Company has achieved the Occupational Health & Safety 
Management Systems OHSAS 18001 for the majority of its 
principal manufacturing sites, excluding the recently acquired 
sites of Duraco and Lendell, both of which have been given, in 
accordance with Filtrona policy, a period of 24 months to reach 
the required standard. It is anticipated that the other remaining 
principal manufacturing sites which are not yet accredited to 
OHSAS 18001 will be reassessed during 2009.
The Company operates Filtrona Group Safety Awards whereby 
sites can achieve gold, silver and bronze status on the basis  
of annual performance assessed against stringent criteria set 
by the FHSEC. There are strict criteria governing these awards, 
based upon: OHSAS standard accreditation; regular health 
and safety meetings; availability of suitably trained employees 
on site; and levels of lost time accidents. For 2008 there were 
four gold awards (2007: nil), seven silver awards (2007: four) 
and seven bronze awards (2007: two). The criteria are 
designed to become increasingly stringent over time such  
that the level of performance required to qualify for an award 
requires continuous improvement to an increasingly high 
standard. The rise in the number of the awards in 2008 
compared to 2007 demonstrates the health and safety 
commitment and progress being made internationally  
across the Filtrona businesses. 36  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Corporate Responsibility
Business Review
Filtrona’s commitment to the growth of its employees as 
individuals, challenging them to fulfil their potential through 
investment in training and personal development, is 
fundamental to the recruitment, motivation and retention of 
people with the talent and energy to drive Filtrona’s growth  
as a profitable business. Filtrona’s training programmes  
are designed to secure continuous improvement, with the 
Company’s businesses benefiting from the increase in  
the capabilities of its employees.
Filtrona seeks to ensure that the training opportunities are 
extended beyond the simple development of skills focused  
on fulfilling a particular role within the current operations.
In addition to the impact of the training and development 
programmes, employee engagement is enhanced by the 
communication practices which have been adopted across 
the businesses. 
Filtrona values highly the commitment of its employees and 
recognises the importance of communication to good working 
relationships and practices. The Company seeks to ensure 
that employees are informed on matters relating to their 
employment and on financial and economic factors affecting 
the businesses. This is achieved through management 
briefings, internal announcements, the Filtrona website and by 
the distribution of public announcements. Various initiatives, 
including the use of regular newsletters detailing progress 
and key news across the divisions focus on the dissemination 
of important information and messages to employees.
The Company seeks feedback and ideas from employees to 
improve its operations and forums appropriate to Filtrona’s 
local businesses have been established to allow employees 
to voice their views on how the Company should fulfil the 
demands of all its local and international stakeholders. The 
Company’s European Information and Consultation Forum 
facilitates the discussion of issues across all of its operations 
in the European Union.
The Company recognises the importance of, and the benefits 
to be derived from, diversity across its global operations and 
is committed to offering equal opportunities to all people 
without discrimination of any form. Filtrona remunerates

Employees
Filtrona’s employees are a vital resource in the pursuit of 
operational excellence and the provision of quality products 
and service to its customers. The skills and expertise of 
Filtrona’s employees drive the innovation which enables the 
Company to provide added value to its customers, enhance 
supply chain logistics with its suppliers and reduce the 
environmental impact of its operations.
Filtrona is guided by its aim to deliver a competitive and fair 
employment environment and the opportunity to develop and

business opportunity. Filtrona encourages its employees to 
develop and manage their own careers. It facilitates this by 
providing relevant job training and, where appropriate, 
aiming to fill vacancies with existing staff where employees 
are suitably qualified and experienced.
The Chief Executive’s Health and Safety 
Award was won by Payne in Banbury. During 
the year, the site saw 365 days without  
a lost time accident and a 58% reduction 
in minor incidents. In support of those 
statistics, a variety of safety campaigns 
were initiated incorporating special training 
sessions for all employees, with two 
managers achieving relevant qualifications 
and an extension of health and safety 
into occupational and personal health  
for employees. 37  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

management in the workplace and the environment, and its 
ethical and responsible conduct in the marketplace. The

Filtrona’s challenge is to determine how, through current 
initiatives and current technology, and with further projects 
and future innovation, it can reduce the impact of its 
“ Renewable energy is used where 
available at competitive rates.  
All locations are examining and 
sharing energy efficiency initiatives 
– such as energy efficient motors 
for maintenance and new projects, 
replacing lighting with high 
efficiency units and installing 
motion sensor lights.”

Corporate Responsibility
Business Review
environmental footprint within a realistic financial framework 
and appropriate timeframe. This should be in a manner 
relevant to, and meaningful in, the context of the Company’s 
overall strategic objectives and financial performance. 
The risk management process has identified that climate 
change may be the single most important environmental 
constraint impacting on the future of its businesses. The 
management of the environmental impact of, the Company’s 
international operations are focused on methodologies to 
reduce that impact, and the development of initiatives to 
secure both economic and environmental benefits and 
sustainability. Filtrona continues to closely monitor the 
environmental impact of its operations. Significant 
improvement in data collection methods and increased 
reporting procedures, reinforce the accountability of the 
businesses for the consequences of their operations on the 
environment and drive the commitment to seek opportunities 
to make improvements which:
reduce the use of natural resources 
reduce direct and indirect emissions of carbon dioxide   
and other pollutants
reduce operating costs and improve operating margins  
and profitability
Filtrona seeks to ensure good environmental practice at all  
its locations and in its operational processes and investment 
decisions. Filtrona’s principal manufacturing sites are 
ISO 14001 accredited and all of the Company’s European 
businesses comply with EU and domestic waste management 
regulations. A range of initiatives are being undertaken to 
drive the efficiency of Filtrona’s energy consumption and the 
Company has developed bespoke software to monitor the 
effect of such projects, as well as identifying potential future 
opportunities for further improvements. Landfill is being 
reduced as local initiatives seek to recycle waste materials  
or explore alternative uses with third parties.
Due to the scale of Filtrona’s global operations, the use of 
energy has both environmental and commercial importance. 
Where possible, and financially viable, energy from renewable 
resources is utilised to limit environmental impact and 
commercial risk and costs.
Filtrona actively engages with its employees, customers, and 
suppliers to exploit opportunities offered by new technologies, 
improved process operations and new material to further 
reduce environmental impact and improve profitability. 
Supplier standards are subject to review by the Company 
employees who audit their environmental credentials.
Given the diverse range of products manufactured, sourced 
and distributed by the Group, emissions intensity and 
achievements alongside targeted reductions are measured 
on a site by site basis, with local management taking 
responsibility for performance. As Filtrona seeks to further 
drive its environmental performance, all divisions have been 
charged with providing realistic targets based on a common 
metric to enable a corporate declaration of targeted emission 
reduction during the period from 2009 to 2012.
Filtrona supports the activities of the Carbon Trust and during 
2008 participated in the 6th annual Carbon Disclosure Project 
(‘CDP’), an environmental impact survey. It is the Company’s 
intention to participate in the CDP survey during 2009.
During 2009, Filtrona will be piloting the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment (the ‘CRC’) which is a UK legal requirement and 
aims to cut carbon emissions from large non‑ energy intensive 
users in the private and public sectors by four million tonnes 
of CO
2
 by 2020 through mandatory emissions trading. CRC is 
designed to drive energy efficiency and carbon saving by 
giving organisations a financial incentive through emissions 
trading, combined with reputational incentives through 
publishing organisations’ performance in a league table. 
Initially the CRC will be focused on UK activity only but it is 
targeted for expansion globally.
Filtrona and a major supplier of tow, which 
is used in the manufacture of filters, held 
discussions regarding the environmental 
impact of packaging. Subsequently the 
cardboard packaging layers were reduced 
and the use of plastic banding was 
significantly reduced.
Filtrona plc operates a small head office 
team and, during 2008, a renewed focus was 
promoted to increase recycling. As a result 
Filtrona saved the equivalent of 848 kg of 
CO
2
 annualised. 39  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Given the diversity of Filtrona’s global operations, local 
management drive environmental performance based  
on divisional objectives set in accordance with Filtrona’s 
environmental policy. Copies of the policy can be found  
on the Company’s website www.filtrona.com. 
The FHSEC provides an opportunity to share best environmental 
practices and waste minimisation initiatives across all the 
Group sites and has established a Group award to recognise 
the best divisional project initiated in each calendar year which 
in its opinion delivered the most successful and innovative 
environmental improvement or initiative on a site that meets 
one or several of the following criteria:
reductions in emissions 
recycling of waste product 
waste reduction 
energy efficiency 
efficient use of raw material 
use of biodegradable materials 
 
Community
Filtrona’s commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen 
extends through to the support for appropriate non‑ political 
and non‑ sectarian projects across a range of organisations 
and charities. As an example, during the year, Filtrona plc part 
sponsored the purchase of a vehicle for use by Save the 
Children. It is hoped the vehicle will help the charity reach 
vulnerable children particularly for projects such as education 
and child protection. 
Regardless of regional or national boundaries the Company 
aims to support the creation of prosperous, educated, 
sustainable and healthy communities in the countries and 
cultures within which it operates. In its attempts to bring 
benefits back to those communities whose support provides a 
basis for Filtrona’s success, the Company has focused on 
education and enterprise, health and welfare and the 
environment. In pursuit of its aims within the community, the 
Company has developed targeted programmes for local 
communities, often involving commercial sponsorship and 
significant employee engagement through direct involvement 
or secondment.
Applying Filtrona’s principles
The Chief Executive is the Director with primary responsibility 
for the implementation and integration of Filtrona’s Corporate 
Responsibility across the Company. 
The Director of Group Human Resources, supported by the 
Company Secretary and General Counsel, is responsible for  
co‑ ordinating the operation of the detailed policies on human 
resources, health and safety, ethics and the environment  
which support Filtrona’s commitment to its Corporate 
Responsibility principles. 
Further details of those policies can be viewed via the 
Corporate Responsibility page on the Company’s website  
at www.filtrona.com.
The Group Environmental award was won 
by the Filter Products facility in Indonesia. 
A number of general energy efficiencies 
introduced during the year resulted in 
substantial reductions of energy 
consumption, particular initiatives saw; the 
recycling of approximately 1 tonne of 
waste per day to produce steam used  
in the manufacturing process to eliminate 
the need for purchasing 565,000 kWh of 
electricity per year; and the elimination of 
waste to landfill, thereby reducing traffic 
emissions and transport costs .
For 2008 and, beyond, Filtrona Indonesia based 
in Surabaya, introduced a ‘Get Involved’ 
community development day. 40 employees 
participated in the main activities of: painting 
and finishing a local school building; planting 
trees in the immediate area of the school; 
and practising first aid with the students.  
The objectives were to create awareness and 
actively develop the community. 40  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

Directors’ Report
for the year ended 31 December 2008
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of the Company will be held at the Holiday Inn Hotel, 500 Saxon Gate West, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire MK9 2HQ on 
Thursday 23 April 2009 at 12 noon.
In addition to the ordinary business of the AGM, resolutions in respect of the following matters of special business are included in the 
Notice of Annual General Meeting:
Authority to allot unissued shares
The Directors were granted authority at the last AGM held in 2008 to allot relevant securities up to a nominal amount of £17,138,516. That 
authority will apply until the conclusion of this year’s AGM. At this year’s AGM, shareholders will be asked to grant an authority to allot 
relevant securities: (i) up to a nominal amount of £17,138,516, and (ii) comprising equity securities up to a nominal amount of £34,277,032 
(after deducting from such limit any relevant securities allotted under (i), in connection with an offer by way of a rights issue, (the ‘section 
80 authority’), such section 80 authority to apply until the end of next year’s AGM (or, if earlier, until the close of business on 30 June 
2010). The proposal conforms to the guidelines issued by the institutional investment protection bodies to ensure that existing 
shareholders’ interests are safeguarded. The Directors have no present intention of exercising their authority to allot unissued shares, 
except those relating to share options.
Allotment of shares for cash
The Directors will, under Resolution 8 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, seek power until the next AGM to allot shares for cash, 
otherwise than in accordance with the statutory pre-emption rights, either in connection with a rights issue, or otherwise, up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of 5% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2008, equivalent to 10,966,340 shares. The proposal 
conforms to the guidelines issued by the institutional investment protection bodies to ensure that existing shareholders’ interests  
are safeguarded. 
Purchase of own shares
At the last AGM, held in 2008, the shareholders approved a special resolution to enable the Company to purchase its own shares. That 
approval will apply until the conclusion of this year’s AGM. At this year’s AGM, the Directors consider it expedient to seek shareholders’ 
approval to enable the Company to purchase its own shares. Accordingly, under Resolution 9 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, 
authority will be sought to enable the Company to make market purchases of up to 10% of the issued share capital at 25 February 2009 for 
the period of one year following the date of passing the Resolution. In accordance with the requirements of The Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority, the maximum price for shares purchased in the market shall not exceed an amount equal to 105% of the average middle 
market quotation taken from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days before the purchase is made. The 
minimum price per share shall be not less than 25p, being the nominal value of the shares. The Directors will only utilise this authority if 
satisfied that to do so will result in an increase in earnings per share and that it is in the best long-term interests of the shareholders. 
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares) Regulations 2003 (the ‘Regulations’) allow companies to hold shares 
acquired by way of market purchase in treasury, rather than having to cancel them. The Directors may use the authority to purchase 
shares and hold them in treasury (and subsequently sell or transfer them out of treasury as permitted in accordance with the Regulations) 
rather than cancel them, subject to institutional guidelines applicable at the time. No shares, were, purchased either by the Company nor 
were cancelled or transferred out of treasury during the year.
No dividends have been paid on shares whilst held in treasury and no voting rights attach to the treasury shares.

Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, 
the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and have elected to prepare its individual company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and applicable law.
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and 
performance of the Group. The Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant  
part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation. 
The parent company financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent company. 
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; •	
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; •	
for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU; •	
for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject  •	
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent •	
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, a Report of the Remuneration Committee and a Corporate 
Governance Report in compliance with applicable law and regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in  
other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the •	
assets, liabilities and financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and
the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and •	
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

Corporate Governance
Report of the Remuneration Committee
This report to shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2008 sets out the policies under which the Executive and Non-executive 
Directors are remunerated and tables of information showing details of the remuneration and share interests of the Directors.
As required by The Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’), this report will be subject to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). The Report is intended to be in full compliance with the requirements of the 
Regulations and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. KPMG Audit Plc have audited the contents of the Report to the extent 
required by the Regulations.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on remuneration policy as applied to Filtrona’s 
senior executives, including Executive Directors. 
Membership of the Remuneration Committee during the year consisted wholly of independent Non-executive Directors:
Paul Drechsler Chairman
Adrian Auer
Lars Emilson
The Company Secretary and General Counsel acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
The Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive and Director of Group Human Resources may, by invitation, attend the Remuneration 
Committee meetings, except when their own remuneration is discussed.
The terms of reference for the Committee, which are annually reviewed, can be found on the Company’s website www.filtrona.com.
Remuneration Committee processes
The Committee met four times during the year. Details of the attendance are shown in the Corporate Governance Report on page 58.
During the year the main items considered were:
a review of the remuneration for the Executive Directors and other senior executives •	
annual bonus structure, targets and payouts •	
2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) awards and vesting criteria attaching to them •	
assessment of individual performance for future LTIP awards •	
Advice
During the year, Filtrona’s Director of Group Human Resources was invited by the Remuneration Committee to provide views and advice. 
In addition, with the approval of the Remuneration Committee, the Company received services and advice from the following independent 
and expert consultants:
Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (’HNBSC’) who provided advice on the Company’s long-term share incentive plans  •	
and on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and other senior executives within the Company
Mercers Human Resource Consulting (‘Mercers’) who provided advice and information on pension matters •	
Neither HNBSC nor Mercers provides any other services to the Company except that Mercers provide actuarial services with respect  
to the UK pension schemes.
Remuneration policy
The Board as a whole establishes the remuneration policy. The Remuneration Committee determines and recommends to the Board  
the framework for the remuneration of the Executive Directors. The Chief Executive’s remuneration proposals for the members of the 
Executive Committee, and for other senior executives reporting directly to him, are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and 
recommendations are made to the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee also takes note of the remuneration policy as detailed by the Chief Executive in respect of other  
levels of management in the Company and makes such recommendations to the Chief Executive as the Remuneration Committee  
deems appropriate. 49  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
The remuneration of the Executive Directors and Chairman is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee and the remuneration 
of the Non-executive Directors is the responsibility of the Board as a whole. No Director is involved in determining or voting on their  
own remuneration.
In determining the policy for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee’s objective is to ensure that those individuals are 
provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner having regard  
to the performance of the Company, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration in a competitive form and amount to attract, retain and motivate high 
quality management. The importance of aligning the interests of Executive Directors and senior executives with shareholders is carefully 
considered, particularly in the design of the performance-related elements of their remuneration packages. 
Key developments
The following amendments to the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) were approved at the AGM held in April 2008, effective from 
1 January 2008 and were applied to the awards granted during the year:
The introduction of an earnings per share performance target to determine the level of vesting of half of the performance shares •	
granted under LTIP Part B, with the other half continuing to be subject to a total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance condition
The rules were amended to bring the treatment of awards in the event of a change in control in line with best practice •	
It was communicated to shareholders at the 2008 AGM that no further awards will be granted to Executive Directors under LTIP  
Part A. Instead the value of share options which would ordinarily have been granted under Part A to the Executive Directors will be 
replaced with grants of performance shares under LTIP Part B, worth up to 50% of salary.
During 2008, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration policy with particular regard to the impact of environmental, social 
and governance issues on executive remuneration within Filtrona. The conclusion of the review was that where personal objectives are 
set for the attainment of bonus awards these objectives, where appropriate having regard to the interests of internal and external 
shareholders, will contain an element of environmental, social and governance issues.
In consideration of the current economic climate and having regard to inflation levels the executive and senior management have  
been given a 3% pay increase with effect from 1 January 2009, which is in line with the average pay award being granted to the global 
workforce. An exception is for Steve Crummett, the Group Finance Director appointed in March 2008. At the time of Steve’s appointment 
his salary was deliberately set at the conservative end of market practices. To reflect his time in the role and performance since March 
2008, the Committee agreed that his salary level should be adjusted to competitive market levels and, accordingly, the Remuneration 
Committee approved a revised salary of £275,000 per annum effective from 1 January 2009.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the structure of the annual bonus scheme during 2008 and agreed that in future the annual 
bonus (of up to 100% of basic salary for Executive Directors) would contain three elements:
cash bonus related to: (i) an operating profit target (to be set on the basis of constant exchange rates and with reference to the •	
underlying earnings per share performance of the Company), accounting for up to 40% of any bonus; and (ii) personal objectives, 
accounting for up to 10% of any bonus
Deferred Annual Share Bonus – provided as a match for the aggregate of the cash and personal objectives elements and deferred  •	
for three years
The Committee believe that this structure better allows them to incentivise and influence management actions.
The Remuneration Committee has recently further refined annual bonus arrangements for 2009 and adopted the following framework  
of principles:
Where targets are set below prior year’s adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’) (on a constant currency basis) the quantum of bonus •	
payable for: (i) Operating Profit and personal objectives elements will be reduced by the same percentage as the reduction in EPS;  
and (ii) Deferred annual share bonus will be reduced and will only be granted where Filtrona plc share price has outperformed the 
FTSE 250 Index by at least 5%
Where performance is equal to or above prior year EPS (on a constant currency basis) cash bonus and deferred share bonus awards •	
will continue to be made at the normal quantum
The Committee believes that this framework provides a reasonable incentive structure for management in the current economic 
environment, whilst protecting shareholders’ interests. 50  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

The Remuneration Committee structures senior executive remuneration in two distinct parts: fixed remuneration of basic salary,  
pension and benefits; and variable performance-related remuneration in the form of cash and deferred share bonuses and long-term 
incentive arrangements.
Remuneration for Executive Directors is structured so that the variable (performance-related) pay element forms a significant portion of 
each Director’s package and that the majority of Executive Directors’ total remuneration at the maximum performance level will derive 
from the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements, which are strongly aligned to the Company’s strategic objective to secure 
long-term shareholder value creation.

Salary
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the roles, responsibilities, 
performance and experience of the individual and pay awards and conditions elsewhere in the Company. Salaries are reviewed annually 
with any increase being effective from 1 January (unless responsibilities change). Salary levels are determined taking into account market 
data on salary levels for similar positions at comparable companies. A review of salary levels was undertaken in December 2008. In line 
with average pay awards across the Group, Mark Harper was awarded an increase of 3%. At the time of Steve Crummett’s appointment 
his salary was deliberately set at the conservative end of market practices. To reflect his time in the role and performance since March 
2008 the Committee agreed that his salary level should be adjusted to competitive market levels and, accordingly, the Remuneration 
Committee approved a revised salary of £275,000 per annum effective from 1 January 2009.

Annual bonuses
Under the terms of the annual bonus arrangements for 2008, Mark Harper and Steve Crummett were each potentially entitled to a 
maximum bonus of up to 100% of basic salary (50% in cash and 50% in shares in the Company, the entitlement to such shares being 
deferred for three years, in accordance with the rules of the DASB).
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the performance targets were approved by the Remuneration Committee and based upon 
Filtrona’s adjusted earnings per share. Company performance was required to reach a minimum threshold adjusted EPS target for a 
bonus of 30% of basic salary to be payable (15% in cash and 15% in deferred shares under the DASB).
For the year ended 31 December 2008, having matched the target performance of adjusted EPS of 18.6p the Remuneration Committee 
approved a bonus of 50% of basic salary for each of the Executive Directors (25% in cash and 25% in shares under the DASB). When 
assessing the approval of the bonus awards, the Remuneration Committee carefully considered the impact of certain exceptional items 
upon the Company’s earnings per share performance and had regard to the interests of the shareholders. 52  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan 
The DASB provides for Executive Directors and nominated senior executives to receive existing issued ordinary shares in the Company 
for nil payment. The number of shares subject to an award is determined at the time the award is granted, based upon the performance 
in the Filtrona’s preceding financial year of the participant and/or the Company and/or the division in which the participant worked.
Under the rules of the DASB the aggregate value of shares made subject to awards granted to a participant in any one financial year may 
not exceed 100% of their basic salary as at the award date. The Remuneration Committee has determined that, in accordance with the 
Company’s bonus arrangements, awards under DASB will not normally exceed 50% of basic salary.
Shares awarded under the DASB are held in trust until 1 March in the third calendar year after the year in which the award was made, or 
such other date as the Company may determine is reasonably practicable, at which point they are transferred to the participant subject to 
the participant’s continued employment within the Group. 
Details of the awards granted to the Executive Directors under the DASB in 2008 are shown in the table on page 53.
Executive LTIP share-based incentive plans
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that offering Executive Directors and nominated senior executives the opportunity to be 
awarded shares in the Company is an important part of motivating, rewarding and retaining key employees so that they may drive and 
participate in the future growth of the Company. It is also of the view that the Executive Directors and nominated senior executives should 
be encouraged to invest directly in the Company through the purchase of shares. The Company’s DASB and LTIP are both intended to 
support these objectives.
On the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Company has adopted shareholding guidelines for both Executive 
Directors and nominated senior executives. The guidelines are such that Executive Directors should hold shares to the value of 100%  
of their basic salary within 5 years of the recommendation being adopted or the date of their appointment (whichever is the later).  
Details of the shareholdings held by the Executive Directors are disclosed on page 56.
The award of shares or options under the executive share-based incentive plans is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking 
into account, inter alia, the role of the individual, and other such criteria as they may determine from time to time. The current policy is that 
participation in the DASB and LTIP Part B is restricted to Executive Directors and nominated senior executives. Since 2008 Executive 
Directors and such nominated senior executives will receive no further awards under LTIP Part A. Thereafter participation, in LTIP Part A, 
has been limited to other designated employees. 
Awards under the Company’s share-based incentive plans will be satisfied using market purchases, new issue shares and/or shares held 
in treasury.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan – Part B
A performance share award under LTIP Part B consists of a conditional right to receive shares in the Company, subject to performance 
conditions, on the basis described below. Participants make no payment for the grant and exercise of performance share awards.
Participants may receive performance share awards over shares worth up to two times their basic salary in any financial year.
In June 2005, following the demerger, the Executive Directors and nominated senior executives were granted a one-off matching share 
award linked to their investment in the Company’s shares. During the year the matching shares awarded in June 2005 lapsed, due to the 
performance targets not being met.
A performance share award, will not normally be exercisable before the third anniversary of its award and may only be exercised to the 
extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied. The awards are structured as nil cost options. For employees 
based outside the US, the options remain capable of being exercised up to the sixth anniversary of grant. For employees based in the 
US, once the performance conditions have been satisfied the options must be exercised within 30 days of vesting.
For awards granted prior to 2008, the extent to which performance share awards vest is subject to the Company’s TSR performance 
over a fixed three year period relative to the TSR performance of the FTSE 250 companies (excluding investment trusts) at the start of the 
three year performance period. Identical conditions were attached to the matching share awards.
Performance share awards will vest in full only if the Company’s TSR performance is ranked at upper quartile or above within the peer 
group over the performance period. For median performance one quarter of such awards vests, rising proportionally up to full vesting 
thereafter. For below median performance, no such awards will vest. 
The performance condition will be tested after three years and there is no provision for retesting. To the extent the performance condition 
has not been met after three years, the relevant awards will lapse. 
Corporate Governance
Report of the Remuneration Committee 53  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
For awards granted in 2008, and beyond, 50% of the awards will be subject to a TSR performance condition (as set out above) and 50% 
of the awards will be subject to an adjusted EPS performance condition. The adjusted EPS performance condition for these awards will 
require the Company’s earnings per share growth (adjusted to exclude items which did not reflect the Company’s underlying financial 
performance and intangible amortisation) relative to inflation over three financial years to exceed inflation by an average of at least 3% per 
annum for 12.5% of the awards to vest. The proportion of the awards vesting will increase on a straight-line basis and for 50% of the 
awards to vest such adjusted EPS growth must exceed inflation by an average of at least 8% per annum. The performance condition will 
be tested after three financial years and there will be no provision for retesting. To the extent the performance condition has not been met 
after three financial years, the relevant awards will lapse.
The Remuneration Committee will review the performance conditions each time performance share awards are granted under  
LTIP Part B in order to ensure that they remain challenging and may impose different conditions on share awards granted in 
subsequent years. 
Details of the awards granted and outstanding during the year to the Executive Directors under the LTIP Part B and DASB are as follows:

A total of 1,841,949 (2007: 771,814) share incentive awards were granted to Executive Directors and nominated senior executives under 
the LTIP Part B and the DASB during the year ended 31 December 2008.
The middle market price of an ordinary share in the Company on 31 December 2008 was 136.75p. The middle market price of an 
ordinary share in the Company during the year ranged from 110.00p to 224.75p.
The remaining awards granted in 2006 and 2007 under LTIP Part B are subject to relative TSR performance targets. At the end of 2008 
the awards granted in 2006 were ranked below median and the performance targets had not been met. If the performance targets are 
not met, the shares subject to those awards will not vest. For the awards granted in 2007 Filtrona is ranked between the median and 
upper quartile of the comparator group, which would indicate a vesting of 48.88% of options awarded.
The position may change depending on the Company’s performance as at the date of the relevant third anniversary.
During the year LTIP Part B ‘Performance’ options awarded in June 2005 lapsed due to the performance targets not being met.
Long-Term Incentive Plan – Part A
The LTIP Part A provides for participants to receive share option awards over shares worth up to two times basic salary or £250,000 
(whichever is the greatest) in any financial year, subject to performance conditions. 
In accordance with the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee, Executive Directors and nominated senior executives are  
no longer receiving LTIP Part A share option awards (the last awards having been granted in 2007). Awards will continue to be made to 
other participants and the exercise price set equal to the share price at the date of the grant.  54  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

During 2008 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the criteria being applied when quantifying the level of individual awards being 
granted. As a result the Committee has recommended that further emphasis be placed on the participant’s contribution relative to the  
part of the Group in which they work in contrast to current performance of the Company as a whole.
A share option award will normally be exercisable between three and ten years following its grant, but only if the specified performance 
condition has been satisfied.
The performance conditions attached to previous LTIP Part A awards were based on the Company’s earnings per share growth (adjusted 
to exclude items which did not reflect the Company’s underlying financial performance and intangible amortisation) relative to inflation 
over three financial years, requiring such earnings per share growth to exceed inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum. The 
performance condition will be tested after three financial years and there will be no provision for retesting. To the extent the performance 
condition has not been met after three financial years, the relevant share option awards will lapse.
Save As You Earn scheme 
In addition to the LTIP, the Company operates a Save As You Earn share option scheme (‘SAYE’). During the year, the Company made its 
third award under the rules of the SAYE.
The Company has decided not to launch an SAYE award during 2009.
Mark Harper joined the SAYE in 2006 and Steve Crummett joined the SAYE in 2008 with both contributing the statutory maximum 
monthly amount of £250. Consequently neither are currently eligible to participate in any further invitations.
Details of the awards granted and outstanding during the year, to Executive Directors under the LTIP Part A and the SAYE are as follows:

Report of the Remuneration Committee 55  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Executive Directors’ service contracts
The policy for senior executive service contracts is that notice periods will normally not exceed 12 months. Mark Harper has a service 
contract dated 12 May 2005 and Steve Crummett has a service contract dated 19 March 2008, both with a notice period of 12 months 
from either party. The service contracts for the Executive Directors are available for inspection by members at each AGM and during 
normal business hours at the Company’s registered office.
The Remuneration Committee’s policy in relation to termination of service contracts is to apply an appropriate level of mitigation, having 
regard to all of the circumstances of the individual and the termination of employment, and to any legal advice received. The Company 
has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice and any such payment may be made in monthly instalments at the Company’s discretion 
and may be reduced to take into account any sums earned during the payment period by way of employment elsewhere.
Non-executive Directors
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts and do not participate in any Company pension, share or incentive scheme.  
In accordance with best practice, letters of appointment have been issued for all Non-executive Directors for an initial period of three 
years. These letters are available for inspection by members at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Company’s  
registered office.
Fees for the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration Committee. Fees for Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman,  
are approved by the Board in to accordance with the policy adopted by the Remuneration Committee, and are based on a standard 
fee, with additional fees payable to the Senior Independent Non-executive Director and for the chairing of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. The fees are set taking into account current market practice and the responsibilities and time commitment involved in the 
role. The fees were reviewed in December 2008 for the first time since December 2006. The fees will be subject to a further review in 
December 2009 in accordance with the policy for the remuneration of Non-executive Directors adopted by the Board.

1 For Mark Harper the accrued pension at 31 December 2008 is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on the assumption that service terminated at  
the year end. For Steve Dryden the accrued pension at 31 December 2008 is calculated based on the actual date that his service terminated, 31 March 2008
2 The value of the accrued pension is calculated on the current transfer value basis applicable to the FSPS and the FPP as appropriate and is not the actual cost of providing  
the pension
3 The change in the value of the accrued pension during the year includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company.  
It is calculated in accordance with current legislation and is after the deduction of the Executive Directors’ contributions during the year
Steve Dryden’s departure from the FPP did not materially affect the plan.
Outside appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to accept up to two appropriate non-executive directorships offered by listed companies and other 
organisations, which provide industry experience or public service. Such outside appointments are subject to prior Board approval, 
taking into account existing duties or potential conflicts of interest. Mark Harper is a non-executive director of BBA Aviation plc and retains 
his fees of £50,000 per annum.

by the Filtrona Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) as they are, together with other Filtrona employees, potential beneficiaries of the EBT. 
These shares are held in order to satisfy employee entitlements relating to the Company’s share plans. 
As at 31 December 2008, dilution through employee related share plans totalled 4.08% which is well below UK institutional shareholder 
limits of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital.

Corporate Governance
Report of the Remuneration Committee 57  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report
Filtrona is committed to high standards of corporate governance, corporate responsibility and risk management throughout the 
Company. The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for the standards of governance which are maintained across 
Filtrona’s diverse range of international businesses.
Compliance with the Combined Code
As a listed company, Filtrona confirms that throughout the year ended 31 December 2008 the Company has complied with the 2006 
version of the Combined Code of Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council (the ‘Code’). 
The Company applies the Code’s principles of openness, integrity and accountability through its own behaviour, by monitoring corporate 
governance best practice and by adopting appropriate recommendations of relevant professional bodies. The policies and procedures 
adopted by the Board and applicable to the Filtrona businesses are documented in a manual which sets out the roles and delegated 
authorities applying to the Board, the Executive Committee and the businesses. This manual is updated whenever necessary.
Board of Directors
The Board is collectively committed to promoting the success and strategic direction of the Company. The Board provides 
entrepreneurial leadership and stewardship to the businesses and management and takes responsibility for the strategic direction  
of the Company by the implementation and maintenance of its core values and governance controls. 
The Board is of the view that it has a highly competent Chairman and that the people on the Board and executive teams are well 
equipped to drive, and capable of delivering on, the Company’s strategy, proper and effective communication to employees, 
shareholders and other stakeholders, and the maintenance of effective controls for performance measurement controls and risk 
management systems.
The Board has adopted a schedule of matters which are required to be reviewed by it, including:
group strategy •	
approval of annual and half year results, and interim quarterly statements •	
annual budgets •	
treasury policies •	
major capital and operating expenditure proposals, acquisitions and disposals •	
health, safety and environmental policies •	
appointments to the Board •	
system of internal control •	
dividend policy •	
The Board reviews the schedule of reserved matters annually and during 2008 concluded that the level of authorities delegated  
to the Executive Committee and the individual businesses remained appropriate within the overall control environment maintained  
by the Company. 
Other specific responsibilities are delegated to the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees which operate within clearly  
defined terms of reference approved by the Board and available on the website www.filtrona.com. These Committees report regularly  
to the Board. 
 
During the year, there were eight scheduled Board meetings, together with an additional day of strategy discussions. In addition to the 
scheduled formal meetings, the Board met on an ad hoc basis as required for particular matters. The Chairman and Chief Executive 
maintain regular contact with the Directors and the Chairman also holds periodic informal discussions with the Non-executive Directors, 
without any of the Executive Directors being present, to review performance and monitor corporate control mechanisms.
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary and General Counsel, sets the programme for the Board during the year. At 
each scheduled meeting, the Board considers a report from the Chief Executive on health and safety performance and current trading,  
a financial review from the Group Finance Director and other significant business issues such as acquisition proposals, other major 
investment plans, shareholder feedback, pension scheme liabilities, succession planning, and environmental performance. Additionally, 
the Board receives presentations and considers reports from senior management about matters of material importance to the Company. 
Board meetings are structured to allow open discussion and all Directors participate in determining the Group’s strategy and regularly 
reviewing the trading and financial performance of the Company.
The internal procedures implemented by the Company to ensure the Board maintains overall control for all material strategic, financial, 
operational and compliance matters affecting the Company are included within the internal control section of this Report set out on  
page 61.
Composition of the Board
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separately held and are so defined as to ensure a clear separation of 
responsibilities. The Chairman leads the Board and ensures its effectiveness. The Chief Executive is responsible for the executive 
management and performance of Filtrona’s operations. 58  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
In the opinion of the Board, Paul Drechsler, Adrian Auer and Lars Emilson are each considered to be independent of management  
as detailed in the Code and there are no relationships or circumstances which would materially interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgement. 
The Board considers that the Non-executive Directors provide an independent view in Board discussions and the development of the 
Company’s strategy. Non-executive Directors also ensure a sound basis for good corporate governance for the Company, challenging 
management’s performance and, in conjunction with the Executive Directors, ensuring that rigorous financial controls and systems of risk 
management are maintained as appropriate to the needs of the businesses within Filtrona. 
The Board is content that the Non-executive Directors devote sufficient time to the business of Filtrona.
The letters of appointment for Non-executive Directors are available for review at the Company’s registered office and prior to the Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’).
Paul Drechsler acts as the Senior Independent Non-executive Director. In that role he is available to shareholders to discuss and develop 
an understanding of their issues and any concerns which cannot be resolved by discussions with the Chairman, the Chief Executive or 
Group Finance Director or where such contact is inappropriate.
 
The Articles of Association of the Company require one third of the Directors to retire from office each year and for all Directors to submit 
themselves for re-election on a date which is no more than three years from the date of their appointment or last re-appointment. The 
Directors retiring at the forthcoming AGM and submitting themselves for re-appointment are Jeff Harris and Steve Crummett.
Following the Board performance evaluation undertaken during the financial year, the Board is satisfied that each of the Directors being 
put forward for re-election, continue to be effective and that their ongoing commitment to the role is undiminished.
The following were Directors of the Company during the year and attended the following number of meetings during the year ended 
31 December 2008:

Information and professional development
The Chairman with the Company Secretary and General Counsel takes responsibility for ensuring that the Directors receive accurate, 
timely and clear information. The agenda for each Board and Committee meeting is considered by the relevant Chairman and papers for 
each scheduled formal Board and Committee meeting are usually provided five clear working days beforehand. In addition, the Chairman 
maintains regular contact with the Executive Directors to discuss current trading and financial performance and other specific issues 
which may arise from time to time.
On appointment, Directors benefit from an induction programme tailored to their individual needs and designed to assist them in their 
understanding of Filtrona and its operations. The programme, which continues throughout a Director’s tenure as necessary, includes 
details of fiduciary duties, Companies Act requirements, dealing restrictions as outlined in the Disclosure Rules and the Model Code on 
directors’ dealings in securities contained in the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, Board and business related matters, 
meetings with senior management, site visits and the opportunity to meet with major shareholders. 
Directors are free to meet individual members of the senior management team and have done so during the year under review.
The Board and its Committees receive briefings on legislative and regulatory developments and new accounting requirements as 
appropriate and believe that, given the experience and skills of its Directors, the identification of general training needs is best left  
to their individual discretion.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and General Counsel who is responsible to the Chairman 
for ensuring that Board procedures are complied with and that applicable rules and regulations are followed. During the year under review 
the Company Secretary and General Counsel’s advice was sought in relation to share dealings. In furtherance of their duties, there are 
Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report 59  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
agreed procedures for the Directors to take independent professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense. No Director took 
independent professional advice during the year.
Performance evaluation 
In the two previous years since the Company’s listing on the London Stock Exchange in June 2005, an annual evaluation of the Board’s 
performance has been undertaken with an internal exercise led by the Company Secretary and General Counsel with the Chairman 
through the use of questionnaires supplied by an external organisation.
This year, to ensure the process remained relevant and challenging, an external facilitator was used to conduct individual interviews with 
each Director, and a number of senior managers who have regular contact with the Board. It was believed that this approach would 
enable the process to deal effectively with not only the procedural and administrative elements of how the Board operates but also some 
of the behavioural aspects of performance. The external facilitator also attended a Board meeting as an observer.
An independent report (the ‘Board Evaluation’) was prepared and presented to the Board and the relevant committees for discussion. 
The review found that the Board continues to operate effectively, but concluded that additional benefits could be derived from the Board 
enhancing the clarity of its focus on the key challenges facing the Group and improving its connection with the senior management  
team. Following the recommendations made within the Board Evaluation, the Board has taken steps to improve the management and 
communication of its priorities and objectives, both within and outside the Boardroom. As a result the Board believes that it is better able 
to facilitate open structured debate with the senior management team, including the respective heads of Filtrona’s five divisions, which 
respects the challenges being faced by the Company and seeks to identify the key actions required to deliver the strategic objectives  
of the Group. 
As part of the 2008 Board performance evaluation, the Chairman reviewed the performance of each of the individual Directors and the 
Directors (led by the Senior Independent Non-executive Director) also appraised the Chairman’s performance without the Chairman being 
present. During the year the Non-executive Directors met without the Chairman present, under the direction of the Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director to appraise the Chairman’s performance, having first sought the views of the Executive Directors. In addition, the 
Chairman held a private meeting with the Non-executive Directors to assess the performance of the Chief Executive.
The Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committee each also had an evaluation on their work and effectiveness. The results were 
reported to the Board by the respective Chairmen. The reviews concluded that each Committee was operating effectively.
Insurance
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, and to the extent permitted by the laws of England and Wales, the Directors 
are granted an indemnity from the Company in respect of those liabilities incurred as a result of their office. In respect of those matters for 
which the Directors may not be indemnified, the Company maintained a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy throughout the 
year. It is anticipated this policy will be renewed. Neither the Company’s indemnity nor the insurance provides cover to the extent that the 
Director is proven to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently.
Board committees
Each Board committee has established clear and defined terms of reference detailing their responsibilities and powers. The terms of 
reference for each Board Committee are reviewed annually and are available on Filtrona’s website at www.filtrona.com.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee currently comprises Adrian Auer, who chairs the Committee, Paul Drechsler and Lars Emilson. 
The Board is satisfied that Adrian Auer has recent and relevant financial experience. 
A representative of the Company’s external auditor ordinarily attends all meetings of the Audit Committee and the Group Finance Director 
and Group Head of Audit are normally invited to attend the meetings.
The Audit Committee met four times during the year and maintains a formal calendar of items that are to be considered by the Committee 
during the year. The timetable of these items are scheduled in accordance with the annual audit cycle.
During the year the Committee undertook the following work:
Examined the full year financial statements and half year results, reviewing, challenging and approving the accounting policies, •	
financial reporting issues and the judgement of the financial management
Reviewed and considered reports from the Group Head of Audit including any issues relating to internal controls and the status of •	
actions taken in response to any identified concerns
Reviewed the performance of the internal audit function •	
Reviewed the risk management processes including changes to the Risk Management Committee, and considered the key risks •	
arising from the Company’s activities and the response of senior management to those challenges 60  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Reviewed the progress made by the Company in its tax planning •	
Reviewed the Company’s whistleblowing policy to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place for the proportionate and •	
independent investigation and follow-up action of any concerns raised by employees in relation to financial reporting or other matters
Assessed the qualifications, expertise, resources and independence of the external auditor and the effectiveness of the audit process. •	
The conclusion enabled the Board to endorse the recommendation of the auditors put to the shareholders at the April 2008 AGM
Reviewed and approved, as appropriate in accordance with the Committee’s policy, proposals for the engagement of the external •	
auditor for non-audit services
Evaluated its own performance as part of the Board Evaluation and reviewed its terms of reference to ensure that they remained •	
appropriate for the needs of the Company
The Audit Committee has a policy regarding the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services. The policy recognises 
the importance of maintaining the objectivity and independence of the external auditor by minimising its involvement in projects of a 
non-audit nature. It is, however, also acknowledged that, due to its detailed understanding of the Company’s business, it may sometimes 
be necessary to involve the external auditor in non-audit related work, principally comprising further assurance services relating to due 
diligence and other duties carried out in respect of acquisitions, disposals and tax services.
The Audit Committee meets with the external auditor without the Company management being present and conducts an annual 
assessment of the performance of the external audit and the Company’s internal audit function.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee currently comprises Jeff Harris, who chairs the Committee, Paul Drechsler, Adrian Auer and Lars Emilson. 
The Chief Executive attends by invitation as appropriate. 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for selecting and recommending candidates for appointment as Executive and Non-executive 
Directors of the Company. The Nomination Committee is also responsible for conducting an annual review of the register of notified 
interests, and any new interests, in accordance with the Company’s conflicts of interest policy. The Nomination Committee meets as 
required and during 2008 it met three times.
In furtherance of these duties and when considering succession planning, the Nomination Committee looks at the balance, structure and 
composition of the Board and takes into account the future challenges and opportunities facing the Company. The selection process is, 
in the Board’s view, both rigorous and transparent in order to ensure that appointments are made on merit and against objective criteria 
set by the Nomination Committee.
With the benefit of assistance from external advisers, the Nomination Committee made a recommendation to the Board regarding  
the appointment of Steve Crummett to the Board in March 2008. The Nomination Committee made recommendations to the Board  
for the reappointment of Jeff Harris as Non-executive Chairman and Paul Drechsler and Adrian Auer as Non-executive Directors  
following the expiry of their initial three year term of appointment in May 2008. The Nomination Committee is engaged in the process  
for the recruitment of a new Non-executive Director following the notification of Adrian Auer’s resignation.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises Paul Drechsler, who chairs the Committee, Adrian Auer and Lars Emilson. The 
composition and role of the Remuneration Committee is described more fully in the Report of the Remuneration Committee on pages  
48 to 56.
Shareholder communications
The Company communicates regularly with its major institutional shareholders and ensures that all the Directors, including the  
Non-executive Directors, have an understanding of the views and concerns of major shareholders and are able to explain business 
developments and financial results as appropriate. The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director have primary responsibility for 
investor relations. Presentations for analysts and institutional shareholders were held during the year and meeting were held with key 
institutional investors to discuss strategy, financial performance and investment activities. Slide presentations, made to institutional 
shareholders immediately after the full year and half year results are also available on the Company’s website www.filtrona.com to view 
and download.
All shareholders have the opportunity to meet any of the Directors of the Company should they so wish. 
Feedback from meetings with shareholders is provided to the Board to enable them to gain a balanced understanding of the issues and 
concerns of major shareholders.
Additionally, the Board uses the AGM as an occasion to communicate with all shareholders, including private investors, who are provided 
with the opportunity to question the Directors. 
At the AGM the level of proxy votes lodged on each resolution will be made available, both at the meeting and subsequently on the 
Company’s website. Each substantially separate issue is presented as a separate resolution and the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees are available to answer questions from shareholders.
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting and related papers will be posted to shareholders more than 20 working days before the AGM.
Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report 61  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Internal control
In accordance with the Code, the Board acknowledges its responsibility to ensure that an adequate system of internal controls is in place.
Filtrona’s internal systems and controls are designed to safeguard the Company’s assets and to ensure the integrity and reliability of 
information used both within the businesses and for public announcements. The Board has overall responsibility for the Company’s 
system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of this system. Such a system can only be designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can therefore only provide reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Operational matters and the responsibility for the day-to-day management of the businesses are delegated to the Chief Executive 
supported by the Executive Committee and to the respective Divisional Managing Directors or Presidents as appropriate within delegated 
authority limits and in accordance with clearly defined systems of control.
The Executive Committee, which meets at least twice per month, is made up of the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the 
Company Secretary and General Counsel and the Director of Group Human Resources. All Directors receive copies of the minutes from 
each Executive Committee meeting and the monthly reports submitted by the individual business divisions. 
Following one of the recommendations made during the 2008 Board Evaluation the Company established a Group Operating Committee 
(the ‘GOC’) which superseded the Global Executive. The GOC consists of the Executive Committee members and the Divisional 
Managing Directors or Presidents, as appropriate. The GOC meets monthly to discuss health and safety performance, risk management, 
business performance, employee-related matters, including succession planning, and key operational and financial management issues 
across Filtrona’s international businesses. Biographies of the GOC members demonstrating the range of management expertise within 
the Company’s senior executive team appear on pages 40 to 41. 
In accordance with one of the other recommendations arising out of the Board Evaluation, the members of the GOC will be participating 
in a leadership development programme in conjunction with an external service provider. This programme is intended to support the 
GOC team in planning their individual development in alignment with the delivery of Filtrona’s strategic objectives and should serve to 
provide Non-executive Directors with further visibility on the skills and resources available within the GOC and how they function together. 
Policies and procedures, which are subject to ongoing review and updated as required, are communicated across the Company and 
designed to ensure significant risks, investment decisions and management issues are identified, considered and escalated as necessary 
at the earliest opportunity. Divisional Managing Directors and Presidents are responsible for ensuring the communication of and 
compliance with Filtrona’s internal controls across their respective divisions.
The Board believe that this management structure ensures a strong link between Filtrona’s overall corporate strategy and its 
implementation within an effective control environment.
Control of significant risks
The Board is of the view that a rigorous ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Company 
was in place throughout 2008 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report 2008. This process is regularly reviewed by the Board 
with the assistance of the Audit Committee and accords with the internal control guidance for Directors as required by the Code.
A Risk Management Committee (‘RMC’), which during 2008 consisted of the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and General 
Counsel, the Director of Group Human Resources, the Group Head of Audit and the Head of Tax and Treasury, meets at least four times 
each year and otherwise as necessary. All Directors receive copies of the minutes from each RMC meeting.
During the course of the year, the Company Secretary and General Counsel was appointed Chairman of the RMC as the Company took 
steps to ensure its internal control mechanisms incorporated an appropriate separation of powers and division of responsibilities, 
particularly in relation to financial management and reporting issues. 
The RMC enhances management’s ability to review and monitor the effectiveness of risk control on a regular basis. The terms of 
reference of the RMC include supporting corporate governance requirements, recommending business risk strategy and developing 
policies and procedures for risk management and internal controls. They also include the monitoring of the effectiveness of internal 
controls and the design of processes to test the effectiveness of controls. During 2008, the RMC implemented changes to refresh the 
Company’s approach to risk management and to assist in the recognition of, and response to, new and emerging risks in the light of 
challenging trading conditions and recessionary trends.
Risk review is a continuing process embedded within the businesses with divisional executives required to include risk management on 
agendas for their regular management meetings and to report to the RMC on actions taken to review the effectiveness of their controls. 
Businesses are also required to have processes to formally identify risks, consider their financial and non-financial implications and, so  
far as possible, take action to reduce those risks. The process includes the maintenance of a register for identifying and evaluating the 
Group’s significant risks and the related financial, operational and compliance controls. The Audit Committee reviews the identified key 
risks, changes in their status or the composition of the risk matrix regularly. 62  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
The RMC also reviews the environmental, social and employee issues prevalent within the Group when considering its risk  
management processes.
The Company has an internal audit department. The resources of this department are augmented with independent expert external 
resources wherever necessary to review risk and monitor compliance with the Company’s policies and procedures across its international 
operations. Accordingly the resources of the department, together with the additional available resources, are considered adequate.
The Audit Committee regularly reviews the effectiveness of internal controls based on the processes implemented by the Executive 
Committee and the RMC. At each meeting the Audit Committee receives a presentation from the Group Head of Audit and the Chairman 
of the RMC on the steps taken to identify and reduce risks and actions designed to increase the awareness of both risk management and 
the importance of having effective internal controls across the businesses.
Certain specific administrative functions are controlled centrally by the Company. Taxation, treasury and insurance functions report to the 
Board via the Group Finance Director. The legal and governance compliance functions report to the Board via the Company Secretary 
and General Counsel, whilst the Chief Executive, supported by the Director of Group Human Resources and the Company Secretary and 
General Counsel, reports to the Board on corporate responsibility issues. Policies and processes are in place to ensure that the activities 
undertaken in relation to all such matters are designed to reduce the risk profile of the Company. 
The Company operates a comprehensive budgeting and financial reporting system. Annual budgets are reviewed and approved at both 
divisional and corporate level. This process includes the analysis of significant risks relating to market trends and operational 
performance. Monthly performance is reported against budget and the prior year and forecasts are updated as appropriate. Monthly 
management accounts analyse and explain variances and report on performance indicators, with detailed explanations for variances and 
movements on updated forecasts being reviewed by the Board. 
The Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee review the arrangements by which employees of the Company may, in 
confidence, raise concerns about financial reporting or other matters in accordance with the Company’s whistleblowing policy.
 
Financial reporting
The Directors have acknowledged, in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 47, their responsibility for preparing the 
financial statements of the Company and the Group. The external auditor has included, in the Independent Auditor’s Report set out on 
pages 99 to 100, a statement about their reporting responsibilities.
The Directors are also responsible for the publication of unaudited quarterly interim management statements and half year results as 
required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Services Authority providing an explanation of material events and 
transactions that have taken place during the relevant period and their impact on the financial position of the Company and the Group 
and a general description of the financial position and performance of the Company and the Group during the relevant period.
Going concern
Information on the business environment Filtrona operates in, including factors likely to affect its future development, is included in the 
Business Review on pages 10 to 39.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 30 to 31. In addition, note 1 to the Financial Statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and exposures to credit, market 
and liquidity risk. Cash balances and borrowings are included in note 21 to the financial statements.
As highlighted in note 1, the Group’s financing facility of £215 million matures in May 2010. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
into account reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its 
current financing facility. In addition, the Group has opened negotiations with certain banks regarding future borrowing facilities and no 
matters have been drawn to its attention that suggest that a renewal may not be forthcoming.
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to remain in 
operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Financial Statements
Accounting Policies
a Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU in 
accordance with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002) (‘adopted 
IFRS’). The Company has elected to prepare its individual 
company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’); these are 
presented on pages 95 to 98.
The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis 
except for derivatives which are stated at fair value. 
The preparation of financial statements that conform with adopted 
IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and the reported amounts of income and 
expense during the reporting period. Although these estimates are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or 
actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods  
if relevant.
The accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial 
statements are detailed below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all periods presented. 
The following standard was adopted by the Group during the year:
IFRIC 14: IAS 19: The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum 
funding requirements and their interactions (effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008)
This clarifies the requirements of IAS 19: Employee Benefits  
(‘IAS 19’ revised) paragraph 58, which limits the measurement of a 
defined benefit asset to the ‘present value of any economic 
benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions 
in future contributions to the plan’ plus unrecognised net actuarial 
losses and past service cost. The Group, together with its 
actuaries, has considered the implication of this when measuring 
its retirement benefit obligation for the year ended 31 December 
2008 and have concluded that it has no impact.
The following standards or interpretations have not yet been 
adopted by the Group:
IFRS 8: Operating segments (effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009)
This standard contains requirements for the disclosure of 
information about an entity’s operating segments and also about 
the entity’s products and services, the geographical areas in which 
it operates and its major customers. The standard is concerned 
only with disclosure and replaces IAS 14: Segment reporting. The 
Group is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its 
financial statements.
IFRS 3 (2008): Business combinations (‘IFRS 3’) (effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009)
This standard and its amendments widen the scope of IFRS 3 
(2004) and impact the way that business combinations are 
accounted for including the treatment of contingent consideration 
and transaction costs. The Group will consider the implication of 
the revised IFRS 3 standard when assessing the accounting for 
any potential future acquisitions.
This standard has not yet been endorsed for use within the EU.
Amendment to IFRS 2: Share based payments (effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009)
The definition of vesting conditions in the standard has been 
amended to clarify that vesting conditions are limited to service 
conditions and performance conditions. Conditions other than 
service or performance conditions are considered to be non-
vesting. The Group does not expect this amendment to have a 
significant impact on the accounting for existing and future share 
option schemes.
For the purposes of these financial statements ‘Filtrona’ or the 
‘Group’ means Filtrona plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on  
a going concern basis the statement of which can be found on 
page 62.
b Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by Filtrona. Control exists when 
Filtrona has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic 
benefit from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries 
are included in the financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases.
(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or 
income and expense arising from intragroup transactions are 
eliminated in preparing the financial statements. 
c Foreign currency
Items included in the financial statements of the Group’s 
subsidiaries are measured using the primary currency in which  
the entity operates (functional currency). The consolidated financial 
statements are prepared in sterling (functional currency of parent 
company). 
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of 
exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet 
date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at  
that date and recognised in the income statement unless hedge 
accounting criteria apply (see policy for derivatives).
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill 
and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated 
at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. The 
revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at 
average exchange rates. 
(iii) Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences on retranslation at the closing rate of the 
opening balances of overseas entities are taken to reserves,  
as are exchange differences arising on related foreign currency 
borrowings and derivatives designated as net investment hedges, 
to the extent that they are effective. Other exchange differences 
are taken to the income statement. Differences arising prior to  
1 January 2004 are included in retained earnings. 68  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Financial Statements
Accounting Policies continued
d Derivatives
In accordance with IAS 39: Financial instruments: recognition  
and measurement (‘IAS 39’), derivatives are measured initially  
at fair value. The subsequent measurement depends on the 
classification of the derivative. Interest bearing loans and 
borrowings and other financial liabilities (excluding derivatives)  
are held at amortised cost, unless they are included in a hedge 
accounting relationship. See note 15 for separate disclosure of 
hedge types. 
(i) Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument in a cash 
flow hedge the change in fair value is recognised in equity to the 
extent that it is effective and any ineffective portion is recognised in 
the income statement. Where the underlying transaction results in a 
financial asset, accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the 
income statement in the same period as the hedged item affects 
profit or loss. Where the hedged item results in a non-financial asset 
the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in equity 
are included in the initial carrying value of the asset. 
(ii) Fair value hedges
Where a derivative is used to hedge the foreign exchange 
exposure of a monetary asset or liability, any gain or loss on  
the derivative is recognised in the income statement. 
(iii) Hedges of net investment in foreign operations
The gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in 
a foreign operation that is deemed effective is recognised in equity. 
Any ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
e Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Previously revalued 
properties were treated as being held at deemed cost upon 
transition to adopted IFRS.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment or other 
assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items. The carrying values of property, plant and 
equipment and other assets are periodically reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  
that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
f Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their 
estimated remaining useful lives on a straight-line basis at the 
following annual rates: 
Freehold land Not depreciated
Buildings 2% or life of lease if shorter
Plant and machinery 7–20%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10–33%
The assets’ useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
g Leases
Where Filtrona has substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a 
finance lease. All other leases are treated as operating leases and 
the rentals expensed to the income statement on a straight line 
basis. Lease incentives are amortised in the income statement 
over the life of the lease.
h Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment losses. 
Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method. For 
acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004 goodwill 
represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and fair 
value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
acquiree. For acquisitions made before 1 January 2004, goodwill 
is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the 
amount previously recorded under UK GAAP. 
(ii) Research and development
Research costs are expensed to the income statement in the year 
in which they are incurred. 
Development costs relating to new products are capitalised if  
the new product is technically and commercially feasible. Other 
development costs are recognised in the income statement and 
expensed as incurred.
(iii) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are 
recognised on acquisition and recorded at fair value. These 
principally relate to customer relationships which are valued using 
discounted cash flows based on historical customer attrition rates. 
Amortisation is expensed in the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful economic life. 
i Impairment
All assets, except intangible assets, deferred tax assets and 
inventories, are reviewed annually to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets with 
indefinite lives are tested annually. If an indication of impairment 
exists the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount  
of a non-financial asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount, being the greater of value in use and net 
selling price, and is recognised in the income statement. Value in 
use is estimated based on future cash flows discounted using a 
post-tax discount rate.
j Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (on a first in, first out 
basis) and net realisable value. For work-in-progress and finished 
goods, cost includes an appropriate proportion of labour cost  
and overheads. 
k Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and fixed 
term investments whose maturities are three months or less from 
the date of acquisition. Bank overdrafts repayable on demand form 
an integral part of Filtrona’s cash management and are included as 
part of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows.
l Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings are initially measured at cost (which is  
equal to fair value at inception), and are subsequently measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Any 
difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and  
the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the 
term of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
m Trade and other receivables
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the 
present value of future cash flows less impairment losses.
n Trade and other payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially 
at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
o Income tax
Income tax in the income statement comprises current and 
deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity. 69  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for 
the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in prior years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences arising between the tax bases 
and the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements. The following temporary differences are not provided 
for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable 
profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the 
extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred 
tax is determined using tax rates that are expected to apply when 
the related deferred tax asset or liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will 
be realised.
p Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income 
statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
have been transferred to the buyer. No revenue is recognised if 
there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the 
consideration due, associated expenses or the possible return  
of goods.
q Finance income and expense
Finance income and expense is recognised in the income 
statement as it accrues.
r Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of Filtrona that is 
engaged in providing products (business segment), or in providing 
products within a particular economic environment (geographic 
segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are different 
from those of other segments.
For operational and financial reporting purposes, Filtrona identifies 
two business segments which are characterised by shared 
technology and raw material inputs.
s Pensions
(i) Defined contribution schemes
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
schemes are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
(ii) Defined benefit schemes
The significant pension schemes in Europe and the US have been 
accounted for on a defined benefit basis.
The net obligations in respect of defined benefit pension schemes 
are calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the 
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return  
for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is 
discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any 
scheme assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the 
balance sheet date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity 
dates approximating to the terms of Filtrona’s obligations. The 
calculation is performed by a qualified independent actuary using 
the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses that have arisen are recognised in full in 
the statement of recognised income and expense.
The amounts charged to operating profit are the current service 
cost, past service cost and gains and losses on settlement and 
curtailments. The expected increase in the present value of scheme 
liabilities is included within finance expense and the expected return 
on scheme assets is included within finance income.
t Share-based payments
Filtrona operates equity-settled, share-based incentive plans.  
A charge is made in the income statement based on the fair  
value of options using the Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo or binomial 
valuation models as appropriate with a corresponding increase in 
equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over 
the period between grant and vesting date of the options. The 
amount recognised as an expense will be adjusted to reflect the 
actual number of share options that vest with the exception of 
options that fail to vest because market-based conditions are  
not met.
u One-off items in the consolidated income statement
(i) Exceptional acquisition fees
During the fourth quarter of 2008, Filtrona withdrew from a 
significant potential acquisition at an advanced stage and had to 
expense £1.3m of professional adviser fees which would otherwise 
have been treated as part of the consideration for the acquisition.
(ii) Restructuring costs
The restructuring of Filtrona’s operations in 2007 gave rise to 
considerable incremental one-off costs. The most significant 
component of these restructuring costs was redundancy 
payments. Filtrona views significant restructuring costs as an 
expense associated with investment in the future performance of 
the business and not part of the trading performance. 
These costs had a material impact on the absolute amount of, and 
trend in, Filtrona’s operating profit and operating margin. Therefore 
they were shown as a separate line item within operating profit on 
the face of the income statement in order for the reader to obtain a 
proper understanding of the financial information. 
v Investment in own shares
The shares held in the Filtrona Employee Benefit Trust for the 
purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of share option plans are 
treated as belonging to the Company and are deducted from its 
retained earnings. The cost of shares held directly (treasury 
shares) is also deducted from retained earnings. 
w Provisions
A provision is recognised when there is a probable legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the outflow of economic resources that 
will be required to settle the obligation.
x Net debt
Net debt is defined as cash and cash equivalents, net of interest 
bearing loans and borrowings.
y Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they 
are declared.
z Discontinued operations
In 2007 Filtrona disposed of Globalpack and this was classified as 
a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5: Non-current 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations. The profit after 
tax of Globalpack, including profit on disposal, was disclosed as  
a single line item in the income statement and similarly the cash 
flows were also disclosed as a single line item in each of the 
categories in the statement of cash flows. 70  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

Critical Accounting Policies
The following provides information on those policies that management considers critical because of the level of judgement and  
estimation required which often involves assumptions regarding future events which can vary from what is anticipated. The Directors 
believe that the financial statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimates and provide a true and fair view of Filtrona’s 
performance and financial position. 
i Pensions
Filtrona accounts for its defined benefit pension schemes in accordance with IAS 19 (revised). The application of IAS 19 (revised) requires 
the exercise of judgement in relation to the assumptions used (see note 18) and for each assumption there is a range of possible 
outcomes. In consultation with Filtrona’s actuaries, management decides the point within those ranges that most appropriately reflects 
Filtrona’s circumstances. Small changes to these assumptions can have a significant impact on valuations.
ii Intangible assets
IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value such 
intangible assets require the use of estimates. Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the 
estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and 
assumptions (including discount rates, timing and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective.
iii Taxation
Filtrona is required to use management judgement to estimate the corporate tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This 
requires an estimate of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence  
of different accounting and tax treatments.
iv Provisions 
Filtrona’s provisions are based on management’s best estimate of exposure based on currently available information. By their nature 
these provisions are judgemental. 71  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

Notes
1. Risk management
Filtrona’s activities expose the business to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business 
objectives. The principal risks faced by Filtrona and management’s response thereto are summarised in the Business Review on pages 
32 to 33. 
The Board has overall responsibility for Filtrona’s system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of 
this system. Such a system can only be designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can therefore only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Filtrona has a centralised treasury department to manage funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk. 
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of derivatives that may be 
employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash. Filtrona uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate risk  
arising from underlying business activities. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken. The treasury department is subject 
to periodic independent reviews by the internal audit department. Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the 
Executive Directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant 
combination of geographic presence, expertise and suitable credit rating. 
The following describes Filtrona’s financial risk exposure and management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
(i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial asset or liability fails to meet its contractual obligations, 
and arises principally from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Filtrona has no significant individual concentrations of credit 
risk. The following is an overview of how Filtrona manages its credit risk exposures.
Trade and other receivables
Filtrona’s exposure to credit risk is driven by the profile of its customers. This is influenced by the demographics of the customer base, 
including the industry and country in which customers operate, which is wide and diverse. Filtrona monitors significant customers’ credit 
limits and there is an allowance for impairment that represents the estimate of potential losses in respect of trade and other receivables. 
The components of this allowance are a specific allowance for individual losses and a collective allowance for losses that have been 
incurred but not yet identified. The collective allowance is determined based on historical experience.
Trade and other receivables are generally due from customers who are unlikely to seek credit ratings as part of their normal course of 
business. The following table provides information on the trade and other receivables’ credit risk exposure.
          2008 2007 
          £m £m
Not impaired or past due:    
 New customers (less than one year)        4.4 4.6
 Existing customers (more than one year) with no defaults in the past      58.1 45.1
1–30 days past due not impaired         11.2 10.0
31–60 days past due not impaired         2.5 1.7
61–90 days past due not impaired         0.5 0.7
More than 90 days past due not impaired         0.6 0.5
Impaired          0.9 1.0
          78.2 63.6
Trade and other receivables carried at £96.8m (2007: £79.8m) include prepayments and accrued income of £6.9m (2007: £5.6m)  
which are not financial assets. Therefore, these amounts are excluded from the above analysis. Trade and other receivables also  
include deferred consideration of £11.7m (2007: £10.6m) due from the Itavema Group for the purchase of the Globalpack business.  
This amount is also excluded as it is included in the credit ratings analysis below.
During the year impairment losses on trade and other receivables of £0.8m (2007: £0.6m) have been recognised within net  
operating expense. 
Derivative assets
Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed 
standard form documentation exists. The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored. 72  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

1. Risk management continued
Cash and cash equivalents
Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored regularly on a counterparty by counterparty basis. The credit limits imposed 
specify the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in or with any single counterparty. These limits are determined by 
geographic presence, expertise and credit rating. Filtrona monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Filtrona by classifying deferred consideration, 
derivative assets and cash and cash equivalents according to credit ratings of the counterparties. AAA is the highest possible rating and 
all of the assets are neither impaired nor past due.

    0.1 22.2 9.4 1.6 0.1 0.4 0.8 34.6
Filtrona’s maximum credit risk exposure is £116.5m (2007: £98.2m) and no collateral is held against this amount (2007: £nil).
(ii) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets and 
liabilities. Filtrona has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of either  
a 1%, 5% or 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points (‘bp’) 
100bp and 200bp in market interest rates. The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the 
future may materially differ. 
Filtrona is exposed to two types of market risk; currency risk and interest rate risk.
a) Currency risk
Filtrona publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies. Therefore it is 
subject to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its 
operations and their transaction costs. 
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations
The majority of Filtrona’s net assets are in currencies other than sterling. The Company’s normal policy is to limit the translation exposure 
and the resulting impact on shareholders’ funds by borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets and  
by using forward foreign exchange contracts. However, in response to the significant weakening of sterling against particularly the  
US dollar and euro in the fourth quarter of 2008 and to reduce the effect of currency movements on the Group’s net debt, the  
Company temporarily suspended its normal policy and repaid substantially all of its US dollar and euro denominated financial liabilities 
and replaced them with sterling denominated debt. As a result, at 31 December 2008, Filtrona’s net assets were exposed to the impact 
of foreign currency translation. 
Transaction exposure hedging
The majority of Filtrona’s transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and so transaction exposure is limited. 
However, where they do occur, Filtrona uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates 
on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 15 months. 
Filtrona does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate 
percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Group’s risk management policies and prevailing market 
conditions. The Group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges. To the extent that 
cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and 
losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The following table shows Filtrona’s sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies. To 
calculate the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies’ average rates have been increased or decreased by 1%, 5%  
or 10%. The translational effect on equity is limited as some US dollar (2007: all US dollar and euro) exposure is hedged. Accordingly  
the effect on equity is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in 
currency hedges. It is assumed that all net investment and cash flow hedges will be 100% effective. 73  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

|
 (0.8) (3.7) (7.1)
b) Interest rate risk
Filtrona’s strategy is to ensure with a reasonable amount of certainty that at least 50% of the overall net finance expense is protected 
against material adverse movements in interest rates using interest rate swaps and caps. 
As a result of the temporary suspension of the normal net investment hedging policy in the fourth quarter of 2008, Filtrona repaid 
substantially all of its US dollar and euro denominated financial liabilities and replaced them with sterling denominated debt. 
Consequently, most of the Company’s US dollar and euro interest rate swaps and caps in place at 31 December 2008 were no longer 
effective in providing protection against increases in interest rates. No sterling interest rate caps or swaps were taken out, and as a result, 
at 31 December 2008, Filtrona was exposed to the impact of any material adverse movements in sterling interest rates.
The following table shows Filtrona’s sensitivity to a 50bp, 100bp and 200bp decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro interest 
rates. To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year the interest rates on all external interest bearing loans and deposits 
have been increased or decreased by 50bp, 100bp or 200bp and the resulting increase or decrease in the net interest charge has been 
adjusted for the effect of Filtrona’s interest rate derivatives. The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and 
the impact of a 50bp, 100bp or 200bp decrease or increase in interest rates on the market values of Filtrona’s interest rate derivatives. 
The impact on derivatives is estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates 
prevailing at the year end.

(iii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that Filtrona, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to meet its 
obligations as they fall due.
Filtrona’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility. Filtrona is mostly funded by a multi-currency syndicated 
£215m facility from its bankers. The syndicated facility matures in May 2010. In addition, during the year, the Company put in place additional 
bilateral facilities totalling US$40m, which mature in November 2009. At 31 December 2008 the available bank facilities totalled £242.8m of 
which £198.1m was drawn down. In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term flexibility. 
Amounts drawn by Filtrona on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants.
Filtrona’s available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December were:
          2008 2007 
          £m £m
Expiring within one year         27.8 –
Expiring after one but within two years        16.9 –
Expiring after two years         – 57.2
          44.7 57.2
Any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at floating rates with reference to LIBOR for the currency and period of the loan. 74  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

(iv) Capital structure
Filtrona defines its capital structure as its equity and non-current interest bearing loans and borrowings and aims to manage this 
to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for  
other stakeholders.
Filtrona sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. Filtrona manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, 
Filtrona may return capital to shareholders, through dividends and share buy backs as it did in 2007, issue new shares or sell assets to 
reduce debt. 
Filtrona monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. EBITDA is defined as operating profit 
before depreciation, share option expense, intangible amortisation and exceptional acquisition fees (2007: depreciation, share option 
expense, intangible amortisation and restructuring costs) from continuing operations. During 2008, Filtrona’s strategy, which was 
unchanged from 2007, was to maintain the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5. The net debt-to-EBITDA ratios 
at 31 December were:

2. Segment analysis continued
Inter-segment sales are not significant in either year. Continuing operations’ net finance expense of £6.8m (2007: £6.2m) and income tax 
expense of £18.5m (2007: £17.6m) cannot be meaningfully allocated by segment. The majority of unallocated assets relate to derivative 
assets, income tax receivable and cash and cash equivalents. The majority of unallocated liabilities relate to interest bearing loans and 
borrowings, derivative liabilities, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax liabilities and income tax payable.

iii The Company believes that, given their detailed knowledge of Filtrona’s operations, its structure and accounting policies and the importance of carrying out detailed due 
diligence as part of the acquisition process, it is appropriate for certain audit-related work to be carried out by the Company’s auditor rather than another firm of accountants. 
The Audit Committee, which consists of independent Non-executive Directors, reviews and approves the level and nature of non-audit work which the auditor performs, 
including the fees paid for such work, thus ensuring that the auditor’s objectivity and independence is not compromised

The weighted average useful economic life of customer relationships and other intangible assets at the end of the year was 22.9 years 
and 12.1 years respectively (2007: customer relationships 23.6 years).
Filtrona tests intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. A discounted cash flow 
analysis is computed to compare the discounted estimated future post tax operating cash flows to the net carrying value of the goodwill 
and other intangible assets for each division or business as appropriate.
Goodwill is allocated to divisions as follows:
           Goodwill
          2008 2007

Protection and Finishing Products         29.8 23.3

9. Intangible assets continued
Intangible assets, apart from goodwill, are allocated to the businesses to which they relate as shown below:
         Customer relationships  
         and other intangible assets
        2008 2007 
Business       Division £m £m
Moss and Skiffy       Protection and Finishing Products 24.1 19.1

Lendell       Porous Technologies 10.8 –
Multiple businesses       Multiple divisions 0.6 0.7
         53.3 33.4
The tests are based on the following assumptions:
Cash flows for the following two years are based upon the Group’s annual budget •	
Cash flows beyond the budget period are based on year two’s budget cash flows with zero growth •	
The estimated cash flows are discounted using Filtrona’s weighted average cost of capital of 10.0% (which equates to a pre tax •	
discount rate of 14.3%)
Any impairments identified as a result of the analysis are charged to the income statement. The test is dependent on management 
estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, and the discount rate applied to these  
cash flows.
The Group performed various sensitivity analyses which involved significantly reducing future cash flows. The results of these analyses 
showed that, despite significantly lower post tax operating cash flows, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
continued to be supported.

At 31 December 2008, the majority of Filtrona’s interest bearing loans and borrowings were drawn in sterling, at floating rates of  
interest set with reference to LIBOR for periods ranging from seven days to three months. The Group had US$30m of net debt that  
was effectively fixed at 5.3935% until November 2009. The Group still retains US dollar and euro interest rate caps but these are not 
currently effective in providing protection against increases in interest rates.
After taking into account foreign exchange swaps, the currency and interest rate profile of Filtrona’s financial assets and liabilities

asset balances.
15. Derivatives
Filtrona uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and 
investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, Filtrona does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.

Fair value hedges are hedges of the currency risk exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a previously 
unrecognised firm commitment to buy or sell assets at a fixed price. 
Cash flow hedges are hedges of the currency and interest rate risk exposure to variability in cash flows. 
Hedges of net investments are hedges of the currency risk exposure to changes in the carrying value of recognised investments in  
foreign operations. 
Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year end forward exchange rates 
compared to contracted rates. Fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by discounting cash flows at forward rates. All 
other financial assets, classified as ‘loans and receivables’, and financial liabilities, classified as ‘amortised cost’, are held at amortised 
cost and have short terms to maturity. For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate the fair values. 
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and 
purchases will be transferred to the income statement when the forecast sales and purchases occur. With the exception of the receipt  
of the Globalpack disposal consideration from the Itavema Group all of the hedged transactions are expected to occur over the next  
15 months. With the exception of the consideration discussed above, all other derivative instruments mature within the next 12 months.
At 31 December 2008 Filtrona had temporarily suspended its normal net investment hedging policy and had only US$30m of debt 
designated as a hedge of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings. At 31 December 2007, Filtrona had US dollar denominated 
borrowings and US dollar and euro currency swaps which it had designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings. 
The exchange gains of £0.8m on these borrowings and the gains of £0.4m on the US dollar currency swaps and losses of £4.4m on euro 
currency swaps were recognised in reserves at 31 December 2007.
Finance income and expense arising on financial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost are those amounts, excluding the 
expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities, detailed in note 4. The only losses recognised on 
financial assets held at amortised cost are those detailed as impairment losses in note 1.

16. Deferred tax continued
No deferred tax liability is provided in respect of any future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries where Filtrona is able to control 
the remittance of earnings and it is probable that such earnings will not be remitted in the foreseeable future, or where no liability would 
arise on the remittance. Deferred tax assets of £0.9m (2007: £1.9m) have not been recognised where their realisation is not considered 
probable. These assets include capital losses of £0.6m (2007: £0.6m) and other temporary differences of £0.3m (2007: £1.3m).

Discontinued provisions relate to warranties made on the disposal of Globalpack. Other provisions relate primarily to vacant properties 
and employees’ compensation claims. Non-current provisions are generally long-term in nature with the timing of utilisation uncertain.
18. Employee benefits 
(i) Post-retirement benefits
Trustees administer the schemes and the assets are held independently from Filtrona.
Pension costs of the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified 
actuaries. Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes as at 5 April 2006 and 
annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes. The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit 
schemes have been updated to the balance sheet date from the most recent actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns 
achieved by the schemes and the level of contributions.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices. Defined benefit contributions in 
2009 are expected to be £8.5m, which consists of payments to fund future service accruals and contributions to amortise the deficit in 
respect of past service. 86  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

The assumptions used by the actuaries are the estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the 
timescale covered, may not be borne out in practice. 
The life expectancy assumptions used to estimate defined benefit obligations at the year end are:

they are realised, and the present value of the scheme liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are

Employee trust shares are ordinary shares of the Company held in an employee benefit trust. The purpose of this trust is to hold shares  
in the Company for subsequent transfer to Executive Directors and employees relating to options granted and awards made in respect  
of market purchase shares under the Company’s share-based incentive plans. Full details are set out in the Report of the Remuneration 
Committee on pages 48 to 56. The assets, liabilities and expenditure of the trust have been incorporated in these financial statements. At 
31 December 2008 the trust held 1,557,107 (2007: 1,557,107) shares, upon which dividends have been waived, with an aggregate nominal 
value of £0.4m (2007: £0.4m) and market value of £2.1m (2007: £3.2m). During 2007, 13,664,604 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 
£3.4m were purchased into treasury at a cost of £30.6m. This represents 6.2% of the number of ordinary shares in issue.
The other reserve relates to the Group reorganisation which took place as part of the demerger from Bunzl plc and represents the 
difference between Filtrona plc’s share capital and Filtrona International Ltd’s share capital and share premium on 6 June 2005 and  
is not distributable.

At 31 December Filtrona had the following commitments under non-cancellable operating leases:
          2008 2007 
          £m £m
Payable within one year          2.7 1.4

Payable after five years         2.8 3.5
          10.0 8.0
Other commitments
In December 2005 Filtrona entered into an agreement that could lead to the purchase of the remaining 20% of FractureCode Corporation 
ApS some time between March 2009 and December 2012. The consideration payable for the remaining 20% of shares is dependent on 
various profit related targets with a minimum consideration payable of €3.1m and a maximum of €40m. 
23. Acquisitions
On 17 October 2008, Filtrona acquired the assets and business of Lendell Manufacturing, Inc. (‘Lendell’) based in St. Charles, Michigan, 
for a cash consideration of US$35m. Lendell is a producer of speciality hydrophilic foam products for the medical, printing systems and 
personal care (cosmetics) markets and is highly complementary with Filtrona’s Bonded Fibre Components division.
Lendell contributed £1.1m to revenue and £0.3m to operating profit before intangible amortisation and exceptional acquisition fees. It is 
estimated that if Lendell had been owned by the Group for the entire year it would have contributed £5.8m and £2.3m to revenue and 
operating profit before intangible amortisation and exceptional acquisition fees respectively.
On 3 May 2007, Filtrona acquired the assets and business of Duraco, Inc. (‘Duraco’) based in Chicago, Illinois for a total consideration of 
£31.7m. Duraco is a market leading manufacturer and supplier of self-adhesive foam products for protection and finishing applications in 
a broad array of served markets including point of purchase products and white goods.
Duraco contributed £9.7m to revenue and £2.3m to operating profit before intangible amortisation and restructuring costs in 2007.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired were adjusted to reflect their fair values to Filtrona. The fair value 
adjustments are provisional and subject to finalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
The principal fair value adjustments are as follows:
In 2008:
The adjustment to property, plant and equipment reflects the open market value of the freehold property.
The adjustment to inventories reflects a fair value uplift in line with IFRS 3 and the impact of applying Filtrona Group accounting policies.
The adjustment to receivables reflects the impact of applying Filtrona Group policies.
In 2007:
The adjustment to property, plant and equipment reflects the open market value of the freehold property.
The adjustment to inventories and receivables reflects the impact of applying Filtrona group accounting policies to these items.
The adjustment to deferred tax reflects the asset arising from a temporary difference between the accounting and tax base of property, 
plant and equipment.
The adjustment to provisions includes amounts relating to the reassessment of potential liabilities that were not fully recognised on 
acquisition.

Accounting Policies
a Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
applicable UK accounting standards. 
Under Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985, Filtrona plc is exempt from the requirements to present its own profit and loss account. 
The following accounting policies have been consistently applied.
b Investment in subsidiary undertaking
Investment in subsidiary undertaking is held at cost less any provision for impairment.
c Share-based payments
The fair value of share options is measured at grant date. It is recognised as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary in 
which the relevant employees work over the expected period between grant and vesting date of the options, with a corresponding 
adjustment to reserves. 
d Own shares
The shares held in the Filtrona Employee Benefit Trust for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of share incentive plans are 
treated as belonging to the Company and are deducted from its retained earnings. The cost of shares held directly (treasury shares)  
is also deducted from retained earnings.

We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the 
part of the Report of the Remuneration Committee to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the 
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report 
includes that information presented in those sections that are cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.  
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are  
not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the 
part of the Report of the Remuneration Committee to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and 
judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order  
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Report of the 
Remuneration Committee to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.  
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the  
part of the Report of the Remuneration Committee to be audited. 100  Filtrona plc  Annual Report 2008

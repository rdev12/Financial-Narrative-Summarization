How we do what we do
Key statistics:
We have a strong business model that generates high levels of recurring revenues in the form 
of commission from third party insurance companies. Our membership businesses serve 
as intermediaries in the marketing, sale and administration of policies for these insurance 
companies who undertake the product replacement and repair risk and are responsible for 
the costs of any claim. 
Our business is built on developing long term relationships with utility companies, appliance 
manufacturers, retailers and fi nancial services companies. We deliver policies under their 
brands to our customers, capitalising on our product development knowledge and direct 
consumer marketing expertise.
We are focused on providing a comprehensive offering for our customers, covering all aspects 
of product and service delivery including product design, marketing, sales, managing repairs 
through our managed, sub-contract and franchise networks of engineers and handling 
customer claims.
The Company’s shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE:HSV).

Reported results explanatory note
The reported results and the results contained within this statement reflect the new structure of the Group 
after the transfer of the claims management and policy repair networks from UK Emergency Services into 
UK Membership. The financial impact of this new structure on both divisions is set out in the Financial 
Review section of this statement to enable a full comparison of these results to the previous Group 
structure. Within this new structure the UK Emergency Services division is shown as a non-core operation 
following the Board’s decision to exit this business.

“Core membership operations” includes the policy membership business: UK Membership, Europe and USA
“Non-core operations” is the Emergency Services division HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 5
During the year, we transferred those 
parts of our claims handling and 
network operations that support 
our UK policy customers into UK 
Membership from Emergency Services. 
Our original intention for Emergency 
Services was to develop a unique, 
national, multi-trade network in the 
UK to support our growing policy 
membership base and to provide an 
integrated claims fulfilment solution for 
household insurers. 
Whilst we have validated the benefit 
to insurers of such an integrated hub 
proposition, we have not progressed 
strategic partnerships of this type 
at a rate consistent with our original 
objectives. On the back of this and 
ongoing challenges within the 
insurance sector, we have decided to 
reposition the Group to focus on our 
membership businesses which we 
believe is in the best long-term interest 
of our shareholders. Accordingly, we 
have decided to exit UK Emergency 
Services and are currently progressing 
a number of approaches. 
The decision to exit this business 
is one we have considered very 
carefully in light of our dedicated 
employees, customer relationships 
and investment of time and resources 
in building the business since 2002. 
In addition, as a result of ongoing 
trading challenges and deteriorating 
financial performance, we have taken 
the difficult but necessary decision to 
write down the value of UK Emergency 
Services assets resulting in an 
impairment charge of £97m and a 
statutory pre-tax loss for the year for 
the Group of £21.7m.
Core Membership Operations - 
business development
We are very pleased with the strong 
performance of all our membership 
businesses. Our UK Membership 
business has delivered another year 
of strong growth with gross new policy 
sales of 1.83m (2008: 1.68m) and our 
retention rate for the year remained 
high at 83% (2008: 85%). Our decision 
to focus on driving value per customer 
has been successful through continued 
conversion of existing members to 
Combined Policies and income per 
customer growing by 18% to £59. 
The reorganisation of our UK 
operations has created a fully 
integrated membership business 
including claims management and 
policy repair networks resulting in 
improved customer service and more 
focused and efficient service delivery 
with one division taking ownership for 
the entire customer journey.
We have also reached a significant 
milestone in our international 
operations which delivered an 
operating profit
*
 for the year of £5.1m 
compared with a loss of £0.5m last 
year. 
Chairman’s statement
HomeServe’s core policy membership 
operations have delivered another strong 
performance. Across the UK, Continental 
Europe and US we have seen 14% policy 
growth to 9.2m, 8% growth in customers 
and 22% operating profit
*
 growth to 
£92.3m. 6
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Overview
Our European business has trebled 
operating profit* to £5.3m (2008: 
£1.8m) with Doméo, our French joint 
venture with Veolia, having another 
very successful year and doubling 
total (100%) profits* to £14.0m (2008: 
£6.8m). In Spain, Reparalia continues 
to progress well, growing revenue 
and helping to facilitate agreements 
with new affinity partners. Our 
Spanish policy business ended the 
year with 47,700 policies on the back 
of an encouraging start to full-scale 
marketing with Endesa. We have also 
expanded geographically through the 
acquisition of SPT, Belgium’s leading 
claims handling and repair network 
business.
In addition, the USA has made 
excellent progress, generating a profit 
in the second half and is now profitable 
on an ongoing basis. During the year 
the business increased customer 
numbers by 50% and the retention 
rate to 80% (2008: 78%). We are also 
pleased to announce the signing of 
a 10-year marketing agreement with 
SEMCO Energy Gas Company, a gas 
utility based in Michigan, which will 
provide us with access to an additional 
250,000 households and includes the 
acquisition of 26,300 policies.
Results
Revenue for the Group declined 7% 
to £517.4m (2008: £554.9m) as a 
result of a fall in volumes within UK 
Emergency Services and the change 
in underwriting arrangements in the 
UK and operating profit* increased by 
10% to £100.3m. Group profit before 
tax* increased by 13% to £96.1m and 
earnings per share^ increased by 14%.
We are delighted with the continued 
strong performance of our membership 
businesses.
Revenue for our three membership 
businesses increased by 8% to £284m, 
or 25% excluding the impact from the 
change in underwriting. Operating 
profit* increased by 22% to £92.3m.
Revenue within UK Emergency Services 
decreased by 20% to £233.6m (2008: 
£291.7m) and operating profit* by 47% 
to £8.0m (2008: £15.1m).
As reported in our interim results, we 
incurred £1.5m of costs in relation to 
the aborted second hub deal and 
£5m of costs have arisen from the 
reorganisation of our UK businesses 
(of which £2.7m relates to non-core 
operations). The total exceptional costs 
of £6.5m together with the write down 
of UK Emergency Services assets of 
£97m result in a statutory loss before 
tax of £21.7m and loss per share of 
56.2p.
HomeServe continues to have a strong 
balance sheet, ending the year with 
net debt of £34m and with significant 
headroom on lending facilities.
Dividend
Continuing our policy of increasing 
dividends in line with earnings^ 
growth, the Board is proposing a final 
dividend of 25p per share to be paid on 
4 August 2009 to shareholders on the 
register on 3 July 2009. This brings the 
total dividend for the year to 35.5p, a 
year on year increase of 14%.
Employees
We now have approximately 3,000 
employees in our core operations and 
5,500 employees in the total Group. 
Our employees remain committed 
and dedicated and have once again 
contributed significantly to another 
excellent year and I should like to thank 
them for their hard work. 7
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Organisational changes
We have also announced that our 
Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan 
Simpson-Dent has decided to leave the 
business to pursue other opportunities. 
Jonathan is being replaced as CFO 
by Martin Bennett, currently Finance 
Director of our UK Membership division, 
who has been with HomeServe for six 
years. I would like to thank Jonathan 
for the significant contribution he has 
made to HomeServe over the last two 
years and congratulate Martin on his 
appointment. 
Prospects
We are delighted with the continued 
strong performance of our membership 
businesses.
Our UK Membership business 
continues to perform well and has 
demonstrated its resilience with high 
levels of gross new policy sales and 
increasing value per customer. Our 
focus on targeting new customers 
through initiatives like One Contact, 
new product development and 
broadening our relationships with 
affinity partners will help to maintain 
strong growth in UK Membership 
going forward.
Overall, HomeServe is well positioned for 
future growth and we are committed  
to a membership-focused strategy. 
Our International operations are 
becoming increasingly significant 
contributors to Group performance 
with comparatively low household 
penetration in these countries 
providing further growth potential. We 
have a firm foundation in Spain through 
the strong performance of Reparalia 
and 47,700 live policies and, with the 
acquisition of SPT, we now have a 
platform to develop a policy business in 
Belgium and the Netherlands.
HomeServe is focused on delivering 
long term growth and continues 
to explore selective investment 
opportunities to support the 
development of the three membership 
businesses. The performance of our 
policy businesses has demonstrated 
the resilience of the business model 
and attractiveness of our products to 
our customers.
Overall, HomeServe is well positioned 
for future growth and we are 
committed to a membership-focused 
strategy.

HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Business review
Our strategy is to be the leading 
provider of home assistance and 
appliance warranties to homeowners 
in the UK, Europe and US by offering 
customers annual membership. 
We deliver this strategy through 
leveraging our product development 
knowledge, direct consumer 
marketing expertise, network 
management and service delivery 
capabilities combined with long-
term relationships with business 
partners including utilities, appliance 
manufacturers, retailers and financial 
services companies. 
The results we are announcing 
today show strong progress in our 
worldwide membership businesses 
and reinforce our strategy to focus 
exclusively on policy membership.
Our businesses
We now have access to 56m 
households globally, of which 32m are 
outside the UK. We sold 2.7m gross 
new policies in the year and increased 
total policies by 14% to 9.2m (2008: 
8.1m).
UK Membership
Our UK business now provides cover 
for anything that goes wrong in the 
home that is not covered by household 
insurance such as pipes and wires, 
furniture and appliances. 
UK Membership metrics are shown on 
page 15.
Revenue decreased by 3% to £228.2m 
(2008: £236.5m) and operating 
profit* increased by 14% to £87.2m 
(2008: £76.3m). We signed a new 
underwriting agreement in September 
2007 with Inter Partner Assistance 
whereby from 1 October 2007 they 
took the full risk on new policy sales 
and we ceased reinsuring 49% of the 
risk through our captive insurer. The 
change in underwriting arrangements 
has reduced the reported revenue 
for UK Membership in the year and 
the phasing of profits between the 
first and second halves of the year. 
Excluding the impact of changes in 
underwriting arrangements, revenue 
in UK Membership grew by 14%. 
The business achieved gross new 
policy sales of 1.83m (2008: 1.68m) 
with retention rates remaining high 
at 83% (2008: 85%). We continued our 
successful strategy of increasing value 
per customer through the continued 
success of Combined Policies which 
now represents 14% (2008: 8%) of our 
customers with income per customer 
growing 18% to £59. 
Chief Executive’s review
Our vision is to be the first place 
people turn to when it comes to fixing, 
maintaining and looking after the 
home, recognising the problem that 
homeowners have throughout the world 
in finding a reliable tradesman and 
paying the repair bill in the event of a 
home emergency.

HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
During the year, we reorganised 
our businesses in the UK with those 
areas of the network dedicated to 
servicing our UK policy members 
moving from Emergency Services 
into UK Membership. The transfer 
of our plumbing, electrics, gas and 
other subcontract networks that 
support our policy customers, as well 
as our network of directly employed 
plumbers, has enabled us to deliver 
an improved end-to-end service for 
our UK policy customers, thereby 
replicating the highly successful 
integrated model we deploy in our 
international operations. 
We have continued to develop 
the network that supports our 
policy business by increasing the 
proportion of jobs carried out by our 
own plumbers, from 32% to 47% in 
the year. We have also completed 
the rollout of franchising across our 
Electrics network and introduced new 
technology to improve the efficiency 
and performance of our directly 
employed engineers in the field.
Our Manufacturer Warranties 
business has had another successful 
year with total polices growing 47% 
to 331,000. We also signed up new 
partners including Aqualisa, Lec, 
Maytag, Sanyo and Smeg taking the 
total number of partners to 18 across 
the boiler, shower, white and brown 
goods sectors. 
This business not only provides a 
significant and growing contribution 
to Group performance but also an 
excellent opportunity to cross-sell 
our core utility products to these 
customers. 
As announced at our interim results, 
the difficult retail environment has 
impacted our retail warranties 
business with revenue falling by £6m 
year-on-year. Warranties sold on 
behalf of retailers are not recognised 
in our customer or policy numbers 
and represent a relatively small 
contribution to UK Membership 
profit, with limited exposure to further 
changes in the retail sector. 
In October 2008, we launched a 
pilot in the West Midlands of a new 
range of ‘One Contact’ services 
aimed at attracting new customers 
through offering access, via our UK 
Membership network, to a range of 
home repair trades on a ‘pay-on-use’ 
basis. The response to the pilot has 
been encouraging and the next phase 
of One Contact is to prove that we 
can successfully convert a one-off job 
customer into an annual member with 
a number of tests in progress.
In March, we launched two new 
products. Firstly, home assistance 
cover for landlords providing access to 
an additional 12% of the UK housing 
market. Secondly, cover for flats 
ranging from entry-level plumbing 
cover through to a combined package 
including an annual boiler service and 
central heating inspection. 
Our businesses
We now have access 
to 56m households 
globally, of which 32m 
are outside the UK.

Continental Europe
Our European business has had 
another very good year with operating 
profit* increasing by 204% to £5.3m 
(2008: £1.8m), 143% in local currency. 
We now have access to 22.7m 
households in Europe and 1.6m 
policies with a combined penetration 
of 5%. Doméo, our French joint 
venture with Veolia, has grown total 
(100%) operating profit* by 106% to 
£14.0m (2008: £6.8m). The operating 
profit* result of £5.3m comprises 
£4.8m contribution from our share 
in the French joint venture, a £0.1m 
contribution from Spain, with profits 
from Reparalia being used to invest in 
building our Spanish policy business 
and £0.4m contribution from Belgium.
Our focus this financial year is to 
continue European development 
through broadening our product 
range and building on the success 
we have had in the UK in our 
Manufacturer Warranties business 
by expanding this important part of 
our membership model alongside our 
utility-branded policies. We will also 
continue to explore opportunities and 
identify potential partners to expand 
our membership model into new 
European territories.
France
The total number of policies in our 
French joint venture, Doméo, has 
increased by 33% in the year to 1.57m 
(2008: 1.18m). Gross new policy sales 
in the year have increased to 0.55m 
(2008: 0.44m) and the retention rate 
has remained high at 88% (2008: 
89%). During the year we have also 
increased the number of affinity 
partner households (excluding 
apartments) by 1.0m to 13.5m. 
Metrics for the French business are 
shown on page 15.
The principal policies offered by 
Doméo include plumbing and drains, 
water supply pipe, water loss, electrics 
cover, gas supply pipe and boiler 
cover. Doméo has grown its policy 
book across all categories through 
a combination of customer growth 
and the sale of additional policies to 
existing customers with policies per 
customer increasing from 2.1 to 2.3. 
This, combined with a more attractive 
underwriting deal completed in the 
year, resulted in a 55% increase 
in revenue (82% in GBP) and 65% 
increase in operating profit* in local 
currency (106% in GBP). 
In the year, we recruited a new 
Managing Director to lead our French 
business whose focus, along with 
the expanded business development 
team, will be on developing new 
products and affinity partnerships 
as the business moves into the next 
stage of its development. 
We successfully tested the sale of 
policies via new channels including 
email and the internet and we signed 
agreements with new affinity partners 
Vialis and Gaz Electricité de Grenoble.
Our European business has had another 
very good year with operating profit* 
increasing by 204% to £5.3m 15

Spain
We are pleased with the strong 
performance of Reparalia which 
continues to meet our expectations 
from when we acquired the business 
in August 2007 and is an integral 
part of our plans to build a policy 
business in Spain. Reparalia has been 
instrumental in signing agreements 
with our Spanish affinity partners and 
we firmly believe that this acquisition 
provides the preferred entry model 
into new markets.
We have made progress in 
establishing a policy business which 
now has 47,700 policies following 
an encouraging start to full scale 
marketing with Endesa. We recently 
signed twelve month test marketing 
agreements with two water 
companies, Agbar and Acciona and 
results from the initial tests have been 
positive.
In the year we launched a franchise 
offering to Reparalia subcontractors in 
Madrid and Barcelona. We believe this 
is an effective and cost efficient way 
of raising awareness of the Reparalia 
brand, reinforcing our relationships 
with our subcontractor network and 
helping support the development of 
the Spanish policy business.
With an encouraging start to full 
scale marketing, scope to increase 
penetration of Endesa customers and 
the potential to sign up long-term 
agreements with other partners, 
Spain is well positioned for future 
growth.
Belgium
In December 2008 we acquired SPT, 
Belgium’s leading claims handling and 
subcontract repair network business. 
Our focus this year will be to develop a 
membership business by using SPT as 
a platform to secure long-term affinity 
partnerships with utilities in Belgium 
and the Netherlands. 
United States of America
The US has had another strong year 
generating an increase in revenue 
in local currency of 58% (GBP 96%) 
and an operating profit* in the 
second half. The total number of 
policies has increased by 0.19m to 
0.55m, an increase of 52% driven by 
continued high levels of gross new 
policy sales of 0.25m (2008: 0.18m) 
and an increase in customer numbers 
of 50%. The retention rate has also 
increased to 80% (2008: 78%) as a 
result of improved retention initiatives 
and moving a greater proportion of 
customers to pay for their membership 
via their utility bill. 
Metrics for the US business are shown 
on page 15.
Policy growth in the US has been 
driven by strong take-up rates with our 
water company partners in particular 
California Water and Louisville 
Water and with Progress Energy. 
Initial results from marketing our 
Exterior Electrics policy to First Energy 
customers, which covers repairs to 
the section of external electric line 
or underground cable for which the 
customer has legal responsibility, have 
also been encouraging.
The US has had another strong year 
generating an increase in revenue in local 
currency of 58% 17
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
We are also pleased to announce 
the signing of a 10-year marketing 
agreement with SEMCO Energy Gas 
Company, a gas utility based in 
Michigan, which will provide access 
to an additional 250,000 households 
and includes the acquisition of 
26,300 policies which, together 
with the agreement with Utilities 
Inc announced in January and the 
opening up of additional territories 
with existing affinity partners, has 
increased US marketable households 
in the year by 0.8m to 9.4m.
We continue to develop our pipeline of 
affinity partner prospects and remain 
focused on expanding our footprint in 
the US to reach our goal of more than 
20m marketable households in the 
medium term.
With the US now profitable on an 
ongoing basis we look forward to 
delivering another year of profit 
growth this financial year and 
increasing the contribution of the US to 
the business overall.
UK Emergency Services
As previously announced, it has been 
a difficult year for our UK Emergency 
Services business which continues 
to operate in challenging market 
conditions, with lower volumes and 
pricing pressure. The lower volumes 
together with £41m of flood-related 
work in the prior year have resulted 
in revenue falling by 20% to £233.6m 
(2008: £291.7m). The completion of 
a significant proportion of larger, 
more complex, lower margin jobs, 
particularly within our Buildings 
business has also impacted margin 
progression in the year with operating 
margin* falling from 5.2% to 3.4% 
and operating profit* by 47% to 
£8.0m (2008: £15.1m). On the back 
of the ongoing tough operating 
environment we have taken the 
difficult but necessary decision to 
exit the business and write-down the 
value of these assets resulting in an 
impairment charge of £97m.
Summary
We are pleased to report a year of 
significant progress for HomeServe 
and another set of strong results for 
our membership businesses. The 
market opportunities for our three 
membership businesses are very 
exciting and we are confident that 
each of them will continue to deliver 
strong growth over the coming years. 
The decision to exit our UK Emergency 
Services business will significantly 
simplify the Group and allow us to 
focus exclusively on maximising 
the potential of our membership 
businesses, both in existing markets 
and through further international 
expansion.

Business review
The presentation of this year’s results 
and comparisons with last year are 
impacted by both the reorganisation 
of our UK businesses during the 
second half of the year and the 
decision to exit Emergency Services. In 
this section, we are therefore providing 
additional analysis in order to show 
the impact of these organisational 
changes to assist with comparison 
of the Group’s performance in prior 
years and to present the results of 
the business as it will look going 
forward following the disposal of the 
Emergency Services division. 
Group reported results
The headline statutory financial 
results are presented on page 21 for 
the Group as a whole and further 
split between core and non-core 
operations.
In accordance with IFRS, statutory 
operating profit for the Group, which 
has decreased by 123% to a loss 
of £17.5m (2008: profit of £77.5m), 
includes an impairment charge of 
£97m, amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles, £6.5m of exceptional 
costs from the aborted second hub 
deal and reorganisation of businesses 
in the UK and our share of the 
operating result of our joint venture in 
France. 
The amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles amounts to £12.1m (2008: 
£10.3m) and principally relates to 
customer and other contracts held 
by the acquired entities at the date of 
acquisition. The year on year increase 
principally reflects the full year impact 
of the Anglia, California Water and 
Reparalia acquisitions. For our French 
joint venture, the operating result is 
defined as profit after tax and hence 
£1.9m (2008: £1.0m) of taxation is 
reported within operating profit and 
profit before tax.
Statutory operating profit, after 
deducting the impairment charge, 
amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles, tax on joint ventures and 
exceptional operating costs, were: UK 
Membership £83.9m (2008: £73.4m); 
Continental Europe £2.2m (2008: 
£0.1m); and USA an operating loss of 
£1.7m (2008: loss of £3.1m) resulting 
in a statutory operating profit for the 
core operations of £84.4m. The non-
core UK Emergency Services business 
reported a statutory operating loss of 
£101.9m (2008: operating profit £7.1m).
The Group’s net interest charge 
decreased in the year to £4.2m (2008: 
£5.7m) due to continued strong cash 
conversion, a lower spend in the 
year on acquisitions of £23.4m (2008: 
£46.1m) and no expenditure on share 
purchases (2008: £7.3m). The interest 
charge was covered 24 times by 
operating profit*. 
The effective rate of corporation tax, 
prior to the impact of the impairment 
of UK Emergency Services assets, is 
29.9% (2008: 31.4%). The reduction in 
rate is primarily due to a decrease in 
the UK tax rate to 28% which came 
into effect on 1 April 2008. The effective 
rate applicable to our core operations 
is consistent with the rate for the 
Group overall. 
Financial review
*Excluding amortisation of acquisition intangibles, impairment charge, joint venture taxation and exceptional operating costs, see 
Financial review and notes 5 and 14.  
^Excluding amortisation of acquisition intangibles, impairment charge and exceptional operating costs, see Financial review and notes 
5 and 14. 19
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
The tax rate was impacted by 
continuing investment in our Spanish 
business, partly offset by our US 
business reaching profitability, 
allowing us to start to utilise 
previously non recognised tax losses 
in that jurisdiction. Based on current 
corporate tax rates applicable to our 
core businesses, we expect a similar 
core rate for 2010.
Earnings per share^ in the period has 
increased by 14% from 93.0p to 106.4p 
with the Group making a statutory 
loss per share of 56.2p. The full year 
dividend has increased by 14% to 
35.5p continuing our policy of growing 
dividends in line with earnings^.
Cash flow and financing
Details of cash flow are shown on 
page 21.
We have continued to achieve 
strong cash conversion (defined as 
cash generated from operations 
as a proportion of operating profit* 
after exceptional costs), with cash 
generated from operations amounting 
to £92.2m (2007: £97.4m), representing 
a cash conversion ratio of 98% (2008: 
110%). 
During the year, we incurred net 
capital expenditure of £16.9m (2008: 
£17.6m) principally in respect of 
information systems to support our 
growing business. 
Overall, net debt in the year 
decreased by £9.1m to £34.0m 
(2008: £43.1m), including the impact 
of acquisitions and disposals of 
£23.4m (2008: £46.1m). There was 
a net cash inflow of £29.5m (2008: 
£33.6m) before acquisitions and 
disposals, share purchases and 
financing, demonstrating the strong 
cash generative nature of the Group. 
We continue to have a low level of 
financial gearing. Our priority is to 
use our financial leverage to fund 
strategic acquisitions which accelerate 
the development of our UK and 
international membership businesses. 
In the year we had a working capital 
outflow of £10.8m which reflects 
growth in our UK Membership 
business with a greater proportion 
of customers moving to combined 
policies and the success we have had 
transferring more customers from 
paying annually to monthly via direct 
debit.
UK reorganisation –  
pro forma impact
In October 2008, we reorganised 
our businesses in the UK with 
those components of the previously 
enlarged Emergency Services 
division that service our UK policy 
customers (claims management and 
policy repair networks) transferring 
from UK Emergency Services into 
UK Membership. The results for 
these businesses are included in 
UK Membership’s reported results 
for the full year, with the prior year 
divisional reported results also 
adjusted for consistency. The table on 
page 23 shows this year’s and last 
year’s results both pre and post re-
organisation to assist in the analysis 
of the performance of UK Membership 
and UK Emergency Services on a like-
for-like basis.
In the year to 31 March 2009, the 
reorganisation has resulted in £29.6m 
of revenue and £5.3m of operating 
profit moving into UK Membership 
and £44.0m revenue and £5.3m 
of operating profit moving out of 
UK Emergency Services with the 
elimination of £14.3m of inter-company 
revenue. The UK Emergency Services 
margin pre-reorganisation has fallen 
by 0.6ppts from 5.4% to 4.8%.  20
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Business review
In UK Emergency Services we have 
not been able to achieve our margin 
progression targets due to reduced 
volumes and closing out a significant 
proportion of larger, complex, lower 
margin jobs in our Buildings business. 
The margin decline is accentuated by 
the transfer of claims management 
and policy repair networks into 
UK Membership. Margins in these 
transferred businesses have improved 
through operational efficiencies as a 
result of one division, UK Membership, 
now being responsible for the entire 
customer journey. 
Core and non-core operations
We continue to consider that profit 
before the amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles and tax on our joint 
venture in France represents an 
important performance measure for 
monitoring the business. In addition, 
in the current year the impairment 
charge of £97m and exceptional 
operating costs of £6.5m are excluded 
in calculating these pro-forma 
managerial measures. The revenue 
and operating profit of our four 
operating businesses is set out on 
page 23.
Revenue for the Group, including 
non-core operations, has decreased 
by 7% to £517m (2008: £555m). 
Operating profit* has increased by 
10% to £100.3m (2008: £91.0m). The 
acquisition of SPT completed in the 
year has increased operating profits* 
by £0.4m, representing 0.4% of the 
year on year growth.
Revenue for core operations has 
increased by 8% to £284m (2008: 
£263m) and operating profit* has 
increased by 22% to £92.3m (2008: 
£75.8m). Excluding the impact of 
acquisitions, revenue increased by 
7% and operating profit* increased by 
21%.
The operating profit* improvement 
reported for the Group and core 
operations principally relates to the 
strong performance in our three policy 
membership businesses. 
Our UK Membership business has 
delivered another strong year of 
growth with operating profit* up 14%, 
policy growth of 7%, a retention rate 
of 83% and improved efficiency in 
handling customer claims and service 
delivery.
The contribution from our European 
business has trebled in the year with 
operating profit* increasing to £5.3m 
(2008: £1.8m) and revenue growing 
by 100% to £63.4m (2008: £31.7m). 
Revenue of Doméo, our French joint 
venture with Veolia, has increased 
55% in local currency and 82% in GBP 
as a result of continued strong policy 
growth and an improved underwriting 
deal. The total operating profit* of 
Doméo increased by 106% to £14.0m 
(2008: £6.8m). 
Policy growth of 52% in the US on the 
back of successful marketing and high 
take up rates with our utility partners 
has resulted in a reduced operating 
loss* to £0.3m (2008: loss* of £2.2m). 
Our US business made a profit in the 
second half and is now profitable on 
an ongoing basis. The completion 
of agreements with Utilities Inc. 
and SEMCO and the opening up of 
additional territories with existing 
affinity partners has contributed to an 
increase in affinity partner households 
in the US of 0.8m. Cash flow and financing

** Non cash items are depreciation, amortisation of other intangibles, share based payments expense, share of results of joint venture 
(before tax) and loss/(gain) on disposal of property, plant and equipment and software licenses
UK Emergency Services has seen 
revenue decline by 20% to £234m 
(2008: £292m) and operating profit* 
decrease by 47% to £8.0m (2008: 
£15.1m). The decline in revenue is 
due to an underlying fall in volumes 
from increasingly competitive market 
conditions and last year’s volumes 
including £41m of work relating to the 
summer floods. The fall in volumes, 
increasing pricing pressure combined 
with the completion of a higher 
proportion of larger, more complex 
jobs in the year has resulted in 
margins* falling to 3.4% (2008: 5.2%).
Impairment charges and 
exceptional costs
During the year we incurred 
exceptional costs of £1.5m relating 
to the aborted second hub deal and 
£5m relating to the reorganisation of 
our UK businesses, of which £2.7m 
related to UK Emergency Services, 
making the total exceptional cost for 
the year £6.5m. The reorganisation 
has resulted in approximately £7m 
of ongoing annual benefits which 
is enabling us to respond to the 
challenging conditions in Emergency 
Services and to increase our focus 
this year on customer growth in UK 
Membership. 
A review of the carrying value of 
Emergency Services assets at 
the year-end resulted in the write 
down of these assets by £97m. This 
impairment charge comprises: £59.2m 
of goodwill; £17m of acquisition 
intangibles; £8.7m of software 
assets; £5.1m of property, plant and 
equipment and £7.2m of other net 
current assets. 
Acquisitions
HomeServe continues to add to 
its organic growth through the 
completion of carefully selected 
acquisitions. Acquisition spend during 
the year totalled £15.8m, with a further 
£7.6m of deferred consideration paid 
in relation to acquisitions completed in 
prior years.
During the year, two significant 
acquisitions have been completed 
for cash consideration of £5.7m 
including the acquisition of 100% 
of the relevant share capital of SPT, 
Belgium’s leading claims handling and 
subcontract repair network business, 
and home assistance policies from 
Endesa Hogar. Including acquisitions 
completed in prior years, potential 
further deferred consideration 
payments of £14.4m could be due over 
the next 10 years, of which £5.0m is 
due within the coming year.
In addition, a number of smaller 
acquisitions have been completed 
relating to certain Plumbing & 
Drainage premier contractors. The 
total cash consideration, including 
directly attributable costs, amounted 
to £12.4m. There are no further 
payments due in respect of these 
acquisitions.
The carrying value of goodwill 
and intangible assets identified 
on acquisitions completed in the 
current and previous years has been 
reviewed for impairment based on the 
current budgets and operating plans 
of the businesses. As a result, an 
impairment charge of £97m has been 
incurred against the carrying value of 
Emergency Services. No impairment 
is considered necessary for the three 
membership divisions.  23

Key Performance Indicators 
In order to assist in the management 
of the business and to provide 
evidence of achieving its strategic 
priorities, the Board regularly reviews 
a number of key performance 
indicators as set out on page 7. 
Risks and uncertainties
Financial risk
As part of its ordinary activities, 
HomeServe is exposed to a number of 
financial risks, principally liquidity risk 
and credit risk. The Group has policies 
and procedures on how these risks 
will be monitored and managed.
Liquidity risk relates to the Group’s 
ability to meet the cash flow 
requirements of the operations, while 
avoiding excessive levels of debt. The 
Group’s borrowings are principally in 
the form of short and medium term 
revolving credit facilities, which can be 
drawn down on demand, providing 
flexible access to debt when required. 
The total amount available under the 
facility is £150m and the renewal date 
is December 2012. The amount of any 
committed undrawn facilities is closely 
monitored by the Board on a regular 
basis.
Foreign exchange rate risk is not 
considered to represent a significant 
risk at this time due to the absence 
of significant foreign currency 
transactions. However, this risk is kept 
under constant review and policies 
exist to mitigate this risk should it 
increase in significance.
Credit risk principally relates to 
trade receivables from customers. 
Detailed policies and procedures for 
the assessment of all customers are 
in place including reviewing credit 
history and setting appropriate credit 
limits before trading commences. 
The majority of our trade receivable 
balances within our core operations 
relate to our membership customers 
who either pay in advance or by 
continuous payment methods, such as 
direct debit.
Commercial relationships
Underpinning the success in each 
of our chosen markets are close 
commercial relationships with 
a number of utility companies, 
household insurers, household 
appliance manufacturers and furniture 
retailers. Many of these are long term 
contractual relationships and the loss 
of these relationships could have a 
significant effect on the Group’s future 
profitability and cash flows. This risk is 
managed through regular reviews and 
contact with the senior management 
of these customers in order to ensure 
that we respond to their needs and 
deliver the service that they expect.
Competitors
Additionally, there are a number of 
other businesses that provide services 
that are similar to those of the Group 
and as such could compete in one or 
more of our chosen markets. In order 
to address this risk, a regular review 
of the market and our position is 
undertaken and the activities of other 
participants are closely monitored. 
The development of innovative 
products and solutions which address 
the needs of our customers is seen 
as paramount to maintaining our 
competitive advantage.  25
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Acquisitions
As part of our overall risk 
management, all potential 
acquisitions are subjected to a 
rigorous review, commencing with a 
detailed assessment of the target’s 
position in the market. We have a 
dedicated acquisitions team which 
involves and coordinates managers 
from our existing businesses and 
draws on the services of independent 
advisers when necessary. The ability 
to integrate the acquisitions into our 
existing businesses is considered 
at the outset. Immediately post 
acquisition, a full internal controls 
benchmarking assessment is 
undertaken and the Group’s internal 
control standards are implemented as 
soon as practicable. The performance 
of acquisitions is reported and 
reviewed by the Board on a monthly 
basis.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set 
out in the Chairman’s statement and 
the Chief Executive’s review. Principal 
risks and uncertainties are detailed 
in this review. In addition, this review 
includes, amongst other things, cash 
flow and financing information.
The Directors confirm that, after 
reviewing the Group’s budget and 
projected cash flows, they have a 
reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the 
accounts.
Summary
Despite the impairment of Emergency 
Services assets resulting in a statutory 
loss before tax in the period, I am 
pleased to report another very good 
underlying financial performance 
for HomeServe with continued 
strong profit* growth and margin* 
progression. 
Our membership businesses have 
once again driven this growth, with 
our international operations now 
into profit and action being taken to 
exit the higher risk, lower margin UK 
Emergency Services business. The 
business continues to generate strong 
levels of cash conversion and this, 
combined with low financial gearing 
enables us to access the funds 
required for strategic acquisitions that 
accelerate the development of our 
membership-focused business. 
The business is well positioned for 
continued future growth with a strong 
finance team in place to help drive the 
business forward.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Corporate  
responsibility
We recognise that a big part of our 
business’s future success depends on us 
taking into account the interests of all of 
our stakeholders. We are committed to 
the operation of a responsible business 
model and are developing our activities in 
this area. We will continue to report on our 
progress in implementing key initiatives.
Employees
We recognise that one of our major 
stakeholders is our people. All our 
employees are crucial to HomeServe’s 
future growth and success. Because 
of this, we are committed to improving 
our employee engagement and 
learning more about our staff’s needs. 
We believe HomeServe is a good 
employer, but we are very aware that 
we need to listen to our employees 
in order to ascertain how HomeServe 
can become an even better place to 
work.
In the past year, we have 
developed various existing internal 
communications programmes as well 
as initiating some new activities.
From November of 2008, the newly 
designed staff magazine, Homelife, 
has been published every two 
months. This new, smaller format 
publication aims to both represent the 
entire workforce and be entertaining. 
The magazine is posted to the home 
addresses of all field-based staff, 
whilst other employees (including 
those in our overseas sites) can obtain 
a copy from the main office locations. 
Feedback from the readership has 
been very positive so far.
The Group intranet, which launched 
last year, has been developed both 
as a document store and business 
tool and as a communication medium 
that has wide reach and immediate 
appeal.
Corporate responsibility At the start of the year, the Internal 
Communications team conducted two 
surveys, one online and one print-
based, as well as facilitating a series 
of focus groups across the UK sites. 
Employee forums continue to meet 
regularly at many sites and there are 
plans to develop web casts and online 
Q&As via the intranet.
We realise that our staff’s views and 
opinions are fundamental to our 
future success. We also recognise 
that employees should be rewarded 
when they have done a good job. 
Our HomeServe Heroes employee 
recognition scheme has seen dozens 
of staff across the Group celebrated 
and remunerated for jobs well done. 
All HomeServe Heroes winners will be 
invited to an awards event this June, 
which will celebrate both their success 
and the benefit their hard work brings 
to the business overall.
Training and development is also 
very important at HomeServe. As a 
business, we always look to recruit 
the best staff. To retain current 
and new talent, however, we know 
that we must offer our employees 
development opportunities and 
career progression. Our performance 
management review process enables 
us to identify training needs and 
to provide training solutions in a 
consistent and targeted manner. 
What’s more, the delivery of many of 
these programmes is carried out by 
our own training specialists. 29
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Our performance development review 
process enables clear objective 
setting for all employees of manager 
grade or above. This, along with the 
Leadership Excellence Framework, 
which was implemented recently, 
allows individual management staff 
to work with the Company to identify 
their current performance as well as 
their future training and development 
needs. Such forward planning is 
crucial to HomeServe’s success overall: 
it ensures that we will have the best 
possible management resource to 
support our growth.
We are also significantly developing 
the apprenticeship opportunities 
available at HomeServe. 
Apprenticeships are an integral part 
of our plans to develop a skilled 
workforce for the future and as 
such form a central element of our 
developing recruitment and training 
strategy.
Health and Safety 
Our record
During the last 12 months, 
HomeServe has continued to improve 
its management of health and 
safety (H&S) across the business 
and, wherever possible, to deliver 
improvements in both areas. Clearly, 
our H&S strategy is concerned 
with ensuring compliance with 
legal standards. Beyond this legal 
imperative, however, we aim, where 
practicable, to investigate and adopt 
good industry practice and to ensure 
that this knowledge and expertise is 
shared across HomeServe.
Apprenticeships are an integral part of 
our plans to develop a skilled workforce 
for the future
During the past year, we have 
proactively engaged our customers, 
clients and partners about H&S 
issues. A clear indicator of the success 
of this engagement is demonstrated 
by the fact that we have had limited 
contact with the Enforcing Authority 
during the year. Moreover, no 
prosecutions have been taken against 
HomeServe for breaches of health 
and safety regulations and no other 
statutory notices have been issued.
Health and safety management
Over recent years, HomeServe has 
consistently achieved an acceptable 
safety record via good leadership from 
the senior management team and by 
engaging the workforce. As a whole, 
the Company also continues to expect 
its operating businesses to ensure 
compliance with health and safety 
legislation regardless of the country in 
which each operates. 
The senior team continues to believe 
in and drive the principle that 
management must own the health 
and safety process throughout the 
group. This is a key element of our bid 
to engender a culture of health and 
safety awareness and practice across 
the group. Each of the operating 
businesses is required to have a 
specific health and safety policy and 
a supporting management system 
that are underpinned by a robust risk 
assessment process, which reflects 
the risks within each particular 
business.  30
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Corporate  
responsibility
To ensure that senior management is 
aware of the risks within the business, 
health and safety performance 
reports are routinely generated and 
submitted, the contents of which are 
reviewed and discussed at Executive 
Committee and Board levels. Jonathan 
Simpson-Dent, Chief Financial Officer, 
has continued to be the Main Board 
Director responsible for reporting on 
health and safety, but the Board as a 
whole remains responsible for health 
and safety issues across the Group.
We believe that, to be successful 
in effectively managing health and 
safety, our management teams must 
be properly trained. Over the last 18 
months, we have significantly invested 
in the use of proprietary training 
packages such as ‘IOSH Managing 
Safety’ and the ‘IOSH Health and 
Safety for Senior Managers’ package 
to ensure our managers have the 
correct tools for ensuring health and 
safety is managed effectively. 
This investment in the training of 
our managers has also laterally 
improved the competence of our 
dedicated safety practitioners. Not 
only are they are able to witness 
the buy-in that their respective line 
managers are making to H&S, but 
they are also enjoying specific financial 
support, which is funding their own 
professional development and 
competence. 
To ensure that health and safety is 
adequately resourced, each of the 
operating businesses has access to 
at least one full-time practitioner and 
additional support is available from 
the Group Health and Safety Manager 
when required. 
Accident and injury
One measure of health and safety 
standards in a business is accident 
and injury rates. Within the UK, 
under the requirements of the 
Reporting of Injuries, Diseases, and 
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 
1995 (RIDDOR), certain types of 
accidents or incidents need to be 
reported to the Health and Safety 
Executive. Overall, HomeServe has 
had a generally good year in terms 
of the number of reportable events. 
During 2008/9, the accident rates 
across the Group have shown a small 
improvement, see chart opposite, 
with some of the individual operating 
businesses showing improvements 
in particular categories or types of 
accidents. We have experienced no 
employee fatalities, ‘Major Injuries’ 
or ‘Dangerous Occurrences’ as 
defined by RIDDOR. However, we 
did experience a total of 37 RIDDOR-
defined ‘3 day’ reportable lost-time 
events: this is a slight reduction from 
the previous year when 39 such events 
were recorded. 
In total, during the last year there  
were 398 incidents or accidents 
recorded within HomeServe’s 
businesses, of which 63 involved 
an employee requiring hospital 
treatment. Overall, a total of 538 
working days were lost as a result 
of work-related accidents: this is an 
increase of 87 working days compared 
to those lost in the previous year. Number of RIDDOR reportable incidents
Within the UK, under

of accidents or incidents

Corporate  
responsibility
As with previous years, the majority of 
accidents or incidents that occurred 
involved manual handling, cuts and 
bruises or muscular strains. During 
the coming year, the reduction of 
accidents and incidents rates within 
the businesses will continue to be a 
key challenge. 
April 2009 saw a significant change 
to how contractors who undertake 
work on domestic gas systems are 
administered and centrally approved. 
Since that time, the long-established 
CORGI registration system has ceased 
to exist and the Health and Safety 
Executive has introduced a new 
registration scheme called the ‘Gas 
Safe Register’. The introduction of 
this new scheme could have had a 
significant impact on HomeServe as 
it manages a number of gas-systems 
contractors. To ensure its contractors 
complied with the new requirements 
in a timely manner, HomeServe 
worked closely with its contractor 
network to ensure appropriate 
registrations were made under the 
new system. 
HomeServe continues to view the 
management of its contractors as a 
critical factor in striving to effectively 
manage health and safety risks. To 
improve the current process even 
further, we have invested in the in-
house auditing resource, doubling the 
current resource level for undertaking 
audits of contractors’ health and 
safety performances.
Our employees’ well-being
HomeServe ensures employees 
receive occupational health support 
when required and this is currently 
provided by local HR functions. During 
the coming months, a challenge for 
the company will be to develop an 
occupational health and well-being 
strategy. Such a strategy will ensure 
that a consistent approach towards 
business H&S performance and 
employees’ welfare is adopted across 
the group. It will also be a strategy 
that meets government expectations.
Although a number of achievements 
have been made by the business 
in the area of effectively managing 
health and safety, it is expected that 
H&S will remain a continued priority 
for us in coming years. In 2009/10, it 
is envisaged that significant effort will 
continue to be applied in the following 
areas:
Embedding the H&S policies and •	
management system within the 
operating businesses
Develop a robust system for the •	
management of occupational road 
risk
Development of and refinement of •	
the risk assessment process
Ongoing management of •	
the contractor network, with 
investments being made to 
strengthen the selection and audit 
process
The launch of a new corporate •	
health and safety audit programme 
to provide up-to-date information 
about H&S across the Group
We are committed to managing 
our business in an environmentally 
conscientious way, which will result in 
real benefits to both the environment 
and the business. 33
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Environment
This year, HomeServe has 
further committed to reducing its 
environmental impact. We are also 
actively managing responses to the 
challenges the government’s latest 
environmental targets present to our 
business, as well as complying with 
wider environmental legislation.
The Group Environmental Steering 
Committee, headed by our Chairman, 
Brian Whitty, has been instrumental in 
driving changes across the business 
over the past year. The committee 
members have ensured that the 
environmental strategy is aligned with 
wider business strategy and that key, 
environmentally beneficial projects 
have been progressed during the year.
The environmental plans that have 
been actioned in the past year will 
enable us to reduce our environmental 
impacts over the next 12 months in the 
following core areas: 
Transport (including our commercial •	
fleet)
Energy consumption •	
Waste management at all of our •	
sites 
Paper usage (both for marketing •	
purposes and internal business 
requirements)
In addition, there is continued 
commitment by the business to 
implement the environmental 
management system, Group wide. 
In 2008, both HomeServe Glass and 
Locks and HomeServe Advanced 
Aluminium achieved the ISO14001 
environmental management system 
accreditation. During 2009/10 it is 
intended that the UK Membership 
business will also seek this 
accreditation.
Carbon footprint
To ensure that we continually 
improve our understanding of our 
environmental impacts, focus has to 
be, and will continue to be, placed 
on collating and analysing a wider 
cross section of environmental data. 
The data collated in 2008/9 has been 
utilised to determine HomeServe’s 
carbon footprint. 
HomeServe’s carbon footprint has 
increased from 20,600 tCO2-e in 
2007/8 to 22,567 tCO2-e. This increase 
was expected by the business due 
to business growth and because 
more robust measuring techniques 
have been put in place to ascertain 
the environmental impacts of the 
business. Going forward the strategic 
environmental focus for HomeServe is 
to reduce our environmental impact 
through better energy efficiency, 
improvements in fleet efficiencies and 
to reduce the amount of resources 
used and the waste we generate.
Reducing the impact of 
business travel
HomeServe has made changes this 
year which will enable a reduction 
in the carbon footprint of core 
business activities. Over the year, the 
strategy has focused on reducing the 
environmental impact of our fleet. We 
have done this by assessing the vans 
we use based on factors including 
efficiencies and CO2 emission levels. 
We therefore now select vehicles 
based on a life-cycle cost analysis 
which considers fuel efficiency, 
maintenance and repair costs as well 
as lease costs. We believe this is the 
more environmentally responsible 
option, which will lead to a reduction 
in the emissions profile of our fleet.  34
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Corporate  
responsibility
The significant investment made 
into the fleet’s telematics system 
and speed limiters in 2008 has also 
started to result in improvements 
in fuel efficiencies, with up to a 10% 
improvement in miles per gallon 
gained to date. This efficiency 
improvement is resulting in a 
reduction in the carbon intensity of our 
fleet. 
Our company car policy has facilitated 
changes that have led to HomeServe’s 
company car selection only including 
diesel vehicles – with the focus of our 
range also being on low emission 
bands; the average being 158 grams 
of CO2 per kilometer. We are also 
intending to reduce the cap of the 
CO2 levels of our company cars in the 
coming year to have a further positive 
impact on our emissions.
At the moment, air and rail travel 
made by HomeServe employees is 
minimal. However, we do have a 
growing international presence. We 
have therefore invested in video-
conferencing facilities that connect our 
key sites, both in the UK and overseas, 
which will help to avoid unnecessary 
travel. We will be carrying out a 
review of these facilities throughout 
this year with the aim of further 
reducing the need for travel by making 
improvements where needed.
Energy reduction
Reducing the energy consumption of 
HomeServe’s office sites is imperative 
to enable a reduction of our carbon 
emissions. This year, we have 
assessed where energy is consumed 
across our sites and plans have been 
put in place to facilitate changes that 
will enable a reduction in consumption 
to be achieved. The changes range 
from energy saving educational 
campaigns for our employees, through 
to facility and building modifications, 
which include additional metering 
services and more energy efficient 
equipment being installed. 
Recycling improvements
In order to increase the waste that we 
recycle, additional recycling facilities 
have been installed at our office sites. 
HomeServe Glass and Locks branches 
also provide tradesmen with facilities 
to collect recyclable materials such 
as glass, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and 
garage doors. During 2009/10, further 
recycling facilities will be put in place 
across the business to support our 
aim of reducing the waste that is not 
recycled.
The future
HomeServe realises the importance 
of making continual changes to 
its business in order to reduce the 
environmental impact it has in 
the short and long term. We are 
committed to managing our business 
in an environmentally conscientious 
way, which will result in real benefits 
to both the environment and the 
business.
Community
HomeServe has main office sites in 
eight towns and cities in the UK and 
operates from dozens of depots. We 
also have overseas operations in 
France, Spain and the US, and have 
now added Belgium to this list having 
commenced business in the Benelux 
region earlier this year.
With such a widely spaced 
geographical presence, we 
understand the importance of 
developing and maintaining 
responsible business practices, which 
both support and enhance the diverse 
communities in which we are based.
We have a dedicated community 
development resource, based at our 
head office in Walsall, UK, and take 
our community involvement very 
seriously. 35
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Charitable support
As a member of the UK charity, 
Business in the Community, 
HomeServe has committed itself to 
numerous voluntary projects in many 
of its locations over the past year. 
Many of our sites have programmes 
in place that enable staff to sponsor 
local groups with which they have 
an affiliation, and in Preston and 
Weston-super-Mare we have 
community committees which focus 
on building links with the community 
and fundraising. Staff from across 
the business are able to contribute 
to regular employment volunteering 
projects by offering their time and 
talents to local groups and causes.
During the past year, our major 
donation scheme – Charity Begins at 
HomeServe – has seen three projects 
local to our office sites receive £5,000 
each in the form of direct financial 
assistance and specialist HomeServe 
tradesmen’s labour.
The good causes that have benefited 
from our major donations to date are 
a drug prevention group, a sports 
centre and a regional branch of 
the children’s charity Barnado’s. In 
the coming year, Charity Begins at 
HomeServe will extend its financial 
assistance to other communities 
that we are part of and all our staff 
will have the opportunity to influence 
which types of causes benefit from 
donations.
Representing the communities  
we serve
As a company that employs large 
numbers of local residents in all 
our main offices (our head office 
in Walsall in the West Midlands is 
the largest commercial employer 
in the town) we are very aware that 
we have a responsibility to those 
communities. As an employer, we 
actively seek to represent the diversity 
of all the communities we operate 
in and serve, and we particularly 
welcome applications from groups 
which are under represented in our 
current workforce. HomeServe’s stock 
and trade is the homes of its local 
residents. We aim to serve these 
residents and employ them. 36

Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Directors’ report
The Directors have pleasure in presenting their Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2009.
Principal activities
During the year the Group was engaged in the provision of insured repair solutions and emergency services to 
the home. Details of the Group’s activities and a review of the business are set out in the Chairman’s 
statement, Chief Executive’s review and Financial review.
Details of the Key Performance Indicators used by the Directors to assist in the management of the business 
and to provide evidence of the achievement of its strategies are included on page 11.
A description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group is included in the Financial review.
Information relating to the environment and employees is included in the Corporate social responsibility 
report. 
Financial results and dividends
The Group’s results are shown in the Group income statement on page 70. The Directors are recommending 
the payment on 4 August 2009 of a final dividend of 25 pence per ordinary share to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 3 July 2009 which, together with the net interim dividend of 10.5 pence 
per ordinary share paid on 5 January 2009, results in a total net dividend for the year of 35.5 pence per 
share (2008: 31.25p). For further details of the dividend see note 13 to the financial statements.
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company’s 
issued share capital during the year are shown in note 27. The Company has one class of ordinary shares 
which carries no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the 
Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both 
governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are 
not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 38. No votes are cast in respect of the shares held in 
the Employee Benefit Trust and dividends are waived.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully 
paid. Subject to the Companies Acts and any relevant authority of the Company in general meeting, the 
Company has authority to issue any of the unissued share capital.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease arrangements and 
employees’ share plans. None of these are considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the 
business of the Group as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any agreements between the 
Company and its Directors and employees that provide for compensation for loss of office or employment that 
occurs because of a takeover bid.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Directors’ report
Having been appointed since the last Annual General Meeting, Mark Morris will retire from the Board in 
accordance with Articles of Association and, being eligible, will offer himself for election. Jon Florsheim and 
Barry Gibson retire by rotation and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. Jon Florsheim serves 
under a contract of employment terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party. Messrs Morris and Gibson 
serve under three year renewable letters of appointment which provide for liquidated damages limited to 
the payment of a maximum of one year’s fees in the event of early termination by the Company.
In respect of the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of 
Association, the Combined Code, the Companies Acts and related legislation. The Articles may be 
amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The powers of Directors are described in the Board’s 
terms of reference (which are available on request from the Company Secretary) and the Corporate 
governance statement.
The beneficial interests of the Directors in the shares of the Company and the options held as at 31 March 
2009 and 19 May 2009 are set out in the Remuneration report. None of the Directors serving at the year end 
had a beneficial interest in the share capital of any subsidiary company.
Each of the Directors confirms that as far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware and that he has taken all reasonable steps to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Annual General Meeting
The following special business will be transacted at the Annual General Meeting of the Company, to be held 
on 31 July 2009.
Allotment of shares and pre-emption rights
There will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting a renewal of the Directors’ general authority to allot 
shares up to a maximum nominal amount (‘the Section 80 Amount‘) and the Directors’ authority to issue 
shares for cash without applying the statutory pre-emption rights up to a maximum nominal amount (‘the 
Section 89 Amount‘). The Directors confirm that they presently have no intention to issue more than 7½% of 
the issued ordinary share capital shown in the latest published annual accounts by way of non pre-emptive 
issues for cash in any rolling three year period.
They also confirm that, in the event of an issue of shares other than on a pre-emptive basis, the amount of 
the discount (if any), at which equity is issued for cash other than to shareholders, will be limited to a 
maximum of 5% of the middle of the best bid and offer prices immediately prior to the announcement of an 
issue or proposed issue.
Authority to purchase own shares
Approval is being sought for the Company to renew the authority contained in the Articles of Association to 
purchase its own ordinary shares. The Board has no firm intention that the Company should make 
purchases of its own shares if the proposed authority becomes effective, but would like to be able to act 
quickly if circumstances arise in which such a purchase would be desirable. Purchases will only be made on 
the London Stock Exchange and only in circumstances where the Board believes that they are in the best 
interests of the shareholders generally and would result in an increase in earnings per share. Any shares 
purchased would be cancelled.
Further detail on the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting can be found in the 
Shareholder Circular.
Auditors
A resolution proposing the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditors and authorising the Board to fix their 
remuneration will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
Fixed assets
Capital expenditure on tangible fixed assets amounted to £4.1m (2008: £10.1m) during the year.
Donations
Charitable donations of £43,000 (2008: £37,000) were made during the year. No political contributions were 
made in either year. 43
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Payment of creditors
The Group’s policy is to pay suppliers in line with the terms of payment agreed with each of them when 
contracting for their products or services. Trade creditors at 31 March 2009 represented 68 days of 
purchases during the year (2008: 67 days) for the Group and 44 for the Company (2008: 45 days).
Substantial shareholdings
As far as the Directors are aware, no person had a beneficial interest in 3% or more of the voting share 
capital at 8 May 2009, except for the following:

Taxation status
The Company is not a close company within the meaning of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Employment policies
It is the Group’s policy that all persons should be considered for employment, training, career development 
and promotion on the basis of their abilities and aptitudes, regardless of physical ability, age, gender, 
sexual orientation, religion or ethnic origin. 
HomeServe applies employment policies that are fair and equitable for all employees and which ensure 
entry into and progression within the Group are determined solely by application of job criteria and 
personal ability and competency.
Full and fair consideration (having regard to the person’s particular aptitudes and abilities) is given to 
applications for employment and the career development of disabled persons. HomeServe’s training and 
development policies make it clear that it will take all steps practicable to ensure that employees who 
become disabled during the time they are employed by the Group are able to continue to perform  
their duties.
Employee involvement
HomeServe attaches considerable importance to ensuring that all its employees are provided with 
information concerning them as employees, particularly the economic and financial factors affecting its 
performance and the market in which it operates. Involvement of employees in the Group’s performance is 
also encouraged by the availability of performance-related bonuses as well as share option schemes, 
which are described in more detail elsewhere in this report. Internal circulars and newsletters are issued on 
a regular basis and consultation between management and staff is an ongoing process. Employees are 
consulted on issues directly affecting them wherever practicable. Further details of HomeServe’s policies 
and practices relating to employee involvement may be found in the Corporate responsibility report.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Corporate governance
HomeServe complied throughout the year with the provisions set out in the Combined Code published by 
the UK Financial Reporting Council in 2003 as updated in June 2006 (the ‘Code’).
The manner in which the Company applies the principles of good governance contained in the Code is 
described in the appropriate parts of this Annual Report and Accounts. Thus the application by the 
Company of the Code’s principles relating to remuneration matters in the Remuneration report should be 
read in conjunction with the statement below. A review of the Group’s position and prospects is set out in 
the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review and the Financial review.
The Board
The Board of Directors leads and controls the Company by holding at least eight meetings a year at which 
its current and forecast performance is reviewed and monitored. Regular reports on monthly performance 
and other matters of importance to the Group ensure that the Board is supplied in a timely manner with the 
information necessary to make informed judgements. In addition, the Board holds regular meetings at least 
annually, also attended by senior operational management, to devise and discuss the Company’s medium 
and long term strategic focus and management development strategy. Regular formal and informal 
presentations are given and meetings held in order to apprise Directors of issues of importance affecting 
the Group. Occasionally, meetings of the Board are held at the Company’s operating sites other than 
Walsall, in order to afford the Board, particularly the Non-Executive Directors, with the opportunity to meet 
with local management.
In accordance with the provisions of its Articles of Association and with the Code, each Director is subject to 
election by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting immediately following his 
appointment and is subject to re-election at least every three years thereafter.
The Board has a Schedule of Matters specifically reserved to it for decision and has approved the written 
terms of reference of the various committees to which it has delegated its authority in certain matters. 
Matters reserved to the Board include the recommendation or approval of dividends, the approval of 
preliminary and interim financial statements, major financial commitments, the acquisitions of significant 
companies or businesses, appointments to the Board and its Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
committees, the Company’s future strategy and its internal controls. It also provides that the Board receive 
regular updates from the chairmen of its committees.
During the year the Board was led by Brian Whitty, the Chairman, who also served as a member of the 
Board’s Nomination Committee.
The Chairman’s responsibilities are clearly defined in a written specification agreed by the Board and which 
makes clear the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive. They include the 
smooth running of the Board, effective communication between Executive and Non-Executive Directors and 
the general progress and long term development of the Group. His executive responsibilities include overall 
responsibility for Emergency Services following the departure of Ian Carlisle.
The Board has established a formal procedure for Directors wishing to seek independent legal and  
other professional advice and all members of the Board have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary.
The day-to-day running of HomeServe’s business is delegated to an Executive Committee which is led by 
Richard Harpin, Chief Executive. Other members of the Executive Committee, together with biographical 
details, are listed on page 39.
During the year, four independent Non-Executive Directors (Messrs Maxwell, Chippendale, Gibson and 
Sibbald) with extensive business, finance and marketing backgrounds, provided the Board with a breadth  
of experience and with independent judgement. John Maxwell served as the Company’s senior 
independent Non-Executive Director until 27 February 2009 when he was replaced by Barry Gibson. Mark 
Morris was appointed as an independent Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee on 
27 February 2009. 45
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
The Board actively encourages all Directors to deepen their knowledge of their roles and responsibilities 
and to gain a clear understanding of the Group and the environment in which it operates; and has adopted 
a formal policy on the induction and training of Directors. Newly appointed Board members are required to 
undergo an induction programme, which includes obtaining a thorough understanding of the Group’s 
various operations, and they have the opportunity to receive formal training from external providers if they 
wish. During the year, the Non-Executive Directors have met with various members of the Group’s 
management teams and external advisers. Further training for Directors has been provided as appropriate 
during the year, including training in relation to their duties under the Companies Act 2006.
The Board has implemented a formal process for reviewing its own effectiveness, that of its Remuneration 
and Audit committees and its individual members. In addition, it continued to ensure that regular meetings 
of the Non-Executive Directors were held without the Executive Directors, and at least once a year, without 
the Chairman present, in order to evaluate his performance. The evaluation process, which was conducted 
by the Chairman and Company Secretary, was concluded in March 2008. Directors completed evaluation 
questionnaires, and attended one-to-one meetings with the Chairman and Company Secretary to discuss 
the existing and future needs of the Board, its composition and the skills of its members. A formal written 
report summarising their views and containing recommendations to further improve the effectiveness of 
the Board and its committees was prepared by the Company Secretary and reviewed by the whole Board in 
March 2008. The Board concluded that it and the committees reviewed operate effectively, although a 
number of recommendations for further improvement were approved. Meetings with the Chairman to 
discuss feedback relating to the effectiveness of individual Directors took place in April 2008. Following this, 
a further informal review was undertaken in summer 2009 by an external consultant to explore in more 
detail certain aspects of the feedback. The results of this external review were considered by the Board in 
January 2009.
Committees
The Board operates a number of committees to which it has delegated certain specific responsibilities and 
each of which has formally adopted terms of reference. These comprise the Nomination, Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. The terms of reference of each of the Board’s committees are available on 
request from the Company Secretary.
A Risk Committee, comprising certain Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, 
operates across the Group and is chaired by Jonathan Simpson-Dent. Its terms of reference have been 
approved by the Board and its purpose is to establish the Group’s risk appetite, to evaluate the risk registers 
compiled by each of its businesses, to monitor the effectiveness of its action plans for the mitigation of 
those risks, and to report thereon to the Audit Committee and the Board, which retains responsibility for the 
overall evaluation of the Group’s risk management processes.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee, which makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment of Directors, 
is chaired by Brian Whitty, and Ian Chippendale, Barry Gibson and John Maxwell, independent Non-
Executive Directors also all served on the Committee throughout the year or in the case of John Maxwell, 
until 27 February 2009. Other members of the Board may be invited, but are not entitled, to attend its 
meetings. The Committee draws on the advice of such professional advisers as it considers necessary and, 
during the year, met informally on several occasions to consider the possible appointment of a new 
Non-Executive Director. Having consulted professional advisers and informal contacts, Mark Morris was 
appointed on 27 February 2009.
Its duties include the review of the size, structure and composition required of the Board, and succession 
planning for Directors and other senior managers. During the year, these duties were undertaken by the 
Board itself. 46 Governance
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Corporate governance
Audit Committee
Until 27 February 2009 the Audit Committee was chaired by John Maxwell, a chartered accountant and the 
senior independent Non-Executive Director. The Committee comprises only independent Non-Executive 
Directors with Barry Gibson and Ian Chippendale being the other members. Mark Morris was appointed 
Chairman of the Committee on 27 February 2009. He comes from a strong financial background having 
worked in audit, business advisory and corporate finance before becoming a plc finance director.
The Committee meets regularly to review the preliminary and interim results before they are presented to 
the Board, to receive reports from the Company’s internal and external auditors and to make 
recommendations to the Board on accounting policies. Its primary duties include the monitoring, on behalf 
of the Board, of compliance with and the effectiveness of the Company’s accounting and internal control 
systems. The Committee’s duties also include agreeing audit strategy, monitoring the scope and results of 
the Company’s annual audit and the independence and objectivity of its auditors. The internal and external 
auditors and the Chief Financial Officer are invited, but are not entitled, to attend all meetings. Where 
appropriate, the Chairman and Chief Executive and other Executive Directors also attend meetings at the 
Chairman’s invitation. The external and internal auditors are provided with the opportunity to raise any 
matters or concerns that they may have, in the absence of the Executive Directors, whether at Committee 
meetings or, more informally outside of them.
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board for a resolution to be put to the 
shareholders for their approval in general meeting for the appointment of the external auditors, the 
approval of their remuneration and their terms of engagement.
The Committee has implemented a policy relating to the use of the external auditors for non-audit services 
and monitors fees paid in respect of such services. This policy provides that, excluding certain specialist 
services, the total fees payable to the auditor for non-audit related work in any financial year should not 
normally be more than 50% of the total fees payable in respect of audit and compliance services. 
The Committee has also agreed and implemented a procedure for reviewing and assessing its own 
effectiveness and that of the external audit process. The results of the last review of the external audit 
process were considered by the Audit Committee in May 2009. 
Remuneration Committee
The Committee was chaired by Barry Gibson until 27 February 2009 when Ian Chippendale was appointed. 
The Committee comprises only independent Non-Executive Directors, Ian Chippendale and John Maxwell 
being its other members until 27 February 2009 and from that date, the other members were Barry Gibson 
and Mark Morris.
The Remuneration Committee’s responsibilities include determining the Group’s overall remuneration 
strategy and the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive 
Committee, after having consulted with the Chairman and Chief Executive and having received professional 
advice from remuneration consultants. The Committee is also responsible for approving the grant and 
exercise of executive long-term incentive arrangements. In determining remuneration policy, the Committee 
is free to obtain such professional advice as it sees fit, and regularly monitors both the policies of 
comparator companies and current market practice, in order to ensure that the packages provided are 
sufficient to attract and retain Executive Directors of the necessary quality.
The Committee has also agreed and implemented a procedure for reviewing and assessing its own 
effectiveness. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Company’s Board.
Short biographies of each of the Directors, including their membership of the Board’s committees outlined 
above, may be found on page 39. 47

Relationships with shareholders
The Board, on the Company’s behalf, recognises the need to maintain an active dialogue with its 
shareholders. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer meet regularly with institutional investors and 
analysts to discuss the Company’s performance and all shareholders have access to the senior 
independent Non-Executive Director and the Chairman, who are available to discuss any questions which 
investors may have in relation to the running of the Company. The Board encourages shareholders to 
attend the Annual General Meeting and is always willing to answer questions, either in the meeting itself 
or, more informally, afterwards. In addition, shareholders may contact HomeServe direct, either through its 
website or by telephoning its offices.
The Board also recognises the need to ensure that all Directors are fully aware of the views of major 
shareholders about the Group. Copies of all analysts’ research relating to the Company are circulated to all 
Directors upon publication, monthly analyses of the Company’s shareholder register are made available to 
the Board and written feedback from shareholders and analysts, prepared by the Group’s brokers and 
public relations advisers is provided to all Directors after every significant corporate event and at least twice 
a year.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development,  
performance and position are set out in the Chairman’s statement and the Chief Executive’s review.  
Principal risks and uncertainties are detailed in the Financial review. In addition, the Financial review 
includes, amongst other things, cash flow and financing information.
The Directors confirm that, after reviewing the Group’s budget and projected cash flows, they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing  
the accounts.
Internal controls
As required by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has complied throughout the year with the provisions 
of the Code relating to internal controls, having implemented the procedures necessary to comply with  
the guidance on internal control published in October 2005 (Turnbull Guidance) and to report in line with 
that guidance. 48 Governance
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.  
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
There is an established internal control framework in place, which is continually reviewed and updated 
taking into account the changing nature of the Group’s operations. This process has been in place for the 
whole of the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts. 
The key elements of the system operated by the Group to identify, evaluate and manage significant risks 
include the following:
The Group’s management operates a formal process for identifying, managing and reporting on •	
operational and financial risks faced by each of the Group’s businesses, whereby each of the risks 
identified is reviewed in detail by the Executive Directors on a regular basis. Weekly telephone meetings 
of the Executive Committee monitor its day-to-day performance, and full Executive Committee meetings 
are held on a monthly basis at which the Group’s senior managers report on the progress of the 
companies or discipline for which they are responsible and share best practice. 
A clearly defined organisation structure is in place with clear lines of accountability and appropriate •	
division of duties. The Group’s financial regulations specify authorisation limits for individual managers 
and for local Boards of management, with all material transactions being approved by the Board.
Three year business plans, annual budgets and investment proposals for each business are formally •	
prepared, reviewed and approved by the Board.
The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit function which reports directly to the Audit Committee and a •	
formal audit plan is in place to address the key risks across the Group.
Financial results and cash flows, including a comparison with budgets and forecasts, are reported to the •	
Board on a monthly basis, with variances being identified to initiate action to mitigate them.
Appropriate treasury policies are in place. •	
The Committee has adopted a formal ‘whistleblowing’ policy for employees who wish to raise any issues •	
of concern relating to the Company’s activities on a confidential basis. 
A mechanism exists to extend the Group’s formal risk management processes to any significant new •	
business acquired or begun by the Company immediately upon acquisition or start-up. In this way, the 
Board is able to confirm that the necessary process has been operated by the Group for the whole of  
the year.
At least twice a year, the Audit Committee reviews a register summarising the significant risks faced by •	
the businesses or the Group as a whole, the likelihood of those risks occurring and the steps being taken 
to minimise or otherwise manage those risks.
As required by the Turnbull Guidance, the Board has carried out an annual assessment of the effectiveness 
of the system of internal controls. The processes applied by the Board include:
At the end of the year, the Executive Directors compile a report identifying the key risks faced by the •	
Group. This report is considered by the Risk and Audit Committees and by the Board before the Annual 
Report and Accounts is approved.
The Group has an independent Internal Audit function which reviews the overall effectiveness of the risk •	
management process for the key risks and reports independently to the Audit Committee.
At each meeting the Audit Committee reviews reports of the Executive Directors and the internal and •	
external auditors, on any issues identified as having a potentially substantial impact on the results of the 
Group, or areas of control weakness.
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of managing financial risk and •

Remuneration report
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 (the ‘Act’) and 
has been approved by the Board and the Remuneration Committee. The report also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has 
applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration. A resolution to approve the 
report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Act requires the external auditors to report on certain parts of the report and to state whether, in their 
opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with it. The report has 
therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee 
Role
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the Board the pay, benefits 
and contractual arrangements for the Executive Directors of the Company (including the Chairman) and 
other members of the Executive Committee. It aims to develop and recommend remuneration strategies 
that drive performance and reward it appropriately. In determining its policy, the Committee has paid 
regard to the principles and provisions of good governance contained in the Combined Code published in 
July 2003 by the UK Financial Reporting Council as updated in June 2006 (the ‘Code‘). The Committee 
operates under the delegated authority of the Board and its terms of reference are available on request 
from the Company Secretary. 
Membership
The Committee was chaired by Barry Gibson until 27 February 2009 when Ian Chippendale was appointed 
as Chairman, having been a member of the Committee throughout the year. Barry Gibson remains a 
member of the Committee. John Maxwell served on the Committee until 27 February 2009 when Mark 
Morris was appointed to replace him. All of the members are independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Meetings
Attendance at Committee meetings held during the year and the number of meetings held is set out on 
page 47. 
Advisers
During the year Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS), a firm of independent remuneration consultants, served 
as advisers to the Committee. The Company also instructed HNBS to advise it on a limited number of 
remuneration matters concerning individuals below the Executive Committee during the year. Other than in 
relation to advice on remuneration, HNBS has no other connections with the Company. The terms of 
engagement for HNBS are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee has also received assistance from Brian Whitty, the Group’s Chairman, Richard Harpin, the 
Chief Executive, the Company Secretary (Emma Thomas until July 2008 and then Anna Maughan) and until 
his departure in October 2008, Martin Sawkins, the Group HR Director, all of whom attended meetings of 
the Committee as required. None took part in discussions in respect of matters relating directly to their own 
remuneration. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee’s remuneration policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors and other senior 
executives is based on the following principles: 
to provide a remuneration package that is sufficient, but no more than necessary, to attract, retain and •	
motivate high calibre executives;
to align rewards with the Group’s performance; •	
to reward good performance with remuneration that is in line with that payable by broadly comparable •	
businesses i.e. high-growth companies of a similar size and those with similar operating characteristics;
to reward exceptional performance in such a way as to align the executives’ interests with those of the •	
Company’s shareholders, delivering upper quartile rewards for upper quartile performance. 50 Governance
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Remuneration report
To that end, the Committee structures executive remuneration in two distinct parts: fixed remuneration of 
basic salary, pension and benefits and variable performance-related remuneration in the form of a cash 
bonus and long-term incentive arrangements. Remuneration for Executive Directors is structured so that the 
variable pay element forms a significant portion of each Director’s package. 
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable pay at ‘on-target’ and maximum 
performance levels, in the case of the long-term incentive arrangements assuming certain levels of share 
price growth. Maximum performance assumes the achievement of maximum bonus and full vesting of 
shares under the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements.
They demonstrate the significant weighting of the package towards variable (performance-related) pay. In 
particular, the majority of Executive Directors’ total remuneration at the maximum performance level will 
derive from the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements, which are strongly aligned to shareholder 
value creation.
The Committee has the discretion to take into account performance on environmental, social and 
governance matters when setting the remuneration of the Chairman and Executive Directors. However, the 
Committee has chosen not to take these into specific account in setting performance targets for 2009/10 in 
the belief that the structures in place neither encourage nor reward inappropriate behaviour in this regard 
and that relevant operational controls relating to such matters are in place.
Key activities of the Remuneration Committee during the year
In line with its remit, the following key issues were discussed by the Committee during the year;
Review of salary levels for the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee; •	
Agree the bonuses payable for the 2007/8 financial year; •	
Determination of the targets for the 2008/9 annual bonus plan; •	
Finalise the design of the 2008 LTIP and pre-consult with major institutional investors; •

2008 LTIP;
Review of the performance targets and confirmation of the level of vesting of 2005 share option and •	
deferred share bonus plan awards and approve vesting levels of other awards for ‘good leavers’ from 
the Company as appropriate;
Review of and agreement to all Director joining and leaving arrangements, covering all elements of their •	
reward package;
Review of the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and other members of the •

Summary of changes to the Board structure and individual roles and responsibilities
In November, a reorganisation of the UK businesses was announced to shareholders. Under the new 
structure, our UK Membership business will manage claims and service delivery in addition to sales, 
marketing and administration for our policy customers. A smaller, more focused, Emergency Services 
division was to focus exclusively on fulfilling the needs of our insurer and commercial partners. As a result of 
this reorganisation there have been a number of changes to the individual roles and responsibilities of the 
Board Directors:
Brian Whitty, the Chairman, has reduced his overall executive involvement, focusing on the more •	
traditional chairman role but has assumed responsibility for Emergency Services following the departure 
of Ian Carlisle. He will continue to participate in the annual bonus plan but it is intended that he will no 
longer receive grants under the Company’s long-term incentive plans.
Richard Harpin, the Chief Executive, has now assumed some of the responsibilities previously •	
undertaken by the Chairman including strategy and relations with shareholders and as such, the 
Committee increased his salary mid-way through the year to bring it in line with the market for a Chief 
Executive of a FTSE-250 company.
Ian Carlisle, CEO of the Emergency Services division left the Company on 31 January 2009 and details of •	
his termination arrangements are disclosed in the notes to the emoluments table on page 60.
Jon Florsheim has assumed responsibility for the enlarged UK Membership business and his salary was •	
also realigned to reflect his increased role and responsibilities.
Barry Gibson was appointed senior independent Director following John Maxwell’s retirement from the •	
Board. Mark Morris was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Remuneration for Executive Directors
The main components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are:
Basic salary
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account 
the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual. This is normally reviewed annually 
with any increase usually being effective from 1 April (unless responsibilities change). Salary levels are 
determined taking into account market data on salary levels for similar positions at comparable companies 
and pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere in the Company. 
Following a review undertaken by HNBS in March 2008, the Committee determined that the most 
appropriate comparator group against which to benchmark Executive Directors’ basic salaries is the 
top-half of the FTSE-250 Index (reflecting the increased size and profile of the Company), taking into account 
the roles, responsibilities and experience of each Director. Salary increases of 3% were awarded to Messrs 
Whitty, Harpin, Carlisle and Florsheim and 16.7% to Jonathan Simpson-Dent. The higher increase to 
Jonathan Simpson-Dent reflected his relatively recent appointment to the role. These increases were 
effective from 1 April 2008. These increases compared to a budgeted increase of 3% across the workforce as 
a whole.
Base salary levels were reviewed again in March 2009 and the Committee determined that the top-half of 
the FTSE-250 remained the most appropriate comparator group against which to benchmark salaries (at 
the time of the review the Company was ranked 179 in the FTSE). Reflecting the desire to control fixed costs 
across the business, no pay increases were implemented as at 1 April 2009 for either the Board or the 
members of the Executive Committee. The budgeted increase for the general workforce was 2%. 
During the year, the responsibilities of Richard Harpin, Group Chief Executive and Jon Florsheim, Chief 
Executive of UK Membership were reviewed following a restructure of the UK Membership business. The 
basic salary of both of these individuals was increased to £500,000 with effect from 1 October 2008.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is designed to drive and reward excellent short term operating performance of the 
Company and encourage real year-on-year growth in profitability. The maximum annual bonus for 2009/10 
will be maintained at 100% of basic salary (with the exception of Jon Florsheim whose maximum bonus 
potential is unchanged at 150% of salary). 
During the year, Executive Directors were able to earn up to 80% of bonus potential for Group financial 
performance measured by profit before tax amortisation and exceptional items and cashflow.  The 
remaining 20% of bonus potential was based on measurable personal targets, relating to the part of the 
business or the function for which the Director is responsible.  This weighting differed for Jon Florsheim who 
was able to earn a higher proportion of his bonus potential based on targets specifically related to the 
performance of UK Membership.
The weighting between business and personal objectives will remain 80% financial: 20% personal for 
2009/10 except for Jon Florsheim who will continue to be able to earn a higher proportion of his bonus 
potential depending on the performance of UK Membership.  Provided their personal objectives are met in 
full, the normal ‘on-target’ bonus payable to Executive Directors in any year is expected to be in the region 
of 60% of their basic salary (90% for Jon Florsheim).
Executive Directors’ bonuses are paid entirely in cash, though under the Long Term Incentive Plan adopted 
in 2008, Directors have the opportunity to invest part of their net bonus in shares. If they choose to do this, 
they may be awarded a matching award which is subject to a comparative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance condition. 54 Governance
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Remuneration report
Long-term incentives
The Committee’s policy for the provision of long-term incentives to Executive Directors is to grant awards of 
performance shares (performance awards) and to provide them with the opportunity to voluntarily invest 
their annual bonus into a matching share arrangement (matching awards) under the Long Term Incentive 
Plan adopted in 2008 (the ‘2008 LTIP’). 
The maximum individual award limit under the 2008 LTIP is 200% of basic salary for performance awards 
and for matching awards of up to two shares for each share invested, based on a maximum investment of 
the net of tax equivalent of 75% of the maximum bonus potential. 
Consistent with the grant policy applied in 2008, the Committee intends to limit the size of performance 
share awards in 2009 to the Executive Directors to 150% of salary. Matching awards up to the maximum 
ratio of two shares for each invested share will continue to be granted. It should be noted that, under the 
plan rules, the executives may invest up to the lower of their actual bonus earned in the preceding financial 
year and 75% of their maximum bonus potential. In the event that actual bonuses are lower than 25% of 
salary, executives may invest up to 25% of salary in shares from their own money. 
The Committee may set different targets for each new award but it is intended that performance and 
matching share awards granted in 2009 will be linked to the achievement of stretching TSR targets, with 
25% of the awards vesting for TSR equal to the FTSE-250 Index, increasing in a straight line to 100% vesting 
where TSR performance exceeds the Index by an average of 15 percentage points per annum. In 
determining the number of awards that will vest in any year, the Committee will also take into account the 
underlying financial performance of the business. This is consistent with the performance conditions 
attached to the awards granted in 2008.
Awards under the 2008 LTIP may be satisfied through a mixture of either market purchase or new issue 
shares. To the extent new issue shares are used, the 2008 LTIP will adhere to a 5% in 10 year dilution limit.
Executive Directors, including the Chairman, may also participate in the Group’s Save As You Earn Scheme 
(where share options are exercisable after three or five years at a discount of up to 20% of the market value 
of the shares at the time of grant) and in the Share Incentive Plan on the same basis as all other employees. 
No performance criteria are attached to these schemes.
Benefits
Non-pension benefits comprise company car and fuel allowance and medical insurance. The range of 
benefits and their value are considered to be broadly in line with those provided to Executive Directors in 
similar companies in the FTSE-250. 
Shareholding guidelines
It is the Board’s policy that Executive Directors and certain members of the Company’s senior management 
build up and retain a minimum shareholding in the Company. Each Executive Director is encouraged to hold 
shares of at least equal value to his annual basic salary. 
Accordingly, if the holding guideline has not been fulfilled at the point of exercise of any option or the vesting 
of any other long-term incentive award, the Director must retain 50% of the net proceeds in the Company’s 
shares until the holding requirement is achieved. Details of the current shareholdings of the Executive 
Directors are provided on page 59.  55
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Service contracts
The Committee’s policy is to offer service contracts with notice periods of one year or less (other than, in 
exceptional circumstances, where longer initial notice periods may be offered on appointment, and then 
reduced to one year over time).
All Executive Directors’ contracts of service are terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party. Further 
details of the Executive Directors’ contracts are summarised in the table below:
Name of Director       Date of contract
B H Whitty      28 March 1996
R D Harpin      18 January 2002
J Florsheim      5 March 2007
J Simpson-Dent      18 May 2007
Liquidated damages are limited to the payment of one year’s remuneration, including benefits. Notice 
periods and payments are not extendable in takeover situations.
Ian Carlisle left the Company on 31 January 2009. Details of his termination package are provided in the 
notes to the emoluments table on page 60.
Pensions
Executive Directors currently participate in one of two pension schemes, the Water Companies Pension 
Scheme (WCPS) or the HomeServe Money Plan (HMP). The normal date of retirement for Executive Directors 
is at age 60. Both arrangements are non-contributory for Executive Directors.
The WCPS is a funded, Inland Revenue approved occupational defined benefit scheme. Brian Whitty, Richard 
Harpin and Ian Carlisle (until his departure on 31 January 2009) were members of the WCPS. In respect of 
these Directors, its main features are:
pension at normal retirement age of one-half of final pensionable salary and a tax free lump sum of one •	
and a half times final pensionable salary on completion of 40 years’ service at an accrual rate of 80ths 
plus 3/80ths cash;
life assurance of five times pensionable salary for Brian Whitty or five times basic salary for Richard •	
Harpin and Ian Carlisle;
pension payable in the event of ill health; and •	
spouse’s pension on death. •	
A notional earnings cap restricts the benefits provided to members of the WCPS. In respect of Richard 
Harpin and Ian Carlisle, an unapproved pension payment, equal to 20% of the amount by which their basic 
salary exceeds the notional cap is paid annually. The notional cap is indexed in line with earnings inflation.
With effect from 6 April 2006, all of Brian Whitty’s retirement benefits are provided through the WCPS, on the 
basis of a pension accrual rate of 45ths of his basic salary for future service.
The HMP is a funded, Inland Revenue approved occupational defined contribution pension scheme. Jon 
Florsheim and Jonathan Simpson-Dent are members of the HMP. In respect of Jonathan Simpson-Dent, its 
main features are:
employer contributions of 20%; •	
life assurance of five times basic salary; •	
permanent health insurance; and •	
spouse’s pension on death. •	
In respect of Jon Florsheim, its main features are:
employer contributions of 8%; •	
life assurance of five times basic salary; •	
permanent health insurance; and •	
spouse’s pension on death. •	 56 Governance
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Remuneration report
Where the benefits provided to Executive Directors under the scheme are restricted as a result of the 
notional earnings cap described above, further provision is made by making a payment of 20% in cash of 
the amount by which his basic salary exceeds the cap in respect of Jonathan Simpson-Dent, and 8% into 
the HMP in respect of Jon Florsheim.
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors serve under letters of appointment for periods of three years which include 
provisions in respect of liquidated damages limited to the payment of one year’s fee. Their fees are 
determined by the Executive Directors within the limits set by the Articles of Association and are based on 
information on fees paid in similar companies and the skills and expected time commitment of the 
individual concerned. Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to bonus payments or pension 
arrangements, nor do they participate in the Company’s long-term incentive plans. 
Details of their current three year appointments are as follows:
Name of Director       Date of contract
J M B Gibson      6 April 2004
I Chippendale      1 January 2007
A Sibbald      1 June 2007
M Morris      27 February 2009
The fees for the Non-Executive Directors were last reviewed in March 2008. The current fee policy for 
Non-Executive Directors is a base Board fee of £40,000, a £7,500 premium for Chairmanship of the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees and a £2,500 fee for membership of those committees. As senior 
independent Non-Executive Director, Barry Gibson receives an additional fee of £40,000 on top of his base 
and committee membership fees. The Board considers the level of the additional fee to be appropriate 
taking into account the expected time commitment and the prominence of the role in the absence of a 
Non-Executive Chairman. This increased fee was effective from 1 November 2008.

1 Ian Carlisle left on 31 January 2009 and was treated as a good leaver. The options granted in 2003, 2004 and 2005 had already vested so could be 
exercised for a limited period. The options granted in 2006 and 2007 lapsed following an assessment of the performance conditions.
The price of an ordinary share on 26 September 2008 when Mr Carlisle exercised his option over 17,738 
shares was £14.55.
The ESOP was approved by shareholders in 2001. Options were granted on an annual basis and become 
exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant subject to the achievement of stretching 
performance criteria. The option price is the market price on the last dealing day prior to the date of grant.  61
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Options will become exercisable based on the following scale:
Average normalised       Vesting level as
EPS
1
 growth per annum       percentage of
over three financial years       overall award (%)
RPI + 4%       25
RPI + 6%       50
RPI + 8%       75
RPI + 10%       100
1 EPS is defined as the normalised earnings per share of the Company as defined in IAS33. 
EPS growth is calculated by the Company and independently verified by HNBS. Options granted under  
the ESOP in 2006 and 2007 will only become exercisable if the Company’s share price growth is equal to  
or exceeds 48% in the three year period from the date of grant. Currently, the market price is below the 
option price and in any case, it is unlikely that the performance conditions will be met in respect of the  
2006 awards.
From 2005 to 2007, the normal maximum annual grant under the ESOP was 150% of salary, save in 
exceptional cases, for example on the appointment of a new Executive Director from outside of the Group.
Awards granted under the ESOP will lapse on the date that an executive leaves the Company’s 
employment, except in the case of retirement, illness, redundancy or death, where the Committee has 
discretion to allow options to be retained by the executive subject to such performance conditions as it 
wishes to impose. 
The performance conditions attaching to the options granted on 26 June 2005 were met in full. Over the 
three year performance period, the Company’s EPS performance exceeded RPI by in excess of 10% per 
annum (the target required for full vesting).
There were no changes in the options held under the ESOP between 31 March and 19 May 2009.
2004 LTIP

The LTIP was approved by shareholders in 2004. One-off awards of 200% of salary were made in that year 
to Executive Directors under the LTIP to incentivise them towards specific goals reflecting the Company’s aim 
to deliver exceptional shareholder value over the five years from 2004. A similar award made in March 2008 
to Mr Simpson-Dent for the same purpose. Awards were granted as nil cost share options.
1 Ian Carlisle left on 31 January 2009 and was treated as a good leaver. The performance conditions attaching to the awards will be assessed at the end of 
the relevant performance period and if awards vest they will be pro-rated for time. 
The table below demonstrates the vesting of awards under the LTIP according to absolute TSR growth:
TSR performance      Vesting of award (%)

Remuneration report
Additionally the awards will not vest unless there has been EPS growth of at least 10% per annum above RPI 
over the performance period.
Awards will only vest in full if the Company’s absolute TSR exceeds 180% by the fifth anniversary of the date 
of grant and the annual average EPS growth in the five year period exceeds RPI by at least 10% per annum. 
No part of the award will vest if absolute TSR growth is less than 130% over the five year performance 
period.
TSR is independently calculated by HNBS and verified by the Remuneration Committee. At March 2009, 
HNBS has estimated that the Company’s absolute TSR growth in the period since the date of the 2004 
award is 71.9%. Accordingly, if no further increase in the Company’s TSR occurs in the remainder of the 
performance period, none of the awards would vest.
Conditional share scheme awards (CSS)

On 12 March 2007, pursuant to Listing Rule 9.4.2. (2) (LR 9.4.2), a grant of 49,207 conditional shares was made 
to Jon Florsheim under the CSS. 25% of the award vested on the first anniversary of the grant, 25% of the 
award vested on the second anniversary of the grant and the remaining 50% of the award will vest on the 
third anniversary of the grant, all providing Mr Florsheim remains in HomeServe’s employment at the date 
of vesting. The price of an ordinary share on 12 March 2009, the date on which the second tranche of the 
award vested, was £8.75.

On 30 March 2007, a grant of share options was made to Jon Florsheim and Jonathan Simpson-Dent under 
a Key Executive Incentive Plan (respectively, the JF and JSD KEIP). Awards will vest in two tranches, with 50% 
of the award vesting at the earliest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and 50% two years later. 
The awards are subject to performance conditions in respect of profit before tax and growth in the 
Company’s share price to £32.50 at the time of first vesting. These conditions will be independently verified 
by HNBS.

HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
The DBP was introduced in 2005. Under its terms, Executive Directors were able to invest some or all of their 
annual bonus into shares and to defer receipt for three years. Matching shares could be earned if the Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Company over a three year period exceeds the median of the FTSE-350 index 
of companies (excluding investment trusts). 
The table below demonstrates the vesting of matching shares under the DBP according to TSR growth:
TSR

Below median       Nil
Median       0.5:1
Median – upper decile       0.5-3:1
     on a straight line basis
Upper decile       3:1
1 TSR is averaged over the three months prior to the beginning and end of the performance period. 
The Committee retains the discretion to decline to permit matching shares to vest if it is not satisfied that 
there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company at the 
time of vesting.
Shares invested in the DBP by Executive Directors may be withdrawn at any time during their appointment 
but any entitlement to matching shares will be forfeit in such circumstances. 
At the end of the performance period for the 2005 awards, HomeServe was ranked between median and 
upper decile against the constituents of the FTSE-350 Index. Accordingly 2.62 matching shares vested for 
each invested share out of a maximum 3 matching shares for each invested share. The price of an ordinary 
share on 8 August 2008, the date on which the 2005 invested shares vested was £14.25.
At March 2009, the Company’s TSR performance in the period from the date of grant of the 2006 and 2007 
awards is below the upper decile in comparison with the comparator Group. If this performance were 
unchanged at the end of the performance period, the number of matching shares available to each 
participant would be 0.92 for the 2006 awards and 0.82 for the 2007 awards.

the relevant performance period and if awards vest they will be pro-rated for time.  
The market price of the Company’s shares on 6 August 2008, the date the awards were granted was 
£15.42. Mr Florsheim was granted 46,074 shares in August and a further award over 28,459 shares on  
4 December 2008 when the share price was £8.80.
The performance conditions in respect of the 2008 are as described in the unaudited section of this report. 
At 31 March 2009, the Company’s TSR performance was such that no part of the performance or matching 
awards would vest if this were the end of the performance period. 64 Governance
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
The market price of the Company’s shares at 31 March 2009 was £11.70 (2008: £19.23). During the year the 
price ranged from £8.40½ to £20.57.
The Committee has continued to ensure that a consistent approach is taken to measuring EPS-based 
performance conditions through the transition from UK GAAP to international accounting standards.
The shares required for share options and awards under the DBP, 2004 LTIP, CSS, KEIP and 2008 LTIP may be 
fulfilled by the purchase of shares in the market by the Company’s employee benefit trust (EBT). As 
beneficiaries under the EBT, the Directors are deemed to be interested in the shares held by the EBT which at 
31 March 2009 amounted to 2,109,573 ordinary shares. Shares may also be fulfilled through newly issued 
shares, subject to the dilution limits within each scheme.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts, Remuneration report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The Directors 
are required by the IAS Regulation to prepare the Group financial statements under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and have also elected to prepare the parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year 
the Company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all 
circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, 
Directors are also required to:
•	 p r o p e r l y	s e l e c t	a n d	a p p l y	a c c o u n t i n g	p o l i c i e s ;
•	 p r e s e n t	i n f o r m a t i o n ,	i n c l u d i n g	a c c o u n t i n g	p o l i c i e s ,	i n	a	m a n n e r	t h a t	p r o v i d e s	r e l e v a n t ,	r e l i a b l e ,

enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent auditors’ report
We have audited the Group financial statements of HomeServe plc for the year ended 31 March 2009 which 
comprise the Group income statement, the Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the Group 
statement of recognised income and expense and the related notes 1 to 43. These Group financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the Remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of HomeServe plc for the year 
ended 31 March 2009. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Remuneration report and  
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, 
whether the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and whether the part of the Remuneration report described as 
having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the 
Group financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes that specific information 
presented in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review and Financial review that is cross referred 
from the Principal activities section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Director’s remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on 
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial statements. We consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the  
Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by 
the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the 
amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by 
the Directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 69
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we 
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the 
Group financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we 
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the •	
European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2009 and of its loss for the year then 
ended;
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 •	
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; 
the part of the Remuneration report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in •	
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the Group financial statements. •

Notes to the financial statements
year ended 31 March 2009
1. General information
HomeServe plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The 
address of the registered office is given on page 40.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with 
the policies set out in note 2.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, adopted by the European Union 
and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. At the date of authorisation of these financial 
statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial 
statements, were in issue but not yet effective:

IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes
IFRIC15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate
IFRIC16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation
IFRIC17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners
IFRIC18 Transfers of Assets from Customers
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will 
have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for IFRS3 (Revised), whereby 
acquisition costs and adjustments to contingent consideration will be charged/credited to the income 
statement. IFRS3 (Revised) is expected to apply to the Group for the year ending 31 March 2011.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of 
financial instruments, and on a going concern basis as set out in the Corporate governance statement.  
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities 
controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from  
its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair 
values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.  75
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Investments in joint ventures
The Group’s share of results of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement using the 
equity method of accounting. The Group’s share of their net assets is included in the consolidated balance 
sheet, including associated goodwill. Based on the guidance of IAS28 ‘Investments in Associates’, provision 
for the Group’s share of the joint venture losses are not recognised if the recognition of such losses reduces 
the Group’s share of the joint venture’s net assets below zero.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in 
the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an 
indication that it may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and 
is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount is less than the 
carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a 
subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK 
GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under 
UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or 
loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts 
receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other 
sales related taxes.
Membership businesses
Revenue in respect of the UK and overseas Membership businesses include amounts receivable from the 
sale of policies, stated net of commissions payable and Insurance Premium Tax.
Revenue recorded by the Group consists of commissions due in the Group’s role as an intermediary in the 
policy sale and administration process. Any third-party costs incurred on behalf of the principal that are 
rechargeable under the contractual arrangement, or where the Group’s role is only as an intermediary in 
the cash collection process, are not included in revenue. Consequently, revenue consists of a component of 
the overall policy price, representing the commission due for the marketing and sale of the policy.
Revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except where an obligation exists to provide future services, 
typically claims handling and policy administration services. In these situations, a proportion of revenue, 
sufficient to cover future claims handling costs and margin, is deferred over the life of the policy, as deferred 
income. The assessment of future claims handling takes account of the expected numbers of claims and 
the estimated cost of handling those claims, which are validated through experience of historic actual 
costs.  The deferred revenue is released over the expected profile of expected claims over the policy period.  
The deferral also includes a profit element to recognise the performance of these services in the future. 76

year ended 31 March 2009
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Revenue recognition (continued)
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be provided to 
customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised for each element as 
if it were an individual contract.
Revenue from contracts of reinsurance is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the policies.  
All associated costs are charged to the income statement as incurred. If claims costs under reinsurance 
contracts are expected to exceed revenue, the shortfall would be charged to the income statement 
immediately.
Emergency Services businesses
Revenue represents amounts receivable, excluding VAT, from the sale of goods and services and is 
recognised on completion of the obligations relating to the work.
Revenue on sales to franchises is recognised when the obligations to the franchisee are complete. Revenue 
on the sale of new franchise licences is recognised upon the signing of the related franchise agreement. 
These franchise fees are non-refundable and primarily relate to initial set-up services.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the 
present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also 
spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on 
the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, if 
any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences 
are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging all operating costs and after the share of results of joint ventures 
but before investment income and finance costs. 77
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit 
credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside the income 
statement and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and 
otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value 
of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present 
value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of  
the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the  
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the 
asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when  
it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with  
in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful 
lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Buildings    25–50 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 7 years
Computer equipment  3–7 years
Motor vehicles   3 years (with 25% residual value)
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as 
owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. 78

Notes to the financial statements
year ended 31 March 2009
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired on acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking or business are stated at 
their fair value and are amortised over their useful lives, using the straight line method, as follows:
Customer relationships  3-7 years
Customer databases/ 
exclusive marketing agreements 3-7 years
Franchise assets   3-15 years
Computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised over their useful lives of three 
to seven years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of  
the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from  
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the  
asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.  
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, 
where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is measured on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Net 
realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to 
be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective 
items where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value. 79
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the 
assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest 
method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in 
the period in which they arise.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as cash flow hedges. At the 
inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the 
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a 
hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges are deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately 
in profit or loss and is included within finance costs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected  
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the  
income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised 
in profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.  
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the 
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2 Share-Based Payments. In accordance with the 
transitional provision, IFRS2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that 
were unvested as of 1 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled, share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The Group also provides employees with the 
ability to purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through Save As 
You Earn schemes.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on 
the type of scheme.
Own shares reserve
Shares of the parent Company that are purchased by the HomeServe plc Employee Benefit Trust are held at 
cost and shown as a deduction in equity. Cost comprises consideration paid, including directly attributable 
costs. The shares are held to satisfy obligations under the share option schemes. 80

3. Judgements and estimation uncertainty 
Revenue recognition 
Within the Policy Membership businesses, an appropriate proportion of revenue is deferred to future 
periods when the Group has obligations extending to future periods. As a result, judgement is required in 
assessing the extent and associated costs of fulfilling those future obligations. The Group uses historical 
experience and forecast activity levels in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise in the 
current period and how much to defer to future periods. 
Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets
The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates of 
the value in use (or fair value less costs to sell) of cash-generating units to which goodwill and acquisition 
intangibles have been allocated. As a result, estimates of future cash flows are required, together with an 
appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows. The 
carrying value of goodwill is £175.7m (2008 restated: £218.1m). The carrying value of acquisition intangibles is 
£28.6m (2008: £47.6m). Following the annual impairment review, an impairment charge of £59.2m has been 
recorded against goodwill and £17.0m against acquisition intangibles. As set out in note 7 and 15, 
reasonably possible changes in respect of commercial outcomes around sales volumes, prices and margins 
can impact the recoverable value.
Pensions 
The Group participates in a defined benefit retirement scheme for certain employees. The scheme assets 
and liabilities are valued by an independent qualified actuary using the assumptions summarised in note 
39. As required by IAS19, the value of the defined benefit obligation has been measured using the projected 
unit credit method which requires the use of judgement and estimation.
4. Revenue

5. Business and geographical segments
Segment revenues and results 
IFRS8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the 
Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to 
assess their performance. 
The Group is managed around four operating divisions – UK Membership, Continental Europe, United 
States of America and UK Emergency Services, which has been shown as non-core.
During the year, the claims management and policy repair networks were moved from UK Emergency 
Services to UK Membership. To ensure a consistent comparison to the new structure, the prior year 
segmental information (taking account of segment eliminations) has been restated. 81

5. Business and geographical segments (continued)  
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies 
described in note 2, except that revenues attributable to the Group’s share of its French joint venture are 
included in revenues within ‘Continental Europe’ for segmental reporting, but are not recognised for 
statutory reporting. 
Segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment including allocating costs associated with 
head office and shared functions, but before allocating investment revenue and finance costs and income 
tax expense. This is the measure reported to the Group’s Chief Executive for the purposes of resource 
allocation and assessment of segment performance.

6. Exceptional operating costs
The exceptional operating costs of £6,549,000 comprise £1,535,000 relating to the cessation of discussions 
with our second hub partner and £5,014,000 relating to the reorganisation of our UK businesses. In the prior 
year, exceptional operating costs related to the aborted acquisition of Domestic & General Group plc.
7. Impairment of UK Emergency Services assets
The impairment charge of £97,184,000 consists of:
      2009 2008
      £000 £000
Impairment charge:
Goodwill (note 15)      59,179 —
Acquisition intangible assets (note 16)      16,965 —
Software assets (note 16)      8,739 —
Property, plant and equipment (note 17)      5,149 —  
Other net assets – trade receivables (note 21)     7,152 —
      97,184 —
As noted in the Chief Executive’s review, it has been a difficult year for our UK Emergency Services division, 
which continues to operate in challenging market conditions, with lower volumes and margin pressure. 
Following the transfer of the claims management and policy repair networks from UK Emergency Services 
into UK Membership, the Board has commenced a disposal process of the UK Emergency Services division. 
For this reason, the division has been shown as non-core.
As part of our annual impairment review (note 15), we have reviewed the carrying value of goodwill and 
other assets within the UK Emergency Services division to assess the recoverable value of each cash 
generating unit within this division. Given the Board’s decision to seek a disposal of the businesses within 
this division, our assessment of value in use is closely aligned with the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
these businesses. As value is expected to be realised principally through a disposal process, fair value less 
costs to sell has been based on a price-earnings methodology. This has been compared to external 
sources of information such as indicative preliminary valuations of the businesses, taking account of usual 
commercial negotiations to obtain an agreed sales consideration for the businesses. The resulting 
estimated fair value has not been discounted due to the current expectation of a disposal within the next  
12 months.
Costs have been estimated with reference to disposal proceeds, and estimates of professional fees to be 
incurred on the transaction, supported by indicative fees from advisers. 84

Notes to the financial statements
year ended 31 March 2009
7. Impairment of UK Emergency Services assets (continued)
Based on the impairment review, the recoverable value suggests an impairment of £97,184,000. This has been 
allocated to the cash generating units of the Emergency Services division, initially to goodwill, then to other 
non-current assets. A further £7,152,000 has been allocated to trade receivables, representing a surplus of the 
impairment over the non current assets for certain of the cash generating units within the division.
In light of the challenging market conditions facing the division, a reasonably possible change in the 
judgements around sales margins and volume of work could result in an increase or decrease in the 
recoverable value.

The adjusted earnings per share has been calculated by excluding the amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles, exceptional operating costs and impairment. This is considered to be a better indicator of the 
performance of the Group. As profit/(loss) for the year and adjusted profit for the year are stated after tax, it 
is not considered necessary to include in the above reconciliation the impact of the adjustment for the tax 
on joint ventures of £1,941,000 (2008: £991,000).

For 2009, due to the statutory loss, the effect of share options is anti-dilutive. Consequently, diluted earnings 
per share has been stated as consistent with basic earnings per share for the total Group. 88

During the year, the contingent consideration payable on the 2008 acquisition of Anglia (NW) Limited was 
reduced by £3,088,000. Goodwill on the acquisition has been reduced accordingly, with the goodwill and 
contingent consideration being restated in the comparative period. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units (CGUs) 
that are expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been

During the year, following the transfer of claims management and policy repair networks from UK  
Emergency Services to UK Membership, £4,846,000 goodwill has been transferred to UK Membership in the 
prior year analysis.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill 
might be impaired. 89
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions 
for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes 
to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax 
rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. 
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are 
based on expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares annual cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by 
the Directors and extrapolates cash flows based on an estimated growth rate of 2.5% (2008: 2.5%) 
representing long-term growth rates based in respective country GDP rates. The pre-tax rate used to 
discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 11.3% (2008: 11.3%). 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGU’s carrying value. Details 
in respect of the impairment of the non-core UK Emergency Services division, including assessment of the 
most likely reasonably possible changes which could impact upon the carrying value, are set out in note 7. 
In respect of the Group’s other businesses, the key assumptions are as noted above. Management believes 
that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result 
in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount. This view is based upon inherently 
judgemental assumptions, however, takes account of the headroom in management’s internal growth 
targets verses the conservative growth estimates used in the impairment review.

The Group’s share of the above results is only £3,451,000 (2008: £1,755,000) reflecting the net liabilities of the 
Doméo Assistance joint venture in the current and prior year.
In respect of Doméo Assistance, the Group’s unrecognised share of losses for the year is £42,000 (2008: 
£311,000) and share of cumulative losses is £353,000 (2008: £311,000). Based on the guidance of IAS28 
‘Investments in Associates’, provision for the Group’s share of joint venture profits/(losses) are not 
recognised if the recognition of such losses reduces the Group’s share of joint venture’s net assets below 
zero.
In respect of the interests in joint ventures, there are no capital commitments or contingent liabilities which

Notes to the financial statements
year ended 31 March 2009
21. Other financial assets (continued)
Trade receivables
The Group has provided fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover. This 
assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and 
involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty. In 
addition, an impairment of £7,152,000 has been included to recognise the surplus of the UK Emergency 
Services assets impairment against the pre-impairment carrying value of the non-current assets, for certain 
cash generating units within the division.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, 
with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers. £5.6m (2008: £5.9m) is due 
from Royal Bank of Scotland, the Group’s largest customer. There are no other customers who represent 
more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £20.9m (2008: 
£32.4m) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not 
been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group 
does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of receivables not impaired is 62 days 
(2008: 37 days).
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables:

Amounts recovered during the year      (39) (464)
Balance at 31 March      11,579 3,461
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality 
of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration 
of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors 
believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Ageing of impaired trade receivables:
      2009 2008
      £000 £000

91 days +      10,083 2,744
      11,579 3,461
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. 93
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Other receivables
As part of our activities, the Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection  
of cash on behalf of third parties. Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from 
policyholders, but to be remitted to third parties for components such as underwriting fees, commission 
and Insurance Premium Tax. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being 
small and spread across a diverse policyholder base. In addition, overall balance sheet exposure is 
mitigated as defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset against the corresponding 
payable included in ’Other creditors’.
Cash balances and cash equivalents
Cash balances and cash equivalents of £21,345,000 (2008: £47,198,000) comprise cash held by the Group 
and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of 
these assets approximates their fair value.

Notes to the financial statements
year ended 31 March 2009
23. Bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities (continued)
The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows: 
i. Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. 
ii. The Group has revolving credit facilities with a number of banks totalling £150m (2008: £150m). The   
 revolving credit facility was taken out on 20 December 2007 and has a term of five years. 
iii. Loan notes are repayable on demand, subject to a minimum initial maturity of six months. 
iv. All of the Group’s borrowings are currently at floating rates at margins of between 0.1% and 1% above  
 LIBOR, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. 
v. The covenants associated with the credit facilities are ‘net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.5 times’ and   
 ‘interest cover greater than 4 times operating profit before amortisation’. The Group has complied with  
 all covenant requirements in the current and prior year.
During the previous year, the Group entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a notional value of 
£50.0m. This interest rate swap is for a further one year, and requires fixed interest payments of 4.93%, in 
return for one month LIBOR. 
At 31 March 2009, the Group had available £95.0m (2008: £60.0m) of undrawn committed borrowing 
facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
24. Deferred tax
The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax 
balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes:
    Continental  2009 2008
   UK Europe USA £000 £000

Net deferred tax asset/(liability)   1,671 1,298 1,220 4,189 (694)
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £23.7m (2008: £19.8m) available for offset 
against future profits and which can be carried forward indefinitely. A deferred tax asset of £2,518,000 has 
been recognised in respect of these losses – deferred tax has not been recognised on the remainder of 
these losses due to the uncertainty over the timing of future recovery. 
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures are not material. 95

Other creditors      70,118 73,122
      206,033 201,235
Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing 
costs. The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 68 days (2008: 67 days).
Other creditors mainly represent liabilities for amounts to be collected from policyholders in respect of 
underwriting fees, commission and Insurance Premium Tax. In addition, short term cash advances from 
customers are included in other creditors until the services are performed and the customer is invoiced.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates their fair value.

At 31 March 2009    1,006 1,696 7,709 10,411
Contingent consideration and deferred consideration relates to future amounts payable on the acquisitions 
in the current year of SPT and Endesa policies and the prior period acquisitions of California Water policies 
and First Energy policies. The movement in the year represents the reclassification of an element of the 
liability to less than one year, foreign exchange movements and acquisitions in the year.
Deferred income represents Membership Business revenue where an obligation exists to provide future 
services. An appropriate proportion of monies received in advance are treated as deferred income and 
recognised over the relevant period. No discounting is applied to deferred income balances.

The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income.
Share capital represents consideration received for the nominal value of 12½p per share on all issued and 
fully paid shares.
During the year the Company issued 161,000 shares for total consideration of £999,000 (2008: 215,000 
shares for total consideration of £1,156,000). 96

35. Business combinations
On 15 December 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of SPT Consult GCV, Belgium’s leading 
claims handling and subcontractor repair network.
On 17 March 2009, the Group acquired 27,000 household contracts from Endesa Energia S.A. one of Spain’s 
leading providers of electricity and gas supply services, and signed a marketing agreement with Endesa 
providing access of up to 9.2m households.
There were a number of other acquisitions in the year which individually were not significant. These related 
to acquisitions of plumbing and drainage contractors.
All these transactions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. Fair values are 
reported as provisional for a period of 12 months following acquisition to allow the incorporation of any 
subsequent amendments to completion accounts, contingent consideration or directly attributable costs. 
The acquisition of the Endesa household contract policies has been accounted for using the purchase 
method of accounting as the Directors consider that the number of policies acquired, combined with  
the extended and exclusive access to the customer database represent the purchase of a significant 
business activity. 98

35. Business combinations (continued)
Fair value adjustments to the acquired underlying book value of assets and liabilities, prior to the 
recognition of intangible assets identified on acquisition, were not significant, and in summary terms 
consisted of:
SPT – Acquired book value of net assets of £801,000, reduced by £133,000 for provision against certain •	
receivables and to recognise additional liabilities
Other – Acquired book value of net assets of £1,618,000, reduced by £386,000 principally to recognise •	
impairment against redundant fixed assets.
As these adjustments were not significant, no separate tabular summary of pre-adjusted balance sheets, 
together with analysis of the line items that these adjustments relate to, has been presented.
The provisional fair values, after the adjustments noted above, together with the assessment of the fair 
value of intangible assets identified on acquisition, are set out in the table below:

Intangible assets identified on the acquisitions of SPT and Endesa policies represent the Directors’ estimate 
of the value of the customer relationships at acquisition, the expected value of trade names associated with 
the business or the value of acquired customer policy databases. Goodwill represents future cross sell 
opportunities, efficiency savings and synergies from these acquisitions.
If all the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, the Group revenues for the 
year and Group loss before tax attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £522,310,000 
and £19,776,000 respectively.
In addition to the net cash outflow arising on the acquisitions above of £15,832,000 contingent and deferred 
consideration of £7,548,000 was paid relating to the prior acquisitions of Recommend Limited (trading as 
Improveline), First Energy and California Water policies and Anglia (NW) Limited. 99

38. Share based payments
During the year ended 31 March 2009, the Group had 6 (2008: 6) share based payment arrangements, 
which are described below:
i) Executive Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’)
The ESOP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Company’s shares on 
the day before the date of grant. The vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the real increase 
in Earnings Per Share over the vesting period. In addition, since 2006, vesting has also been dependant 
upon a share price target. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of 
grant, the options expire. 
ii) 2005 Key Executive Incentive Plan (‘KEIP’)
The KEIP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the 
day before the date of grant. The awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years 
from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche. 
The number of awards vesting is dependent upon the Profit Before Tax of the Group for the year ended 
31 March 2009 and is subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 March 2009.  
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
iii) Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The LTIP provides for the grant of nil cost options. The vesting period is between three and five years and  
is dependent upon the Total Shareholder Return performance of the Group over the relevant performance 
period. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options 
expire. 
iv) Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
The Deferred Bonus Plan enables the individual to defer receipt of their annual cash bonus (up to a 
maximum of 100%) and to invest an equivalent amount in the ordinary share capital of the Company. The 
deferred bonus may be matched by the Company dependent upon the Company’s relative Total 
Shareholder Return over a three year period, up to a maximum of 300% of the deferred amount for upper 
decile performance. The shares cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised 
within 10 years from the date of grant.
v) Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’)
The SAYE is open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted market 
price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount. The options can be exercised during 
a six month period following the completion of either a three or five year savings period.
vi) Conditional Share Schemes (‘CSS’)
Awards under the Conditional Share Scheme vest in three tranches on the first (25%), second (25%) and third 
(50%) anniversary of the grant. 101

Notes to the financial statements
year ended 31 March 2009
38. Share based payments (continued)
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the ESOP and 
SAYE and Monte Carlo simulations for the KEIP, LTIP and Deferred Bonus Plan. The assumptions used in the 
models are as follows:
Input   Assumption
Share price  Price at date of grant
Exercise price  Per scheme rules
Expected volatility  20% - 30%
Option life  Per scheme rules
Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield
Risk free interest rate 3.8% - 5.2%
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
The Group recognised total expenses of £3,217,000 (2008: £4,131,000) related to equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions.
39. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all qualifying employees. The 
assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. 
Where there are employees who leave the scheme prior to the contributions fully vesting, the contributions 
paid by the Group are forfeited by the employee.
The total cost charged to income of £2,890,000 (2008: £2,847,000) represents contributions payable to these 
schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans. At 31 March 2009, contributions of £nil 
(2008: £nil) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme
The Group participates in a defined benefit scheme, the Water Companies Pension Scheme, for qualifying 
employees. This is a sectionalised final salary scheme and the Group participates in the HomeServe plc 
Section of the Scheme. The Section funds are administered by the trustees and are independent of the 
Group’s finances. Contributions are paid to the Section in accordance with the recommendations of an 
independent actuarial adviser. The Section has a history of raising pensions in line with price inflation, and 
these increases are reflected in the measurement of the obligation. 
The results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2008 were updated to the accounting date by an 
independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS19. As required by IAS19, the value of the defined 
benefit obligation, the past service cost and the current service cost have been measured using the 
projected unit credit method.

Of the charge for the year, £379,000 (2008: £479,000) has been included in operating costs. Actuarial gains 
and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The actual return on scheme assets was a loss of £3,410,000 (2008: loss of £874,000).
The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Group’s obligations in respect of its defined 
benefit retirement scheme is as follows:

      £000 £000

In the prior year the Group opted not to recognise in the balance sheet any surplus on its defined benefit 
scheme as there was no anticipated refund due from the scheme nor the expectation of a lower schedule 
of contributions as a result of the surplus.
Movements in the present value of defined benefit obligations in the current year were as follows:
      2009 2008
      £000 £000

The overall expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ending 31 March 2009 was 8.0% p.a. 
(2008: 7.8% p.a.). This rate is derived by taking the weighted average of the long term expected rate of return 
on each of the asset classes that the Section was invested in at 31 March 2008.

42. Insurance contracts
During previous years the Group, through its subsidiary Affinity Partners Limited, entered into contracts of 
reinsurance with an independent insurance Company that underwrites the policies marketed and 
administered by HomeServe Membership Limited. Under these arrangements, Affinity Partners Limited 
underwrote 49% of the risk and reward associated with these policies (‘the policies’).
The policies were entered into between the customers of HomeServe Membership Limited and an 
independent insurance company in the United Kingdom only. The policies are principally in relation to 
underwritten cover for a broad range of domestic emergencies relating to Plumbing and Drains, Electrical 
Wiring, Water and Gas Supply Pipes and Gas Boilers.
Revenue from the reinsurance contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the policies 
(typically 12 months), reflecting the period of benefit to the customer. Where the reinsurance premium is 
received in advance, an appropriate amount is included within deferred income.
The costs associated with the claims received under the contract of reinsurance are recognised as they are 
incurred. An assessment is made of whether the expected cash inflows under the reinsurance contracts are 
sufficient to meet the expected future claims costs under the reinsurance contracts. If a shortfall were to 
arise, this would be charged immediately to the income statement.
Affinity Partners ceased to underwrite new policies from 1 October 2007.
The amounts recognised by the Group in respect of reinsurance contracts are as follows:
      2009 2008
      £000 £000
Revenue      3,505 39,421
Claims costs      (2,012) (34,509)
Deferred income      — 3,036
The principal impact on the amount of claims incurred under the reinsurance contracts relate to weather 
conditions, which can impact the frequency of claims and the nature of the emergency. In order to assist in 
managing the risk arising from the policies, the claims costs are fixed for each type of emergency repair.
There is no concentration of insurance risk due to the immaterial size of each of the policies. Neither the 
policies or the reinsurance contract are exposed to any significant liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, nor 
are there any exposures relating to embedded derivatives.
As the policies relate to emergency repairs and generally cover a 12 month period, all cash outflows are 
expected to occur within 12 months from the date of commencement of the policies.
On a weighted average basis, across all policies, a 1 percentage point increase in claims frequencies would 
result in additional claims costs of £nil (2008: £0.1m). 107

43. Financial instruments
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group and the Company from which financial instrument risk 
arises are as follows:
Group      Company
– cash and cash equivalents   – cash and cash equivalents
– bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities  – bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities
– trade receivables    – trade receivables
– loans to joint ventures    – inter-company receivables and payables
– trade payables     – trade payables
– loan notes
All principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group are able to continue as going concerns 
while maximising the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity. The 
capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 23, cash 
and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 27 to 34.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital:
      2009 2008
      £000 £000
Shareholders’ funds      212,984 265,413
Bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities     55,000 90,000
Unsecured loan notes      300 304
Certain of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements from the 
Financial Services Authority. Where such requirements exist, the Group manages the risk through the close 
monitoring of performance and distributable capital within the entities impacted by the regulations. The 
Group has complied with all such arrangements throughout the current and preceding year.
Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s principal financial instruments, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes and cash and 
cash equivalents. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s 
operations. The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade 
payables, derivatives and loans to joint ventures which arise directly from its operations.
Classification of financial instruments
In addition to the other financial assets and liabilities disclosed in notes 21, 23 and 25, the Group has 
derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships with a notional value of £50.0m (2008: 
£50.0m) and a carrying value and fair value of £1,947,000 liability (2008: £nil). The fair value of these 
derivative instruments has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing 
interest rates, sourced from observable market data.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long 
term debt requirements with floating interest rates. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a 
mix of fixed and variable rate debts. To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which the 
Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest 
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. These swaps are 
designated to hedge underlying debt obligations. 108

The Group has entered into an interest rate swap in order to manage the interest rate risks arising from the 
Group’s operations and its sources of finance. It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the 
Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
At 31 March 2009 the Group had in place an interest rate swap to hedge loans subject to variable interest 
rates linked to LIBOR whereby it receives a floating rate of interest based on one month LIBOR on a notional 
principal of £50m (2008: £50m) and pays a fixed rate of interest of 4.9% (2008: 4.9%). The remaining term of 
the interest rate swap is one year. The fair value of the interest rate swap at 31 March 2009 was £1,947,000 
liability (2008: £nil). The timing of the impact on the income statement of the swap is up to one year from the 
balance sheet date. The impact of the cash flow hedge on the income statement will be expensed through 
the finance cost line.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change of 10% increase in interest 
rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax (through the impact on floating 
rate borrowings).

Foreign currency risk
The Group has exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies where it has investments in overseas 
operations which are affected by foreign exchange movements.
The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities 
at the year end are as follows:
 Assets Liabilities
    2009 2008 2009 2008
    £000 £000 £000 £000

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change of 10% increase in sterling 
against the relevant foreign currencies, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax.
      2009 2008
      £000 £000

Effect on profit before tax (£000)      501 (2)
Effect on equity (£000)      194 36
Credit risk
The Group trades only with creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that, with the exception of  
our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for  
financial stability.
The majority of the Group’s trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence  
for these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty.  
In addition, receivable balances within our Emergency Services business are monitored on an ongoing 
basis. As a result, the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and 
cash equivalents and investment in joint ventures, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default  
of the counterparty.
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with 
reputable and creditworthy banking institutions. The risk associated with the investment in joint ventures is 
mitigated through the close management and regular review of the performance of the assets.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Group’s Board which sets the framework 
for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management 
requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities 
and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. Included in note 23 are details of the undrawn 
facilities that are available to the Group to further reduce liquidity risk.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, all of the Group’s financial liabilities are due for 
payment within one year, based on contractual payment terms. 110

Independent auditors’ report
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of HomeServe plc for the year ended 31 March 
2009 which comprise the Company balance sheet, the Company cash flow statement, the Company 
statement of recognised income and expense and the related notes 44 to 59. These parent Company 
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of HomeServe plc for the year ended 31 
March 2009 and on the information in the Remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal 
and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair 
view and whether the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ report is consistent with the parent Company financial statements. The information given in the 
Directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s 
review and Financial review that is cross referred from the Principal activities section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we 
have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified 
by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent Company financial statements. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the parent Company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information 
outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by 
the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the 
amounts and disclosures in the parent Company financial statements. It also includes an assessment of 
the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the parent Company 
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we 
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the 
parent Company financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation 
of information in the parent Company financial statements. 111

Trade receivables
The Company has a policy for providing fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover. 
This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due 
and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, 
with exposure spread across a large number of subsidiary undertakings.
Included in the Company’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £nil (2008: 
£23,000) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Company has not provided as there has 
not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The 
Company does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of receivables not impaired is 
15 days (2008: 15 days).
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables:
      2009 2008
      £000 £000

Current      151,616 149,239
Balance at 31 March      151,616 149,262
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Company considers any change in the credit 
quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The 
concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
No allowance for doubtful debts are considered necessary based on prior experience and the Directors’ 
assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair 
value.
Cash balances and cash equivalents
Cash balances and cash equivalents of £65,515,000 (2008: £76,839,000) comprise cash held by the 
Company and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying 
amount of these assets approximates their fair value. 118

55. Share based payments
During the year ended 31 March 2009, the Company had five (2008: five) share based payment 
arrangements, which are described below:
i) Executive Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’)
The ESOP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Company’s shares on 
the day before the date of grant. The vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the real increase 
in Earnings Per Share over the vesting period. In addition, since 2006, vesting has also been dependent 
upon a share price target. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of 
grant, the options expire. 
ii) 2005 Key Executive Incentive Plan (‘KEIP’)
The KEIP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the 
day before the date of grant. The awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years 
from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche. 
The number of awards vesting is dependent upon the Profit Before Tax of the Group for the year ending  
31 March 2009 and is subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 March 2010. If the 
options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
iii) Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The LTIP provides for the grant of nil cost options. The vesting period is between three and five years and  
is dependent upon the Total Shareholder Return performance of the Group over the relevant performace 
period. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options 
expire.
iv) Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
The Deferred Bonus Plan enables the individual to defer receipt of their annual cash bonus (up to a 
maximum of 100%) and to invest an equivalent amount in the ordinary share capital of the Company.  
The deferred bonus may be matched by the Company dependent upon the Company’s relative Total 
Shareholder Return over a three year period, up to a maximum of 300% of the deferred amount for upper 
decile performance. The shares cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised 
within 10 years from the date of grant.
v) Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’)
The SAYE is open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted market 
price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount. The options can be exercised during 
a six month period following the completion of either a three or five year savings period.  120

The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the ESOP and 
SAYE and Monte Carlo simulations for the KEIP, LTIP and Deferred Bonus Plan. The assumptions used in the 
models are as follows:
Input   Assumption
Share price  Price at date of grant
Exercise price  Per scheme rules
Expected volatility  20% - 30%
Option life  Per scheme rules
Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield
Risk free interest rate 3.8% - 5.2%
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.

Notes to the financial statements

59. Financial instruments
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Company from which financial instrument risk arises are  
as follows:
– cash and cash equivalents 
– bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities 
– trade receivables 
– inter-company receivables and payables 
– trade payables
All principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost.
Capital risk management
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity. The capital structure of the 
Company consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 50, cash and cash equivalents 
and equity comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 54, 57 and 58.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Company manages as capital:
      2009 2008
      £000 £000
Shareholders’ funds      201,020 234,060
Bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities     (10,515) 13,161
Financial risk management objectives
The Company’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts. The main purpose of 
these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company’s operations. The Company also has various 
other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from  
its operations.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and 
liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk
The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s 
long term debt requirements with floating interest rates. The Company’s policy is to manage its interest cost 
using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts. To manage this, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, 
in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable 
rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. These swaps 
are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations. 123

The Company has entered into an interest rate swap in order to manage the interest rate risks arising from 
the Company’s operations and its sources of finance. It is, and has been throughout the year under review, 
the Company’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
At 31 March 2009 the Company had in place an interest rate swap to hedge loans subject to variable 
interest rates linked to LIBOR whereby it receives a floating rate of interest based on one month LIBOR on a 
notional principal of £50m (2008: £50m) and pays a fixed rate of interest of 4.9% (2008: 4.9%). The remaining 
term of the interest rate swap is one year. The fair value of the interest rate swap at 31 March 2009 was 
£1,947,000 liability (2008: £nil). The timing of the impact on the income statement of the swap is up to one 
year from the balance sheet date. The impact of the cash flow hedge on the income statement will be 
expensed through the finance cost line.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change of 10% increase in interest 
rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Company’s profit before tax (through the impact on 
floating rate borrowings).

Notes to the financial statements
year ended 31 March 2009
Credit risk
The Company trades only with creditworthy third parties and subsidiary undertakings. It is the Company’s 
policy that customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Company, which comprise cash and 
cash equivalents the Company’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Company manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only 
with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions. 
The Company has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables  
and instruments.
Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Company’s Board which sets the 
framework for the management of the Company’s short, medium and long term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and 
banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. Included in note 23 are 
details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Company and the Group to further reduce  
liquidity risk.
All of the Company’s financial liabilities are due for payment within one year, based on contractual  
payment terms. 125

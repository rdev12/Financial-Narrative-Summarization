Group at a Glance
The UK and Ireland’s biggest specialist
electricals chain, combining Currys
Megastores and Superstores and
Currys.digital on the high street. Dixons
Travel stores are based at UK airports
and the Eurotunnel terminal.
Ireland operates as Currys and 
PC World.
Currys opened its flagship 55,000 sq ft Megastore and refitted a number 
of Superstores and Currys.digital stores. It also launched further services 
for customers including next-day delivery and market leading three-hour
timed delivery slots.
During the year, Dixons Tax Free rebranded as Dixons Travel and new 
format stores were introduced, including a first PC World airport store 
at Heathrow, Terminal 5.
Description Our brands Highlights
PC World is the UK’s biggest chain of
computing superstores. DSGi Business
is the specialist provider of business 
IT solutions comprising PC World
Business, Equanet, MacWarehouse 
and Microwarehouse. The TechGuys 
are the UK’s largest national digital
support service for customers in-store
and in their homes.
PC World unveiled its new store concept which helps customers get 
the most out of their shopping trip with numerous ‘experience zones’ 
to try out hundreds of products throughout the store. ‘Get Connected’, 
a market-beating mobile broadband proposition was launched, offering the
biggest range of subsidised or free laptops and netbooks. Improvements 
are being made to The TechGuys operations to provide improved choices
and services for customers.
Elkjøp is the leading electrical retailer
across the Nordics.
Elkjøp and Lefdal stores operate in
Norway, El Giganten stores operate 
in Sweden and Denmark and Gigantti
stores operate in Finland. 
At the start of the year, Elkjøp opened a new Megastore in Lørenskog 
in Norway. Offering customers significantly increased ranges, it has had 
a strong first year’s trading with positive customer feedback. A further 
two Megastores have been opened in the Nordics during the year.
Greece’s leading electrical retailer
operates as Kotsovolos and 
Electro World. Electro World 
stores also operate in Turkey.
In Italy, we operate UniEuro electrical
stores, some with PC City ‘stores-
in-stores’. PC City also operates 
in Spain.
Greece grew market share in a challenging market and Turkey performed 
in line with expectations. The turnaround plan in Italy is showing progress
with encouraging signs in a difficult economic environment. A store closure
programme concluded ahead of schedule, and management have made
significant improvements in a number of areas, including stock levels,
availability and margins. In Spain, a plan to reduce costs, manage stocks 
and preserve cash has been implemented.
Electro World stores operate in the
Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia.
Operations in the Czech Republic continue to perform well despite the weak
environment. The Group’s first stores in Slovakia have performed in line with
expectations. In May, the Group announced it had sold the operations of
Electro World Hungary, confirming at the same time that Poland remains
under strategic review.
PIXmania.com is a pan-European 
online electrical retailer.
Dixons.co.uk is one of the leading 
UK electrical e-tailers.
PIXmania performed well in most of its key markets, although sales growth
was impacted by the slowing consumer environment, and sales in the UK
were held back by the strength of the euro.
Dixons.co.uk continues to improve its consumer proposition which will be
bolstered further when it transitions to the PIXmania e-merchant platform.

2004/05 8.05 Chairman’ s Statement
Extraordinary times call for extraordinary effort, initiative 
and resilience. These qualities have been delivered by 
John Browett and his executive in the financial year 2008/09.
After settling into the Company I asked John Browett 
whether he could see a way of returning DSGi to greatness.
He replied: “Yes, I can, providing we don’t find ourselves in a
deep recession.” “Don’t worry” I assured him, “there could be
some cyclical downturn in the economy but I don’t see why 
it should be more than that.” The Chairman’s crystal ball had
clearly ceased to function!
John Browett has led his team in the design of the ‘Renewal
and Transformation plan’ for the Group which provides a practical
template for improvement in virtually every aspect of our
business, with one overriding priority – serving the customer
better. The extent to which we have undergone change in top
management and are now doing so in store design, layout and
processes, internet operations, buying, distribution, systems
and reward is radical if not revolutionary. It is being done with
a very high level of support and commitment from employees
across Europe who believe it is the right thing to do. The
positive aspect of a severe economic downturn is not only
that it fosters the strengths associated with survival, but also
that any ‘blockers’ to improving performance are swept away.
The importance of completing all these changes and, in
particular, rolling out our new store formats with a more
customer-focused business model, coupled with the Group’s
reduced earnings, called for refinancing. The success of our
recent Placing and Rights Issue together with renewed credit
facilities from our banks calls for me to thank our shareholders
and banks for their faith in what we are doing. My thanks also
to our advisers, whose support was excellent.
Your Board is ever conscious of the need to recover the share
price and in due course, when affordable, reinstate a dividend.
The reduction in our market capitalisation in the past year was
painful and demanded the actions we are sharing with you in
this report. Economic recovery is unlikely in the short term and
therefore we cannot promise immediate earnings improvement.
We have found an extremely able Chief Executive whose retail
skills are exactly what is needed for today’s environment. He 
is well on the way to building the team needed to execute our
plan and our determination to serve the customer better 
is at the core of everything we are doing, in our stores, on 
our websites, and in our infrastructure and back office. Our
intention is that the changes which we are making will improve
DSGi’s competitiveness during the downturn and put the
Group in a stronger position to benefit from recovery in the
future. Your Board believes that technological innovation and
new product development in electronics and computing, together
with the replacement cycle in white goods, will continue to
make this a sector with attractive long term prospects.
The DSG Foundation support for the Switched on Communities
programme came to an end this year and I wish the four
charities supported through that programme the very best 
for the future. The Foundation’s focus going forward will be 
in supporting the fundraising efforts of our colleagues in 
stores in engaging with their local communities.
Nicholas Cadbury, who was appointed Finance Director 
on 14 August 2008, and the Finance team have done an
outstanding job in leading the refinancing of the Group. 
A very special thank you goes to Nicholas and his team 
as it does to Helen Grantham and her legal team.
We are delighted that John Allan has agreed to be our
Chairman and we give him a very warm welcome. I have 
every confidence that John has the skills and experience
needed at Board level to ensure the successful completion 
of the Renewal and Transformation plan.
Our thanks go to Count Emmanuel d’André who has served
us well as a non-executive director. His retail experience and
knowledge of Continental Europe has been of particular value,
as well as being an excellent colleague. He will retire at the AGM.
I wish you all well.

John Allan and Sir John Collins Directors’ Report: Business Overview
Chief Executive’ s Statement
Our five point plan for the renewal and transformation of the Group
1 Focus on the customer: better value, choice 
and service
Many changes have been made to make our shopping trip
better for customers, including:
■ putting over 20,000 colleagues in the UK through a
comprehensive service programme. This provides better
service in our stores and helps customers choose the most
suitable mix of products, services, and accessories to meet
their needs;
■ improving the delivery, repair and after-sales service, for
example through the introduction of Currys’ next-day delivery
in three-hour time slots;
■ enhancements to The TechGuys support services business,
resulting in an increase in the annual sales of services in 
PC World;
■ improvements to our repair service. For example, customers’
TVs are now being repaired within 8 days on average rather
than 21 days previously. Further enhancements to this
service will follow. We carried out approximately 110,000 
flat panel television and over 330,000 laptop repairs in the
UK during the year; 
■ improvements to product ranges in our UK and Italian
stores in order to provide wider and clearer choices of
products at competitive prices; and
■ new incentive and remuneration schemes for UK store
colleagues to support better customer service and 
team work.
Our last financial year has been one of significant change for
the Group. We have taken wide-ranging actions to reorganise,
restructure, renew and transform the business.
The Renewal and Transformation plan was drawn up following
extensive and in-depth customer research. We have listened to
customers about what they want. 
We are improving the business for our customers by delivering
an unbeatable combination of value, choice and service. We
are improving our store formats, providing better service in-
store, selling complete solutions, delivering at more convenient
times and improving our technical and after-sales service. 
The Placing and Rights Issue received strong support from
shareholders. It was well received by suppliers. We now 
have the resources and flexibility to deliver our Renewal and
Transformation plan. This is an update on each of the five
points of the plan.

range, easier navigation and up to date environment
As at 20 June 2009, in the UK, the following new format
stores had been opened:
■ 30 Currys Superstores which have delivered average gross
profit uplifts of between 23% and 57% versus the rest of the
chain, ahead of management’s expectations. There are
plans to refurbish a further 58 Currys Superstores in the
year ahead;
■ 5 Currys.digital stores which have delivered average 
gross profit uplifts of 31% versus the rest of the chain. 
As we have previously stated we intend to focus
Currys.digital in approximately 100 core locations across 
the UK. The remaining Currys.digital stores will be closed 
as their leases come to an end. The average lease length 
of the Currys.digital stores is approximately four years;
■ 2 Currys Megastores. This is a unique new concept to the
UK providing the largest range of electrical products under
one roof in the UK. The first Megastore at Junction 9 in
Birmingham opened in October and is, at 55,000 sq ft, 
the UK’s largest electrical store. In its opening weekend 
it generated sales of £2.3 million, exceeding expectations,
and is expected to generate approximately £30 million of
sales per annum. It has delivered average gross profit uplift
of 65% versus the rest of the chain. On 4 June the second
Currys Megastore opened in New Malden, London, a new
site of 37,000 sq ft which has got off to a very encouraging
start. A further 4 Currys Megastores are planned for the new
financial year;
■ 41 PC World superstores have now been reformatted. 
The changes to the PC World format have been less
significant than compared to the Currys stores but they
have generated an average gross profit uplift of 11% versus
the rest of the chain. Further improvements are being made
to the new PC World stores and we believe that further
improvements to the gross profit uplifts can be achieved;
■ 1 trial Currys and PC World 2-in-1 store in Weybridge,
Surrey, has been opened. By incorporating a mezzanine 
into an existing Currys store, the PC World brand has 
been introduced into a catchment where no PC World
existed before. This new format has exceeded expectations
generating an average uplift to gross profit of 65% compared
to the store prior to its refit. Further trials of these 2-in-1
stores are planned this year;
■ we are sharing best practice across our international
businesses and learnings from new formats are being
introduced across the Group;
■ our first new format Megastore was opened in Lørenskog 
in Oslo on 5 May 2008 followed by 3 further Megastores 
in Sweden and Norway; and
■ superstores in Greece, Italy, Ireland and the Nordics are
being reformatted utilising the latest formats from the UK,
with strong early results.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 11
Business Overview Performance Review Strategic Summary Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders
Currys Megastore, ‘J9’, Birmingham Directors’ Report: Business Overview
Chief Executive’s Statement continued
On the basis of the gross profit uplifts achieved to date, 
and taking into account the investment and costs involved 
in reformatting stores, we plan to roll out these renewed
formats across the UK, to capture the benefits of a better
shopping trip as rapidly and effectively as possible.
The average cash payback of the total investment spent 
on reformatting stores in the UK & Ireland is targeted to be
three to four years, which is equivalent to a cash return on
investment of 25% to 33%.
During the new financial year we plan to reformat in total, 
15 Currys.digital stores, 75 Currys Superstores, 20 PC World
stores, open 5 further Currys Megastores and trial 5 further 
2-in-1 combined Currys and PC World stores in the UK. 
In the Nordics we are planning to open up to 10 Megastores
across the region as well as refurbish 15 to 20 Superstores.
3 Focus on winning positions
We have market-leading electrical and computing retail
operations in the UK & Ireland, the Nordic region and 
Greece as well as the strong and growing internet presence 
in Europe. We will exploit the potential of all of these
businesses over the coming years. Additionally, we have
introduced a programme to reduce losses and turn around
the operations in Italy, Spain and Central Europe.
During the year and in line with our strategy, we closed 
PC City in Sweden and Markantalo in Finland as they were
loss-making chains.
In Italy, following a strategic review, the first stage of a
comprehensive turnaround plan has been completed. 
We have closed stores, reduced costs, improved stock turn
and integrated PC City within UniEuro. We expect to invest
approximately €60 million to €75 million of cash in total over
the next three financial years to achieve profitability in Italy.
The strategic review of PC City in Spain concluded that we
needed to restructure the business to reduce costs and 
to minimise cash outflow until the Spanish market recovers.
As a result, 11 stores have been closed and the remaining 
33 stores will be reformatted utilising the principles of the 
new store formats in the UK. Having made these changes 
we believe underlying cash losses in Spain will be materially
reduced over the next two years.
In Central Europe, the operations in Hungary have been sold.
The core operations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia
continue to perform well in their markets and remain as part 
of the Group. We will restructure the central office operations
based in the Czech Republic to meet the needs of customers
in these two countries better. The operations in Poland remain
under review.
4 Win on the internet 
We achieved over £1.2 billion of sales over the internet across
Europe in the financial year. Our objective is to achieve a return
of 2% to 3% per annum on internet sales in the medium term. 
The PIXmania e-merchant platform is a leading internet 
sales engine for electrical and computing products in Europe.
To leverage e-merchant, we expect to roll out this platform 
in the UK during the course of the 2009/10 financial year. 
This will provide customers with improved functionality, 
easier navigation, better product information and accessory
attachment. In addition, system changes have been made so
that PIXmania can benefit from access to the Group’s logistics
infrastructure, particularly in the UK, enabling it to reduce its
cross-border stock and pricing risk on sales of products.
We will continue to exploit our successful reserve&collect and
collect@store options for customers in the UK and Europe.
5 Reduce costs
We are using the step change programme to simplify our
business operations. We are changing our operations to make
them better for customers, easier for colleagues and therefore
cheaper to operate. 
Cost savings of £95 million were achieved in the 2008/09
financial year. There remains significant opportunity for
productivity improvements within the Group and we plan to
deliver £200 million in cost savings over the next four years.
There are efficiency initiatives in logistics, services, head office
administration and in-store processes. The changes also
improve the number of deliveries and repairs that are done
right first time. Process improvement initiatives have already
contributed to reductions in levels of stock held by the Group
of between 15% and 20% year on year.

and a new clearance policy incorporating dynamic pricing.
Outlook
The difficult economic backdrop across Europe and reduction
in consumer spending, particularly on discretionary products,
has been well publicised. We expect these conditions to
continue throughout the coming year in many of our markets.
We are well prepared for this environment and continue to
focus on managing costs, margins, stock turn and cash flow,
alongside the Renewal and Transformation plan.
With the improvements to our business we are well positioned
to emerge from the recession with a more compelling offer 
for customers and are confident of our medium term target 
of achieving a 3% to 4% return on sales.

(3) Like for like sales are calculated based on stores that have been open for a full financial year both at the commencement and end of the financial period. Customer support agreement 
sales are excluded from all UK like for like calculations to remove the distorting effect of the introduction of pay-as-you-go customer support agreements. Operations that are subject 
to closure have sales excluded as of the announcement date. Stores subject to a refurbishment are excluded during the period of refurbishment.
(4) Underlying Retail profit is underlying profit before tax, net finance (charges) / income and net property losses.
(5) Throughout this statement, references are made to ‘underlying’ performance measures. Underlying results are defined as excluding trading results from businesses to be closed, the
amortisation of acquired intangibles, net restructuring and business impairment charges and other one-off non-recurring items, profit on sale of investments, net fair value remeasurements
of financial instruments and, where applicable, discontinued operations. These excluded items are described as ‘non-underlying’. The financial effect of these items is shown in the analyses
on the face of the income statement and in note 4 to the financial statements.
(6) Free Cash Flow relates to continuing operations and comprises net cash flow from operating activities before special pension contributions, plus net finance income, less income tax paid
and net capital expenditure.
(7) The weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of earnings per share for both 2008/09 and 2007/08 has been multiplied by an adjustment factor to reflect the bonus
element of the shares issued under the terms of the rights issue (as described in note 35 to the financial statements). The adjustment factor used was 1.2138.
(8) Unless otherwise noted, figures relate to continuing operations, excluding the results of businesses to be closed. Total revenue including discontinued operations and businesses to 
be closed was £8,415.1 million (2007/08 £8,556.8 million).
(9) UK & Ireland Electricals comprises Currys, Currys.digital and Dixons Travel as well as the operations in Ireland.
(10) UK Computing comprises PC World, DSGi Business and The TechGuys. Like for like sales are for PC World only.
(11) Nordics comprise the Elkjøp Group, and no longer include the results of PC City Sweden and Markantalo which are now classified as businesses to be closed within non-underlying items.
(12) Southern Europe comprises Greece (Kotsovolos and Electro World), Italy (UniEuro), Spain (PC City Spain) and Turkey (Electro World).
(13) Central Europe comprises Electro World operations in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia and no longer includes the results of the discontinued operation Electro World Hungary.
Central Europe results are excluded from like for like comparisons as the number of stores trading is insufficient for a meaningful like for like comparison to be made.
(14) e-commerce division comprises PIXmania and Dixons.co.uk.

A completely new range of televisions

impacting sales and margins. However, management are
taking the necessary actions to focus on cash management.
The market leading position and efficient structure that the
Group operates in Ireland outperforms its competitors. During
the year, Dixons stores in Ireland were rebranded Currys in
order to reduce costs and align the business with that of 
the UK.
During the year, Dixons Tax Free rebranded as Dixons Travel.
The new format stores introduced with the opening of the 
new Terminal 5 at Heathrow are being rolled out across the
rest of the airport stores. These new formats incorporate
many of the same customer benefits as the reformatted
Currys.digital and Currys Superstores with playtables and
improved ranges. In June, Dixons Travel opened its second
accessories store, ADD+, in Stansted Airport. Despite the
weaker economic environment the Dixons Travel stores are
performing well.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 17
Business Overview
Currys and Currys.digital experienced difficult trading
conditions throughout the year as the consumer environment
deteriorated. In July 2008, Currys introduced a programme to
reduce prices on televisions to bring them more into line with
the internet. In the first half of the year, Currys also executed 
a programme to reduce stock levels, particularly older stock.
These two actions, together with an increased mix into small
brown and technology products, impacted gross margins in
the first half of the year. A very tough market in the lead-up 
to the important Christmas period was followed by a better
than expected sales period. Following the Christmas trading
period, gross margins improved as management continued 
to focus on in-store service, costs and cash generation.
White goods have been particularly hit by the slowdown
in the housing market, but have shown signs of stability in 
the latter part of the year. Computing products, particularly
laptops and netbooks have shown strong volume growth in 
the second half of the year. With good stock control, careful
cost and cash management, improving customer service as
well as the benefits of the Renewal and Transformation plan,
Currys and Currys.digital are well placed to operate prudently
through the recession and capitalise on any improvement in
consumer demand.

PC World was trading against a strong comparative period 
in the first half of the year as laptop overstocks were cleared
and as the year progressed was also impacted by the weaker
consumer environment. However, careful margin and stock
management as well as a number of initiatives described
below have limited the impact of the weaker sales
environment on profit performance.
PC World extended its range of connectivity solutions. 
‘Get Connected’, the market-beating mobile broadband
proposition, offers the biggest range of subsidised or free
laptops and netbooks in the UK, tailored to suit customers’
needs. A number of the new format store teams are trialling 
a dedicated zone to demonstrate connectivity solutions for 
the household. Netbooks are now established as a new
product range and PC World has swiftly established clear
market leadership in this new area.
The PC World store refurbishment has progressed well, with
41 stores (25% of the PC World portfolio) converted in time 
for Christmas trading.

operations to provide improved choices and services for
customers with new propositions planned to be rolled out
during the course of the year. The Group expects to innovate
further with other subscription products and service offers 
for customers.
DSGi Business sales were £325.8 million (2007/08

Directors’ Report: Performance Review
Nordics
Sales performance was impacted as the effects of the 
global financial crisis spread more widely across Europe
during the year. The businesses have performed well 
relative to the overall markets in the Nordic region, gaining
market share, especially in Denmark, where customers 
are recognising the strong value proposition. Management 
are taking the necessary actions to manage the business
appropriately, focusing on margin, costs, stock and capital.
At the start of the year, Elkjøp opened a new Megastore 
in Lørenskog (near Oslo) in Norway. Offering customers
significantly increased ranges, it has had a strong first year’s
trading with positive customer feedback and a further three
Megastores have been opened across the Nordics from 
which initial results have also been promising.
Elkjøp’s multi-channel offering continued to grow in all 
markets with a 48% increase in online sales. It introduced 
a reserve&collect service in August 2008 in most of its
operations, which has been well received by customers.
In March 2009, management also announced that it would
close the loss making operations of PC City in Sweden and
Markantalo in Finland.
In the Nordic region, Elkjøp saw sales decline 1% at
constant exchange rates, while in sterling, sales grew 
by 11% to £1,625.2 million (2007/08 £1,469.3 million). 
Like for like sales were down 7%. Underlying operating
profits were £76.1 million (2007/08 £97.7 million). Nordic
region results are stated excluding the businesses to be
closed of PC City in Sweden and Markantalo in Finland.

within the year, impacting the total sales performance. 
Store trials continue to perform ahead of expectations and the
integrated PC City ‘store-in-stores’ are delivering significant
sales uplifts in the computing category. Management have
significantly improved availability in-store, with plans for further
improvements in place, they have reduced stock and margins
have shown good progress across the year.
Following the strategic review, the Group is focused on 
the turnaround plan under the new management team. 
As a result of the improvements being delivered, the Group 
is confident in the long term prospects for UniEuro, however,
the weak consumer environment will impact overall performance
in the short term. Management estimate that approximately
€60 million to €75 million of cash in total over the next three
financial years will be required before the Italian business can
achieve profitability.
Greece
Kotsovolos total sales were down 3% at constant exchange
rates and up 15% in sterling at £405.7 million (2007/08
£354.1 million).
During the first half, Kotsovolos and Electro World were
trading against tough comparables in the prior year which,
together with a weak consumer environment across the 
year, has held back total sales. However, as Greece’s leading
specialist electrical retailer, Kotsovolos and Electro World 
are growing market share. Careful management of costs, 
cash and stock have limited the effects of the weakening
environment on bottom line performance.
This division comprises operations in Italy, Greece, 
Spain and Turkey. Total sales declined by 10% at 
constant exchange rates and grew by 6% in sterling 
to £1,405.4 million (2007/08 £1,325.7 million), with like 
for like sales down 13%. Underlying operating loss 
was £(19.4) million (2007/08 loss of £(14.8) million).
Italy
Total sales for UniEuro in Italy were down 17% at constant
exchange rates and down 1% in sterling to £722.5 million
(2007/08 £732.6 million).
The turnaround plan in Italy continues to make good 
progress with some encouraging signs in a difficult economic
environment. The two year store closure programme has 
been completed ahead of schedule with 46 stores closed

On 29 December 2008, the Group acquired a further 10%
interest in Kotsovolos for a cash consideration of €28.1 million
(£27.5 million) following the exercise of a put option by Fourlis
Holdings SA. The consideration was calculated in accordance
with the pricing formula agreed at the time that the Group
acquired a controlling interest in Kotsovolos in September
2004. This acquisition takes the Group’s total interest in
Kotsovolos to 99% of the issued share capital.
Spain
PC City sales in Spain were down 13% at constant 
exchange rates and up 3% in sterling at £224.3 million
(2007/08 £217.4 million). An extremely tough economic
environment has impacted consumer demand. Management
are implementing a plan to reduce costs, manage stocks and
preserve cash. As at 9 May 2009, 11 stores had been closed
and management believe that losses will be materially reduced
as well as position the business better for when the Spanish 
economy recovers.
Turkey
The Group now operates eight stores in Turkey under 
the Electro World brand with its local joint venture partner.
These new stores are based on the Group’s new large space
format, providing a greater product range and exciting retail
environment for customers. Initial results from these stores
have been positive with further stores planned.
In Central Europe, Electro World saw sales decline 
by 15% at constant exchange rates, growing by 10% 
in sterling to £160.4 million (2007/08 £145.6 million).
Underlying operating losses were £(9.9) million (2007/08

the operations in Hungary, which have been sold.
Operations in the Czech Republic continue to perform well,
despite the weak consumer environment. During the year 
the Group opened its first stores in Slovakia and these have
performed in line with expectations.
On 19 May the Group announced that it had sold the
operations of Electro World in Hungary for a consideration 
of €1. The sale involved the transfer of all nine stores,
operations and employees to the purchaser, EW Electro 
Retail Ltd. The important operations in the Czech Republic
and Slovakia, which continue to perform well in their markets,
remain as part of the Group. Management is planning to
restructure the central office operations based in the Czech
Republic to meet the needs of customers in these two countries
better. The operations in Poland remain under review.

PIXmania performed well in most of its core markets, although
sales growth has been impacted by the slowing consumer
environment, particularly in the UK, France and Spain. Its
overall performance was held back by lower sales in the UK
due to the strength of the euro making the business less price
competitive. Improvements to logistics and better integration
into the Group’s European buying network will reduce this
issue over time. In its core euro trading markets, PIXmania’s

■ in March the Group announced the closure of standalone
stores of PC City in Sweden and Markantalo in Finland
which were completed by 20 May 2009. These have been
classified as businesses to be closed;
■ amortisation of acquired intangibles of £4.9 million
predominantly comprises brand names, with the year 
on year change being affected by currency movements;
■ strategic reorganisation costs of £59.1 million relate to 
the UK business transformation which primarily comprises:
asset impairments associated with the reformat of the 
UK store portfolio; reorganisation costs of the Service
infrastructure; and headcount reductions which have
predominantly been incurred in the UK retail support 
centre. The prior year amounts related mainly to the
reformat of the UK store portfolio;
■ the turnaround plan announced for Italy in the prior year 
has made significant progress. The planned store closures
have been achieved in a faster timeframe than originally
expected and also at lower cost. This has resulted in the
release of surplus lease and employee severance provisions
in the current financial year;
■ other business impairments comprise the closure 
costs of the PC City Sweden and Markantalo stores; 
the closure costs of 11 stores and impairment charges 
in PC City Spain in connection with the restructuring of 
this business; the impairment of Polish stores following 
a disappointing performance in this market; and the
impairment of Currys.digital and certain Currys High Street
stores as the closure programme of those non-core stores,
identified last financial year, is implemented;
■ the Buncefield release relates partly to a settlement received
from the oil companies’ insurers together with a related
release of surplus provision originally set up following the
explosion at the oil storage depot near the Group’s UK 
retail support centre in December 2005; and
■ the financing charge of £7.4 million relates to net fair 
value remeasurement losses on revaluation of financial
instruments as required by IAS 32 and 39. The main
component of the net charge is a £5.9 million revaluation 
of the Kotsovolos put option up to the exercise date of 
29 December 2008 and arose mainly as a result of foreign
exchange movements between sterling and the euro.
24 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow was £(412.6) million (2007/08 £91.6 million
Free Cash Flow).
(i) Capital expenditure in the prior year excludes £7.1 million (shown within net restructuring
and impairment costs) relating to the restructuring of distribution assets in the UK.
(ii) Sale of freehold property in the prior year excludes £10.0 million of sale proceeds relating
to PC City France, and in the current year excludes £18.0 million of sale proceeds relating
to the sale of the Group’s former warehouse in Stevenage. These sale proceeds are
shown within net restructuring and impairment costs.
The cash utilisation was primarily due to working capital
outflows, reduced profitability, restructuring costs and 
cash costs associated with the Group’s hedging activities.
The working capital outflows were primarily due to:
■
structural changes in the trade supplier credit environment
which have limited the Group’s ability in the 2008/09
financial year to repeat historical deferrals of payments 
due to suppliers of between approximately £130 million to
£150 million that previously occurred over its prior financial
year end;
■
one-off early settlement payments to trade suppliers 
of approximately £50 million to assist them in managing 
their credit risk;
■
increase in debtors as a result of the ‘Get Connected’
programme; and
■
continued unwinding of the Customer Services Agreement
creditors as a result of the change in mix from term to
monthly payment contracts.

Capital expenditure was £141.8 million (2007/08 £165.7 million),
down £23.9 million due to a reduction in store openings 
and postponement of the One Group programme. Cash
generated from the sale of property was £10.8 million
(2007/08 £41.5 million), as previously announced this was
lower than anticipated due to the decision to delay the sale
and leaseback of the Group’s Swedish distribution centre.
Other net spend of £65.8 million includes £83.3 million of
revaluation settlements primarily on currency hedges taken
out in previous years against certain overseas assets and
intercompany balances (2007/08 £29.5 million). As previously
announced this was approximately £30 million higher than
anticipated due to the significant further movements in foreign
exchange rates during the year.
Net restructuring and impairment reflects the cash outflows
relating to the strategic reorganisation and business
impairment activities. These predominantly comprise lease
and other property related payments and employee severance
costs, less the disposal proceeds from the sale of the
Stevenage site.

Group Financial Summary continued
Movements in net funds include £60.3 million dividend payments
(being the final 2007/08 dividend), £27.6 million acquisition
costs primarily representing the additional 10% of Kotsovolos
acquired on 29 December 2008, and £13.2 million representing
the net cash utilisation of the discontinued operations in
Hungary. The £12.0 million special pension contribution was
made in accordance with the agreement with the trustee of
the UK defined benefit pension scheme to reduce the pension
deficit, with further amounts of £12.0 million being payable
annually until December 2012. Other items include the impact
on net funds of revaluing the 2012 Bond, offset by the
revaluation of net funds held in foreign currencies and capital
contributions made by our Turkish joint venture partner.
It should be noted that the restricted funds balance has
reduced by less than was originally expected as a result 
of the cancellation of a £50 million letter of credit facility in
December 2008 which necessitated additional funds to be
placed in trust. Furthermore, management expect the amount
of restricted funds to increase during 2009/10 by approximately
£20 million as a result of the amendments made to the
Group’s remaining £75 million letter of credit facility.
On 30 April 2009 the Group announced that it had reached
agreement with its lending banks to amend its £400 million
Revolving Credit Facility and its £75 million Letter of Credit
Facility, as well as raising £310.6 million by way of an equity
Placing and Rights Issue. The equity Placing and Rights 
Issue was approved by shareholders on 18 May 2009. The
receipt of net proceeds of approximately £293.6 million was
completed on 9 June 2009 and, as required by the amended
facilities, have been used to reduce the drawings on these
facilities.
Property losses
Property losses increased to £18.1 million (2007/08 
£7.3 million loss), as the provision to cover the potential 
cost of sub-leasing or assigning our non-trading stores in 
the UK was increased to reflect the deterioration in the UK
property market.
Underlying net finance costs
Underlying net finance costs were £(26.9) million (2007/08
£13.0 million income). The movement year on year was driven
by three key areas:
■ interest cost increases driven by higher borrowings, the cost
of refinancing, and lower interest rates on cash on deposit;
■ losses on earnings related hedges due to the weakening 
of the pound against the Norwegian krone and the euro,
offsetting the gains on the translation of earnings included 
in retail profit; and
■ higher pension interest due to increased discount rates 
on liabilities and lower earnings on assets.
Dividends
The Board believes that the Group’s existing financial
resources should be used to invest in the Renewal and
Transformation plan, which is showing early and encouraging
signs of delivering changes in the Group’s performance, and
to ensure liquidity.
The Revolving Credit Facility and Letter of Credit Facilities,
amended at the time of the refinancing, prohibit payments of
dividends to shareholders in respect of the 2008/09 financial
year and the 2009/10 financial year. The same agreements
allow the Company, subject to certain conditions, to pay a
dividend in respect of the 2010/11 financial year.
Subject to the above, the Board aims to resume dividend
payments when possible and appropriate, consistent with a
sustained recovery in the Group’s operational and financial
performance.
Tax
The Group’s tax rate on underlying profit before tax was
67.9% (2007/08 29.8%). The increase in the tax rate reflects
an increased proportion of loss making businesses where tax
benefits are not fully recognised.
As announced on 27 February 2009, the Group had 
been in dispute with HMRC regarding settlement of certain
intra-group trading arrangements as well as certain other
matters. The Group reached an agreement in principle with
HMRC regarding the settlement which was subsequently
confirmed on 4 June 2009. The settlement amount exceeded
the provision already held in the balance sheet and as a result
an additional non-underlying income tax charge of £52.7
million has been recorded.
26 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 Consolidated balance sheet
Consolidated net assets at 2 May 2009 decreased to 
£584.9 million from £853.5 million. The main movements
comprised £16.2 million generated from underlying post-tax
profits which was more than offset by non-underlying post-tax
charges of £235.5 million which included £22.1 million 
post-tax loss on discontinued operations, all of which are 
set out in the consolidated income statement on page 64. 
Net assets were further decreased by actuarial losses of
£114.3 million on the UK defined benefit pension scheme 
and adverse movements on derivative contracts of 
£73.4 million although these movements were largely 
offset by foreign exchange movements of £122.5 million 
and related tax effects of £53.2 million, all of which affected
reserves directly. The increased stake in Kotsovolos following
the exercise of a put option, further increased net assets by
£17.5 million. These movements were offset by dividend
payments of £60.7 million.
Pensions
At 2 May 2009, the IAS 19 accounting deficit of the UK
defined benefit pension scheme amounted to £148.8 million
(3 May 2008 £51.0 million). The assumptions used for
determining the accounting valuation use a consistent basis 
to that adopted in prior periods. The increased deficit is largely
due to a significant decrease in the value of the scheme’s
assets, which reflects current market conditions but has been
partly offset by an increase in the discount rate applied to the
liabilities (in accordance with accounting standards) which
again reflects the current market conditions.
The actuarial deficit of £61.0 million (measured as at 5 April
2007) is being addressed by special cash contributions 
of £12 million per annum which are payable in two equal
tranches of £6 million in June and December each year until
December 2012.
Over recent years, the Group has implemented a number 
of changes to pension arrangements in order to address 
the deficit over the longer term. The defined benefit section 
of the UK pension scheme was closed to new entrants on 
1 September 2002.

Business Overview Performance Review Strategic Summary Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders Directors’ Report: Performance Review
Corporate Responsibility Review
DSGi takes its responsibilities to 
its stakeholders seriously, aiming 
to have policies and procedures 
in place which balance the
expectations of our customers,
shareholders, employees and 
the wider community.
Set out in this review is a description of how we assess 
and act upon social, environmental and ethical issues
relevant to our business together with details of how 
we measure our performance in this area and examples
of some of the action we have taken during the period
under review. Our goal is to achieve continuous
improvement over time.
The Group Finance Director, Nicholas Cadbury, is the executive
director with responsibility for Corporate Responsibility (CR)
matters. The Group has also appointed a Corporate
Responsibility Committee (CR Committee), which is chaired
by the Company Secretary and General Counsel and also
comprises other senior executives who have responsibility 
for risk management, logistics, supply chain, UK operations,
Group communications, human resources, marketing and
property. The CR Committee’s remit is, in consultation with 
the Board, to set the direction for the Group’s CR efforts and
initiatives, agree action plans prepared to realise the opportunities
and mitigate the risks identified and track progress on actions
through an agreed set of key performance indicators (KPIs).
The Board considers CR matters, including relevant risks 
and opportunities, at least annually. Minutes of meetings of 
the CR Committee are circulated to the Board and Executive
Committee, so they can keep up to date with the action 
being taken in this area and any issues which arise.
The CR Committee met four times during the period 
under review and a summary of key matters discussed 
is listed below:
■
evaluation of the Group’s risks and opportunities and
identification of areas where the CR Committee needs to
enhance reporting or control mechanisms already in place;
■
re-evaluation of the CR KPIs of the Company, to align with
the wider business interests of the Group and with those 
of stakeholders;
■
evaluation of the CR Committee membership and realigning
the membership to have CR Committee members with
accountability for each of the KPIs; and
■
assessing the reporting structures in place and determining
changes to be implemented when gathering information in
respect of the KPIs.

‘FIVES’ is our bespoke customer service
training programme. Since launching FIVES 
we have seen our customer satisfaction 
rates improve. The last 12 months have been a period of significant challenge
to the Group as the global recession has impacted on
consumers and the business. During the period under review
the Renewal and Transformation plan, unveiled in May 2008,
has been rolled out across the UK and is being implemented
within the wider Group as appropriate. The CR Committee
reviewed the CR objectives in light of the plan and has
endeavoured to align the CR agenda with meeting the five
aims of the plan.
Risk management
During 2008 the CR Committee carried out a review of the
risks and opportunities for the Group in the CR area which
was subsequently approved by the Board. The aim of the
review was to ensure our CR focus is on the most appropriate
matters to the evolving business.
The review considered both short and long term risks and
opportunities and their potential operational and value impact
on the business and resulted in an agreed set of priorities
which are:
■
to improve operational energy efficiency and forward
planning;
■
to reduce our impact on the environment, and to raise
revenue and reduce costs, through improved waste
recycling;
■
to add to and promote the customer proposition in 
relation to product reuse and recycling;
■
the provision of a safe and healthy environment for
customers, employees and visitors to our sites;
Identification of risks and opportunities
■ engagement of employees through the provision of
rewarding workplace environments and careers, assisting 
in the ongoing improvement of customer service levels;
■ the provision of safe and reliable own-brand products,
achieved as a result of our expert technical knowledge, 
with products sourced from manufacturers who are 
audited against our ethical requirements; and
■ an appropriate community giving policy, which
complements our interaction with the communities 
in which we work.
A member of the CR Committee has been identified as
accountable for each of the priorities together with individuals
outside of the CR Committee who have responsibility for the
relevant area.
KPIs
Following the review of the risks and opportunities referred 
to above, the Group also reviewed the KPIs which were 
being monitored in the CR area and agreed a revised set 
of KPIs to enable the Group to monitor performance against
the priorities it had set.
The environment related KPIs have been established in 
line with the DEFRA document ‘Key Performance Indicators:
Reporting Guidelines for UK Business’ and with the five 
stated aims of the BRC initiative ‘A Better Retailing Climate’.
The Group’s largest business is its retail business in the 
UK & Ireland and the Group is collecting all of the KPIs listed
below in respect of the UK business. Data for other countries
is collected where available and the intention is to extend
collection of data for all of the KPIs to the wider Group over time.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 29

Our agreed KPIs are as follows:
1. Staff diversity – age, gender and ethnicity 
of employees
2. Health and Safety – employee accidents and injuries
3. Performance on ethical supply chain audits
4. Customer satisfaction
5. Waste electrical equipment collected and recycled
from customers
6. Business waste recycled
7. Group carbon emissions
8. Contributions to the community Directors’ Report: Performance Review
Corporate Responsibility Review continued
With approximately 40,000 employees, our employees are 
our greatest asset and we are committed to high standards 
of employment practice. We aim to reward individuals fairly
and are committed to providing equality of opportunity,
training and development and a safe workplace, in addition 
to developing initiatives which encourage innovation.
Policies
The Group has a comprehensive set of human resources
policies, which cover matters such as reward recognition,
health and wellbeing, promotion and development and
working policies. The aim of these policies is to set out 
our responsibilities and obligations to our employees, 
whilst demonstrating our commitment to be an employer 
of choice. These policies, given the location of our stores 
and subsequently employees, are normally communicated 
via our intranet site. The policies are regularly reviewed and
comply with current regulation.
Training and development
We seek to promote career development with our colleagues
regardless of location. The Group provides its employees with
access to relevant training and development schemes through
in-house training and is committed to undertaking formal
performance and development reviews on a regular basis.
During the past 12 months we have launched our bespoke
customer service training programme in the UK, ‘FIVES’, and
over 20,000 colleagues have received training on it. FIVES is
based on the principle of understanding our customers’ needs
completely, giving them solutions and helping them to make
superb choices. FIVES gives us easy-to-use tools to explore
our customers’ needs and give them a consistently fantastic
experience – wherever they shop. Building upon the success
of the PC World Retail Academies which has coached over
8,000 colleagues on FIVES and Winning New Revenues, the
Workplace
Retail Academies programme has been extended to cover
each of the UK brands. This assists in the delivery of vital
training across the UK. FIVES training is also a key factor in
measuring customer satisfaction, which is discussed below.
Diversity
We value our colleagues and their right to be treated with
respect. We are committed to treating our employees equally
and fairly and we actively pursue a diversity policy. The 
UK & Ireland’s policy on Equal Opportunities states that no
employee should suffer discrimination in respect of disability,
gender, sexual orientation, age, religious belief, race, colour,
nationality, marital status or for any other reason. This policy
applies to the recruitment, training and career development of
all colleagues. The policy is communicated to all employees
via the HR intranet site and is reviewed regularly to ensure its
efficacy. Additionally, the Group keeps records of the ethnic
origins of new and existing employees and recruitment and
promotion decisions.
Health and Safety
The Group has implemented a Health and Safety policy
across all of its operations which meets at least the minimum
legal requirements of the countries in which it operates and
emphasises the principles of good safety management. Each
jurisdiction has a framework within which the Group fulfils its
obligations and assists our colleagues in maintaining a healthy
and safe work environment.
Within the UK & Ireland, regular Health and Safety audits 
are carried out on the stores, warehouses and offices of the
Group. Each location has a nominated individual responsible
for Health and Safety and for ensuring a safe environment for
our colleagues. Through active reviews of policy and focused
risk assessment and monitoring, the number of reported
accidents has decreased over the last three financial years,
making the working environment for our colleagues safer 
and decreasing costs to the business accordingly.

The Group places considerable value on the involvement 
of its employees and is committed to providing effective
communication on matters which may affect our colleagues
and on the development and performance of the business.
This communication takes the form of Group-wide initiatives,
such as John Browett’s weekly diary (a feedback forum 
where colleagues can ask John Browett and other executives
questions directly about the business), together with local
initiatives for communicating within individual businesses,
including updates from business directors, daily store
meetings and divisional heads of business blogs.
The Group is both a customer and a supplier; the Group
seeks to ensure that the high quality, choice and service 
we demand from our suppliers is delivered to our customers. 
We take the lessons learnt from our experiences and adapt
them to make sure we deliver a great customer experience.
Ethical Sourcing
Our focus on the need to supply products from businesses
that meet the requirements of our Ethical Sourcing policy
remains strong. In order to ensure compliance with our policy,
we audit all new factories and reassess existing factories on 
a two to three year cycle. Additionally, our sourcing team will
carry out random spot checks on suppliers to ensure ongoing
compliance. Ethical Sourcing forms part of the curriculum
within our online buyer training tool, which was introduced
during the period under review.
Marketplace
Customer satisfaction
Customers are at the heart of everything we do and this 
year we have agreed a new CR KPI, relating to customer
satisfaction. Our performance in this area is measured 
across a number of interfaces, including our stores, service,
after-sales, internet and technical support departments.
We have based our assessment of the level of customer
satisfaction on research from customer feedback from
mystery shopping activities based around our FIVES 
training programme. Most recently, we have been carrying 
out customer exit surveys, to measure customer satisfaction
with stores, service, pricing and range. Our primary aim 
under the Renewal and Transformation plan is to focus on 
the customer and to deliver an unbeatable combination of
value, choice and service. Monitoring customer satisfaction 
is not just about ensuring that the customer receives excellent
service, but also drives the range and merchandising available
to customers, the layout of the store and the quality of goods
available. The programme is designed to focus the store on
delivering a great ‘shopping trip experience’. FIVES training 
is designed to empower colleagues to deliver great service; 
it encourages our colleagues and gives them confidence
when dealing with the customer.
Where stores are not delivering high customer satisfaction
scores, members of the Retail Academy team can assist in
ensuring FIVES training has been implemented appropriately.
Performance, and as a consequence customer satisfaction,
typically increases. All our store managers are measured and
rewarded on delivery of excellence in customer service – it is 
a key measure of the business.
The current performance information relating to customer
satisfaction has been collated since the beginning of 2009
and comparative data is not available. The Committee will
monitor this KPI and would aim to provide data externally 
over time.

Corporate Responsibility Review continued
We seek to minimise the environmental impact and carbon
footprint associated with our operations and stores. To do 
this we look at initiatives to improve our energy and transport
efficiency and by focusing on reducing both our, and our
customers’, waste.
During the past year we have seen a considerable amount 
of preparation taking place for forthcoming legislation due 
to come into effect in the short to mid term. For example, 
the Regulation, Evaluation & Authorisation of Chemical
Substances (REACH) Directive is being phased in over a 
three year period from June 2008 to implement new controls
regarding the use of chemical substances. We have been in
touch with all of our suppliers regarding the implementation
and their compliance with the regulations. This approach is
enabling us to identify knowledge gaps in the supply chain 
and also helping us to understand any downstream implications
of the changes that need to be made.
There are a number of projects under way relating to 
the energy consumption of electrical products. We have 
been actively contributing to the debate in this area, with 
the aim of thoroughly understanding the requirements and
their associated implementation time lines but also with an
ambition to influence the outcome. We are keen to ensure that
legislators understand the market and its supply chain and
also, of course, the consumer as regulations are implemented.
Additionally, during the year, the CR Committee signed up 
to the British Retail Consortium initiative ‘A Better Retailing
Climate’. This initiative has five stated aims which the CR
Committee has agreed to implement across the UK & Ireland
and then the wider Group.
These aims are:
1. Reducing the direct environmental impact of our business.
2. Managing our climate risks.
3. Helping our customers, staff and suppliers to reduce their
environmental impacts and vulnerabilities.
Environment
4. Engaging in the public policy debate and support the
Government in meeting its climate change goals.
5. Reporting our achievements transparently and consistently.
Full details of the initiative can be found on the BRC website
at www.brc.org.uk
Waste recycled
The Group is committed to reducing the impact of packaging
waste associated with its products. This ambition includes
minimising packaging and also increasing the volume of
materials recycled through its activities.
In response to the introduction of the Waste Electrical 
and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE), the Group also
continues to offer various routes for the collection of end of 
life electrical goods. We continue to offer the UK’s first and
only free in-store and home collection recycling service as 
part of our standard customer service. This scheme is run
within our existing carbon footprint and has proved to be
popular with our customers.
This service is the subject of ongoing communication with
store colleagues and continuing education of customers,
through refreshing our point of sale materials on this service
across the UK.
During the year the CR Committee agreed to set a new KPI 
to monitor the amount of business waste recycled throughout
the Group. Reporting has commenced in this area and the CR
Committee will be reviewing performance in the year ahead.
Group carbon emissions
The Group is also taking action to reduce its carbon footprint,
in particular, relating to the carbon emissions derived from 
our buildings and fleet. The reduction in carbon emissions
from our business has the benefit of both driving down 
costs as well as reducing the environmental impact. The CR
Committee has also agreed KPIs in this area which it monitors
on a regular basis.
Throughout the period under review, the Group’s Property 
team have looked at ways of reducing the costs incurred to
the Group through the operation of our buildings. This has also

carbon emissions from buildings has only been collated since
the beginning of 2009 and comparative data is not available.
The CR Committee will monitor this KPI during the coming
year and would aim to provide data externally over time.
The Group has an ongoing programme to look at ways of
reducing the environmental impact, and associated cost, of
the UK fleet which includes continual monitoring and review 
of fuel efficiency levels. In driving efficiencies in this area, the
UK team has reduced the carbon emissions year on year and
will continue to review this element proactively going forward.
The end of this financial year sees the conclusion of the three
year Switched on Communities campaign working in partnership
with AbilityNet, Eco-Schools, the e-Learning Foundation 
and Foyer Federation. The campaign to increase access to
technology and training has been a great success and also 
a great shared learning experience for all those involved.
Over 18,000 individuals have benefited from the Switched 
on Communities partnership with AbilityNet this year. These
individuals have benefited in a variety of ways, for example,
from using an online assessment tool, one-to-one assessments
on how to ensure their IT equipment best meets their needs 
or using factsheets available on frequently raised issues.
Bitterne Manor Primary School, situated in a diverse community
in Southampton, was awarded a grant via the e-Learning
Foundation’s link with the Switched on Communities campaign.
The school wanted to get all its pupils up to the same level 
in terms of ICT skills, but realised there were dramatic
differences in home access amongst families. Bitterne Manor
has had support from its local PC World Store and, through
the project, pupils at Bitterne Manor have been provided 
with a learning package (for example, a laptop with a range 
of educational software) to use both at home and school. 
Community
All pupils have access to and are using shared online
resources, email and, in some cases, live communications.
Following the launch of the project the local authority also
decided to support Bitterne Manor as a ‘pathfinder’ school 
to encourage others to follow suit.
In the coming year we are planning to continue our focus 
on community activities that bring real benefit to local
communities through the use of technology.
Contributions to the community
Our level of charitable giving, as reported below, includes
significant donations to our partner charities from the DSGi
Foundation (the Foundation), as well as store and employee
grants and charity badge sales.
During the period, the Company made a donation of
£200,000 to the Foundation for charitable activities. The
figures shown in the table below for contributions to the
community include donations made by the Foundation and
include charitable donations made by employees, the sale 
of charitable products in our stores and other fundraising
activities carried out by our colleagues.
Looking ahead to 2009/10, the business plans to continue
along the Switched on Communities theme, encouraging
stores to engage locally with charitable organisations that
share our ambition to improve access to technology.
Information and guidelines for colleagues will be made
available through our intranets.
This reporting period has seen a full scale review of our CR
activities, and we feel confident that we have agreed and
embarked upon an appropriate path, considering the current
tough financial climate and issues important to the business.

Group Overview
The long term objectives of the Group are described in the
Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 10 to 13.
The European market for electrical goods and related services
sold by the Group is estimated to be in excess of £130 billion
per annum. It is highly competitive and is characterised by a
relatively small number of global manufacturers supplying
goods to local, regional and national and international
electrical retailers.
Specialist electrical retailers are the predominant destination for
customers. Buying groups, general merchants and independents
also have a retail presence in most European markets.
The internet delivers enhanced product information and facilitates
price comparability for consumers. Whilst this creates new
challenges in terms of margin maintenance, it also provides 
a significant opportunity. The Group believes that over time
internet demand will polarise towards the larger retailers with
scaleable distribution and systems, together with proven after-
sales service and support.
DSGi is a specialist electrical and computing retailer which
sells consumer electronics, personal computers, domestic
appliances, photographic equipment and communication
products. It is a multi-channel retailer, selling products in
stores, over the internet and by phone and provides product
support services to its customers. It also undertakes business
to business (B2B) sales and services.
The Group is organised into four divisions: UK & Ireland,
Nordics, Other International and e-commerce. Each division
offers a full range of the Group’s products and services.
The activities of each division are described as follows:
■ the UK & Ireland division comprises UK & Ireland
Electricals and UK Computing. Both UK & Ireland Electricals
and UK Computing engage in multi-channel retail sales 
and provide product support services to their customers. 
In addition, UK Computing also engages in B2B sales 
of computer hardware, software and services;
■ the Nordics division, which operates primarily in Norway,
Sweden, Finland and Denmark, engages in multi-channel
retail sales and provides related product support services 
to its customers. It also engages in B2B sales of computer
hardware, software and services and has franchise
operations across the Nordic region;
■ the Other International division comprises operations in
Southern Europe (Italy, Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Turkey)
and Central Europe (the Czech Republic, Poland and
Slovakia). The Other International division engages in retail
sales (including multi-channel sales in some countries) and
provides related product support services to its customers.
It also engages in B2B sales of computer hardware,
software and services in Italy, Spain and Greece and has
franchise operations in Italy, Greece and Cyprus; and
Principal activities
The market in which the Group operates
■ the e-commerce division is engaged in pure-play internet
retail sales, primarily through the PIXmania brand which
operates in 26 countries across Europe and the Dixons.co.uk
brand in the UK.
Products
The principal products sold by the Group are categorised 
as brown goods, white goods, computing products and
mobile phones.
Brown goods include: vision products, such as televisions 
and DVD players; audio products, such as stereos and MP3
players; imaging products, such as cameras and camcorders;
gaming products, such as games consoles and related
essentials and accessories.
White goods include: major domestic appliances such as
washing machines and dryers, refrigerators, freezers as well
as gas and electric cookers; and small domestic appliances
such as microwave ovens, vacuum cleaners, kettles, coffee
makers, toasters, irons and breadmakers.
Computing products include desktop computers, laptop
computers, netbooks, printers and a wide range of related
essentials and accessories.
Mobile phones include prepaid and contract mobile phones,
mobile broadband modems and related accessories.
Brown goods, computing products and mobile phones are
generally characterised by rapid technological advances that
offer major improvements in quality, functionality, interactivity
and design. White goods tend to benefit from innovation,
fashion and improved design and are typically heavily
dependent on the replacement cycle in most markets.
In addition to selling third party branded products, the 
Group sells a number of own-branded products such 
as Advent in computing.
Services
The Group offers a broad range of product support services.
The most important of these, which represent a substantial
proportion of the revenue from support services provided by
the Group, are customer support agreements for repairs and
protection against breakage, fault and accidental damage,
and after-sales support for products bought from the Group.
In addition, the Group provides a range of technical support,
repair, installation and other services, predominantly in relation
to computing products. The Group also offers a range of
home delivery and installation services for its products,
including deliveries within specified time frames, collection 
of customers’ old appliances, gas appliance installation and
television installation and set-up. In the UK these services 
are provided through a network of customer service centres;
The TechGuys clinics in PC World stores; laptop and TV repair
centres; and a dedicated The TechGuys telephone support
team. The Group also has arrangements with a number of
third parties for the repair of products purchased at DSGi
stores, particularly white goods.

The successful delivery of the Group’s strategic objective is monitored by the Board through KPIs and the periodic review of
Group operations.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Financial and operational Definition
Total sales Growth in total sales
Like for like sales The ability to grow sales in stores in the Group is an important measure of a brand’s appeal to
customers and its competitive position. The Board measures like for like sales as sales in stores that
have been open for a full financial year both at the commencement and end of the financial period.
Customer support agreement sales are excluded from all UK like for like calculations to remove the
distorting effect of the introduction of pay-as-you-go agreements.
Sales targets and growth are set relative to the market and expected economic conditions.
Market position In line with the Group’s strategy to be the leading specialist electrical retailer in Europe, this is an
important measure of how well customers are being engaged by the Group’s brands in each market.
Retailing operations should be, or be capable of becoming, the number one or number two specialist
electrical retailer in that market, measured by market share.
Underlying operating profit Continued growth of underlying operating profit enables the Group to invest in its future and provide 
a return for shareholders. Targets are set relative to expected market performance.
Underlying profit before tax Continued growth of underlying profit before tax represents a measure of total Group performance 
to external investors and shareholders. Targets are set relative to expected market performance.
Free Cash Flow The Group defines Free Cash Flow as net cash generated from operations, plus net finance income,
less taxation and net capital expenditure and excluding certain discrete items such as special pension
contributions. The management of cash usage, in particular, working capital employed in the business,
optimises resources available for the Group to invest in its future growth and to generate shareholder value.
Shareholder Definition
Underlying diluted The level of growth in underlying diluted earnings per share (EPS) provides a suitable measure of 
earnings per share the overall financial health of the Group and its ability to deliver returns to shareholders each year. 
The Group targets growth in EPS at fixed increments over the annual Retail Prices Index (RPI).
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) This metric provides a relative performance measure over the longer term of the Group’s ability to deliver
returns for shareholders. The Group seeks to outperform the FTSE 350 index over a three year period. 
Corporate Responsibility KPIs
We have reviewed during the year the KPIs which the Group
monitors in the Corporate Responsibility (CR) area and the CR
Committee has agreed to monitor the following KPIs on an ongoing
basis, initially concentrating on monitoring in the Group’s biggest
business in the UK and via the Group’s central buying function. 
The plan would be to extend monitoring of the KPIs to the other
Group businesses over time, these are:
1. Staff diversity – age, gender and ethnicity of employees
2. Health and safety – employee accidents and injuries
3. Performance on ethical supply chain audits
4. Customer satisfaction
5. Waste electrical equipment collected and recycled 
from customers
6. Business waste recycled
7. Group carbon emissions
8. Contributions to the community
Details are set out in the Corporate Responsibility Review 
on pages 28 to 33.
KPIs are monitored by the CR Committee on behalf of the Board
and the Board considers Corporate Responsibility issues on an
annual basis. The CR Committee assists the Board in identifying
risks to achieving the Group’s objectives and mitigating action. Directors’ Report: Strategic Summary
Risks to achieving the Group’ s objectives
The Corporate Governance Report on pages 45 to 48
describes the processes through which the directors assess,
manage and mitigate risk. The Board reviews regularly the
risks faced by the Group. The directors consider that the
major risks to achieving the Group’s objectives are those 
set out below. The Board recognises that the profile of risks
changes constantly and additional risks not presently known,
or that are currently deemed immaterial, may also impact on
attainment of the Group’s business objectives.
(i) Macroeconomic factors
Economic environment
The Group’s operating and financial performance is influenced
by the economic conditions in each of the countries in which 
it operates. The economic environment impacts on consumer
spending on electrical and computing goods in many ways.
Consumer confidence is an important influence on spending
on electrical and computing goods, which is largely discretionary.
Unemployment levels, interest rates, consumer debt levels,
availability of credit, costs of food, fuel and energy, taxation
and many other factors influence consumer confidence and
customer spending decisions. In addition, house moves and
home improvements, which are influenced by the economic
environment, impact on consumer spending on domestic
appliances.
The Group recognises that the current difficult economic
climate may affect individual countries and regions, which 
has resulted in a general reduction in consumer confidence
and spending. Management therefore monitors economic
metrics and works closely with suppliers to adjust forecasts 
of demand. Stock orders are realigned and, where possible,
selling capacity and support services are flexed in response 
to changing expectations.
Meeting customers’ needs
What differentiates specialist electrical retailers is the wide
range of products stocked and the provision of services 
that customers want, in a convenient location with staff 
that provide excellent service at competitive prices. Giving
outstanding service is a key ingredient of the Group’s 
Renewal and Transformation plan.
Regular surveys of customer satisfaction are conducted
across all stores. The results are used to assess store
performance and to drive high standards across each chain.
Customer feedback is used to shape our ranges and to
understand where the Group can be more responsive to
customers’ needs.
Seasonality
The Group’s business is highly seasonal, with a substantial
proportion of its revenue and operating profit generated 
during its third financial quarter, which includes the Christmas
and New Year season. In addition, in Southern Europe, hot
summer periods encourage sales of air conditioning units 
and, accordingly, this forms a second peak period of trading.
Any factors negatively affecting the Group during, in 
particular, the third financial quarter of any year (including
adverse weather, product sourcing issues, incorrect stock
forecasting or unfavourable economic conditions) could 
have a disproportionately adverse effect on the Group’s
financial performance or results of operations for the year.
Competition
The Group operates in a highly competitive environment.
There are few barriers to new entrants to markets for the 
sale of electrical goods. Businesses therefore join and leave
the market and / or expand or reduce their product ranges in
response to competitive forces. Different channels to market
have different cost structures and different appeal to customers.
The Group continuously monitors the activities of its competitors
and potential competitors in each of its markets and takes
appropriate action in terms of, for example, its product and
service offering and pricing to maintain and strengthen its
position. The Group actively manages its brands through
advertising, promotions and enhancing the retail experience
with the goal of ensuring the Group’s stores are seen as the
primary destination for electrical goods.
Market margin pressure
The level of margins in electrical retailing is governed by 
a combination of the market and buying prices. Consumer
demand, manufacturer supply, competition from store 
and internet channels, regulation and taxation all impact 
on margins. The Group is focused on protecting margins
through maximising its international buying scale, maintaining
an efficient supply chain and placing continued emphasis 
on strong selling skills. The Group actively manages its cost
structures to mitigate the impact of product margin erosion.
Price deflation
Price deflation has been a common feature across most
electrical goods categories for a number of years, primarily
driven by improving efficiencies in production throughout 
the life cycle of a product. The Group works closely with its
suppliers to bring products to the mass market to meet the
increased sales volume driven by price deflation. Where the
effect of price deflation is not countered by an increase in
sales volumes, the importance of strong cost and expense
management, as well as stock management, in maintaining 
or growing money margins, is increased.
(ii) Store portfolio
Quality and location of store portfolio
The quality and location of the Group’s store portfolio is 
a key contributor to the Group’s performance and growth
strategy. The Group principally operates from large out of
town stores in convenient locations that are accessible to
substantial numbers of customers. The Group continually
reviews its store portfolio in both the UK and overseas 
and its business is dependent on identifying and securing
favourable new sites, reformatting existing stores at an
acceptable return on investment and assigning, sub-leasing 
or terminating lease obligations at an acceptable cost where 
it no longer wishes to operate.
The Group will continue to actively manage its store portfolio
to optimise the location, size and costs of each of its stores. 
In areas where the population catchment is lower, franchising
36 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 of the Group’s brands offers the potential for market growth.
The Group has franchised brands in Norway (Elkjøp), Italy
(UniEuro), Sweden (El Giganten), Greece (Kotsovolos), 
Cyprus (Kotsovolos), Finland (Gigantti), Iceland (Elko),
Greenland (Pisiffik) and the Faroe Islands (El Ding).
(iii) Employees
The Group is dependent on its senior management to 
operate its business and execute its strategies. It has a
decentralised management structure with many high-level
management responsibilities devolved to regional or country
management. The Group has a strong reputation for developing
retail leaders with entrepreneurial spirit. All retailers also 
face the challenge to attract, develop and retain the right
calibre of staff for their business. Through the Group’s retail
reputation, development and incentive programmes and 
the career opportunities afforded by its size and diversity 
of operations, the Board believes that the Group is well 
placed to build on its success. A review of the long term
incentive arrangements used to retain employees has been
carried out by the Remuneration Committee and is discussed
on pages 53 to 55.
(iv) Supply of product and product life cycles
Responding to changing technology or consumer
preferences
The Group’s success largely depends on its ability to
anticipate and introduce new products, services and
technologies to consumers, as well as on the frequency 
of such introductions, the level of consumer acceptance 
of new products, and the related impact on the demand for
existing products, services and technologies. Some electrical
and computing products sold by the Group are subject to
rapid technological change, which shortens their life cycle 
and may negatively impact sales of existing stock by the
Group as consumers may elect to purchase newer products
or defer their decision to purchase once technological
changes have been announced.
As new technologies become more widely recognised 
and valued by consumers and sales volumes and availability
increase, these types of products have historically tended 
to suffer a level of price deflation. Careful management is
required by the Group to avoid a decrease in the value of its
inventory and the risk of stock obsolescence when products
are superseded by those that have newer or more popular
technology or design, which could lead to a write-off or 
write-down of stock.
Responding to changes in the credit insurance market
It is important for the Group to be able to source the electrical
and computing goods it requires from its suppliers. Suppliers
in the electrical goods and computing products market 
have traditionally taken out credit insurance to protect their
receivables against the risk of bad debt. However, as a result
of the current economic downturn, many credit insurers have
reduced or withdrawn the availability of insurance to electrical
and computing product suppliers, which may impact on the
Group’s working capital. The management team engages in
discussions with its suppliers and, in some cases, the credit
insurers to those suppliers. The Placing and Rights Issue 
and refinancing announced on 30 April 2009 has provided 
the Group with a stronger financial base to provide comfort 
to the Group’s suppliers and their credit insurers with regard 
to the Group’s working capital position.
(v) Entering new markets
The Group enters new markets by introducing new types 
of business in the countries where it already operates (for
example, the development of its product support services
business, The TechGuys, in the UK) and by launching 
its existing businesses in new countries (such as Turkey).
Expansion can be through acquisition or the establishment 
of new businesses. As with store openings, the entry into 
new markets results in increased revenue, but also results 
in upfront or start-up costs to the Group.
The Group has utilised its considerable experience of
developing new retail chains through both start-ups and
acquisitions. Start-ups usually commence with a small
number of stores, which involves relatively smaller upfront
costs, with a larger roll-out if the start-up proves successful
(such as Electro World in Turkey).
The Group’s growth through acquisition has been either in
stages (such as the acquisition of Kotsovolos in Greece) or as
outright purchases in a single stage (such as the acquisition of
the Elkjøp Group).
(vi) Treasury risks and policies
Treasury operations are managed centrally within 
policies approved by the Board and are subject to 
periodic independent internal and external reviews. Group
Treasury reports regularly to the Audit Committee and the 
Tax & Treasury Committee. The major treasury risks to which
the Group is exposed relate to market risks (movements in
foreign exchange and interest rates), liquidity risk and credit
risk. Areas where risks are most likely to occur are evaluated
regularly. The Group uses financial instruments and derivatives
to manage these risks in accordance with defined policies.
Throughout the period under review, in accordance with
Group policy, no speculative use of derivatives, foreign
exchange or other instruments was permitted.
The Group’s accounting policies in relation to derivatives 
are set out in note 1.16 to the financial statements.
Exchange rate risk
The Group is exposed to exchange movements on recognised
assets and liabilities, overseas earnings and translated values
of foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Group’s principal
translation currency exposures are the euro and Norwegian
krone. Taking into account the cost of hedging, the Group’s
policy is to match, in whole or in part, currency earnings with
related currency costs and currency assets with currency
liabilities through the use of appropriate hedging instruments.
The Group is also exposed to certain transactional currency
exposures. Such exposures arise from purchases in currencies
other than in the functional currency of the entity. The Group’s
principal transactional currency exposures are the US dollar
and euro. It is Group policy to minimise the currency exposures
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 37
Business Overview Performance Review Strategic Summary Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders Directors’ Report: Strategic Summary
Risks to achieving the Group’s objectives continued
on such purchases through the use of appropriate hedging
instruments such as forward exchange contracts. Such
contracts are designed to cover exposures ranging from 
one month to one year.
Interest rate risk
The principal interest rate risks of the Group arise in respect 
of sterling cash, investments and borrowings, hedged internal
Norwegian krone liabilities and euro borrowings. Potential
exposure to interest rate movements is mitigated by the
Group’s policy to match to the extent possible the profile of
interest payments with that of its interest receipts. Taking into
account the cost of hedging, further mitigation is achieved
with interest based credit commissions received and through
the use of interest based hedging instruments. Such matching
is evaluated regularly to ensure that risks are minimised.
Liquidity risk
It is Group policy to maintain a balance of funds, borrowings,
committed bank and other facilities sufficient to meet anticipated
short term and long term financial requirements. In applying
this policy the Group continuously monitors forecast and
actual cash flows against the maturity profiles of financial
assets and liabilities. Uncommitted facilities are also maintained
and used if available on advantageous terms. It is Group
treasury policy to ensure that a specific level of committed
facilities is always available based on forecast working 
capital requirements.
Cash forecasts identifying the Group’s liquidity requirements
are produced and are stress tested for different scenarios
including, but not limited to, reasonably possible decreases 
in profit margins and increases in interest rates on the Group’s
borrowing facilities and the weakening of sterling against other
functional currencies within the Group.
Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk on liquid funds, investments
(mainly bank deposits and floating rate notes) and derivative
financial instruments arises from the risk of non-performance
of counterparties, with a maximum exposure equal to the
book value of these assets. The Group limits its exposure to
credit risk through application of Group treasury policy which
restricts counterparties to those with a minimum Moody’s 
long term credit rating of Aa3, bank financial strength rating 
of C and short term credit rating of P1. In the prior period, 
the policy on investment restricted counterparties to those
with a minimum Moody’s long term credit rating of Aa3, short
term credit rating of P1 and bank financial strength rating 
of B-. The Group also has policies that limit the amount of
credit exposure to any single financial institution. The Group
continuously reviews the credit quality of counterparties, the
limits placed on individual credit exposures and categories of
investments. The Group does not anticipate non-performance
of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material
concentration of credit risk given the policies in place.
The Group’s receivable balances comprise a large number 
of individually small amounts from unrelated customers,
spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Concentration of risk is therefore limited and maximum
exposure is equal to the book value of receivables. Sales to
retail customers are made predominantly in cash or via major
credit cards. It is Group policy that all customers who wish to
trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
New credit customers are assessed using an external rating
report which is used to establish a credit limit. Such limits are
reviewed periodically on both a proactive and reactive basis,
for example, when a customer wishes to place an order in
excess of their existing credit limit. Receivable balances are
monitored regularly with the result that the Group’s exposure
to bad debts is not significant. Management therefore believe
that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess
of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
Capital risk management
It is the Group’s policy to maintain a strong capital base so 
as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and 
to sustain the future development of the business. The Group
is subject to certain externally imposed capital requirements 
in the form of banking covenants involving borrowing ratios
which it met throughout the period.
The Board has delegated responsibility for routine capital
expenditure to a Capital Committee, which has approval
responsibility for: Group long term and budgeted capital
spend, setting capital assessment criteria, new store 
capital approval, subsidiary company funding, business
acquisitions, business disposals and contingent liabilities 
such as guarantees. The Committee also approves routine
statutory and internal delegated powers of authority in relation
to capital expenditure.
The Group considers the manner in which funds are
distributed to shareholders by assessing the performance of
the business, the level of available net funds and the short to
medium term strategic plans concerning future capital spend
as well as the need to meet banking covenants and borrowing
ratios. Such assessment will influence the level of dividends
payable as well as consideration from time to time of market
purchases of the Group’s own shares.
The Group monitors available net funds on a regular basis 
and this is affected by Free Cash Flow, one of the Group’s 
key performance indicators (see page 35).
(vii) Pension risk and policies
The principal pension scheme operated by the Group is 
the UK defined benefit scheme.
This scheme is subject to risks regarding the relative amount
of the scheme’s assets, which is affected by the value of
investments held by the scheme and the returns derived 
from such investments, as compared to its liabilities, which 
are affected by changes in life expectancy, inflation and future
salary increases. In the short term, the difference between the
value of liabilities and assets may vary significantly, potentially
resulting in an increased deficit having to be recognised on 
the Group’s balance sheet. In the current overall volatile market
environment, there is an increased risk that large deficits may
arise on the Group’s pension schemes and that overall deficits of
the UK defined benefit scheme in particular may increase further.
38 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 In recent years, the pension trustee, in consultation with 
the Company, has implemented changes to the scheme’s
investment strategy to mitigate the volatility of liabilities and 
to diversify investment risk.
(viii) Systems failure
In common with other large businesses, the Group relies
heavily on its information technology systems to enable its
customers to purchase products in store, online and over 
the phone as well as record and process transactions and
manage its operations. These systems provide information
regarding most aspects of financial and operational
performance, including sales and stock information and, 
given the number of transactions that are completed and 
the importance of the efficient management of stock, it 
is vital to maintain continuous operation of the computer
hardware and software systems. Notwithstanding efforts 
to prevent an information technology failure or disruption, 
the Group’s systems may be vulnerable to damage or
interruption from fire, telecommunications failures, floods,
physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, power
outages and other malfunctions or disruptions.
The Group has developed emergency procedures that are
regularly tested. The Group carries out evaluation, planning
and implementation analysis before updating or introducing
new systems that have an impact on critical functions.
(ix) Outsourcing / insourcing
The Group outsources a proportion of its UK call handling, 
IT and HR services including payroll. While these contracts
produce significant cost savings, the Group recognises 
the increased dependency on third parties, in particular the
relationships with its IT partner, HCL, and its payroll provider,
Northgate, to deliver core activities and has put in place
appropriate service level agreements within the contracts. 
The Group is bringing the operations of its outsourced call
centres in Nottingham and Sheffield in-house on 10 July 2009. 
The Group recognises the risk of failing to properly integrate
these services back into the operations and is managing this
process closely.
(x) Damage to property and consequential business
interruption
The Group operates from a large number of sites, all of 
which are subject to the risks of fire, weather and water
damage and in some cases are subject to earthquake and
other specific risks. The Group also operates from a small
number of distribution and administrative sites, all of which 
are subject to the risks of fire, weather and water damage
and, in some cases, earthquakes. The Group’s ability to
distribute merchandise to its stores and to sell and distribute
merchandise to its customers is reliant on its operational
infrastructure, particularly the efficient functioning of its
distribution centres and distribution network. Failures or
unavailability of such infrastructure (caused, for example, 
by fire, structural damage, natural disaster, industrial action 
or terrorist activity) could result in disruptions to the Group’s
ability to deliver products to its stores or its customers.
The Group regularly reviews and assesses these risks, takes
action to mitigate the likelihood and cost of potential incidents
and has insurance in place to cover material exposures.
Business continuity plans are in place to respond to major
disruption to the business.
(xi) Legislative, reputational and regulatory risks
The Group is subject to a range of legal and regulatory
requirements originating from the UK and the European 
Union, particularly in the areas of consumer protection,
product safety, competition, extended warranties, health 
and safety, taxation, the environment, labour and employment
practices and transportation.
Compliance with these laws and regulations may result in
significant costs for the Group and changes in such laws 
and regulations or the policies regarding enforcement may
have an adverse impact on the Group in terms of cost,
changes to business practices or restrictions on activities. 
In addition, legal, regulatory and other developments affecting
the countries in which the Group operates may have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business. The Group engages
with governmental bodies in the UK and Europe through trade
associations such as the CBI and British Retail Consortium, 
or directly, where it considers it appropriate to do so.
Tax laws that apply to the Group’s businesses may be
amended by the relevant authorities, for example, as a result
of changes in fiscal circumstances or priorities. Such potential
amendments and their application to the Group are regularly
monitored and, if relevant, appropriate actions taken to ensure
ongoing efficiency.
Social, environmental and ethical risks that might impact on
the Group’s reputation are annually monitored by the Board.
(xii) Customers’ confidential information
The Group must comply with restrictions on the use of
customer data and ensure that confidential information
(including financial and personal data) is transmitted in a
secure manner over public networks. Controls have been put
in place to ensure the confidentiality, availability and integrity of
customer and company data. They are under constant review
to ensure we prevent a successful attack from computer
programmes that attempt to penetrate the network security
and misappropriate confidential information. However, due to
advances in these programmes, computing capabilities and
other developments, there is no guarantee that the Group’s
security measures will be sufficient to prevent breaches.

Statutory Information
Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital and changes to the
issued share capital during the period, including share options
exercised, are given in note 23(a) to the financial statements.
At the AGM on 3 September 2008, shareholders approved 
a resolution for the Company to make purchases of its own
shares to a maximum number of 177 million ordinary shares.
This resolution remains valid until the conclusion of this year’s
AGM. No shares were purchased by the Company following
the AGM and until the date of publication of this report.
On 30 April 2009, the Group announced its plans to raise 
an additional £310.6 million via a Placing and Rights Issue 
of shares. At the EGM on 18 May 2009, shareholders
considered three resolutions necessary to proceed with 
this equity raising and approved the resolutions; granting
authority to allot shares up to a maximum of 1,837,458,762
new ordinary shares; granting authority for the disapplication
of pre-emption rights in respect of the new shares; and
approving the placing and listing of the new shares on the
London Stock Exchange. The Company issued 333,333,333
shares via a placing at a subscription price of 30p per placing
share and a further 1,504,125,429 shares via the Rights Issue
at a subscription price of 14p following the period end. 
The first two resolutions remain valid until the conclusion 
of the next AGM on 2 September 2009.
As part of the announcement of the now completed Placing
and Rights Issue, the directors made a profit forecast (the
Profit Forecast). As required by Listing Rule 9.2.18R, this
forecast information is reproduced as follows whereby the
directors forecast that the Group’s underlying profit before 
tax would be not less than £42 million and underlying profit
before tax less losses before tax from businesses to be closed
(Markantalo and PC City Sweden) would be not less than 
£30 million. Furthermore, the directors also forecast that the
Group would have losses before tax from businesses to be
closed and net non-underlying charges of £195 million to
£215 million over the same period.
The actual figures reported in the Group’s income statement
show underlying profit before tax of £50.5 million, underlying
profit before tax less losses before tax from businesses to be
closed (Markantalo and PC City Sweden) of £36.4 million as
well as losses before tax from businesses to be closed and
net non-underlying charges before tax of £190.9 million.

The Directors’ Report is set out on pages 1 to 62. The Performance Review contained therein, which can be found on pages 
14 to 33, is based on many of the principles contained in the best practice statement ‘Reporting Statement: Operating and Financial
Review’ issued by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB). Reference to information that fulfils the business review requirements
of section 417 of the Companies Act 2006 together with other disclosures required in the Directors’ Report are set out below:
Pages 1 to 62, together with any sections of this Annual Report and Accounts which have been incorporated by reference,
comprise a directors’ report which has been drawn up and presented in accordance with and in reliance upon applicable

Substantial share interests Statutory Information 43 The actual underlying profit before tax and the underlying
profit before tax less losses before tax from businesses to 
be closed are consistent with the statement made in the 
Profit Forecast but are improved by a significant margin 
owing to the treatment of the Group’s Hungarian business
which was sold on 18 May 2009 and which has consequently
been treated as a discontinued operation such that its trading
losses before tax of £4.6 million have now been excluded 
from the measures stated in the Profit Forecast. Concerning
the losses before tax from businesses to be closed and net
non-underlying charges before tax, the figures in the Profit
Forecast included charges to impair the Group’s Hungarian
business of £16.9 million. For the same reasons as described
above, these charges before tax, together with the post-tax
losses of the business have now been disclosed separately 
as discontinued operations. Had this business not been
disposed and these impairment charges remained as part 
of net non-underlying charges before tax, the actual figures
would have been within the range stated in the Profit Forecast.
Substantial share interests
In accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules,
DTR5 we have received notification as at 25 June 2009 of the
following interests in voting rights of 3% or more in the issued
share capital of the Company:
*Includes Tameside MBC which has a holding of 3.11%.
Directors
The names of the directors in office at the date of this report,
their biographical details and other information, are shown 
on page 40. All of the directors served throughout the period,
except for John Allan and Nicholas Cadbury who were
appointed on 23 June 2009 and 17 July 2008 respectively.
Kevin O’Byrne served from the start of the period until his
resignation from the Board on 14 August 2008.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Rita Clifton 
and John Browett will retire by rotation at the AGM and, 
being eligible, will offer themselves for reappointment. Rita
Clifton was appointed a non-executive director, pursuant 
to a letter dated 1 September 2003 and her term of office 
has subsequently been extended for two additional three 
year terms. The Board is satisfied that the directors retiring 
by rotation are qualified for reappointment by virtue of their 
skills, experience and contributions to the Board.
John Allan was appointed to the Board on 23 June 2009 
and, in accordance with the Articles of Association, will retire
at the first AGM following his appointment. He has a letter 
of appointment with DSG international plc which is available
from the Company Secretary upon request. John Allan’s

appointment as Chairman designate was made after a search
led by the Senior Independent Director with the assistance of
the other non-executive directors and The Zygos Partnership,
an external search firm. The Board considers that John Allan
is a highly-regarded executive with a strong track record. He
brings to the Group a wealth of large multinational company
experience from areas including marketing, service, and
corporate management.
Count Emmanuel d’André will retire from the Board following
the AGM on 2 September 2009.
The interests of the directors in the share capital of the
Company are shown in the Remuneration Report on page 57.
No director had any beneficial interests in the shares of any
subsidiary undertaking or in any contract or arrangement
(apart from contracts of service) to which the Company or 
any subsidiary was a party during or at the end of the 
financial period.
All of the Company’s share plans contain provisions relating 
to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options
would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of
control, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions
where applicable.
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
Pursuant to Article 159 of the Memorandum and Articles 
of Association, the directors, secretary and other officers of
the Company are entitled to be indemnified by the Company
out of its own funds against liabilities arising from the conduct
of the Group’s business to the extent permitted by law. The
Group has purchased appropriate directors’ and officers’
insurance cover which in general terms indemnifies individual
directors’ and officers’ personal legal liability and costs for
claims arising out of actions taken in connection with the
Group’s business.
Conflicts of interest
The Articles of Association were amended at the 2008 
AGM with effect from 1 October 2008 to permit the Board 
to consider and, if appropriate, to authorise situations where a
director has an interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict
with the interests of the Company.
The Board has a formal system in place for directors to
declare conflicts to be considered for authorisation by those
directors who have no interest in the matter being considered.
In deciding whether to authorise a conflict and potential
conflict those directors deciding the matter are requested to
act in the way they consider would be most likely to promote
the success of the Company and may impose limits and
conditions when giving authorisation.
The Board has delegated responsibility to the Audit
Committee to review on an annual basis the conflicts
previously authorised by the Board and to consider whether
any authority provided should remain in place, whether any
terms and conditions should be imposed or amended and
whether such authority should be revoked and to make 
such recommendations to the Board accordingly.

Business Overview Performance Review Strategic Summary Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Statutory Information continued
Corporate activity
On 29 December 2008, following the exercise of a put 
option held by Fourlis Holdings SA, the main minority
shareholder of DSGi South-East Europe A.E.V.E. (formerly 
P . Kotsovolos S.A. (Kotsovolos)), the Group acquired a 
further 10% stake in Kotsovolos for cash consideration 
of €28.1 million (£27.5 million). The acquisition increases 
the Group’s total interest in Kotsovolos to 99.2%.
On 19 May 2009 the Group announced the sale of 
Electro World Hungary to EW Electro Retail Ltd for a
consideration of €1. The sale saw the transfer of all nine
stores, operations and employees to EW Electro Retail Ltd.
Dividends
A final dividend of 3.43p per share in respect of the 3 May 2008
financial period was paid on 26 September 2008 to shareholders
on the register at the close of business on 15 August 2008.
Total dividends paid to shareholders on 26 September 2008 in
respect of the 3 May 2008 financial period were £60.7 million.
No dividend will be paid for the year ended 2 May 2009.
Going concern
In considering the going concern basis for preparing the
financial statements, the directors have considered the Group’s
objectives and strategy, risks to achieving its objectives
(including treasury risks) and its review of business performance
which are all set out in the Directors’ Report and Business
Review section of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Over the course of 2008/09, the current difficult consumer
and retail environment has placed significant pressure on 
the Group’s revenue, profits, cash flows and overall liquidity.
This together with the cost of restructuring the Group, higher
finance costs and pressures on working capital due to
structural changes to the credit environment, has contributed
to an increase in the Group’s indebtedness. The continued
uncertainty over the economic outlook has made it necessary
for the Group to take steps to improve the capital structure 
of the Group to sustain the business through the current
economic cycle. For these reasons, on 30 April 2009 and 
as described in note 35 to the financial statements, the 
Group announced a Placing and Rights Issue to raise gross
proceeds of £310.6 million as well as agreeing with its lending
banks to amend terms of the Revolving Credit Facility and
Letter of Credit Facility Agreements. Further details of the
Group’s liquidity and funding arrangements are described 
in notes 17 and 22(f) to the financial statements. The Placing
and Rights Issue completed on 9 June 2009 and its proceeds
have significantly improved the Group’s liquidity position since
2 May 2009. In conjunction with applying the Group’s policies
in relation to liquidity risk (as described in the section on 
risks to achieving the Group’s objectives referred to above),
the directors believe that these amendments will provide 
the Group with significant covenant and liquidity headroom
under these facilities for the foreseeable future.
After reviewing the Group’s expenditure commitments, current
financial projections and expected future cash flows, together
with the available cash resources and undrawn committed
borrowing facilities the directors have considered that
adequate resources exist for the Group to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,
the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.
Political donations
The Company made no payments (2008/09 £nil) which
constituted EU Political Expenditure. A resolution to authorise
the directors to incur EU Political Expenditure in the coming
year to an aggregate amount not exceeding £25,000 will be
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Payment of suppliers
It is the Group’s policy to agree terms of payment with its
suppliers. Payments are made in accordance with these 
terms provided that the supplier has complied with all the
relevant contractual obligations. Trade creditors at 2 May 
2009 represent 50 days of annual purchases made during 
the period (3 May 2008 51 days).
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
On 1 December 2008, Deloitte & Touche LLP changed its
name to Deloitte LLP . Deloitte LLP are willing to continue 
in office as auditors to the Company. Resolutions for their
reappointment and to authorise the directors to agree their
remuneration will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the
Companies Act 2006, each of the directors at the date 
of approval of this report confirms that to their knowledge 
and belief, and having made appropriate enquiries of other
officers of the Group:
■
so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
■ they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken
as a director to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s
auditors are aware of that information.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held on 2 September 2009 at the Watford
Colosseum, Rickmansworth Road, Watford WD17 3EX at
10.30am. Notice of the meeting, together with full details 
and an explanation of the business to be considered, is 
given in a separate letter accompanying this report.

44 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report
The Board recognises the importance of good corporate
governance and maintains high standards of corporate
governance for which the directors are collectively accountable
to shareholders. Sound governance is central to achieving the
directors’ prime objective of maximising shareholder value and
comprises, principally, the processes by which the Group is
directed and managed, risks are identified and controlled and
effective accountability is assured.
The directors consider that the Company has throughout the
period complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of 
the Combined Code.
Combined Code
The following statement, together with the Remuneration
Report on pages 51 to 61, the Audit Committee Report on
page 49 and the Nominations Committee Report on page 50,
explains how the Group has throughout the period applied 
the principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting
Council in June 2006 (the Combined Code).
Board of Directors
As at the date of this report, the Board comprises a 
non-executive Chairman, the Chairman designate, who 
is considered to be independent upon appointment, four 
non-executive directors considered by the Board to be
independent and two executive directors. Andrew Lynch
fulfilled the role of the Senior Independent Director 
throughout the year.
The Chairman announced at the 2008 AGM his plan to 
retire as Chairman and from the Board at the 2009 AGM. 
The Senior Independent Director led the search for an
additional director to assume the position of Chairman 
having considered the current Chairman’s performance with
the other non-executive directors and having established 
an appropriate role description. This process culminated 
in the appointment of John Allan as a director. John Allan 
will assume the role of Chairman after the 2009 AGM.
The Chairman ensures that the Board has full and timely
access to all relevant information and holds occasional
meetings with the non-executive directors without the
executive directors being present to discuss, amongst 
other matters, corporate strategy and performance. 
There is frequent contact between directors outside 
formal meetings to progress the Group’s business and 
to promote open communication and team working.
The Articles of Association require one third of the Board not
otherwise subject to reappointment by shareholders to retire
by rotation each year and ensure that over a three year period
each director is subject to reappointment by shareholders in
general meeting. Details of the directors retiring by rotation at
the AGM on 2 September 2009 are set out in the Statutory
Information on page 43, with detailed biographies of the
Board members shown on page 40.
The schedule of matters reserved for the Board includes:
■ approval of the interim statement and annual report and
accounts (including the review of critical accounting policies
and accounting judgements and an assessment of the
Company’s position and prospects);
■ approval of the interim and final dividends;
■ the appointment and remuneration of the external auditors;
■ communication with shareholders, including approval of all
circulars, prospectuses and major public announcements;
■ changes relating to the Company’s capital structure and 
the Memorandum and Articles of Association;
■ the appointment, removal and remuneration of directors 
and the Company Secretary;
■ the terms of reference of Board committees, the Chairman
and the executive directors;
■ approval of the Group’s strategy and annual budget;
■ review of Group performance;
■ maintaining and monitoring the Group’s system of internal
control and risk management;
■ approval of major capital expenditure or disposals, material
contracts, material acquisitions and divestments; and
■ changes to retirement benefits schemes, employee share
plans and long term incentive programmes.
The Board, with the assistance of the Nominations Committee,
conducted an annual assessment of the Board, committees
and individual director performance between April and July 2008
and reviewed the performance of the non-executive directors,
the Board and its committees again later in the year. During
both of these reviews, the Board concluded that the balance
of skills and experience of the Board and its committees 
was appropriate for the requirements of the Group. However,
it was decided that to facilitate succession planning the Board
should undertake a search for an additional non-executive
director in addition to the Chairman designate. The new
Chairman plans to evaluate the performance of the executive
directors in early 2010 once he has had an opportunity to
work with the Board for a period of time.
A corporate governance framework has been approved by the
Board defining the role and responsibilities of the constituent
elements of the Group’s management structure. This enables
the Board to plan, execute, control and monitor the Group’s
activities so as to achieve its strategic objectives.
All directors have access to the services of the Company
Secretary and may take independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense in the furtherance of their duties.
On appointment, each director receives a tailored induction

programme into the Group together with guidance and
training appropriate to their level of previous experience. 
Non-executive directors are encouraged to meet members 
of senior management regularly, to undertake visits to all 
parts of the Group, particularly developing businesses, 
and to attend external seminars on corporate governance
matters. All directors are kept informed of changes in relevant
legislation and changes in commercial and financial risks.
The Board met 14 times during the period including eight
scheduled meetings and six ad hoc meetings convened to
deal with the Placing and Rights Issue announced on 30 April
2009 and other procedural matters.
*Appointed 17 July 2008.
Due to the ad hoc meetings being called at short notice, 
not all the directors were available to attend meetings due 
to other commitments.
The Board’s normal practice has been to hold meetings both in
the UK and in Europe, enabling, in particular, the non-executive
directors to gain first hand experience of markets in which the
Group operates and giving local management direct access 
to members of the Board. During the 2008/09 financial year all
meetings have been held in the UK. It is planned for 2009/10
to return to the Board’s normal practice of holding a number
of meetings at overseas business locations. There were
meetings of the non-executive directors during the period
without the executive directors being present and meetings
between the Senior Independent Director and the other 
non-executive directors without the Chairman being present.
Board committees
The Board has established a number of committees to which
it has delegated specific responsibilities. The trading divisions
are managed by separate executive committees. Separate
reports from the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration
Committees, including details of membership and terms 
of reference, are set out on pages 49 to 61.
The Group has also established an Executive Committee and
a Chairman’s Committee. Membership of the Committees is
detailed below. Further information relating to the Executive
Committee members can be found on page 41.

All Board committees operate within written terms of reference
approved by the Board, which are available on request from
the Company Secretary. The Board receives and reviews
minutes of their meetings and those of the Executive and
Chairman’s Committees. The Company Secretary is the
secretary to the Chairman’s and Executive Committees.
The Executive Committee is responsible for the implementation
of strategy and the day to day management of the Group’s
business. Individuals from the Committee attend Board
meetings at the request of the Chairman to report on areas
within their executive responsibilities.
The Chairman’s Committee is a forum for the Chairman to
monitor and review the development and implementation of
strategy and business / market developments and to report
appropriately to the Board.
Relations with shareholders and other stakeholders
The Board attaches considerable importance to the
maintenance of constructive relationships with shareholders
and its other stakeholders. Relationships with suppliers,
employees and the community are further discussed in the
Corporate Responsibility Review on pages 28 to 33. Effective
two way communication with institutional investors and
analysts is established through regular presentations and
meetings in the UK and overseas, usually by the Chief
Executive, Group Finance Director and Group
Communications Director.
The Chairman holds occasional meetings with major
shareholders to discuss matters of mutual interest including
corporate strategy and governance. Where appropriate, the
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee communicates
with major shareholders to canvas opinion when deciding
remuneration policy. Matters arising from these presentations
and meetings are communicated to the Board. Presentations
are conducted in accordance with the Financial Services

46 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 Authority’s Disclosure Rules on the dissemination of inside
information to ensure the protection of such information 
that has not already been made available generally to the
Company’s shareholders. The Board receives and reviews 
an investor relations report at each of its meetings. The Senior
Independent Director is available to discuss with shareholders
any major issues that cannot be resolved through normal
channels. Non-executive directors are offered the opportunity
to attend meetings with major shareholders.
The AGM provides an opportunity to communicate directly
with shareholders. The chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration
and Nominations Committees are available at the meeting 
to answer questions from shareholders. Notice of the AGM
and related documents are mailed to shareholders at least 
20 working days before the meeting. Separate resolutions 
are proposed on each substantially different issue. The notice
is contained in an accompanying letter.
In addition to the interim and annual reports, shareholders 
can obtain information about the Group from the corporate
website.
Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution and
defined benefit pension schemes. The principal scheme,
which operates in the UK, comprises a funded defined benefit
section and a defined contribution section. A corporate
trustee holds the assets of the scheme separately from those
of the Group. There are six directors of the trustee company:
two have been nominated by the Group, two have been
selected from amongst the scheme membership and two are
independent directors. Asset management is delegated to a
number of independent companies whose performance is
monitored by a specialist performance measurement service.
The scheme’s accounts are audited annually by Nexia Smith 
& Williamson, who are not auditors to any Group companies.
Members of the scheme receive an annual statement of their
accrued benefits and a copy of the trustee’s annual report.
Further information about pensions is given in note 21 to the
financial statements.
Internal control
In accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull working 
party set out in ‘Internal Control: Revised Guidance for
Directors on the Combined Code’, the Group has established
and maintained a process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks faced by the Group, for
reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control
and for confirming that action has been taken to remedy any
significant failings or weaknesses that have been identified.
This process, which is reviewed periodically by the Board, 
was in place throughout the 52 weeks ended 2 May 2009 
and to the date of approval of the financial statements.
Responsibility and accountability
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of
internal control, for reviewing its effectiveness and the Group’s
approach to risk management.
The Board delegates to executive management the day to 
day responsibility for identifying, evaluating and managing the
risks facing the Group’s operations, and for implementing and
maintaining internal control systems that manage those risks
in an efficient and effective manner, appropriate to their nature
and scale.
Senior management is responsible and accountable for
internal control and risk management and for ensuring
compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures.
Inherent limitations and continuous improvement
In determining its policies on internal control, the Board has
regard to the materiality of the relevant risks, the likelihood of
losses occurring and the costs of control. The directors are
aware that the inherent limitations in any system of control
means that risk cannot be totally eliminated. It follows that 
the Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage
and mitigate, rather than remove, the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives and can only provide reasonable but not
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group’s approach to managing and monitoring internal
control and risk assessment is reviewed regularly to identify
ways in which it can be improved and further embedded
throughout the Group’s operations. Where significant
weaknesses are identified, these are investigated fully using
appropriate internal resources and, where deemed necessary,
engaging external expertise. Detailed plans are drawn to
remedy the weaknesses and progress is monitored on an
ongoing basis.
In light of the issues that have emerged in other companies
and industry sectors in the past 12 months, a review of the
Group’s approach to the management of risks is currently
underway to see if any lessons can be learned.
Control environment and control activities
In addition to the corporate governance structure described
above, the Group’s system of internal control and processes
for managing risk comprise the following main elements:
■ the Board and management committees meet regularly

Assurance and monitoring
Senior management under the direction of the Board is
responsible for maintaining the appropriate internal control
systems and for managing risk at an operational level. The
Board conducts an annual evaluation of the management of
risk and the processes of internal control and has established a
monitoring framework consisting of the functions set out below:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee seeks ongoing assurance that the
control environment and activities described above are
operating effectively and reports regularly to the Board. The
Audit Committee’s review of the effectiveness of the internal
controls is formally reported to the Board on an annual basis.
Internal audit
The Internal Audit department is fully independent of business
operations and has a Group-wide mandate. Its work is driven
by a risk-based methodology ensuring that the controls 
to mitigate the Group’s key risks are audited on a regular
basis. Its plans are approved by the Audit Committee, which
also receives regular reports on its findings and progress of
related actions. The function also works with the business to
promote and further develop effective risk management within
their operations.
External audit
The external auditors provide further independent
observations on certain elements of the internal financial
controls as part of their audit of the financial statements 
and their findings are presented to the Audit Committee.
Corporate Responsibility (CR)
The Group operates a CR Committee, which was chaired 
by the Company Secretary from 31 May 2008. During 
the period the Committee met on four occasions. The 
Group Finance Director is the Board member with specific
responsibility for social, environmental, ethical and other 
CR related matters. The CR Committee assists the Board 
in identifying reputational and other risks arising from the
conduct of the Group’s businesses. It makes recommendations
on measurement tools and audit procedures and reports on
the effectiveness of systems for managing CR related matters.

Membership and meetings
The current membership of the Committee, whose biographies
and qualifications are set out on page 40, is set out in the table
below and comprises the four independent non-executive
directors (excluding the Chairman designate). All Committee
members served throughout the period. The Committee 
was scheduled to meet four times during the period in June,
September, November and April in advance of key internal
and external reporting dates and had an additional meeting 
to facilitate the Placing and Rights Issue announced on 
30 April 2009. The Committee has a formal schedule of
matters to be considered over the course of the year which
are allocated across the four scheduled meetings. The
agendas may be supplemented by specific meetings when
required and through informal discussions with the Chairman
and other members of the Committee.
The Chairman has recent and relevant financial experience.
The Company Secretary acted as secretary to the Committee
during the period.
Representatives of the external auditors, the Group Finance
Director, the Group Financial Controller, the Group Chief
Accountant and the Group Director of Internal Audit and Risk
Management were invited to attend each meeting to ensure
that Committee members were fully informed and fully
supported in carrying out their duties. Part of each meeting
was held between the members of the Committee and the
external auditors in private.
Role of the Committee
The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee responsibility to:
■ monitor the integrity of the financial statements and any formal
announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance;
■ review critical accounting policies and financial reporting
judgements;
■ review the integrity of the Group’s system of internal control
and risk management;
■ monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal
audit function;
■ the annual audit plan of both the internal and external audit
functions including the principal areas of focus;
■ review the Group’s risk and insurance programmes;
■ review and monitor the external auditors’ independence and
objectivity taking into consideration relevant UK professional
and regulatory requirements, assess the effectiveness of the
external audit process, approve the external auditors’
remuneration and terms of engagement and make
recommendations in respect of their reappointment or removal;
■ review the directors’ conflicts of interest register and to
agree any amendments to previously approved conflicts;

■ review regularly the Group’s policy on the supply of non-
audit services by the external auditors taking into account
relevant ethical guidance regarding the provision of non-
audit services, to approve the qualifying services and the
level of non-audit fees and to monitor the services provided.
In this respect, the level of fees paid for non-audit services
when taken as a proportion of the audit fee is considered in
addition to the nature of such services in order to preserve
the external auditors’ independence and objectivity; and
■ monitor the results and effectiveness of arrangements under
which employees can raise in confidence issues of concern
relating to financial matters and internal controls
(Whistleblowing).
The full terms of reference of the Audit Committee are available
on the corporate responsibility section of the corporate website.
Key matters considered
In addition to executing the responsibilities described above,
the key matters considered by the Committee during the
period included:
■ significant issues arising from reports from both the internal
and external audits;
■ the review of the internal controls of PIXmania, noting that
there was an improvement in controls within PIXmania;
■ the carrying value of certain assets in the Group;
■ adopting revised terms of reference to include the annual
review of directors’ conflicts of interest;
■ a review of working capital of the Group in connection with
the Placing and Rights Issue and the profit forecast
contained within the related prospectus and engaging the
external auditor to assist the Group with these areas;
■
a review of the tax position of the Group in respect of the
transfer pricing case and the subsequent accounting
treatment of the settlement reached with HMRC; and
■ the annual audit fee with particular regard to the balance
between audit and non-audit fees. The pre-approval policy
for non-audit work has been carefully monitored throughout
the period and helps to ensure that engagements which
might compromise auditor independence are not assigned
to Deloitte LLP , noting that this policy has been working well
and remained appropriate. The Committee also noted that
there had been a significant increase in fees paid to the
auditor in connection with work undertaken on the Placing
and Rights Issue, the refinancing of the Group’s debt
facilities and actual and potential disposal activity and which
had been pre-approved in line with the policy.
The Committee, having considered the policies and procedures
applied by the Group and the internal policies and representations
of Deloitte LLP , including the regular rotation of audit partner,
remains satisfied with the auditors’ objectivity and independence
and the effectiveness of the audit process. Accordingly, the
Committee has recommended to the Board that a resolution
for their reappointment be proposed at the AGM.

Membership and meetings
The membership of the Committee during the period, whose
biographies and qualifications are set out on page 40, is set
out in the table below and comprised the four independent
non-executive directors and the Chairman. All the Committee
members served throughout the period. The Committee met
twice during the period and additionally on an ad hoc basis as
required to facilitate the recruitment of the Chairman designate.
The Company Secretary is secretary of the Committee. 
John Allan joined the Committee following his appointment 
to the Board on 23 June 2009.
Role of the Committee
The Committee’s principal roles and responsibilities are:
■
to keep under review the structure, size and composition of
the Board and its principal committees and to recommend
changes deemed necessary;
■
to identify, evaluate and nominate to the Board candidates
for appointment to the Board;
■
to be responsible for succession planning for Board members,
in particular, the Chairman and Chief Executive; and
■
to make recommendations to the Board for the continuation
or otherwise of a director in office upon the expiry of any
specified term of appointment.
No member of the Committee participates in discussions 
or decisions concerning their own appointment to the Board.
The Committee’s full terms of reference are on the corporate
responsibility section of the corporate website.
Key matters considered
The principal matters considered by the Committee during 
the period included the following:
■ the recruitment of an additional director to assume the
position of Chairman following the announcement that 
Sir John Collins will retire at the AGM in September 2009.
The recruitment process was led by the Senior Independent
Director, Andrew Lynch, with the assistance of the recruitment
consultancy The Zygos Partnership. The Committee believes
John Allan is independent in character and judgement on
appointment and meets the independence criteria as set out
in the Combined Code. Sir John Collins was not involved 
in the selection and approval of the Chairman designate;
■ the appointment of Nicholas Cadbury as Group Finance
Director;

■ further consideration of succession planning in relation to
Board members and senior executives within the Group;
■ the evaluation of the Board undertaken during the year
which confirmed the Committee’s opinion that the Board’s
size, composition and structure and the present Board
Committee structure were appropriate to the present 
needs of the Group. The Committee is also satisfied 
that the present structure offers strong leadership for 
the Company, but does not concentrate authority in 
one or two key individuals. As part of the evaluation, 
the Committee benchmarked the Board against a peer
group of companies;
■ the evaluation of the time commitment required from 
each non-executive director and the Chairman in fulfilling
their respective roles, recognising the need for availability
outside the scheduled Board timetable;
■ review of the Committee’s terms of reference following
changes arising from the Companies Act 2006 and other
relevant legislation;
■ consideration of the terms of appointment of Rita Clifton,
Andrew Lynch and John Whybrow and the recommendation
to the Board that those terms be extended for a further
period of three years; and
■ a review of the policy for external appointments for both
non-executive and executive directors following changes
implemented by the Companies Act 2006 for recommendation
to the Board.
The Committee is satisfied that the Board keeps abreast of
developments within the industry through a mixture of private
research and presentations from internal and external advisors
on key areas of importance to the Company.
The Committee is satisfied that the directors retiring in
accordance with the Articles of Association at the forthcoming
AGM (John Browett, Rita Clifton and John Allan) are properly
qualified for reappointment by virtue of their skills and
experience and their contribution of guidance and time 
to the Board’s deliberations.
Following the announcement that Count Emmanuel d’André
will be retiring at the AGM in September 2009, the Committee
has begun the search for an additional non-executive director
and details regarding this process will be reported in the
Committee’s report in 2010.

Remuneration Report
This report, approved by the Board, has been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002, the relevant schedules of the
Companies Acts and the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority. This report is divided into two sections:
■ remuneration policy (not audited) which details the role 
of the Committee, the principles of remuneration and 
other matters; and
■ remuneration review (audited) which details directors’ 
and former directors’ emoluments, share awards and
options and pension arrangements.
The purpose of this report is to inform shareholders of the
Company’s policies on directors’ remuneration applicable 
to the two financial periods up to 2 May 2009 and, so far 
as practicable, for subsequent years as well; and to provide
details of the remuneration of individual directors as determined
by the Remuneration Committee. Shareholders will be asked
to approve the report at the AGM on 2 September 2009.
(i) Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee
responsibility for determining policy in relation to, and approval
of, remuneration packages for senior management. This
includes the terms and conditions of employment of each of
the executive directors of the Company and for other senior
management of the Group; and policy in relation to the operation
of the Group’s share-based employee incentive schemes. 
The membership of the Committee during the period under
review, whose biographies and qualifications are set out on
page 40, is set out in the table below and comprises three
independent non-executive directors and the Chairman of 
the Company. All the Committee members served throughout
both the period under review and the prior period, except for
the Company Chairman who joined the Committee in January
2008. The Chairman has joined the Committee in accordance
with the provision of the Combined Code permitting a
company Chairman to be a member, but not Chairman, 
of the Remuneration Committee. The Committee’s terms of
reference are shown on the corporate responsibility section 
of the corporate website. The Committee met five times
during the period. Following his appointment to the Board 
on 23 June 2009, John Allan has also joined the Committee.

Remuneration policy
The Chief Executive and the Group Director – Marketing,
People & Property attended meetings of the Committee 
by invitation in an advisory capacity. Meetings are attended 
by the Company Secretary (who acts as secretary to 
the Committee) and by the Group Reward Director and
occasionally by representatives from the Group’s external
remuneration advisors, Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS).
Nobody attends any part of a meeting at which their own
remuneration is discussed.
During the period under review the Committee obtained
advice from HNBS for which they received fees of £113,000.
HNBS provided no other services to the Company and has 
no other connections with the Company or its officers.
(ii) Remuneration principles
In setting its policies, the Committee has regard to several
factors including the benefits arrangements which apply below
senior management level and competitor benchmarking.
In implementing this policy, the Remuneration Committee
takes account of information and surveys from internal 
and independent sources and the remuneration paid for
comparable positions in other companies. It reviews data 
and surveys provided by remuneration consultants and
market research companies with particular reference to the
scale and composition of the total remuneration packages
payable to people with like responsibilities, qualifications, skills
and experience in businesses of similar size and structure.
In setting the remuneration of the directors and senior
management, the Committee takes into account the economic
environment and financial performance of the Group, along
with pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere
in the Group. For the financial year 2009/10 the Committee
has approved a decision to freeze the pay of all UK employees
except that in exceptional circumstances pay increases may
be provided to individuals whose base salary is considerably
behind the market or to those individuals who are performing
above expectation. This policy has also been applied to both
the directors and other senior management.
Executive directors
The objectives of the remuneration policy are to:
■ ensure that the remuneration structure motivates 
the directors and senior management to succeed and
appropriately rewards them for their contribution to the
attainment of the Group’s short and longer term results;
■ maintain, particularly through reward schemes based on
performance, a competitive package of pay and benefits
which provides the motivation for future achievement;
■ facilitate the building and retention of a high calibre and
focused team which will work effectively to achieve the
Group’s longer term strategic objectives;
■
align the directors’ interests with those of shareholders by
offering participation in schemes which provide opportunities
to build shareholdings in the Company; and
■ facilitate effective succession planning.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 51
Business Overview Performance Review Strategic Summary Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Remuneration Report continued
The Committee is satisfied that the incentive structure for
senior management does not raise governance risks by
inadvertently motivating irresponsible or reckless behaviour.
During the previous financial period, the Remuneration
Committee reviewed the remuneration policy. The Committee
decided that the fundamental structure of the incentive design
for executive directors should remain unchanged; changes
were needed, however, mainly in the area of the Group’s short
and long term incentive arrangements, particularly with regard
to ensuring appropriate performance conditions were in place
and changes to reflect good corporate governance. These
changes were approved at the AGM held in 2008. 
During the period under review, the Committee has again
reviewed the remuneration of the executive directors and
senior management and has concluded that the fundamental
structure remains sound, although attention should be 
given to addressing the balance between fixed and variable
elements. The Committee therefore felt it was necessary 
to review 2009/10 remuneration arrangements for senior
management so that, whilst remaining consistent with the
remuneration policy objectives outlined above, the revised
arrangements better reflected the current position of the
Company and the strategic challenges that it faces.
To this end the base salary will be generally frozen at current
levels, in line with Company policy. Bonus targets will be made
more stretching at maximum levels with a lower proportion
payable at target (budget) levels recognising the reduction in
Company profitability. Share incentives will retain the same
performance measures with appropriate targets being set
prior to grant reflecting the task ahead.
The number of shares awarded under the Executive Share
Option and Performance Share plan will be granted at a 
higher level than last year, although the face value will be lower
given the lower market share price which has been affected
by both the current economic environment and the Placing
and Rights Issue. Overall, the total expected value of the
remuneration package will be similar to that of 2008/09.
In addition, the Committee will be consulting with leading
institutional shareholders and their representative bodies 
with a view to offering the senior executive population 
the opportunity to receive a lower salary in 2009/10 whilst
receiving an additional grant of share options. In this way, 
the remuneration package would be rebalanced, lowering
fixed pay and raising variable pay. If this proceeds then it will
be the subject of a separate vote at the forthcoming AGM 
and full details will be provided with the Notice of Meeting.
It is currently anticipated that these proposals will apply for 
the 2009/10 financial year only and will be reviewed by the
Committee next year. 
(a) Base salaries
As a general policy, base salaries reflect the Committee’s
assessment of the mid-market rate for relevant positions 
and levels of responsibility and the individual executive’s
experience, performance and value to the business. The
Committee also assesses pay and employment conditions 
of employees of the Group when determining the executive
directors’ remuneration. 
The Chief Executive’s salary remains unchanged for 2009/10
at £670,000. The Finance Director’s salary will be increased by
£25,000 to £400,000 to reflect the fact that he is performing
above expectations in his new role and that his salary on
promotion was below market levels and anticipated increases
as he developed in the role.
(b) Performance-related remuneration
The performance-based elements of remuneration are designed
to drive performance and to strengthen the alignment between
the interests of the Company’s shareholders and its senior
management, whilst encouraging management retention. 
The components of performance-related remuneration are 
as follows:
(i) Annual cash bonus
During 2007/08 and 2008/09, performance-based remuneration
for the executive directors comprised an annual cash bonus
plan based on the achievement of the Group’s targets and, for
2008/09, personal objectives. In the case of other participating
executives below Board level, divisional and business unit
targets were applied.
For 2007/08, the maximum bonus payable to Kevin O’Byrne
and John Clare was 100% of basic salary. In the case of both
of the executive directors, the bonus performance measures
were based on Controllable Earnings and the achievement 
of Free Cash Flow targets whereby Controllable Earnings
represented 80% of the bonus opportunity and Free Cash
Flow comprised 20% of the bonus opportunity. Free Cash
Flow is defined in the consolidated financial statements on 
the cash flow statement. The maximum potential bonus for
members of the Executive Committee was 85% of basic
salary and for other participating senior management was
80% of basic salary. For 2007/08 the performance targets
were not met and accordingly neither John Clare nor Kevin
O’Byrne were paid a performance-related bonus. John
Browett’s bonus arrangements upon joining are discussed
below in section (g).
For 2008/09 the maximum potential bonus for the Chief
Executive was 100% of basic salary and 85% for the Finance
Director. Payment was dependent on underlying Group
operating profit (60% of bonus), Group Free Cash Flow (20%
of bonus) and achievement of personal objectives (20% of
bonus), which included an element related to non-financial
52 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 objectives. For 2008/09 the maximum potential bonus for
members of the Executive Committee was 85% of basic
salary and for other participating senior management was
80% of basic salary. Although there is an entitlement under
the personal objectives element of the bonus plan, the
executive directors have volunteered not to receive any 
bonus for the 2008/09 financial year. This offer has been
accepted by the Remuneration Committee. 
For 2009/10, there will be no change in the existing bonus
potential for the executive directors – 100% of salary for the
Chief Executive and 85% of salary for the Finance Director.
The bonus will be dependent on underlying Group operating
profit (55% of bonus), Group Free Cash Flow (25% of bonus)
and achievement of personal objectives (20% of bonus), which
will include an element related to non-financial objectives. 
Bonus targets for 2009/10 have been set using benchmarks
that reflect both internal business objectives and external
expectations. In light of the reduced level of profitability for
2008/09 compared to previous years, the bonus payment
scale for 2009/10 will be 70% of the maximum available for
achieving performance in line with budget compared to 90%
for 2008/09. The stretch target at which a full payment will 
be made will be more demanding relative to the budget than
in 2008/09.The Committee is satisfied that the targets are
challenging. Before approving bonus payments, the Committee
will confirm that awards reflect genuine improvement in the
Group’s underlying financial performance. 
Any bonus paid to the Chief Executive or the Finance Director
as detailed above will not be pensionable. 
(ii) Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Performance Share
Plan (PSP)
For awards made prior to June 2008 under the LTIP ,
performance has been measured in terms of the Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) achieved by the Company over 
a three year period relative to the companies comprising 
the FTSE 100 Index at the start of the performance period.
TSR data is collated by HNBS to calculate the extent to 
which the performance condition has been met. 
Vesting of shares was subject to the achievement of the
following performance targets: 
■ no shares would vest if TSR performance was below 
the median for the comparator group; and
■ for performance in the upper quartile, 100% would 
vest, for median performance 40% would vest and for
performance between the median and upper quartile the
number of shares was calculated using a sliding scale.
Any shares which vest cannot be released within close periods.
The number of shares awarded was calculated by reference
to basic salary at the date of grant. The maximum award of
shares was equivalent to 50% of basic salary in the case of
the executive directors, 45% for the members of the Executive
Committee and 40% for other participating executives. Prior
to vesting, the Remuneration Committee satisfied itself that
the TSR performance achieved reasonably reflected the
financial performance of the Group and reserved the right 
to vary awards accordingly. 
At the AGM on 3 September 2008, shareholder approval was
given to establish a new incentive plan called the Performance
Share Plan (PSP), which replaced the LTIP . The performance
targets for the PSP continued to be based upon Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) (as it aligns management interests
with those of the shareholders), however, the Committee
believed that the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index were 
no longer the most appropriate benchmark of performance.
Accordingly, for the annual awards made in 2008/09, TSR
performance was compared to that of a bespoke weighted
index comprising UK and European retailers Debenhams,
Inchcape, Signet Group, Halfords Group, Kesa Electricals,
Marks & Spencer, Sports Direct International, Home Retail
Group, Kingfisher, Next, Tesco, PPR, Metro Group, Jelmoli
and Praktiker. All companies had equal weighting within the
group other than Kesa and Metro Group, who have greater
competitive relevance and therefore have double weighting. 
The annual awards made in July 2008 under the LTIP
contained provisions consistent with the PSP in terms 
of the comparator group referred to above. The 2008/09
awards made to participating executives were made in line
with previous practice, with awards granted up to 50% of
salary. For 2008/09, 25% of an award vests for performance
equivalent to median (nothing below) with full vesting occurring
for performance equivalent to the upper quartile over the three
year performance period. Vesting between these targets will
occur on a straight-line basis. In the event of an individual
leaving as a Good Leaver and on a change of control the
following provisions apply:
■ in the event of a participant leaving the Group as a Good
Leaver, awards will be capable of vesting, at the normal
vesting date (except in the event of death), subject to
satisfaction of the TSR performance condition. Awards 
will be pro-rated to reflect the shortened service during 
the performance period; and
■ in the event of a change of control, awards will only vest 
to the extent that the Remuneration Committee determines
that performance warrants it and awards will be pro-rated
unless the Committee determines that it is inappropriate to
do so.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 53
Business Overview Performance Review Strategic Summary Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Remuneration Report continued
Good Leaver circumstances relate to a participant leaving 
the Group under compassionate circumstances, including
those leaving due to retirement, ill-health, injury, disability 
or redundancy.
Awards granted under the PSP in December 2008 mirror 
the provisions detailed above for the LTIP . Details of awards
made in 2008/09 to Nicholas Cadbury and John Browett 
are contained in section (iii) on page 59.
The number of shares planned to be awarded under the PSP
in 2009/10 will be higher than those awarded in 2008/09 with
the total face value of the award being reduced reflecting the
lower share price. The PSP will continue to use TSR achieved
by the Company over a three year period relative to an index
of comparator companies at the start of the performance
period. The comparator group for 2009/10 will be broadly the
same as for the 2008/09 awards with the exclusion of Jelmoli
and the inclusion of others to be agreed by the Committee. 
All companies will have equal weighting within the group other
than Kesa and Metro Group, who have greater relevance 
and will, therefore, have double weighting. Prior to vesting, 
the Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the TSR
performance achieved reasonably reflects the financial
performance of the Group and reserves the right to vary
awards accordingly. 
(iii) Share Option and Reward Share plans
The Remuneration Committee approves the basis on which
options are granted to executive directors and other employees
under the Company’s discretionary share option schemes and
other performance plans.
Options are normally granted annually to executive directors
and to senior management under the Group’s Executive 
Share Option Scheme (ESOS). The scheme permits making
an award with a market value on the date of grant of not more
than twice the recipient’s basic salary. However, in exceptional
circumstances (for instance to facilitate recruitment or to retain
key executives) this limit can be exceeded. Executive directors
and senior management are also entitled to participate in the
Sharesave plan on the same conditions as other employees.
The Company will be inviting employees to participate in a
Sharesave plan in early July 2009.
For 2007/08, Kevin O’Byrne received a grant of share 
options with a value of 200% of salary and, on joining, 
the Chief Executive received a grant of share options with 
a value of 200% of salary. Both awards were subject to 
EPS performance conditions and were measured over 
three financial years. The performance period for the award
made to Kevin O’Byrne (which has now lapsed, following 
him leaving the Group) commenced on 29 April 2007; and 
the performance period for the award made to the Chief
Executive commenced on 4 May 2008.
In 2008/09, a very small number of executives received an
exceptional grant of share options worth 300% of salary, 
with other senior management receiving options with a value
of 200% of salary, based upon a three month average share
price preceding the date of grant. For 2008/09, the Chief
Executive received an award of 200% of salary as originally
agreed upon joining. Upon his appointment the Group
Finance Director received a further grant of options to bring
his annual grant of options to a value of 200% of his new
salary. In order to incentivise junior management to develop 
a stronger ownership culture in the Group, a grant of share
options was made to this population in 2008 but at a lower
value level.
A limited number of senior executives below Board level 
also received awards in 2008 under the Retention and
Recruitment Plan (Reward Shares) as reported in the 2007/08
Remuneration Report whereby no performance condition
applied but, other than in the event of death or on change 
of control, shares will only be released in the event that the
relevant individuals remain with the Group for a three year
period. The Reward Share awards ranged between 30% 
and 50% of salary. Reward Shares were not granted to
executive directors.
Both the exceptional share option grant and Reward Shares
were considered necessary to ensure that those executives
key to delivering the targets were appropriately incentivised
and ‘locked in’ to the Company for three years. In the event 
of a change of control, awards under the Share Option Plan
will only vest to the extent that the Committee determines that
performance warrants it and awards will be pro-rated unless
the Committee determines that it is inappropriate to do so. 
The options granted in 2008/09 to the Group’s most senior
executives (those in the top three management grades at 
that time) were subject to performance conditions which 
are detailed below:
*Awards will vest on a straight-line basis as detailed on page 60.
In 2008/09, share options were granted to other employees 
in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade,
including regional and store managers. To maximise the value
of the options, no performance conditions were applied to
awards made to employees below the top three management
grades. These awards were granted at a level of up to 150%
of salary. The average award made to employees was
approximately 30% of salary.

54 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 All the awards granted in 2008/09 were subject to the Good
Leaver provisions detailed below:
At the AGM on 3 September 2008, shareholder approval was
given to establish a new share option scheme which is called
the Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP), which replaced the
previous scheme. The ESOP contains provisions consistent
with the annual awards made in July 2008 for Good Leavers
and the maximum award levels as detailed above.
It is planned to grant share options in 2009/10 under the
ESOP to the top 90 executives, and eligible Regional and
Store Managers. Awards granted to the executive directors
and the Executive Committee will be subject to an EPS target
with 25% vesting at the threshold level of performance.
The awards will contain provisions for Good Leavers
consistent with the 2008 awards as detailed above.
All share options, other than those under the Sharesave scheme,
are exercisable between three and 10 years from the date of
grant and, for those options subject to a performance target, 
if the Committee determines that the performance conditions
have been met. Such determination is made following
presentation of the calculation which is performed once 
EPS figures are known for the relevant financial year and
targets, since 2004, are tested only once. All share options
lapse on the earlier of 10 years from the date of grant or,
where performance conditions apply, on the date on which 
the Remuneration Committee determines that the performance
conditions have not been met.
(iv) Dilution
A combination of both newly issued shares and shares 
bought in the market are to be used to satisfy awards 
under the Group’s employee share incentive agreements.
The Remuneration Committee is aware of, and supports, 
the ABI guidelines regarding dilution and regularly monitors
compliance with these requirements. The Remuneration
Committee included provisions in the scheme rules adopted
at the 2008 AGM which limit the number of newly issued
shares which can be granted to 10% of the issued share
capital in 10 years under all employee share schemes and 
5% for the executive directors and senior management 
under the discretionary share plans.

As at the date of this report, the Company’s usage of shares
against the limits detailed above in respect of all employee
schemes was 3.03%; and was 1.17% in respect of grants 
to executive directors and senior management under the
discretionary plans. 
The Group has an established employee trust which it uses 
to hold existing shares and the Committee’s intention is to
make purchases, if required, of shares taking into account the
portion of awards and options to be satisfied by new issue,
the likelihood of any performance targets being met and also
potential lapsing of awards when employees leave the Group.
(v) Placing and Rights Issue 
Following the Placing and Rights Issue, the Committee 
has agreed, subject to receiving permission from HMRC, to
adjust the approved share options awarded in prior years, to
reflect the dilutive effect of the Rights Issue and to adjust the
current options and awards accordingly. This HMRC specified
adjustment will be applied to all awards.
Following the adjustments referred to above, of the shares
currently under option detailed in (iv), approximately 1.59% 
of the issued share capital would relate to grants made 
to the executive directors and senior management under
discretionary plans and approximately 4.11% would relate 
to all schemes for all employee schemes.
Further information on share-based payments is set out 
in note 26 to the financial statements.
(c) Taxable benefits
Each of the executive directors is entitled to the use of 
a company car with related benefits or cash payments in 
lieu and is a member of the non-contributory DSGi medical
expenses plan which provides benefits similar to those
applicable in comparable companies.
Further information on employee costs and those relating to
senior management is given in notes 6 and 33, respectively, 
to the financial statements.
(d) Pensions and related benefit
Nicholas Cadbury accrues benefits under the defined 
benefit section of the DSGi Retirement & Employee Security
Scheme (DRESS). This is a funded, HMRC registered
contributory pension scheme which provides a pension at 
a normal retirement age of 65 accrued at a rate of 1/60th of
pensionable salary per annum up to a maximum of 40 years.
Part of this pension may be exchanged for cash at the date 
of retirement. Membership of the scheme also confers
dependants’ pensions and insured lump sums on death in
service (equal to four times basic salary). Notwithstanding 
the abolition of the statutory earnings cap for pension
purposes on 6 April 2006, an equivalent cap, adjusted
annually for inflation, was introduced for the purposes of DRESS.

Business Overview Performance Review Strategic Summary Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Remuneration Report continued
From 4 May 2008 this was £117,600 and from 3 May 2009 is
£123,600. Nicholas Cadbury is provided with a salary supplement
at the annual rate of 30% of the difference between his basic
salary and the scheme earnings cap as set by the Company
from time to time. A similar salary supplement arrangement for
pension purposes applies to three other senior executives.
John Browett has chosen not to become a member of any
DSGi pension plan. However, he receives a contribution of
32.1% of basic salary to fund his own retirement arrangements.
John Browett is also entitled to receive life assurance cover
equal to four times basic salary and personal accident cover
at the level of £2,000,000.
Prior to leaving the Group, Kevin O’Byrne and John Clare
accrued benefits under the senior executive defined benefit
section of DRESS which provides a pension at normal
retirement age of 60. Part of this pension is exchangeable 
for cash at the date of retirement. Membership of the scheme
also conferred dependants’ pensions and an insured lump
sum on death in service. In respect of the scheme earnings
cap described above, Kevin O’Byrne received a salary
supplement equivalent to the contributions which would
otherwise have been paid by the Company to DRESS on 
that part of his pensionable salary which exceeded the
scheme earnings cap.
New externally recruited executive directors will be offered
membership of the money purchase section of DRESS and
the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion
regarding the level of award of any salary supplement or
enhanced contributions.
(e) Service agreements
John Browett and Nicholas Cadbury have service agreements
with DSG international plc which may be terminated at any
time by 12 months’ notice. Service agreements contain
neither a liquidated damages nor a change of control clause. 
It is the Company’s policy to ensure that any payments made
to a director in the event of the early termination of a service
agreement reflect the circumstances giving rise to termination
and, where considered appropriate, the obligation of the
outgoing director to mitigate his loss. Accordingly, consideration
is given to making compensation payments in instalments and
is conditional on the leaver’s employment and earnings status.
The service agreements of the executive directors who 
served during the financial period were entered into on 
the following dates:
Date
John Browett 6 June 2007
Kevin O’Byrne (resigned 14 August 2008) 16 July 2004
Nicholas Cadbury 13 April 2009
The service agreements of the continuing directors are
available for inspection at the registered office of the Company
during normal business hours on each business day. 
(f) External directorships
Executive directors are permitted to accept non-executive
directorships in external companies and to retain the fees
which they receive in such roles. Normally only one such
appointment will be authorised for each director. John Browett
is a non-executive director of easyJet plc and was paid a fee
at the rate of £45,000 per annum.
(g) Recruitment of John Browett in the prior financial year
On 31 May 2007, John Clare announced his intention to 
retire from the Board at the 2007 AGM. The Nominations
Committee undertook a search for a new Chief Executive
which culminated in the recruitment of John Browett. In 
order to facilitate his recruitment, and in compensation of 
the significant value of share awards and bonus entitlement
John Browett was forfeiting upon joining the Company, the
Remuneration Committee agreed the following incentive
arrangements:
■ on joining, an award of shares with a value of 200% 
of salary under the LTIP , which will vest after the third
anniversary of appointment in December 2010 subject to
the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance
relative to the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index over the
three year period starting on 5 December 2007. Vesting is in
line with LTIP grants prior to June 2008 (which are referred
to in section (b)(ii) above);
■ a grant of options under the share option scheme with a
value of 200% of salary, which will be exercisable subject to
achieving earnings per share (EPS) growth over the three
financial years commencing 4 May 2008. These options
cannot be exercised until after the preliminary announcement
of results for the 2010/11 financial year. Where EPS growth
is 3% per annum, half of the options will become exercisable
increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS
growth of 5% per annum;
■ on joining, a ‘one-off’ award of 200% of salary under the
LTIP , which will vest on 6 December 2010 subject, in most
circumstances, to John Browett remaining in employment
with the Group at that time; and
■ a ‘one-off’ guaranteed bonus for 2007/08 of £600,000
which was paid in August 2008.
56 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 (iii) Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are normally appointed for three 
year terms, although appointments vary depending on 
length of service and succession planning considerations.
Their current terms expire as follows:
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by
the Board upon the recommendation of the Chief Executive
and the Group Finance Director. 
Sir John Collins’ fee is £330,000 per annum; he is also
provided with the use of a car and related benefits and is a
member of the Group’s medical expenses plan. The other
non-executive directors receive a fee of £48,000 per annum 
or euro equivalent. The fee is normally reviewed bi-annually
and is due to be reviewed in 2010.
The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees
receive an additional fee of £10,000 per annum. Andrew
Lynch has been designated Senior Independent Director 
for which he receives a further fee of £5,000 per annum.
Non-executive directors derive no other benefits from their
office and are not eligible to participate in the Group’s pension
scheme. It is Company policy not to grant share options to
non-executive directors or to require part of their fees to be
paid in the form of shares.
Letters of appointment of the non-executive directors 
are available on application to the Company Secretary.
(iv) Directors’ share interests 
The Committee implemented a policy in the 2008/09 financial
year of encouraging executive directors to build shareholdings
in the Company. The policy is that executive directors are
required to retain 50% of the net of tax out-turn from the
vesting of future awards or share options under the Company’s
share plans until a shareholding with a minimum value
equivalent to their basic salary is achieved.

(i) Directors’ remuneration
The following table shows an analysis of the emoluments of individual directors:
1 Amounts for the 53 weeks ended 3 May 2008 relate to John Browett’s period in office as a director (5 December 2007 to 3 May 2008).
2 John Browett’s pension contribution payable to him represented an amount calculated as a percentage of basic salary to fund his own retirement arrangements.
3 John Browett’s cash bonus relates to the ‘one-off’ guaranteed bonus described above in section (g). 
4 Amounts shown relate to Nicholas Cadbury’s period in office as a director (17 July 2008 to 2 May 2009).
5 Nicholas Cadbury’s pension contributions represent 30% of the difference between his basic salary and the scheme earnings cap set by the Company.
6 Kevin O’Byrne’s pension contributions represented amounts which would have been payable to DRESS had his pensionable salary not been subject to an earnings cap.
7 Kevin O’ Byrne’s cash bonus relates to a ‘one-off’ discretionary payment in respect of the additional responsibility he assumed during the period between John Clare’s departure and John
Browett joining the Group.
(ii) Directors’ pensions
*Represents the date of appointment as a director.
Accrued pension shown is that payable at normal retirement age (65).
The transfer value as at 17 July 2008 has been calculated in accordance with Guidance Note GN 11 ‘Retirement Benefit
Schemes – Transfer Values’ published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries and adopted by the Board 
for Actuarial Standards with effect from 6 April 2007. The transfer value as at 2 May 2009 has been calculated in accordance
with the amended Government regulations on the calculation of transfer values, ‘Occupational Pensions Schemes (Transfer
Values) (Amendment) Regulations 2008’, which came into force on 1 October 2008 replacing the previous professional
guidance. The recalculation has led to an increase in the transfer value as detailed above. The difference between the transfer
values at the beginning and end of the period also includes the effect of factors beyond the control of the Company and the
directors, such as stock market movements.

The directors’ restricted beneficial interests shown in the table below represent the maximum number of shares which may 
vest under the LTIP or Retention and Recruitment plan. Details of the LTIP , including performance conditions for the awards
made during 2007/08, are described in section (b)(ii) of this report. Details of the Retention and Recruitment plan are described
in section (b)(iii) of this report.
*Date of appointment, if later.
**The above figures show the awards as originally granted. The awards will be adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of the Placing and Rights Issue. 
1 The award of 788,834 shares was made on 6 December 2007. The quantum of shares awarded was calculated using the mid-market value of the shares on 6 June 2007, the date on which
John Browett accepted the offer of employment with the Group.
2 The release of these shares, in most circumstances, is dependent on John Browett remaining in employment until the vesting date, 6 December 2010. These shares may vest on an earlier
date in certain circumstances.
3 Following the period end, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the TSR performance condition associated with the awards made to Nicholas Cadbury in the 2006/07 financial period and
determined that the target had not been met. Accordingly, these awards have now lapsed.
The status of the provisional awards under the LTIP are reviewed regularly and as at the last review the status of the awards as
at the date of this report is as follows:
The ‘one-off’ LTIP award made to John Browett upon joining the Group is not subject to performance conditions.
It is intended that any releases of shares under the LTIP will be satisfied by shares held in trust by Halifax EES Trustees International
Limited, the trustee of the employee share ownership trust (the Trust). Vesting of the shares provisionally awarded under the LTIP
in 2007/08 and 2008/09 occurs in June 2010 and July 2011, respectively, subject to the attainment of performance targets. The
shares provisionally awarded under the LTIP in 2006/07 did not vest as they did not satisfy the performance targets.

(iv) Directors’ share options
*Date of appointment, if later.
**The above figures show the awards as originally granted. The awards will be adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of the Placing and Rights Issue. 
1 Options are exercisable between three and 10 years from the date of grant, subject to the performance conditions being met. The conditions upon which discretionary options may 
be exercised are summarised below. 
2 The performance period for this award made to John Browett commenced on 4 May 2008.
3 Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are exercisable in the six month period following the date of maturity of a three year or five year savings contract. 
Options may be exercised earlier by Good Leavers, subject to performance conditions being satisfied.
The following table summarises the terms applicable to the executive directors’ and senior management options outstanding 
as at 2 May 2009:
Options granted to the directors and senior management between 1 July 2003 and 11 October 2004 have now lapsed.
Prior to 2005/06, share options were granted to other employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade
and to employees with more than three years’ service. Since 2005/06 and until 2007/08, employees below executive level have
either participated in a cash settled performance share plan or in a few selected cases have been granted share options, both 
of which were linked in most cases to the attainment of three year EPS targets. In 2008, share options were granted to other
employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade; these options were granted with no performance
conditions below the top three management grades at the date of grant. 
Performance conditions Re-testing
Grants made before 1 July 2003 The market price on the date of exercise is at least 20% higher than the option During the life 
price, assuming exercise takes place between three and four years after the of the option
date of grant. For later exercises, the rate of share growth is adjusted in line with 
Retail Price Index (RPI).
Exercise is also conditional upon EPS having increased by not less than 3% 
above the annual RPI over any consecutive period of three years during the 
life of the option.
Grants made after 11 October 2004 Over the three year performance period, EPS growth is equal to or greater than No re-testing
annual RPI plus 5% per annum. Where EPS growth is between annual RPI 
plus 3% and RPI plus 5%, options will vest on a straight-line basis between 
50% and 100% of the award.
Grants made after 11 July 2008 Over the three year performance period, EPS growth is equal to or greater than No re-testing
annual RPI plus 4% per annum. For an award of 200% of salary where EPS 
growth is between annual RPI plus 4% and RPI plus 7% per annum, options 
will vest on a straight-line basis between 50% and 100% of the award. For an 
award of 300% of salary where EPS growth is between annual RPI plus 4% 
and RPI plus 10% per annum, options will vest on a straight-line basis 
between 33% and 100% of the award.

Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and regulations. They are required to prepare accounts for the
Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and
have chosen to prepare unconsolidated company financial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP).
In the case of the consolidated IFRSs financial statements,
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions,
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards
Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and Presentation 
of Financial Statements’. In almost all circumstances, a fair
presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable
IFRSs. The directors are also required to:
■ properly select and apply accounting policies;
■ present information, including accounting policies, in a
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information; and
■ provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements of IFRSs is insufficient to enable
users to understand the impact of particular transactions,
other events and conditions on the financial position and
financial performance.
In the case of the unconsolidated Company financial statements
prepared under UK GAAP , the directors are required by UK
company law to prepare financial statements which give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company for
each financial period as at the end of that financial period 
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing both the consolidated Group financial statements
and the unconsolidated Company financial statements, suitable
accounting policies have been used and applied consistently,
and reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates have
been made. Applicable accounting standards have been
followed. The financial statements have been prepared on 
the going concern basis as disclosed in the Directors’ Report.
The directors are responsible for maintaining adequate
accounting records and sufficient internal controls to safeguard
the assets of the Company and to take reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud or any other irregularities
and for the preparation of a Directors’ Report and directors’
Remuneration Report which comply with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006. The directors are responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and
financial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
■ the Group and unconsolidated Company financial statements
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position
and loss of the Group and Company, respectively; and
■ the Performance Review includes a fair review of the
development and performance of the business and the
position of the Group together with a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties they face.

Independent Auditors’ Report
We have audited the Group financial statements of DSG
international plc for the 52 weeks ended 2 May 2009 
which comprise the consolidated income statement, the
consolidated statement of recognised income and expense,
the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash 
flow statement and the related notes 1 to 35. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with sections 495 and 496 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters
we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices
Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial
statements.
Opinions
Financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
■ give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as
at 2 May 2009 and of its loss for the 52 weeks then ended;
■ have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union; and
■ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
IFRSs issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1.1 to the Group financial statements, 
the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation 
to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also
applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB). In our opinion the Group financial
statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
■ the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial
period for which the financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the Group financial statements; and
■ the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report upon in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
■ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
■ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit; or
■ the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
■ the directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ Report in relation to
going concern; or
■ the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s
compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined Code specified
for our review.

statements of DSG international plc for the 52 weeks ended 
2 May 2009.

DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 67
Business Overview Performance Review Strategic Summary Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders Financial Statements
Notes to the Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, IFRSs issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board and those parts of the Companies
Act 2006 applicable to those companies reporting under
IFRSs, and have been prepared on a going concern basis 
as disclosed in the going concern statement on page 44.
The Group’s income statement and segmental analysis
identify separately underlying performance measures and 
non-underlying items. Underlying performance measures
reflect an adjustment to total performance measures to
exclude the impact of businesses to be closed and other 
non-underlying items. Underlying performance measures
comprise profits and losses incurred as part of the day-to-day
ongoing retail activities of the Company and include profits
and losses incurred on the disposal and closure of owned 
or leased properties that occur as part of the Group’s annual
retail churn. The profits or losses incurred on disposal or
closure of owned or leased properties as part of a one-off
restructuring programme are excluded from underlying
performance measures and are therefore included, among
other items, within non-underlying items as described below.
The directors consider ‘underlying’ performance measures 
to be a more accurate reflection of the ongoing trading
performance of the Group and believe that these measures
provide additional useful information for shareholders on the
Group’s performance and are consistent with how business
performance is measured internally.
Non-underlying items comprise trading results of businesses
to be closed, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net
restructuring and business impairment charges and other
one-off, non-recurring items, profit on sale of investments, 
fair value remeasurements of financial instruments and, 
where applicable, discontinued operations. Items excluded
from underlying results can evolve from one financial year to
the next depending on the nature of reorganisation or one-off
type activities described above and for 2008/09, trading
results from businesses to be closed represents such an 
item. Prior year comparatives have been re-presented to
exclude them from underlying results. A reconciliation of
underlying profit to total loss is shown in note 2. Businesses 
to be closed are defined as businesses whose closure was
announced prior to the year end date and do not meet the
definition of discontinued operations as stipulated by IFRS 5.
Underlying performance measures and non-underlying
performance measures may not be directly comparable 
with other similarly titled measures or ‘adjusted’ revenue 
or profit measures used by other companies.
During the period, the Group elected to adopt IFRS 8
‘Operating Segments’ in advance of its effective date. IFRS 8
requires operating segments to be identified based on internal
reporting to the chief operating decision maker and also
amends certain disclosure requirements. Prior year comparatives
have been re-presented to reflect this change.
The principal accounting policies are set out below:
1.2 Accounting convention and basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the
Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the
power to control the financial and operating policies of an
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results 
of subsidiaries acquired are included from the date on which
power to control passes. The net assets of subsidiaries
acquired are recorded at their fair values. The results of
subsidiaries disposed of are included up to the effective 
date of disposal.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting from the date on which the power to exercise
significant influence passes.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses
are eliminated on consolidation.
1.3 Revenue
Revenue comprises sales of goods and services excluding
sales taxes. Revenue from sales of goods is recognised at 
the point of sale or, where later, upon delivery to the customer
and is stated net of returns. Revenue earned from customer
support agreements is recognised as such over the life of 
the agreement by reference to the stage of completion of 
the transaction at the balance sheet date.
1.4 Other income, including non-operating income
Other income which is incidental to the Group’s principal
activities of selling goods and services and accordingly is 
not recorded as part of revenue, is recognised when the
Group obtains the right to consideration by performance 
of its contractual obligations. Interest income is accrued on 
a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and 
at the effective interest rate applicable. Dividend income from
investments is recognised when the right to receive payment
has been established.
1.5 Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group 
which represents a significant separate line of business 
which has been sold. Classification as a discontinued
operation occurs upon disposal or earlier if beneficial title 
and risk has transferred to the purchaser and in the case 
of a business acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent
disposal, on the date of acquisition.
Where the sale of a component of the Group is considered
highly probable and the business is available for immediate
sale in its present condition, it is classified as held for sale.
Assets and liabilities held for sale are measured at the lower 
of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
1.6 Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms 
of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. The determination of the classification
of property leases is made by reference to the land and
buildings elements separately. All leases not classified as
finance leases are operating leases.
68 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at their fair
value on acquisition or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception 
of the lease and depreciated over their estimated useful lives
or the lease term if shorter. The corresponding obligation 
to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a liability.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges
and reduction of the lease obligation. Finance charges are
charged to the income statement over the period of the 
lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating property leases are charged
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the fixed
term of the lease. At the end of the fixed term of leases, rental
payments are reset to market rates, typically on an upwards
only basis.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into
an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.
Where a lease forms part of a separate cash generating unit
(CGU), such as a store or group of stores, and business
indicators exist which could lead to the conclusion that the
carrying value of the CGU is not supportable, the recoverable
amount of the CGU is determined by calculating its value in
use. The value in use is calculated by applying discounted
cash flow modelling to management’s projection of future
profitability. If an impairment of a CGU has been identified
such that the value in use is negative and a lease exists in 
that CGU, a provision for the onerous portion of the lease is
made equal to the lower of the outstanding lease commitment
and the negative present value of the CGU.
1.7 Translation of foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the
rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. Exchange gains and losses arising on settlement
or retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are included
in the income statement.
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated 
at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The
results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated 
into sterling at the average rates of exchange during the
period. Exchange differences resulting from the translation 
of the results and balance sheets of overseas subsidiary
undertakings are charged or credited directly to retained
earnings. Such translation differences become recognised 
in the income statement in the period in which the subsidiary
undertaking is disposed.
As the cumulative translation differences for all foreign
subsidiaries were deemed to be zero at the transition 
date to IFRS on 2 May 2004, upon disposal of a foreign
subsidiary, any gain or loss arising will include only those
foreign exchange gains or losses attributable to periods 
after that date.
1.8 Goodwill
On acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, the fair value 
of the consideration is allocated between the identifiable net
tangible and intangible assets / liabilities on a fair value basis,
with any excess consideration representing goodwill. Goodwill
in respect of subsidiaries is capitalised as goodwill on the
balance sheet; goodwill relating to associates is capitalised 
in investments in associates as part of the carrying value of
the associate.
Goodwill is not amortised, but instead is reviewed annually 
for impairment. Any impairment is recognised immediately 
in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate the attributable
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the 
gain or loss on disposal.
1.9 Intangible assets
Acquired intangibles
Acquired intangibles comprise brands and customer lists
purchased as part of acquisitions of businesses and are
capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives 
on a straight-line basis. Acquired intangibles are stated at 
cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate,
provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on
disposal. Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of
assets on a straight-line basis between three and 30 years.
Other intangible assets: computer software
Computer software is capitalised on the basis of the 
costs incurred both to acquire and bring into use the 
specific software. Amortisation is provided to write off the 
cost of assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated
economic useful lives of between three and seven years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer
software are recognised as an expense as incurred unless
they increase the future economic benefits of the asset, 
in which case they are capitalised.
Internally generated computer software is capitalised at cost 
if the project is technically and commercially feasible and 
the economic benefits which are expected to be generated
exceed one year. The expenditure capitalised includes the
cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion
of overheads. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only
when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in
the specific asset to which it relates. Amortisation is provided
to write off the cost of assets on a straight-line basis between
three and seven years.
Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated
amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for 
impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.

1.10 Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant & equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and, where appropriate, provision
for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets 
by equal instalments over their estimated useful lives. The
rates used are:
Short leasehold property – over the term of the lease
Freehold and long – between 1
2
⁄ 3% and 2
1
⁄ 2% per annum
leasehold buildings
Fixtures, fittings – between 10% and 33
1
⁄ 3% per annum
and equipment
No depreciation is provided on freehold and long leasehold
land or on assets in the course of construction.
Property, plant & equipment are assessed on an ongoing
basis to determine whether circumstances exist that 
could lead to the conclusion that the carrying value is not
supportable. Where assets are to be taken out of use, an
impairment charge is levied. Where assets’ useful lives are
shortened, an estimate is made of their new lives and an
accelerated depreciation charge is levied. Where the property,
plant & equipment form part of a separate cash generating
unit (CGU), such as a store or group of stores, and business
indicators exist which could lead to the conclusions that the
carrying value is not supportable, the recoverable amount of
the CGU is determined by calculating its value in use. The
value in use is calculated by applying discounted cash flow
modelling to management’s projection of future profitability
and any impairment is determined by comparing the carrying
value with the value in use.
1.11 Investments and other financial assets
The Group’s financial assets comprise cash and cash
equivalents, short term investments and those receivables
which involve a contractual right to receive cash from external
parties. Financial assets comprise all items shown in notes 14,
15 and 16 with the exception of prepayments. Under the
classifications stipulated by IAS 39, short term investments
and trade and other receivables, (excluding derivative financial
assets) are classified as ‘available for sale’ and ‘loans and
receivables’, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents and
derivative financial instruments, which are further described in
notes 1.14 and 1.16, are classified as ‘loans and receivables’
and ‘held for trading unless designated in a hedge
relationship’, respectively.
Investment in associates
Associates are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting from the date on which the power to exercise
significant influence passes. All purchases and sales of
investments and other financial assets are recognised on 
the date that the Group becomes committed to make such
purchase or sale (the trade date).
Short term investments
Investments are initially measured at fair value and then
subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance 
sheet date owing to occasional sales of such investments.
The fair value of unlisted investments is estimated either 
by comparing recent arm’s length transactions or by using
discounted cash flow analysis or other modelling techniques.
Gains and losses arising from revaluation at the balance 
sheet date are recognised directly in equity. For unlisted
investments a significant or prolonged decline in the fair 
value of the investment below its cost is considered 
evidence of impairment.
To the extent that any fair value losses are deemed
permanent, such impairment is recognised in the income
statement. Upon sale or impairment of the investments, 
any cumulative gains or losses held in equity are transferred 
to the income statement.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables (excluding derivative financial
assets) are recorded at cost less an allowance for estimated
irrecoverable amounts and any other adjustments required 
to align cost to fair value. The carrying amount of trade
receivables is reduced through the use of a provision 
account. A provision for bad and doubtful debts is made 
for specific receivables when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts
due under the original terms of the invoice. Receivables that
are not assessed individually for impairment are assessed 
for impairment on a collective basis using ageing analysis 
to determine the required provision. Bad debts are written 
off when identified.
1.12 Taxation
Current taxation
Current taxation is the expected tax payable on the taxable
income for the period, using prevailing tax rates and adjusted
for any tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available
against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. No
provision is made for tax which would have been payable 
on the distribution of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries
or associated undertakings, unless the distribution of such
earnings has been accrued in the balance sheet.
70 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each 
other when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement,
except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to
equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and
laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted by the
balance sheet date. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
1.13 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost and 
net realisable value. Cost comprises direct purchase cost 
and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present location and condition, both
types of cost being measured using a weighted average 
cost formula. Net realisable value represents the estimated
selling price less all estimated and directly attributable costs 
of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling
and distribution.
1.14 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in
hand, bank overdrafts and short term highly liquid deposits
with a maturity of three months or less and which are subject
to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts,
which form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose
of the cash flow statement are shown under current liabilities.
1.15 Borrowings and other financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities are those which involve a
contractual obligation to deliver cash to external parties at 
a future date. Financial liabilities comprise all items shown 
in notes 17, 18 and 19 with the exception of other taxation
and social security, deferred income from customer support
agreements, other deferred income and other non-financial
creditors. Under the classifications stipulated by IAS 39,
borrowings, finance lease obligations and trade and other
payables (excluding derivative financial liabilities) are classified
as ‘financial liabilities measured at amortised cost’. Derivative
financial instruments, which are described further in note 1.16
below, are classified as ‘held for trading unless designated 
in a hedge relationship’.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recorded at the consideration 
received less directly attributable transaction costs.
Transaction costs are amortised through the income
statement using the effective interest method and the
unamortised balance is included as part of the related
borrowing at the balance sheet date. A fair value adjustment 
is made to the borrowing where hedge accounting, as
described in note 1.16 below, has been applied.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables (excluding derivative financial
liabilities) are recorded at cost. Derivative financial instruments,
which includes put options over equity held by minority
shareholders, are initially recorded at fair value and then
subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet
date and are held within assets or liabilities as appropriate.
Gains and losses arising from revaluation at the balance 
sheet date are recognised in the income statement unless 
the derivatives are designated as hedges and such hedges
are proved to be effective.
1.16 Derivative financial instruments and 
hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments held by the Group are initially
recognised in the balance sheet at fair value within assets or
liabilities as appropriate and then subsequently remeasured to
fair value at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising
from revaluation at the balance sheet date are recognised in
the income statement unless the derivatives are designated 
as hedges and such hedges are proved to be effective.
Derivatives are classified as non-current assets or liabilities
where a hedge relationship is identified and the remaining
maturity of the hedged item is greater than 12 months from
the balance sheet date. Derivatives are classified as current
assets or liabilities in all other circumstances.
Fair values are derived from market values. The fair value 
of financial instruments traded in active markets is based 
on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial 
risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. The Group uses derivative financial
instruments such as interest rate swaps, options, cross
currency swaps and forward currency contracts to hedge
these risks. The Group does not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.
Where hedge accounting is to be applied, the Group formally
designates and documents the hedge relationship to which
the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, 
or no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting.
The accounting treatment of derivatives that qualify for 
hedge accounting is dependent on how they are designated.
The different designations and accounting treatments are
explained below:
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 71
Business Overview Performance Review Strategic Summary Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders Financial Statements
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
1 Accounting policies continued
Fair value hedges
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure 
to changes in the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments that meet the ‘fair value’
hedging requirements are recognised in the balance sheet at
fair value with corresponding fair value movements recognised
within finance income / costs in the income statement. For 
an effective fair value hedge, the hedged item is adjusted 
for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged
with the corresponding entry in the income statement. To 
the extent that the designated hedge relationship is effective,
such amounts in the income statement offset each other. 
As a result, only the ineffective element of any designated
hedging relationship impacts the income statement. If the
hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item 
for which the effective interest method is used, is amortised 
to the income statement over the period to maturity.
Cash flow hedges
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to 
hedge the foreign currency exposure on inventory ordered 
and purchased and certain sales of inventory. It is Group
policy to hedge between 80% and 100% of committed
purchase orders and sales. At any point in time the Group
also hedges up to 80% of its estimated foreign currency
exposure in respect of forecast purchases and sales for the
subsequent 12 months. Orders and purchases as well as
sales are each considered to be separate hedge transactions.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify for such cash 
flow hedging are initially recognised on the balance sheet 
with gains and losses relating to the remeasurement of the
effective portion of the hedge being deferred in equity. To 
the extent that such items are ineffectively hedged, gains or
losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the
income statement. Amounts taken to equity are transferred 
to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects
profit or loss (i.e. when a purchase or sale is made). For
inventory purchases, the associated gains or losses on the
derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are
included in the initial measurement of inventory. For sales, 
the gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been
recognised in equity are included in the income statement 
in the period in which the sale is made.
Net investment hedges
The Group uses currency forward contracts and currency
swaps to hedge its currency risk on the translation of net
investments in foreign entities. Gains and losses arising on 
the retranslation of the investments and the related derivatives
are recognised in equity. However, this is on the basis that 
the hedging requirements of IAS 39 are met and the hedging
relationship is effective. To the extent that such items are
ineffectively hedged, gains or losses relating to the ineffective
portion are recognised within the income statement.
1.17 Retirement benefit obligations
Company contributions to defined contribution pension
schemes and contributions made to state pension schemes
for certain overseas employees are charged to the income
statement on an accruals basis as contributions become
payable.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the regular service 
cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during 
the period, together with the cost of any benefits relating 
to past service is charged to operating profit in the period. 
A credit representing the expected return on assets of the
retirement benefit schemes during the year is included within
other finance income. This is based on the market value of 
the assets of the schemes at the start of the financial period.
A charge is included within other finance costs, representing
the expected increase in the liabilities of the retirement benefit
schemes during the period. The difference between the
market value of the assets and the present value of the
accrued pension liabilities is shown as an asset or liability 
in the balance sheet. Differences between the actual and
expected returns on assets during the period are recognised
in the statement of recognised income and expense, together
with differences arising from changes in actuarial assumptions.
1.18 Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments 
to certain employees which are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant. This fair value is expensed in the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period,
based on an estimate of the number of shares that will
eventually vest as adjusted for any non-market conditions.
A liability equal to the portion of services received 
from employees is recognised at the current fair value
determined at each balance sheet date for cash-settled 
share-based payments.
1.19 Estimates, judgements and critical 
accounting policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items subject to
such assumptions and estimates include the useful lives of
assets; the measurement and recognition of provisions; the
recognition of deferred tax assets; and liabilities for potential
corporation tax. Actual results could differ from these
estimates and any subsequent changes are accounted for
with an effect on income at the time such updated information
becomes available. The most critical accounting policies in
determining the financial condition and results of the Group
are those requiring the greatest degree of subjective or
complex judgements. These relate to revenue recognition,
inventory valuation, lease costs, the valuation of goodwill 
and acquired intangible assets, share-based payments, 
post-retirement benefits and taxation, and are set out below.
72 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 Revenue recognition
Revenue earned from the sale of customer support agreements
is recognised over the term of the contracts when the Group
obtains the right to consideration as a result of performance 
of its contractual obligations. Revenue in any one year is
therefore recognised to match the proportion of the expected
costs of fulfilling the Group’s total obligations under the
agreements. An estimate of the degree of performance of
these contractual obligations is determined by reference to
extensive historical claims data. Reliance on historical data
assumes that current and future experience will follow past
trends. The directors consider that the quantity and quality of
data available provides an appropriate proxy for current trends.
Inventory valuation
Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost and 
net realisable value. Cost comprises direct purchase cost 
and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present location and condition, both
types of cost being measures using a weighted average 
cost formula. Net realisable value represents the estimated
selling price less all estimated and directly attributable costs 
of completion and costs to be incurred in the marketing,
selling and distribution. Net realisable value includes, where
necessary, provisions for slow moving and damaged inventory.
The provision represents the difference between the cost 
of stock and its estimated net realisable value, based on
ageing. Calculation of these provisions requires judgements 
to be made which include forecast consumer demand, the
promotional, competitive and economic environment and
inventory loss trends.
Provisions and accruals for onerous leases
If the Group vacates a store or other property prior to 
the expiry of the related lease, or a lease forms part of a
separate CGU whereby the carrying value of that CGU is 
not considered supportable, it records a provision or accrual
for the expected lease payments that the Group will incur 
prior to assignment or sublease of the property. Such a
calculation requires a judgement as to the timing and duration
of the expected vacancy periods and the amount and timing
of future potential sublease income. When making these
judgements, the directors consider a number of factors,
including the landlord, the location and condition of the
property, the terms of the lease, the specific marketplace
demand and the economic environment.
Goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant &
equipment impairment reviews
Goodwill is required to be valued annually to assess the
requirement for potential impairment. Other assets are
assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether
circumstances exist that could lead to the conclusion 
that the carrying value of such assets is not supportable.
Impairment testing on goodwill is carried out in accordance
with the analyses described in note 9. Such calculations
require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors
and long term growth prevalent in a particular market as well
as short and medium term business plans. The directors 
draw upon experience as well as external resources in 
making these judgements.
In assessing impairment of intangible assets and property,
plant & equipment, discounted cash flow methods are 
used as described in note 1.10. Judgement is required in
determining the appropriate discount factors as well as the
short and medium term business plans. As for goodwill, the
directors draw upon experience and external resources in
making these judgements.
Share-based payments
The charge for share-based payments is calculated by
estimating the fair value of the award at the date of grant
using either the binomial option pricing model or the Monte
Carlo simulation. The option valuation models used require
highly subjective assumptions to be made including the future
volatility of the Company’s share price, expected dividend
yields, risk-free interest rates and expected staff turnover. 
The directors draw upon a variety of external sources to aid 
in the determination of the appropriate data to use in such
calculations.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The surplus or deficit in defined benefit schemes that is
recognised through the statement of recognised income 
and expense is subject to a number of assumptions and
uncertainties. The calculated liabilities of the scheme are
based on assumptions regarding salary increases, inflation
rates, discount rates, the long term expected return on the
scheme’s assets and member longevity. Such assumptions
are based on actuarial advice and are benchmarked against
similar pension schemes.
Taxation
Tax laws that apply to the Group’s businesses may be
amended by the relevant authorities, for example as a result 
of changes in fiscal circumstances or priorities. Such potential
amendments and their application to the Group are regularly
monitored and the requirement for recognition of any liabilities
assessed where necessary. The Group is subject to income
taxes in a number of different jurisdictions and judgement 
is required in determining the appropriate provision for
transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
In such circumstances, the Group recognises liabilities for
anticipated taxes due based on best information available 
and where the anticipated liability is probable and estimable.
Where the final outcome of such matters differs from the
amounts initially recorded, any differences will impact the
income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period to which
such determination is made. Where the potential liabilities are
not considered probable, the amount at risk is disclosed
unless an adverse outcome is considered remote.
Deferred tax is recognised on taxable losses based on 
the expected ability to utilise such losses. This ability takes
account of the business plans for the relevant companies,
potential uncertainties around the longer term aspects of
these business plans, any expiry of taxable benefits and
potential future volatility in the local tax regimes.

1.20 New accounting standards and interpretations
During the period, the following new standards, and
amendments to existing standards, which are applicable 
to the Group were published, but do not become effective
until future accounting periods.
The following are effective for the financial year ending 
1 May 2010:
■ IAS 1 ‘Revised Presentation of Financial Statements’. 
This revises the presentation of non-owner changes 
in equity and introduces a statement of comprehensive
income. It is not expected to have an impact on the 
net results, net assets or disclosures of the Group;
■ IAS 23 ‘Revised Borrowing Costs’. This removes the option
of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs
that relate to assets that take a substantial time to prepare
for use. It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs as
part of the costs of such assets. It is not expected that this
will have a material impact on the net results or net assets
of the Group; and
■ Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments: Vesting
Conditions and Cancellations’. This restricts the definition 
of vesting conditions to include service and performance
conditions only. All other features are not vesting conditions
and must be reflected in the grant date fair value. It specifies
that all cancellations should receive the same accounting
treatment. This is expected to impact the accounting for
Save As You Earn (SAYE) share plans, for example. It is
effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of this
amendment on the Group’s net results and net assets.
The following is effective for the financial year ending 
30 April 2011:
■ IFRS 3 ‘Revised Business Combinations’ and IAS 27
‘Revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’.
IFRS 3 Revised introduces a number of changes in the
accounting for business combinations that will impact 
the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results 
in the period that an acquisition occurs and the future
reported results. IAS 27 Revised requires that a change 
in the ownership interest of a subsidiary is accounted for 
as an equity transaction. These changes must be applied
prospectively and will affect future acquisitions and
transactions with minority interests. The revised standards
are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. 
It is not expected that this will have a material impact on 
the net results or net assets of the Group, however, it may
impact acquisitions in the future.
Certain other amendments to existing standards and
interpretations were issued during the period which either 
do not apply to the Group or are not expected to have any
material effect.
2 Segmental analysis
The Group’s operating segments have been determined
based on the information reported to the Board. This
information is predominantly based on geographical areas
which are either managed separately or have similar trading
characteristics such that they can be aggregated together into
one segment and in the case of e-commerce, as a business
area with geographical territories aggregated. Accounting
policies for each operating segment are the same as those 
for the Group as described in note 1. The Group evaluates
each operating segment based on underlying operating 
profits which excludes those items described in note 1.1.
On 18 May 2009 the Group disposed of its operations in
Hungary to EW Electro Retail Limited for consideration of 
€1 and, accordingly, has classified its assets and liabilities 
as held for sale owing to the sale being highly probable 
under the definitions stipulated in IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’. As a result of 
the sale, the business has been classified as discontinued 
and the prior periods have been re-presented on a consistent
basis. Hungary was previously shown within the Other
International division.
All segments are involved in the multi-channel sale of high
technology consumer electronics, personal computers,
domestic appliances, photographic equipment, communication
products and related financial and after-sales services. The
principal categories of customer are retail, business to
business and online.
The Group’s reportable segments have been identified as 
UK & Ireland, Nordics, Other International and e-commerce.
■ the UK & Ireland division comprises UK & Ireland Electricals
(which consists of Currys, Currys.digital, Dixons Travel and
the Irish business) and UK Computing (which consists of 
PC World and DSGi Business), both of which are engaged
predominantly in retail sales with the latter also engaging 
in business to business sales of computer hardware and
software, associated peripherals and services and related
financial and after-sales services;
■ the Nordics division comprises the Elkjøp Group which
operates in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Iceland,
Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The Nordics division
engages predominantly in retail sales;
■ the Other International division comprises operations in
Central and Southern Europe. Central Europe comprises
Electro World, operating in the Czech Republic, Poland and
Slovakia whilst Southern Europe operates in Italy, Greece,
Spain and Turkey. The Other International division engages
predominantly in retail sales; and
■ the e-commerce division, primarily comprising PIXmania
and Dixons.co.uk, is engaged in online retail sales and
operates in all of the countries in which the other divisions
operate and across Europe.
74 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 Businesses to be closed comprise Markantalo and PC City Sweden whereby their closures were announced on 31 March 2009
and 23 March 2009, respectively. Owing to their closure rather than disposal, these operations do not meet the definition of
discontinued operations as stipulated by IFRS 5. Their results have been shown as businesses to be closed and prior year
comparatives have been re-presented on a consistent basis. Both businesses were previously shown within underlying results 
as part of the Nordics division.

The Italian business impairment credit relates to the reversal of charges incurred in prior periods whereby either liabilities 
have settled at lower amounts than those originally provided or in respect of properties which the Group has been able 
to exit earlier than previously expected.
Other business impairments comprise businesses in the Nordics, Spain and Poland as well as stores in underperforming locations
in the UK High Street. Goodwill impairment relates to the full write off of Markantalo in Finland following the announcement of
the closure of this business. Other asset impairments comprise the brand name associated with Markantalo, other intangible
assets, property, plant & equipment and inventory. Such impairments relate to assets in individual underperforming businesses
whereby either the whole business is to be closed or which result from impairment reviews of certain businesses whereby
either individual stores have been deemed impaired or are to be closed. Property charges comprise onerous lease costs 
and charges related to vacating properties. Property credits relate to onerous provisions set up in prior periods where such
provisions have been determined to be no longer required. Other charges relate predominantly to employee severance.
(iv) Other items relate to releases of unutilised provisions and settlement income received for claims for damages incurred following
the Buncefield explosion in December 2005 and for which exceptional charges were incurred in the 2005/06 financial year.
(v) Profit on sale of investments: For 2007/08, related to the sale of a small minority shareholding which had been held at £nil 
in the balance sheet.
(vi) Net fair value remeasurement gains and losses on revaluation of financial instruments: Items excluded from underlying
finance income and expense represent the gains and losses arising from the revaluation of derivative financial instruments
under methodologies stipulated by IAS 39 compared with those on an accruals basis (the basis upon which all other items 
in the financial statements is prepared). Also included within this amount are remeasurement losses relating to put options
predominantly held by minority shareholders. Such a treatment is a form of revaluation gain or loss created by an assumption
that the derivatives will be settled before their maturity.
Such gains and losses are unrealised and in the directors’ view also conflict with both the commercial reasons for entering
into such arrangements as well as Group Treasury policy whereby early settlement in the majority of cases would amount 
to speculative use of derivatives.
(vii) As announced on 27 February 2009, the Group has been in dispute with HMRC regarding settlement of certain intra-group
trading arrangements in the years 1997 to 2005 as well as certain other matters. The Group reached an agreement in principle
with HMRC regarding the settlement which was subsequently confirmed on 4 June 2009. The settlement amount exceeded
the provision already held in the balance sheet and as a result a non-underlying income tax charge of £52.7 million has been
recorded. The key elements of the agreement are such that a small proportion of the liability is not currently payable and 
the remainder has been offset against the income tax receivable which the Group held on its balance sheet such that no
cash payment has been made in respect of this offset. The amount has been treated as non-underlying owing to its one-off
non-recurring nature.

As announced on 27 February 2009, the Group has been in dispute with HMRC regarding settlement of certain historical intra-
group trading arrangements in the years 1997 to 2005 as well as certain other matters. The Group reached an agreement in
principle with HMRC regarding the settlement which was subsequently confirmed on 4 June 2009. The settlement amount exceeded
the provision already held in the balance sheet and therefore a non-underlying income tax charge of £52.7 million has been
recorded in current tax. This charge is in addition to the tax effects applied to the net non-underlying charges before tax
described in note 4 and has been treated as non-underlying owing to its one-off non-recurring nature.

The effective tax rate on underlying earnings of 68% (2007/08 30%) is expected to fall in future periods due mainly to unrecognised
losses starting to form a lower proportion of net profits / (losses). The Group has total unrecognised deferred tax assets relating
to tax losses of £96.3 million (2007/08 £57.1 million), of which £8.8 million (2007/08 £13.9 million) have no time restriction over
when they can be utilised. The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to time restricted tax losses of £87.5 million
(2007/08 £43.2 million) for which the weighted average period over which they can be utilised is five years (2007/08 six years).
In the 53 weeks ended 3 May 2008 the effect on the income statement of changes in tax rates resulted in an adjustment to
deferred tax asset carrying values of £6.2 million which predominantly related to the UK and Italy.

The recognition of trading losses carried forward is considered supportable due to the ability to offset losses against future profits.
The Group has provided deferred tax of £0.8 million (2007/08 £0.4 million) in relation to temporary differences associated with
investments in subsidiaries and the income tax consequences of paying dividends. In all other cases, the Group has determined
that the undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. The deferred tax which has not
been recognised for the taxes which would be payable on the undistributed earnings of the Group’s investment in subsidiaries 
is £27.8 million (2007/08 £27.3 million).
As a result of share disposals, allowable losses have been incurred which are available for offset against certain future chargeable
gains. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as it is considered that there is insufficient evidence
that chargeable gains will arise. The deferred tax asset not recognised, measured at the standard rate of 28%, is not less than
£352.0 million (2007/08 £351.3 million). Where applicable, certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset for financial
reporting purposes.

Additions in the period relate mainly to the exercise of a put option held by a minority shareholder in Kotsovolos as described
further in note 23 and which resulted in a further 10% of Kotsovolos being acquired.
As required by IFRS 3, goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews. These reviews are carried out using the following criteria.
An amount of goodwill is attributed to each specific acquisition. Such acquisitions are determined to be a cash generating unit
(CGU) as determined by IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on calculating
its value in use. The value in use is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to management’s own projections
covering a five year period. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate equivalent to
the relevant market’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The value in use is compared to the carrying amount in order to determine
whether impairment has occurred.
The impairment charge in the current year relates to Markantalo (2007/08 predominantly UniEuro and Markantalo) and arises 
as a result of the closure of this business which was announced on 31 March 2009.
The most significant components of goodwill relate to Elkjøp Nordic AS (Elkjøp), UniEuro S.p.A. (UniEuro) and PIXmania S.A.S.
(PIXmania, formerly FotoVista S.A.S.). In addition to management’s five year projections, the key assumptions used in calculating
value in use as well as the carrying values are:
2009 2008
Key assumptions for 2009 Key assumptions for 2008
Growth rate Pre-tax risk Carrying Growth rate Pre-tax risk Carrying
beyond adjusted value beyond adjusted value
five years discount rate £million five years discount rate £million
Elkjøp 3.0% 11.0% 610.8 2.5% 11.4% 585.5
UniEuro 1.2% 12.3% 147.3 1.2% 12.7% 129.0
PIXmania 2.1% 13.2% 185.6 2.3% 13.7% 162.5
The growth rate beyond five years is based on GDP for the territories in which these businesses operate.
The discount rates applied to cash flows are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital with a risk premium
reflecting the relative risks in the markets in which the businesses operate.
The five year projections, which have been approved by management, have been prepared using strategic plans which incorporate the
relative performance of competitors and knowledge of the current market together with management’s views on the future achievable
growth in market share, impact of the Renewal and Transformation plan and profitability over the longer term. In forming these views,
management draws on past experience as a measure to forecast future performance. Key assumptions used in determining the
forecasts comprise sales, costs and margins. Historical amounts for both the businesses under impairment review as well as from
other parts of the Group are used to generate the values attributed to these assumptions. Achievable growth in market share takes
into account the anticipated success of store offerings versus competitors as well as internal and external competitor intelligence.
Sensitivities
A sensitivity analysis had been performed on the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill. The directors have
concluded that in the case of Elkjøp there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying
amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use. In the case of UniEuro and PIXmania, it is reasonably possible that a change in 
key assumptions could occur over the course of the next financial period.

UniEuro
In respect of management’s five year projections, a decrease of 5% in the compound annual growth rate in pre-tax profits over
this five year period would cause the current headroom of £5.6 million to erode by £2.3 million.
A decrease in the growth rate beyond five years of 0.1% and an increase in the pre-tax adjusted discount rate of 0.1% would
cause the headroom to erode by £1.5 million and £2.1 million, respectively.
PIXmania
In respect of management’s five year projections, a 1% decrease in compound annual growth rate in pre-tax profits over this 
five year period would cause the current headroom of £46.7 million to erode by £7.5 million.
A decrease in the growth rate beyond five years of 0.1% and an increase in the pre-tax adjusted discount rate of 0.1% would
cause the headroom to erode by £2.1 million and £3.3 million, respectively.

Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. The weighted average effective interest rate on bank overdrafts approximates 3.7%
(3 May 2008 5.0%).
Current borrowings include £250 million (3 May 2008 £nil million) which has been drawn down under the £400 million sterling
committed facility (the Facility) at a weighted average effective yield of 4.88%. These borrowings have an average maturity of 
62 days and are eligible for renewal under the terms of the Facility. The Facility has a maturity date of October 2011.
On 30 April 2009, the terms of the Facility were revised such that interest margin was increased, additional guarantees are required
to be given by certain subsidiaries within the Group, the financial covenants were amended, and a new capital expenditure
covenant added. In addition, mandatory prepayment events, representations, other financial covenants, events of default and
conditions on the payment of dividends have also been included. Interest on drawn amounts from this date is payable at LIBOR
plus a margin of 3.75%. The commitment fee on undrawn amounts is 1.875%. A utilisation fee of 0.5% is payable on drawings
greater than £200 million but less than £300 million and a rate of 1.5% on drawings greater than £300 million. At 2 May 2009
and 3 May 2008 the available undrawn amount of the Facility, which expires after more than one year but no more than five
years, was £150.0 million and £400 million, respectively.
In the 53 weeks ending 3 May 2008, other borrowings included bank loans, which had a weighted average effective yield 
of 1.94% and an average maturity of 0.5 years.
The carrying amount of current borrowings and overdrafts approximates their fair value.
The 6.125% Guaranteed Bonds 2012 (the Bonds) are denominated in sterling with a nominal value of £300 million, paying
interest annually, are unsecured, are guaranteed by DSG Retail Limited, a subsidiary undertaking, and are listed on the London
Stock Exchange. Unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled they will be redeemed at par on 15 November 2012.
The Bonds may be redeemed in whole or in part at their principal amount plus accrued interest by DSG international plc by
providing 30 to 60 days’ notice to the bondholder. The Bonds may also be purchased in the open market by any company
within the Group. In either circumstance, the Bonds and any unmatured coupons will be cancelled and may not be re-issued 
or re-sold. The value of the Bonds excludes accrued interest of £8.4 million (3 May 2008 £8.6 million), included in trade and
other payables. Further details of the Bonds are included in note 22.

The majority of finance leases relate to properties in the UK where obligations are denominated in sterling and lease terms vary
between 16 and 27 years. The effective borrowing rate on individual leases ranged between 5.61% and 8.34% (3 May 2008
between 5.61% and 8.34%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no
arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The total value of minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases at 2 May 2009 
was £0.8 million (3 May 2008 £0.8 million).
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.

The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are held in a separate
trustee administered fund. The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed
in accordance with the actuary’s advice so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants. Membership of the
defined contribution section is offered to eligible employees.
In the Nordic region, the Group operates two funded secured defined benefit pension schemes with assets held by a life
insurance company as well as an unsecured pension arrangement. In addition, contributions are made to a state pension
scheme. The net movement in the obligation comprises a charge to operating profit of £0.9 million (2007/08 £0.8 million) 
with the remaining movements relating to the benefits paid in the period, actuarial gains / (losses) and currency retranslation.
In other territories, the Group also provides other post-employment benefits which are largely governed by statute, in particular
in Italy and Greece. These benefits are unfunded.
(a) Defined contribution pension schemes
The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes was £5.4 million (2007/08 £5.1 million).
94 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 (b) UK defined benefit pension scheme – actuarial valuation and assumptions
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was last carried out as at 5 April 2007 using the projected unit method and has been
used to determine the level of funding to the scheme. The Group’s contribution rate for the period ended 2 May 2009, agreed 
in consultation with the trustees’ actuaries, was 12.5% per annum of pensionable salaries (2007/08 12.6%) with the reduction
representing a change in the mix of contributions between different sections of the scheme. The contribution rate for future
periods is currently planned to remain at this level, however a ‘recovery plan’ has been agreed with the trustee whereby the
Company makes twice yearly contributions of £6.0 million which commenced in June 2008 and end in December 2012. Since
April 2007, the scheme has operated on a career average revalued earnings arrangement where benefits are earned for each
year of pensionable service as opposed to being calculated with reference to salary near to date of retirement.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 5 April 2007 used for determining costs and contributions were:
Rate per annum
Discount rate for accrued benefits – pre retirement 6.6%
– post-retirement 5.2%
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries – up to April 2010 3.5%
– thereafter 4.5%
Rate of increase to pensions – Guaranteed Minimum Pension 3.0%
– pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.5-3.75%
Inflation 3.0%
Expected return on assets 6.5%
At 5 April 2007, the market value of the scheme’s investments was £688 million and, based on the above assumptions, the
value of the assets was sufficient to cover 92% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases
in earnings. The value of liabilities exceeded assets by £61.0 million.
(c) UK defined benefit pension scheme – IAS 19
The following summarises the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement, the funded
status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet. The methodologies set out in IAS 19 are different from those
used by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
(i) Principal assumptions adopted
2009 2008
Rates per annum
Discount rate 6.7% 6.5%
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries – up to April 2010 3.8% 4.1%
– thereafter 4.3% 5.1%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment / deferred pensions 3.3% 3.6%
Inflation 3.3% 3.6%
The Group uses certain demographic assumptions when calculating scheme obligations which are those underlying the 
last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 5 April 2007. In particular, post-retirement mortality has been assumed to
follow the standard tables PA92 projected to calendar year 2008 in line with the ‘medium cohort’ factors set out in CMI working
paper 1: ‘interim basis for adjusting the “92” series mortality projections for cohort effects’, with an allowance for future mortality
improvement in line with medium cohort projection factors. Such tables represent an average expected longevity of 87 years 
for men and 89.9 years for women (3 May 2008 85.2 years for men and 88.3 years for women) for those becoming 65 at the
measurement date and an extra one year of longevity for both men and women becoming 65 in 15 years’ time.

Excluding contributions relating to the recovery plan described in (b) above, the Group expects to make regular contributions 
of £8.0 million to its UK defined benefit pension scheme in 2009/10.

The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined based on the market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date,
applicable to the period over which the obligation is to be settled. Actual return on UK defined benefit pension plan assets 
was a loss of £148.3 million (2007/08 gain of £6.5 million). The actual return on other post-employment benefit scheme assets
was not significant.

(d) Sensitivities
The value of the UK defined benefit pension scheme assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values. Changes
in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and liabilities may have a material impact on the 2009/10 income
statement and the balance sheet. The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality
rate. The following table provides an estimate of the potential impacts of each of these variables.

*The increase in scheme benefits provided to members on retirement is subject to an inflation cap.
(e) Other post-employment benefits – IAS 19
The Group offers other post-employment benefits to employees in overseas locations. At 2 May 2009 the net obligation in
relation to these benefits was £12.3 million (3 May 2008 £12.4 million). The net movement in the obligation comprises a charge
to operating profit of £4.7 million (3 May 2008 £4.0 million) with the remaining movements relating to the benefits paid in the
period and currency retranslation.

(a) Financial risk management objectives and policies
A statement of the financial risk management objectives and policies is contained in the Strategic Summary section of the
Directors’ Report under the sub-section entitled ‘Treasury risks and policies’ and forms part of these financial statements.
(b) Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
For receivables and payables classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, fair value is estimated to 
be equivalent to book value. These values are shown in notes 14 and 19, respectively. The categories of financial assets and
liabilities and their related accounting policy are set out in notes 1.11 and 1.15.
For those financial assets and liabilities which bear either a floating rate of interest or no interest, fair value is estimated to be
equivalent to book value. These values are shown in note 22(d).
The fair value of the Bonds is £216.1 million (3 May 2008 £262.9 million). The Bonds are carried at amortised cost, plus a fair
value adjustment, as a result of the fair value hedge discussed below. Excluded from the fair value is £8.4 million (3 May 2008
£8.6 million) of accrued interest which is included in trade and other payables.

Included in derivative financial instruments are forward foreign currency contracts, options, interest rate swaps and currency swaps.
The Group’s interest rate swaps have a nominal value of £300 million, receive fixed interest rates of 6.125% (2007/08 6.125%)
and pay floating rates of LIBOR plus a margin which ranged from 3.04% to 7.13% (2007/08 6.52% to 7.37%). Currency swaps
with a nominal value of £250 million receive LIBOR plus a margin and pay EURIBOR plus a margin. The sterling floating rates
ranged from 3.04% to 6.82% in the year (2007/08 6.52% to 7.37%) and the euro floating rates ranged from 3.03% to 6.63%
(2007/08 4.89% to 6.24%). Other swaps exchanged Norwegian krone and sterling at fixed interest rates of 5.06% and 5.67%
(2007/08 3.46% and 5.99%).
(c) Hedging activities
The Group manages exposures that arise on purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies by entering predominantly
into forward foreign exchange currency contracts. It also uses swaps and options to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange
translation exposure. The Group designates financial instruments as hedges under IAS 39 as follows:
Cash flow hedges
At 2 May 2009 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts in place with a notional value of £72.7 million (3 May 2008
£351.5 million) that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges. These contracts are expected to cover exposures ranging
from one month to one year. The fair value of these currency derivatives, which have been deferred in equity amounts to a 
£0.2 million gain (2007/08 £1.5 million loss). In respect of contracts which matured during the period, gains of £27.4 million 
and gains of £13.4 million have been transferred out of equity into inventory and out of equity into operating profit, respectively
(2007/08 gains of £11.5 million and losses of £6.4 million, respectively).
Hedge ineffectiveness of £3.0 million gain was recorded in the income statement (2007/08 £nil).
Fair value hedges
At 2 May 2009 and 3 May 2008 the Group had interest rate swaps in place for the 6.125% Guaranteed Bonds with a notional
amount of £300 million whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 6.125%. Of this, £250 million (€390 million notional value) has
been swapped into floating rate euro borrowings bearing interest based on EURIBOR and the remaining £50 million into floating
rate borrowings bearing interest based on LIBOR. The swaps are used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of 
the Bonds and have the same critical terms. The fair value of interest rate swaps entered into as fair value hedges is an asset 
of £30.3 million (3 May 2008 a liability of £0.1 million).
A fair value loss on the interest rate swaps of £28.0 million (2007/08 loss of £5.6 million) has been recognised in the income
statement and offset by an equivalent fair value gain on the Bonds.
98 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 Hedge of net investments in foreign operations
At 2 May 2009 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps in place with a notional value of
£374.0 million (3 May 2008 £858.1 million) which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in foreign operations.
Gains and losses on the retranslation of these derivatives are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of
the net investments in the foreign operations. The fair value of currency derivatives entered into as net investment hedges is a
£128.1 million loss (2007/08 £104.9 million loss).
No hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement (2007/08 £nil).
(d) Interest rate profile of financial assets and financial liabilities by currency
The following table sets out the interest rate exposure of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group. The financial instruments
not included in the table are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on financial
instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Fixed rate cash and short term investments are predominantly money market deposits (as shown in note 16).
Floating rate borrowings include fixed rate bonds after taking into account the effect of interest rates swaps entered into 
by the Group. Bonds with a nominal value of £50 million bear interest at rates based on LIBOR. Bonds with a nominal value 
of £250 million (€390 million) bear interest at rates based on EURIBOR. The latter provide a hedge against certain euro
denominated fixed asset investments and to finance working capital. The other major component of floating rate borrowings 
are drawings under the £400 million sterling committed facility (as shown in note 17).
Amounts in respect of other currencies for cash and cash equivalents and short term investments relate to funds held within
subsidiary companies, operating in the Nordic region and Central Europe. The negative balance as at 2 May 2009 has arisen 
in a multi-currency pooled facility and is offset by positive euro balances.

(e) Sensitivity analysis
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to changes in specified market
variables on monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments as listed below. As a consequence, the sensitivity
reflects the position as at 2 May 2009 and 3 May 2008 and is not necessarily representative of actual or future outcomes.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Group’s profit before tax due to changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities 
and derivative financial instruments. Changes in exchange rates affect the Group’s total equity due to changes in the fair value 
of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. The table below shows the Group’s sensitivity to 
a reasonably possible change in the Group’s key currencies of US dollar and euro, with other variables held constant. A 10%
decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.

Effect on underlying Effect on underlying

£million £million £million £million
Change in exchange rates:
US dollar + 10% (0.2) 3.8 0.4 14.8
Euro + 10% (2.1) (37.5) (1.2) (41.5)
Changes in interest rates affect the Group’s profit before tax, mainly due to the impact of floating rate borrowings, cash and
derivative financial instruments. The Group’s principal floating rate interest rate exposures are based on LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The table below shows the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates (uniform across all currencies), with other
variables held constant. A 1% increase in interest rates would decrease profit before tax by £7.2 million and have £nil impact on
equity (2007/08 a £1.8 million decrease in profit before tax and a £0.5 million increase in equity). A 1% decrease would have an
equal and opposite effect. 
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
■ the balance of borrowings, investments and the derivative portfolio are all held constant for the whole year;
■ all net investment, fair value and cash flow hedges are assumed to be highly effective;
■ the effect of changes in interest rates on fixed rate bonds is calculated after taking into account the effect of interest rate
swaps. In combination these financial instruments are floating in nature;
■ changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges arising from movements in
interest rates are recorded in the income statement. The impact of movements in exchange rates is recorded directly in equity; and
■ changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments that are not in hedging relationships arising from movements 
in interest rates and exchange rates only affect the income statement to the extent that they are not offset by changes in an
underlying transaction.

Over the course of 2008/09, the current difficult consumer and retail environment has placed significant pressure on the 
Group’s revenue, profits, cash flows and overall liquidity. This, together with the cost of restructuring the Group, higher finance
costs and pressures on working capital due to structural changes to the credit environment, has contributed to an increase 
in the Group’s indebtedness. The continued uncertainty over the economic outlook has made it necessary for the Group 
to take steps to improve the capital structure of the Group to sustain the business through the current economic cycle. For 
these reasons, on 30 April 2009 and as described in note 35, the Group announced a Placing and Rights Issue to raise gross
proceeds of £310.6 million as well as agreeing with its lending banks to amend terms of the Facility and Letter of Credit Facility
Agreements. The key elements of the revised terms of the Facility are described further in note 17. The Placing and Rights Issue
completed on 9 June 2009 and its proceeds have significantly improved the Group’s liquidity position since 2 May 2009. In
conjunction with applying the Group’s policies in relation to liquidity risk as referred to in note 22(a) the directors believe that
these amendments will provide it with significant covenant and liquidity headroom under these facilities for the foreseeable future.
Included in note 17 are details of committed facilities, which are also maintained and used if available on advantageous terms.
(g) Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is discussed in the Directors’ Report.

form of introducing a new parent company above the existing Group and the merger reserve represents the difference between
the capital structure of the new parent company and that of the former parent company.

25 Employee share ownership trusts
Halifax EES Trustees International Limited is the trustee of a number of employee share ownership trusts (the Trusts). At 2 May
2009, the Trusts held shares in the Company for the purposes of satisfying potential awards to specified executive directors and
senior employees under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Retention and Recruitment Plan
(Reward Shares). Details of the LTIP and PSP are given in the Remuneration Report in section (b) (ii) and for the Reward Shares
in section (b) (iii). Movements in the number of shares held by the Trusts is shown in the table below.
The Company’s aim is to hedge its obligations under the above plans by buying shares through the Trusts to meet the anticipated
future liability. The anticipated liability is regularly reassessed during the relevant performance period and additional shares are
purchased when required to meet an increase in this liability. The costs of funding and administering the Trusts are charged to
the income statement in the period to which they relate. Shareholders’ funds are reduced by the net book value of shares held 
in the Trusts which have not vested unconditionally.

Share option plans
Employee Share Option Scheme (ESOS) and Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP)
Options are normally granted annually to executive directors and other senior executives. The ESOS and ESOP permit making
awards with a market value on the date of grant of not more than twice the recipient’s salary. Options are also granted to other
employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade. Vesting of options is based upon remaining in service with
the Group over a three year period subject to certain conditions for Good Leavers. Depending on grade, vesting is also dependent
on the level of growth in underlying diluted earnings per share (EPS) over a three year period, with the ability to exercise the
options up to seven years after the vesting date.
Save As You Earn (SAYE)
The Group offers to all of its UK and Irish employees having completed the relevant period of service, share-based savings 
plans whereby amounts may be contributed up to a specified limit per plan and per employee. Three year and five year plans
have been offered annually, with exercise prices set at a 20% discount to the market share price on the date of grant. Exercise 
is conditional upon employees remaining employed by the Group for the full term of the plan subject to certain conditions for
Good Leavers as described in the Remuneration Report in section (b) (ii). Employees can choose to withdraw their contributions
in full from the plan at any time, together with any interest earned.

The fair value of equity settled share option plans and cash settled share-based payments (described in (ii) below) granted is
estimated as at the date of grant using the binomial or Black Scholes option pricing models taking into account the terms and
conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the periods
ended 2 May 2009 and 3 May 2008 based on information prevailing at the date of grant.

Weighted average share price £0.39 £0.93
The expected remaining life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of the actual exercise
patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends.
Actual outcome may differ from this assumption.
Other equity settled share plans
Executive directors’ and senior executives’ LTIP , PSP and Reward shares
LTIP and PSP shares are provisionally awarded to executive directors, members of the Executive Committee and other
participating senior executives and are based upon performance measured in terms of the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
achieved by the Company. Prior to 2008/09, TSR performance was based on performance over a three year period relative to
the companies comprising the FTSE 100 Index. From 2008/09, TSR performance has been based on a bespoke weighted index
comprising UK and European retailers. Reward shares were granted to a limited number of executives in July 2008 and do not
have any performance conditions.

Further information concerning share-based incentive plans specific to directors is included in the Remuneration Report in

(ii) Cash settled
Awards are granted to employees annually on the basis of a monetary amount determined by grade and length of service.
Employees must remain in employment until the vesting date which occurs on the third anniversary of the date of grant subject
to certain conditions for Good Leavers as described in the Remuneration Report in section (b) (ii). The vesting of such share-based
payments for employees above a certain grade is determined based on the level of growth in EPS over a three year period. Such
awards are settled in cash which is calculated based on the share price at the exercise date. The fair value of cash settled share-
based payment plans is estimated as at the date of grant using the binomial option pricing model taking into account the terms
and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. No cash settled awards had vested at 2 May 2009 (3 May 2008 none).

The Norwegian tax authorities have issued an assessment for the years 2002 to 2006 against certain Norwegian companies 
in the Group for VAT on third party insurance and credit services sold to customers whereby the Group’s Norwegian companies
acted as an intermediary. The Group is contesting the assessment on several grounds and intends to proceed with court action
if the decision from the Norwegian tax authorities is adverse. In accordance with Norwegian regulations, in order to contest the
assessment, the Group has been required to make a full prepayment for the amount in question and accordingly has recorded 
a receivable on its balance sheet of £11.7 million. The Group has obtained independent external expert advice concerning the
assessment and based on this advice believes that it has a strong likelihood of succeeding. It is therefore considered recoverable.

To the members of DSG international plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements

which comprise the parent company balance sheet and the
related notes (a) to (n). The financial reporting framework that
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP)).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with sections 495, 496 and 497 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters
we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent
company financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
the parent company financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the
Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial
statements.
Opinions

prepared is consistent with the parent company financial
statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report upon in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if in our opinion:

112 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 Notes to the Parent Company
Financial Statements
(a) Accounting policies
The unconsolidated financial statements for the Company have
been prepared in accordance with UK law and applicable UK
GAAP accounting standards and on a going concern basis 
as described on page 44. Accounting policies have been
consistently applied throughout the current and preceding
periods. The principal accounting policies are set out below:
(i) Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost
convention as modified by the revaluation of certain derivative
financial instruments to fair value.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and has not disclosed
information required by that standard, as the consolidated
financial statements for DSG international plc, in which the
Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the
Group under IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.
(ii) Change in presentation of financial information
FRS 8 (Amended) provides an exemption for disclosures 
of transactions between two or more members of a group,
provided that all subsidiaries which are party to the transaction
are wholly-owned by the DSG international plc Group. Previously
an exemption was available for 90% owned subsidiaries.
(iii) Operating leases
Rentals payable under property leases are charged to the
profit and loss account in equal instalments up to each market
rent review date throughout the lease term. Rentals payable
under leases for plant and machinery are charged to the profit
and loss account in equal instalments over the total lease term.
(iv) Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments 
to certain employees which are measured at fair value at the
date of grant. This fair value is expensed in the profit and loss
account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based
on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually
vest as adjusted for any non-market conditions.
A liability equal to the portion of services received from
employees is recognised at the current fair value determined at
each balance sheet date for cash settled share-based payments.
Where the Company has granted rights to its equity to
employees of subsidiary undertakings in relation to equity
settled share-based payment arrangements the contribution
to the subsidiary undertakings is recognised as an additional
investment.
(v) Translation of foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange ruling at
the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses arising 
on settlement or retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities
are included in the profit and loss account.
(vi) Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment
or estimated loss on disposal. Depreciation is provided to
write off the cost of the assets by equal instalments over their
estimated useful lives. The rates used are:
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – between 10% and 33% 
per annum.
(vii) Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost, less any
provision for impairment in value.
(viii) Taxation
Current taxation
Current taxation is the expected tax payable on the taxable
income for the period, using prevailing tax rates and adjusted
for any tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided for in full on all timing differences
which have not reversed at the balance sheet date. No
provision is made for tax which would become payable on 
the distribution of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries 
or associated undertakings, unless the distribution of such
earnings has been accrued in the balance sheet. Deferred 
tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are
regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
(ix) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recorded at the consideration received
less directly attributable transaction costs.
Transaction costs are amortised through the profit and loss
account using the effective interest method and the unamortised
balance is included as part of the related borrowing at the
balance sheet date. A fair value adjustment is made to the
borrowing where hedge accounting has been applied.
(x) Post-retirement benefits
The expected cost of providing pensions under the defined
benefit pension scheme arrangements, as calculated
periodically by qualified actuaries, is charged to the profit 
and loss account so as to spread the pension cost over the
normal expected service lives of members in such a way that
the pension cost is a substantially level percentage of current
and expected future pensionable payroll.
It is not practical to allocate the underlying assets and liabilities
of the defined benefit section to individual companies, on a
consistent and reasonable basis. Therefore, following full
implementation of FRS 17, the Company has accounted for
its contributions to the defined benefit section of the scheme
as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The Company’s contributions to the defined contribution
section of the pension scheme are charged to the profit and
loss account on an accruals basis as they become payable.

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued
(a) Accounting policies continued
(xi) Derivative financial instruments (derivatives)
Derivatives are classified as current assets or liabilities when
they are deemed to be held for trading. Derivatives are
classified as non-current assets or liabilities where a hedge
relationship is identified and the remaining maturity of the
hedged item is greater than 12 months from the balance
sheet date.
Fair values are derived from market values. The fair value 
of financial instruments traded in active markets is based 
on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Hedge accounting
The Company’s activities expose it primarily to the financial
risks associated with changes in interest rates. The Company
uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate
swaps to hedge these risks. The Company does not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where hedge accounting is to be applied, the Company
formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to
which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and
the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking
the hedge.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer meets
the criteria for hedge accounting.
The accounting treatment of derivatives that qualify for hedge
accounting is dependent on how they are designated. The
designations and accounting treatments applicable to the
Company are explained below:
Fair value hedges
The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure
to changes in the fair value of recognised liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments that meet the ‘fair value’
hedging requirements are recognised in the balance sheet at
fair value with corresponding fair value movements recognised
within interest in the profit and loss account. For an effective
fair value hedge, the hedged item is adjusted for changes 
in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the
corresponding entry in the profit and loss account. To the
extent that the designated hedge relationship is fully effective,
the amounts in the profit and loss account offset each other.
As a result, only the ineffective element of any designated
hedging relationship impacts the profit and loss account. 
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting,
the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item for
which the effective interest method is used, is amortised to
the profit and loss account over the period to maturity.
(xii) Cash flow statement
As permitted by FRS 1 (Revised 1996) ‘Cash Flow Statements’,
the Company has not prepared a cash flow statement because
it has already produced a consolidated cash flow statement
which is publicly available.
114 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09

Details of directors’ remuneration, share interests, share options, pensions and other entitlements, which form part of these
financial statements, are given in the parts of the directors’ Remuneration Report which are described as having been audited.

Current borrowings comprise £250 million (3 May 2008 £nil) which has been drawn down under the £400 million sterling
committed facility (the Facility) at a weighted average effective yield of 4.88%. These borrowings have an average maturity of 
62 days and are eligible for renewal under the terms of the Facility. The Facility has a maturity date of October 2011.
On 30 April 2009, the terms of the Facility were revised such that interest margin was increased, additional guarantees are required
to be given by certain subsidiaries within the Group, the financial covenants were amended, and a new capital expenditure
covenant added. In addition, mandatory prepayment events, representations, other financial covenants, events of default and
conditions on the payment of dividends have also been included. Interest on drawn amounts from this date is payable at LIBOR
plus a margin of 3.75%. The commitment fee on undrawn amounts is 1.875%. A utilisation fee of 0.5% is payable on drawings
greater than £200 million but less than £300 million and a rate of 1.5% on drawings greater than £300 million. At 2 May 2009
and 3 May 2008 the available undrawn amount of the Facility, which expires after more than one year but no more than five
years, was £149.9 million and £400 million, respectively.

116 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09 (l) Post-retirement benefits
DSG international plc maintains a pension scheme for eligible employees in the UK comprising both a defined benefit and
defined contribution section. The defined benefit section is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered
fund. The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with
the advice of independent qualified actuaries so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
The last valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2007, using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level
of funding to the scheme.
The last actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section showed the value of assets to be sufficient to cover 92% of the benefits
accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. At 2 May 2009, the valuation of the defined benefit
section for the purposes of FRS 17 showed a gross pension deficit of £148.8 million (3 May 2008 £51.0 million). Further
particulars of the scheme are disclosed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, which although presented under 
IAS 19 ‘Employment Benefits’ show figures and disclosures equivalent to those applicable under FRS 17.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the pension scheme has been closed to new entrants. Membership 
of the defined contribution section is now offered to eligible employees.
(m) Related parties
The Company has applied the exemption allowed by FRS 8 (Amended) ‘Related Party Disclosures’ regarding disclosure of
transactions with other undertakings which are wholly-owned members of the DSG international plc Group. Material transactions,
entered into in the ordinary course of business, with members of the DSG international plc Group which are not wholly-owned
are disclosed below as well as the Group’s percentage holding.

Dividend mandate
If you wish your dividends to be paid directly into a bank or

post and ensures that your account is credited on the
dividend payment date.

Our Registrars are now able to convert dividends to certain
foreign currencies payable through the Bank of New York.

third parties on payment of a prescribed fee. This may result in

What we do
Caledonia’s strategy is to identify
opportunities through our extensive
network, to invest in signiﬁcant stakes 
for the long term and to involve ourselves
with the managements of investee
companies. We aim to be a long term
supportive shareholder with investments
in a number of businesses that we believe
will deliver shareholder value over the
medium to longer term. Our initial
investment commitments range typically
between £10m and £25m.
Our approach attracts a ﬂow of
investment opportunities not always
available to others. We back proven
management teams and look for
opportunities where our investment 
style and involvement will be welcome. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 03
Caledonia is a supportive
investor, working in partnership
with the management teams of
investee companies to assist in
maximising the potential of their
businesses. We usually have a
Caledonia executive on the
board of investee companies.
Involvement
with investee
management
teams
Caledonia holds a portfolio of
significant stakes in listed and
unlisted companies. We are
opportunistic, with investments
in a range of sectors and
territories. We usually seek
substantial minority stakes 
but will invest for a majority
holding if we believe this 
to be in the best interests 
of shareholders.
Invest in
signiﬁcant
stakes for the
longer term
Caledonia’s reputation, size and
extensive network gives us a flow
of investment opportunities. This
enables us to be highly selective in
the businesses that we back. We
use our experience and expertise
to analyse potential investments
and we will take particular care in
appraising the track record and
commitment of potential investee
management teams.

Results
Our third year as an investment trust
company has seen a continuation of the
strong growth shown in the first two. Our
total shareholder return over five and ten
years has outpaced our benchmark of the
FTSE All-Share Total Return index by 152% and
179% respectively and both these measures
show a further worthwhile advance on the
133% and 111% shown a year ago. We believe
that our long established investment strategy
of taking sizeable stakes, though usually
minority ones, in promising listed and
unlisted companies at sensible prices, and
working closely with proven managements 
to achieve their goals over a longer term,
differentiates us from most other investment
companies and has been a key contributor to
this good performance. 
Share price
Our share price during the year has risen
from £13.67 to £19.80, driven principally by
an increase in net assets per share of 34%,
but also helped by the further reduction 
in the discount of our share price to the
underlying net asset value per share. This
reduced over the year from 11% to 4% and
at times moved to a nil discount or very
small premium. Last year I cautioned that 
it would prove challenging to maintain a
continued reduction in this discount, which
Another 
successful 
year
had fallen during the previous year from
21% to 11%, but I am pleased that this 
has not been the case. Whilst narrower
discounts are not out of keeping with other
investment trusts with good track records,
the recent market volatility has seen our
discount widen again and is a salutary
reminder that our share price is not within
our control.
Dividend
For the thirty-ninth year in succession, we
are pleased to increase our annual dividend
by recommending a final dividend for the
year of 20.5 pence per share. This will bring
the total dividend for the year to 29.6 pence
representing an increase of 5% and costing
£18.8m.
Elective special dividend
In 2004, we paid an elective special 
dividend to help resolve shareholder issues
within The Cayzer Trust Company, our
largest shareholder, which were affecting
our stability and long term investment
approach. I am happy to say that these
matters are now fully behind us. In March
this year, we were pleased to announce
proposals for another elective special
dividend to celebrate a long period of 
good investment performance and to
enable shareholders, if they so choose,  Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 07
to participate in our resultant strong cash
position. The special dividend is intended to
distribute around £128m depending, inter
alia, on the level of take up and the value of
our net assets at the strike date. Payment is
scheduled on or about 13 July. The options
offered to shareholders are summarised on
page 19 of these financial statements and a
circular setting out the detailed terms of the
elective special dividend was posted to
shareholders on 31 May. 
Portfolio
The year under review has seen considerable
activity within our portfolio and highlights
are shown in the Chief Executive’s
statement and the pages following. Markets
moved strongly upwards during the year
which was good for realisations. These
totalled £307m, of which Paladin Resources,
the independent oil exploration company,
was our largest, yielding proceeds of
£108m. Higher market prices suggested 
a less favourable climate for making new
investments, but we have nevertheless
committed £155m to new and follow on
investments on sensible terms, with a
continuing healthy flow of proposals to
review. Since the end of the year, Kerzner
International has announced that it has
agreed to an offer from an investment
group led by its management to purchase
the company. This offer is expected to be
voted on by its shareholders by early July
and, if approved, will result in cash proceeds
for Caledonia of $237m, supplementing
earlier realisation proceeds of $159m.
Economic and political background
The recent market downturn has not come
as such a surprise to us for we had been
puzzled by the apparent strength of the 
UK and US economies following the very
significant rise in oil and commodity prices
and have recently been holding significant
levels of liquidity. Our instincts are to
remain cautious as there are signs of
inflation creeping in, which is leading to
higher interest rates. The US deficit remains
worryingly high and UK government
spending continues to rise with seemingly
little improvement from services delivered
and an almost daily dose of burdensome
and costly legislation to hinder our
efficiency in world markets. In particular, 
the imposition of draconian measures on
private sector pension funds through the
Pensions Regulator which, combined with
the earlier and mindless removal of the 
tax credit for pension funds, has wantonly
wrecked a jewel in this country’s essential
savings movements. The supreme irony 
of what amounts to an irresponsible
demolition of private sector pension
provision is the fact that the Government
has utterly failed to curb the excesses in
public sector pensions. This will inevitably
rebound in higher taxes to fund the
consequent financial black hole, which 
now exceeds the National Debt. Hopefully
the electorate of this country will wake 
up to the shortcomings of this Government
so devoid of competence or integrity, 
before more harm is done.
At the time of writing last year, we 
were on the eve of referenda in France and
Holland on the topic of the proposed new
European constitution. Thankfully they
returned a firm ‘Non’ but this gave a
welcome excuse to the Government in
Britain to duck the issue. Seemingly this
message from the people of Europe has
gone unheeded by the politicians who 
seem to be turning a blind eye to the
continued scheming for new constitutions
and legislation in Brussels to the ultimate
detriment of the economies across Europe.
We shall continue to pay some attention to
the economies of India and beyond, where
higher rates of growth seem more likely.
Staff
I would like to pay a fulsome tribute to all
our staff for their efforts throughout the
year on behalf of shareholders. They do
battle with an ever growing jungle of
legislation much of which is of questionable
value. On the accounting front, the task 
of dealing with the new IFRS rules has 
been time consuming and expensive 
and the increasing requirements for more
detailed and ever lengthier reporting seem
to be losing the respect of many senior
professionals and running the danger that
shareholders will find it increasingly difficult
to identify the key issues. On the wider
front, the concept of responsibility is losing
out to the cult of blaming others and this
regrettably seems to be increasingly the
focus of the growing army of regulators 
who seek comfort from the number of
boxes ticked. All of this adds to the pressure
on our hard worked staff. I thank them all
for the tremendous contribution which 
they have made.
Outlook
We have been fortunate to enjoy a long 
run of good performance, but market 
highs have recently suffered an unsurprising
check. We are not immune from these
market downturns, but our long held
investment strategy described in my
opening paragraph is less susceptible to 
the market cycle. Therefore we believe that
our continuing strong deal flow, coupled
with our investment philosophy, will
continue to stand us in good stead.
Peter Buckley
Chairman 08 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006
Tim 
Ingram
Chief Executive’s
statement
Building on 
our competitive
advantage
2005/06 has again been a good year for
Caledonia’s shareholders, with NAV per
share increasing by 33.6% to 2061p per
share at 31 March 2006. This is 9.6% more
than the increase in the FTSE All-Share index
over the same period. The growth of NAV
per share compared to the FTSE All-Share
index over the years since we converted 
to investment trust status is shown in the
graph on page 9.
Investment activity
The last year has seen strong increases
generally in share prices across the globe.
This has inevitably meant that it has become
an easier market in which to achieve
realisations and it has become more difficult
to find new investments at an entry price
which we believe presents sufficient value
creation potential for our own shareholders:
however, our distinctive style does still
mean that we are continuing to find some
new opportunities at acceptable prices,
although recently this is tending more to 
be in the unquoted segment.
During the course of our financial year
our investment committee evaluated
around 125 potential new investment
opportunities. These were short listed down
to a more manageable number which were
then intensely evaluated, and from which
we made eight new investments for a total
amount of £70m. In addition, we invested 
a further £85m as follow-on funding in
existing investments, making a total of
£155m of investment during the year. 
More detail on investments is included in
table 3 on page 18. This includes a further
£34.5m invested in India (including the UK
listed India Capital Growth Fund) bringing
the total value of Indian investments to
around £48m at 31 March 2006.
We have again been actively and
constructively involved with all our investee
companies, which we believe continues to
aid our outperformance. It is our normal
policy for a Caledonia investment executive
to join the board of the investee company 
as a non-executive director and considerable
time is spent in working supportively 
with management to achieve long-term
shareholder value creation. During the 
year, we have had a Caledonia executive 
as a director on the board (or appropriate
committee) of 17 of our top 20 investments.
Whether we have representation on the
board or not, efforts are made to influence
constructively the operations and strategy 
of each investee company.
Although we are a long term investor,
we believe there comes a time when it is
appropriate for us to disinvest or partially
sell down from an investment. In addition,
there can be redemptions within funds in Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 09
which we have invested, which also give 
rise to capital flows back to Caledonia. 
With conditions in the last year having been
so favourable for realisations, full and partial
disinvestments totalled over £307m during
the year, which was significantly up on the
previous year’s figure of £218m. These
realisations are listed in table 4 on page 19.
As mentioned in the Chairman’s
statement, Kerzner International, the
resorts owner and operator in which we
have an 8% stake, is recommending to its
shareholders acceptance of a bid at $81 per
share by a management-led investor group.
If the offer is implemented, we will receive
$237m and have put in place forward
foreign exchange contracts to hedge this.
As a result of the above activity, our net
liquid funds increased to £180m at 31 March
2006, and we are proposing an optional
return of funds of approximately £128m by
way of an elective special dividend.
Costs
Keeping the overhead costs down is 
an important objective for us as every
pound of costs is a pound reduction in our
shareholders’ net assets. Nonetheless, it is
vital that we have sufficient resources to be
able to manage our portfolio effectively in 
a hands-on fashion while also attracting 
and evaluating a good deal flow of new
opportunities. We believe that being a 
self-managed investment trust company,
with direct control over costs significantly
helps this objective. Our total overhead
costs for the year were about 0.9% of our
net assets, which compares favourably
against a pre tax weighted investment trust
industry average of 1.4%.
Outlook
It is, to say the least, very difficult to 
predict in advance when markets are to
reach their zenith in the cycle. Recent events
suggest that this may now be happening. 
At Caledonia, we do not deliberately take
market positions. However, we are careful
not to overpay for new investments and,
notwithstanding the proposed elective
special dividend, our present expectations,
on the assumption that the bid for Kerzner
International completes, are that we are
likely still to be holding liquidity on our
balance sheet at the end of the current
financial year.
By carefully selecting the right
opportunities where there are strong
management teams, by continuing our
active involvement in investee companies
and through disinvesting when appropriate,
we seek to maintain our distinctive
performance.

Caledonia has developed a distinctive and
successful investment style and philosophy .
It is centred on our long term approach,
our close supportive relationship with 
the management teams we back and our
determination to guard our reputation as 
a good, reliable equity partner.
All this differentiates us, in the case of
unquoted investments, from the mainstream
private equity and venture capital markets
and, for our listed investments, from more
traditional fund managers. The business
highlights of the year under review illustrate
our approach.
Business highlights
of the year Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 11
We acquired a 22% stake for £18.0m in Satellite Information
Services (SIS), the provider of integrated information systems
to the betting industry and outside broadcast services. 
Our ability to take a long term view and acquire an existing
shareholding in a well established business, without requiring
a shorter term exit mechanism, meant that we could respond
to the desire of an existing investor to realise its minority
stake at what we believe was a highly attractive entry price.
Broadcasting remains a key area of expertise for SIS. 
It is one of the most experienced television and production
and outside broadcast companies in Europe, and the leading
supplier of television programming and sports data to
licensed betting offices. In 1987, SIS became the first
broadcaster to create a dedicated specialist sports channel
for the UK betting market. Betting markets around the globe
now receive a service from SIS that includes live worldwide
sports coverage.
Employing over 400 people across Europe, SIS operates 
a number of dedicated television channels and is one of 
the small number of television companies in the world 
able to cover and deliver live televised racing and provide 
a continuous supply of support data.
SIS is an established and successful business, which is
owned by a small group of both strategic and financial
investors. Through having a Caledonia executive on the
board, we look forward to supporting management and
developing our relationship with our fellow shareholders 
and we have been impressed with the results to date of SIS.
During the year, our holding has increased to 24%. We believe
that our long term investment approach is well suited to 
a business like SIS, which will benefit from a stable and
involved shareholder base.
Wallem
Satellite Information Services
Generating shareholder
value by responding to
market opportunities
In 1992, Caledonia became a significant shareholder with 
a 74% economic interest in Wallem, a Hong Kong-based
group, best known for its leading position in the ship
management industry. There had been strong links with
Wallem since the 1970s through the involvement of one 
of Caledonia’s directors in Wallem’s business, but the
opportunity then arose for us to acquire the stake of the
major shareholder. So, in 1992, we invested alongside the
chairman of Wallem, who had then been working in the
business for some 30 years. It was this close relationship
and knowledge of the business which gave us the
confidence to invest in a company with its headquarters 
in Hong Kong. The presence of Wallem at the gateway to
China and its success in servicing burgeoning Chinese trade
have both helped us to develop an investment presence in
that part of the world.
Wallem performed very well in the mid-1990s,
generating cash which it paid out as dividends, but suffered a
significant downturn during the Asian crisis of the late-1990s.
In response to this, Wallem restructured its operations,
selling its shipping investments, and has subsequently seen 
a substantial improvement in its fortunes.
Then, an unsolicited approach from an interested
purchaser, closely connected with the founding Wallem
family, coincided with discussions we were holding in 2005
with our shareholding partner about how we might help
him realise his interests in Wallem. Consequently we were
able, over the course of almost a year, to work with our 
co-investor, Wallem’s management, advisers and the
potential purchaser to achieve a successful exit at the 
end of our financial year. We are satisfied that this sale, 
to knowledgeable trade investors with sound financial
backing, was both at an attractive value and ensured that
the excellent reputation Wallem enjoyed with its clients
remained in good hands, so that the business and its people
should continue to prosper.
Cash received for our stake totalled some £35m.
We believe the Wallem story is an excellent example of
how Caledonia’s flexible response to market opportunities
works well through the economic cycle for shareholding
partners and management teams and generates value for
our shareholders.

Avanti Screenmedia
Paladin Resources
Backing management 
in listed companies
through cornerstone
fundraising support
We invested £10.0m for a 17.9% stake in Avanti
Screenmedia, the AIM listed supplier of screen media
systems, and now have a Caledonia executive on the board.
We were introduced to Avanti by the company’s brokers 
who were well known to us and recognised the benefit 
of Caledonia’s investing philosophy. The investment
demonstrates how Caledonia is able to assist listed
companies through being able to cornerstone an issue 
of equity, such as an IPO or, as in this case, a £25m 
equity placing to fund the growth of the business.
Avanti is the market-leading provider of screen media
services for the retail, leisure and shopping mall sectors 
in the UK, with a 30% market share. Their screen media
channels reach over 12m consumers per week, including 
a high proportion of the highly desirable 18-34s market
through its pub and bar channels.
Avanti currently rents satellite space for relaying its
services, but is keen to own its own satellite as a more
efficient way of securing long term revenues. It was awarded
a satellite licence by Ofcom, the UK communications
regulator, in August 2005 and plans to build and launch its
£70m satellite by 2008, in conjunction with the European
Space Agency.
Having appraised the opportunity in a relatively short
period through detailed discussions with management and
other due diligence, we decided that there was considerable
upside in the value of the business and look forward to
working with our Avanti board colleagues and management
to realise this potential.

We realised our investment in Paladin Resources for
£108.2m towards the end of 2005 by supporting a
recommended offer from Talisman Energy Resources. 
To achieve this, we worked closely with management,
whom we had known from the 1990s when they had 
been responsible for the development and successful 
sale of Clyde Petroleum.
We had originally invested in Paladin Resources in 1994
and then built up a 9% stake, principally during 2002 and
2003, at a total cost of £19.8m.
Paladin Resources was one of the UK’s most successful
independent oil and gas exploration and production
companies. Its strategy was to position itself as a natural
partner for oil majors wanting to dispose of assets and to
purchase assets where further active investment would
enhance production. Assets acquired included a package 
of North Sea oil interests from BP and Amerada Hess and
various permits in the Timor Sea off the coast of Australia.
For the offer to proceed, the purchaser needed to
minimise the transaction risk from a potential competing
offer. We helped achieve this through committing our stake
to the offeror – a good example of how our supportive
relationship with management can help to secure an
outcome which benefits all the company’s shareholders. Caledonia has been closely involved with Sterling Industries,
specialising in hydraulic valves and combustion heat transfer
systems, since acquiring a 25% stake in 1989. We acquired
100% ownership of the Sterling Group in 2000 in order 
to be able to help management reposition and restructure
the business. This was achieved through recruitment 
both at board and management levels and we supported
operational management through some challenging market
conditions. During these, the cost base was reduced and a
clearer market focus introduced, capitalising especially on
growth in China. Our efforts were rewarded in 2005, when
Sterling Industries took advantage of industry consolidation
and sold its hydraulic valves business to Parker Hannifin of
the USA for £33.2m, realising a book profit of £22.3m.
The remaining businesses in Sterling Industries are
performing well. Bloom, which designs and manufactures
burners for the iron, steel and aluminium industries, is
expanding its market into China; PCC, a specialist in providing
thermal solutions for pollution control, is performing well in
the US, and GCD, an Australian business that designs and
manufactures fibreglass ovens for a range of customers and
applications, is enjoying a strong market in its sector.

Business highlights
of the year 
In 2003, Caledonia made a decision to build a portfolio 
of direct investments in India, extending geographically 
the successful strategy of backing proven management
teams over the long term. Working with local advisory
partners, we initially gained experience through building 
a modest portfolio of small stakes in a number of
companies introduced to us. One of these businesses 
was Alok Industries, a listed textile manufacturer based 
in Mumbai, and we were impressed by their achievements
and ambitions, not only in the domestic field but more
particularly in export markets. We were aware that 
they should be able to benefit substantially from the
imminent removal of WTO quotas on textile exports 
and were preparing to raise capital to expand production
for this purpose.
We initially acquired a small stake through a convertible
bond issue in 2004 and then in July 2005, once we had
really got to know the major shareholding family, we made
a more substantial investment by participating in Alok’s
second convertible bond issue. We have subsequently
converted all our bonds into equity and added to the
investment at various times through market purchases,
giving us an 11.8% stake as at 31 March 2006 at a total cost
of £13.9m. We have also accepted the offer of a board seat.
The rapid expansion of Alok’s already substantial
manufacturing plants represents a considerable management
challenge which we think is being skilfully met. Recent good
results reflect the quality of the management team and the
longer term opportunities open to them.

Alok Industries Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 15
In the 1990s, we invested in a UK self storage business
called Abacus. The early days of the business required
considerable input and some further investment from
Caledonia. Abacus became one of the largest European 
self storage companies and was sold in 1998 for a
substantial profit.
Some two years later we were asked by the former
Abacus management to join in a new venture establishing
self storage sites in Italy and Spain. In 2000, Easybox was
created and quickly established itself with two sites in Spain
and four in Italy.
It has proven much harder than expected to expand 
the business in Spain due to high property prices, so we
decided to sell this part of the company and concentrate
our efforts on Italy. The Spanish operations were sold for
£13.5m, a substantial profit on the cost of £6.9m. £7.0m
was returned to Caledonia by way of loan repayments. 
All sites in Italy have been trading well, a new site in
Rome will be opening this autumn, and a number of new
properties are being considered.
The Abacus/Easybox history demonstrates our
principles of seeking out able management, establishing 
a strong, long term relationship and being a flexible and
supportive investor.
Over the year, Caledonia’s liquidity increased from 
£40m to £180m. The principal role of Group Treasury 
is to ensure that we have the cash available to meet 
our investment commitments and also to maximise the
return from surplus liquidity consistent with maintaining
an approved level of risk. Traditionally, Caledonia has
mainly held surplus cash in term deposits, but 
we have recently invested £75m in a range of money
market funds that aim to deliver a return above bank
deposits, whilst protecting our capital.

Risk management
It is the responsibility of management to
ensure that proper controls are in place 
to maintain effective risk management in
every aspect of the company’s business. 
The main risks comprise economic risk,
treasury and funding risk, investment risk
and operational risk.
Economic risk
Caledonia invests mainly in the UK, 
Europe, US and Asia. The company takes an
opportunistic approach to investment and is
not sector or geography driven. At present
the majority of investments are based in the
UK, which results in exposure to the UK’s
economic cycle. In addition, a proportion 
of assets are invested in the US and an
increasing proportion of assets are invested
in Continental Europe and in Asia, which may
be subject to different economic cycles.
Treasury and funding risk
The overall funding objective continues to
be to ensure access to efficient financing 
for investment purposes whilst investing
liquidity for optimal returns within an
agreed risk matrix. This objective continued
during the year ended 31 March 2006.
All assets and liabilities are held by the
company for non-trading purposes and, as 
a result, Caledonia does not have a trading
book. Caledonia does not trade in derivatives
and does not enter into transactions
unrelated to its investment activities.
Derivatives are used to manage the risks
arising from Caledonia’s investment activities.
The main funding risks faced by Caledonia
are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
The level of these risks is addressed by the
overall funding objective and the Board
regularly reviews and approves policies 
on the approach to each of these risks.
Business review
Caledonia is an investment trust company,
but is unusual in holding trading subsidiaries
as part of its investment portfolio. The
ownership of subsidiaries requires Caledonia
to prepare consolidated financial statements,
but Caledonia views and manages these
holdings as part of its investment portfolio.
This business review reflects management’s
view that subsidiaries are part of its
investment portfolio.
Objectives and strategy
Objectives
Caledonia aims to achieve a long term 
total shareholder return in excess of the
FTSE All-Share Total Return index, while
maintaining a progressive annual dividend,
through a focused portfolio of significant
stakes in companies where it believes there
to be good opportunities for building value.
Caledonia measures its performance
over the long term by comparing its total
shareholder return against the FTSE All-
Share Total Return index over five and 
ten year periods.
In addition, Caledonia aims to achieve 
a positive total return over rolling five 
year periods.
Strategy
Caledonia’s strategy is to invest in and
actively manage significant stakes in 30 
to 40 companies and situations where it
believes there to be good opportunities 
for building value. Active management 
will usually be achieved by working closely
and constructively with the investee
management, and usually with board
representation, as a long term supportive
shareholder. Risk is managed by holding a
diversified portfolio, with at least 50% of the
portfolio in quoted securities or liquid assets.
Caledonia self-manages its portfolio, using
in-house expertise, as well as using third
party managers who specialise in particular
asset classes or geographical areas.
Caledonia seeks new investments with 
a typical size of £10m to £25m. Although
Caledonia usually aims to have an influential
minority stake, the company will, on occasion,
be prepared to take a controlling interest
where it believes that this will maximise
shareholder value. When considering an
investment opportunity, particular care is
taken in appraising the capabilities and
commitment of the management team 
of the prospective investee company. The
anticipated total return from the investment,
the strategy in relation to it, and the overall
risks, are carefully analysed as part of the
investment process.
Caledonia will invest part of its 
portfolio in third party managed funds.
Again, a core skill is its ability to assess the
capabilities and commitment of the fund
management team and Caledonia will often
seek to obtain a significant stake in the
management company, thereby potentially
enhancing returns to shareholders.
Caledonia seeks to work closely and
constructively with the managements of
companies that it has backed and to make
available, the considerable experience of its
own team to help the investee companies’
managements to address the business
issues. The strategy for each investment,
including the returns and the timing of
eventual disposal, is reviewed regularly.
Investments are realised when it is believed
that the funds released can provide 
better long term returns, but in a manner
consistent with Caledonia’s reputation 
as a supportive long term investor.
Whilst the source of funding for new
investments generally comes from its own
resources, Caledonia may at times seek to
enhance returns by taking on moderate
levels of gearing.
Tight control is exercised over costs,
notwithstanding Caledonia’s active and
participative management style. Cost
containment is significantly aided by
managing the large majority of investments
through the in-house management team. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 17
Financial review
Profit for the year
Caledonia achieved a profit of £349m 
for the financial year, which equates to
35.7% on restated opening shareholders’
funds. This compares with a 24.0% return 
on the FTSE All-Share Total Return index.
The components of the profit for the year
are shown in table 1.
The main drivers of the profit were the
level of profitable realisations, strong levels
of income and overall growth in the value of
the net assets.
Table 2 summarises the changes in the
investment portfolio.
Investments
Caledonia invested a total of £155.2m,
compared with £123.8m in 2005.
A summary of the principal investments,
analysed between new and follow-on
investments, is given in table 3.
During the year, 125 potential new
investments were considered and eight
were selected with an aggregate cost of
£70.0m. Of these new investments, one 
was made directly in India and one in China.
In addition, the company supported the
raising of a £75m fund for investment in
India and also made a follow-on investment
during the year in Alok Industries, the Indian
quoted textiles manufacturer.
Realisations
Caledonia made full and partial realisations 
of certain holdings during the year with total
proceeds of £307.0m (2005 – £217.8m),
reflecting a gain over cost of £180.5m (143%),
compared with £105.4m (94%) in the prior
year. The increased uplift percentage relative
to last year was significantly enhanced by the
rise in the value of Paladin Resources, as a
result of the successful offer from T alisman
Energy Resources.
A summary of full and partial
realisations of our holdings is given in 
table 4.
Caledonia’s foreign exchange risk
management policy allows for exposure 
to structural and transactional currency
movements. In the event that there is a
clear, short term exit plan for a foreign
currency denominated investment, a view
will be taken of likely currency movements
over the period to expected exit and part or
all of the exposure may be hedged using
foreign currency contracts or currency
derivatives.
The exposure to interest rate
movements on treasury assets is managed
through the use of term deposits and
money market funds. Where there are
group borrowings, exposure to interest rate
movements is managed through the use of
derivatives, such as caps and collars where
appropriate.
Day-to-day management of treasury
activities is delegated to executive Directors
and to the Group Treasurer. Regular reports
on Caledonia’s funding position and cash
flow forecasts are considered during the
year by the Board. There has been no
change during the year or since the year 
end to the principal funding risks faced by
Caledonia, or to Caledonia’s approach to
such risks.
Investment risk
This risk includes investing in companies
that may not perform as expected, 
being over-exposed to one sector of the
economy, being over-exposed to individual
investments and the portfolio valuation
being partly based on stock market
valuations which may fluctuate.
In addition to financial, legal and market
due diligence, Caledonia’s investment
criteria include a rigorous assessment of
investee management’s track record of
success and commitment to their business.
All potential investments are presented 
to Caledonia’s Investment Management
Committee, which comprises executive
Directors and other senior managers and
any individual investment of £20m or more
requires Board approval.
The valuation of a large proportion 
of Caledonia’s equity portfolio is based 
on stock market valuations. Quoted
investments are valued using the closing
market bid price at the balance sheet date.
Where appropriate, Caledonia’s unquoted
portfolio investments are valued using 
stock market earnings multiples for the
relevant industry sector, discounted for non-
marketability. Accordingly, stock market
valuations are a factor in determining the
valuation of Caledonia’s portfolio and 
the total return.
Actual proceeds from the disposal of 
any individual investment will inevitably
depend on market and economic conditions
prevailing at the time.
Operational risk
Within a framework approved by the Board,
heads of department are responsible for
identifying, assessing, controlling and
reporting operational risk. This is supported
by a framework of core values, standards
and controls and delegated authorities.
The ability to recruit, develop and 
retain capable people is of fundamental
importance to Caledonia’s strategy. The
company operates in a competitive industry
and aims to remunerate staff in line with
market practice, to provide development
opportunities and to encourage staff
motivation and retention.
The company seeks to operate within
applicable legal and regulatory frameworks.
A Compliance Committee sits weekly and
reviews Caledonia’s current business for
regulatory compliance, as well as
considering investment proposals from 
a compliance perspective.
A business continuity strategy is in place
to ensure that operations can continue in
the event of disruption. This strategy has
been assessed against a detailed business
impact analysis and is regularly tested. 18 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006
Gains and losses on investments
Net gains and losses on investments during
the year was £352.7m (2005 – £159.0m).
An analysis of the principal contributors is
given in table 5.
Income and costs
The main elements of income and costs are
shown in table 1 on page 17.
Investment and other income was
£26.2m (2005 – £18.9m). The increase
when compared with the prior year is due
mainly to the receipt of a £2.4m dividend
from Satellite Information Services.
Management expenses of £10.8m 
(2005 – £10.6m) comprised the costs of
managing the company’s investment
operations.
Other expenses included transaction
costs of £1.1m (2005 – £0.2m), which
comprised the due diligence costs incurred in
successfully making investments during the
year, together with costs where investment
opportunities were not followed through to a
specific investment being made. The increase
over the prior year reflects the increased
activity during the year.
The provision of £10.0m (2005 – £nil)
was in respect of matters related to the
mandated disposal of investments.
Finance costs of £0.8m (2005 – £1.0m)
were lower than in the prior year as the
company had minimal borrowings during
this year.
Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Caledonia is an investment trust company.
However, because it holds majority stakes 
in certain investments, it is required to
prepare group accounts that consolidate 
the results of such investments. In addition,
in order to present information that is
comparable with other investment trust
companies, Caledonia publishes company
financial statements, which include these
investments in subsidiaries at fair value.

Valuation
Investments have been valued by the
directors in accordance with IAS 39 and
based on the principles of the International
Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation
Guidelines. Details of Caledonia’s valuation
methodology are provided on page 62.
Introduction of International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’)
These financial statements have been
prepared for the first time in accordance
with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The
principal elements impacting Caledonia’s
results on transition to IFRS were as follows:
• The requirement under IAS 39 
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement’ to value quoted
investments at bid price. Under UK
GAAP, quoted investments were
reported at mid-market price.
• Under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, the
pension scheme deficits should be
included in the balance sheet.
• Deferred tax has been recalculated in
accordance with IAS 12. This adjustment
includes deferred tax calculated on the
unrealised gains on investments and 
a deferred tax asset in respect of the
pension deficit recognised under IAS 19.
• Under IAS 10, dividends declared after
the balance sheet date are not accrued
at the balance sheet date. Business review
continued
20 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006
Proposal to return capital to shareholders
As indicated in the Chairman’s statement, 
it is intended that around £128m will be
returned to shareholders through an
elective special dividend and associated
capital reduction.
Under the proposal, Caledonia
shareholders will be offered the opportunity
to receive a special dividend on one 
out of every ten shares held. Shares on
which a shareholder elects to receive the
special dividend will be cancelled for no
consideration, pursuant to a Court approved
reduction of capital. The total number 
of ordinary shares on which the special
dividend will be paid is limited to 6,410,579
ordinary shares, based on the 64,105,796
ordinary shares in issue (excluding ordinary
shares held in treasury) as at 26 May 2006.
The special dividend payable in relation to
each share to be cancelled will be an
amount equal to the net asset value per
share at a specified date, expected to be 
7 July 2006, discounted by 3%. Actual
payment of the dividend is expected to 
be on or around 13 July 2006.
Under the terms of the special dividend
offer, all shareholders have the following
choices:
• To do nothing and therefore continue to
hold all of their ordinary shares.
• To elect to receive the special dividend 
in respect of one out of ten shares held
(the ‘basic entitlement’).
• To elect to receive the special dividend
on a number of ordinary shares less 
than their basic entitlement (the ‘under
election option’).
• To elect to receive the special dividend
on a number of shares greater than their
basic entitlement, with such elections
only being accepted to the extent that
other ordinary shareholders elect to
receive the under election option or do
not elect to receive the special dividend
at all (the ‘over election option’).
• To elect to receive the special dividend
on such number of ordinary shares 
as to maintain, after taking into account
other shareholders’ elections, their
proportionate interests in Caledonia 
at the same level as prior to the special
dividend (the ‘pro rata option’).
All ordinary shares on which ordinary
shareholders validly elect to receive the
special dividend will be cancelled for 
no further consideration pursuant to 
a reduction of capital.
Cash flows
The key cash flows during the year were 
the aggregate proceeds of £314.0m 
(2005 – £218.5m) from the realisation 
of investments and outflow of £160.2m
(2005 – £127.4m) for the purchase of
investments. In addition, in the prior year,
there was a cash outflow of £88.0m in
respect of the elective special dividend 
paid on 2 July 2004.
Liquidity
With cash equivalents and money market
funds totalling £179.6m, Caledonia has a
high level of liquidity. Successful completion
of the bid for Kerzner International would
yield around a further £131m in cash 
during August. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 21

Directors’ report
The directors present their report and accounts for the year ended 
31 March 2006. This report should be read in conjunction with the 
directors’ remuneration report and the corporate governance report.
Principal activities and results
Caledonia is an investment trust company. A review of the activities of the
company, together with the results for the year, is given in the business
review, which should be regarded as part of this report. There have been no
significant changes in the activities of the operating subsidiaries during the
year, other than the sale of the hydraulic valves business in Sterling Industries.
With effect from 1 April 2003, the company has been managing its affairs 
so as to enable it to comply with the requirements for approval by Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) as an investment trust. Approval
as an investment trust is granted retrospectively by HMRC for each financial
year for which such status is sought. An application for approval for the
years ended 31 March 2004 and 2005 have been made and an application
for approval for the year ended 31 March 2006 will be made subsequent to
the approval of these accounts by members of the company.
Annual general meeting
The seventy-seventh annual general meeting of the company will be held 
at the Crowne Plaza London-St James Hotel, 45-51 Buckingham Gate,
London SW1E 6AF on Thursday, 20 July 2006 at 11.30 am. The notice of 
the annual general meeting is set out on page 63 and contains three items
of special business.
Resolution 2 seeks shareholders’ approval of the directors’ remuneration
report in compliance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations
2002. The directors’ remuneration report, which is set out on pages 52 to
56, explains the company’s overall policy on directors’ remuneration and
provides details of the remuneration paid to directors for the year ended 
31 March 2006. As required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002, the company’s auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, have audited
those parts of the directors’ remuneration report required by the legislation
to be audited and their report is set out on page 27.
Resolution 11 will be proposed, as in previous years, to renew the authority
granted at the last annual general meeting, held on 13 July 2005, to allot
unissued ordinary shares in the company. Whilst they do not have any
present intention of exercising this authority, the directors would be
authorised to allot ordinary shares up to a nominal value of £1,068,400,
representing approximately 33.33% of the company’s issued ordinary 
share capital (excluding ordinary shares held in treasury) as at 30 May 2006,
being the latest practicable date prior to the printing of this annual report.
The authority, if granted, will last until the next annual general meeting of
the company.
Resolution 12 seeks to renew the directors’ flexibility to issue ordinary
shares for cash in connection with a rights issue or other than pro rata to
existing ordinary shareholders. In the case of an issue of ordinary shares
other than pro rata to existing ordinary shareholders, the authority will be
limited to a nominal amount of £160,260, which represents approximately
5% of the company’s total issued ordinary share capital (excluding ordinary
shares held in treasury) as at 30 May 2006, being the latest practicable date
prior to the printing of this annual report. If granted, the authority will last
until the next annual general meeting of the company. This authority to
issue ordinary shares on a non pre-emptive basis will also apply to the
transfer of ordinary shares held in treasury.
The directors will comply with the guidelines of the investment committees
of the Association of British Insurers and National Association of Pension
Funds that no more than 7.5% of the issued ordinary share capital should be
allotted for cash, or transferred from treasury, on a non pre-emptive basis
during any rolling three year period.
Extraordinary general meeting
The company is seeking shareholders’ approval at an extraordinary general
meeting (‘EGM’) convened for 26 June 2006 for the renewal of an authority
to make market purchases of up to 6,410,500 of its own ordinary shares,
being approximately 10% of the company’s issued ordinary share capital
(excluding ordinary shares held in treasury) as at 30 May 2006, being the
latest practicable date prior to the printing of this annual report. The price
permitted for any such purchases will be a price not more than the higher of
(a) 5% above the average of the middle market quotations for such shares
during the five business days preceding any such purchase and (b) the
higher of (i) the price of the last independent trade in the company’s shares;
and (ii) the highest current independent bid relating thereto on the trading
venues where the purchase is carried out, nor less than 5p, being the
nominal value of an ordinary share. The company has stated that it will not
make market purchases of its shares where to do so would result in the
interests in the company’s shares held by the concert party (‘Concert Party’)
that is deemed by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (‘Panel’) to exist by
virtue of the Cayzer family interests in the company exceeding 49.9% of the
total voting rights (excluding shares held in treasury). As at 30 May 2006,
being the latest practicable date prior to the printing of this annual report,
the interests in the company’s shares held by the Concert Party stood at
45.4% of the total voting rights.
The company is also seeking at the EGM the approval of those shareholders
who are not members of the Concert Party of a waiver by the Panel of the
obligation that could arise on the Concert Party under the City Code on
Takeovers and Mergers to make a general offer for the company following 
an increase in the voting rights of the Concert Party as a result of the
company making market purchases of its own shares. If granted, this waiver
will permit the company to make market purchases of its shares without
incurring such an obligation on the Concert Party, provided that such
purchases do not increase the interests in shares held by the Concert Party
to over 49.9% of the total voting rights. Without this waiver, the company
will only be able to use the power to make purchases of its own shares, if
granted, without incurring such an obligation on the Concert Party provided
that any such purchases do not increase the percentage voting rights of 
the Concert Party either to above their highest percentage in the previous
12 months or by more than 1% over the previous 12 months, taking into
account any purchases made by the Concert Party during that period.
It will be the directors’ intention to use this power only in circumstances
where they believe, after careful consideration, that such a purchase would
be in the best interests of shareholders and would result in an increase 
in net asset value per ordinary share. In considering whether to exercise 
this power, the directors will also take into account both the longer term
investment opportunities available to the company and any discount at
which its shares are trading in the market relative to their underlying net
asset value. It is the company’s present intention that any shares purchased
pursuant to the exercise of this power would be held in treasury.
The authority to make market purchases, if granted at the EGM, will expire
on 1 January 2008 or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next annual general
meeting of the company following that to be held on 20 July 2006. The
waiver to be granted by the Panel will, if approved by the non-Concert Party
shareholders, expire on 26 June 2007. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 25
Directors and their interests
The directors of the company are shown on pages 22 and 23. All of the directors
served throughout the year, with the exception of Messrs J M B Cayzer-Colvin
and W P Wyatt, who were both appointed on 4 April 2005.
Messrs D G F Thompson, J M May, T C W Ingram and the Hon C W Cayzer
retire by rotation at the annual general meeting and, being eligible, offer
themselves for re-election in accordance with the company’s articles of
association. Mr J R H Loudon, who has served as a director for over nine
years, also retires at the annual general meeting in accordance with the
recommendations of the Combined Code and, being eligible, offers himself
for re-election. 
None of Messrs May, Ingram and Cayzer has a contract of service which
cannot be terminated within one year. Messrs Loudon and Thompson, who
are non-executive directors, have no entitlement to compensation in the
event of their appointments being terminated. Biographical details of all of
the directors proposed for re-election at the annual general meeting are
shown on pages 22 and 23.
Following formal individual performance evaluation and a review of 
the structure, size and composition of the board, the Nomination
Committee confirms that the non-executive directors proposed for re-
election continue to demonstrate strong commitment to their roles and
that, through their knowledge, skills and experience, they continue to
provide effective contributions to the functioning of the board and its
committees. Accordingly, the Nomination Committee believes that both
non-executive directors proposed for re-election at the annual general
meeting should be re-elected directors of the company.
The interests of the directors and their families in the ordinary share capital
of the company as at 31 March 2006 were as follows:

details of the directors’ shareholdings and options.
Directors’ indemnity
Each of the directors has the benefit, under the company’s articles of
association, of an indemnity, to the extent permitted by the Companies Act
1985 (as amended), against all costs, charges, losses and expenses and
liabilities incurred by him in the execution or discharge of his duties or the
exercise of his powers as a director or otherwise in relation thereto.
Substantial interests
As at 30 May 2006, being the latest practicable date prior to the printing 
of this annual report, the following had notified the company that they 
were interested in 3% or more of the issued ordinary share capital of

Sofina sa 3,000,000 4.7% 
The interest notified by The Cayzer Trust Company Ltd (‘Cayzer Trust’)

a further 59,570 shares (0.1%) arising by virtue of voting and pre-emption
arrangements entered into between Cayzer Trust and a group of its former
shareholders.
Employees
Group companies are encouraged to develop their own consultative
policies. These include regular meetings held between local management
and employees to allow a free flow of information and ideas.
The group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment
from disabled persons, having regard to their aptitudes and abilities, and
group companies make every effort to treat disabled persons equally with
others. Where existing employees become disabled, it is the group’s policy
to provide continuing employment under normal terms and conditions and
to provide training and career development and promotion to disabled
employees wherever appropriate.
Customers and suppliers
The group’s policy in relation to all of its suppliers is to settle the terms of
payment when agreeing the terms of the transaction. The group will abide
by those terms provided that it is satisfied that the supplier has provided 
the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions.
The group does not follow any code or statement on payment practice and
Caledonia itself does not have any trade payables.
Charitable donations
Group companies support chosen community and charitable causes local 
to their areas of operation. Overall, the group made charitable donations
during the year amounting to £111,000.
Auditors
Resolutions will be proposed at the annual general meeting to reappoint
KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the company and to authorise the directors 
to agree their remuneration. A description of how the Audit Committee
ensures the objectivity and independence of the auditors is set out on 
page 58 within the corporate governance report. 
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this directors’ 
report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware and each
director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director to
make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that
the company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the group
and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required
to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare the parent company
financial statements on the same basis.
The group and parent company financial statements are required by law 
and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the
group and the parent company and the performance for that period. The
Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a
true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements,
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended). They have general
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to
safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible 
for preparing a directors’ report, directors’ remuneration report and the
corporate governance statement that comply with that law and those
regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
corporate and financial information included on the company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 27
Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Caledonia Investments plc
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’) of Caledonia Investments plc for the year ended
31 March 2006 which comprise the group and parent company income
statements, the group and parent company balance sheets, the group and
parent company cash flow statements, the group and parent company
statements of recognised income and expenses, and the related notes.
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the
directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the directors’
remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as
adopted by the EU are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities
on page 26.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a
true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you
whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is
consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the
directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the business
review that is cross referenced from the principal activities and results
section of the directors’ report. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is
not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of 
the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information 
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements 
and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the group’s and the parent
company’s affairs as at 31 March 2006 and of the group’s and the 
parent company’s profit for the year then ended;
• the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial statements,
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the
financial statements.

Accounting policies
General information
Caledonia Investments plc is an investment trust company incorporated 
in England. The address of its registered office is Cayzer House, 
30 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6NN. The ordinary shares of the
company are listed on the London and New Zealand Stock Exchanges.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the
currency of the primary economic environment in which Caledonia operates.
These financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 
31 May 2006.
Significant accounting policies
Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared for the first time in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as
adopted for use in the EU. IFRSs comprise accounting standards issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and its predecessor
body as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) and its predecessor body.
Basis of preparation
In preparing these financial statements, Caledonia has elected to take
advantage of certain transitional provisions within IFRS 1 ‘First-time
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’, which offer
exemption from applying IFRSs retrospectively. The exemptions that the
company has relied on are:
• IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’ where the
cumulative translation differences for foreign operations has been
accounted for prospectively from the date of transition to IFRS.
• IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ where business combinations that
occurred before the date of transition to IFRS have not been restated to
comply with the requirements of the standard.
In addition, Caledonia has adopted the Amendment to IAS 39 ‘The Fair
Value Option’ and Amendment to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ with effect
from 1 April 2004, ahead of their effective date, being 1 April 2006.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP
to IFRS are given in note 32.
The company will be required to comply with IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments:
Disclosure’ and IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures’
in its financial statements next year. Management has not yet assessed the
impact of these disclosure requirements on the financial statements.
Caledonia is an investment trust company. However, because it holds majority
stakes in certain investments, it is required to prepare group accounts that
consolidate the results of such investments. In order to present information
that is comparable with other investment trust companies, Caledonia also
publishes financial statements of the company, which include investments in
subsidiaries regarded as part of the company’s investing business at fair value.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to the functional
currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated to the functional currency
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value
are translated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at
the dates the fair value was determined.
Assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations are measured using
their functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic
environment in which they operate.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations
are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income
and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the
period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences
arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the group’s foreign
exchange translation reserve. Such exchange differences are recognised in
the income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated
at the closing rate.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a
purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require
delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market
concerned, and are initially measured at cost, excluding transaction costs.
Investments held as part of the group’s business of investing in financial
assets are designated as measured at fair value through profit and loss in
both the consolidated financial statements and the company financial
statements. Other investments held by subsidiaries are designated as
available for sale in the consolidated financial statements. Other investments
in subsidiaries held by the company are accounted for at cost in the financial
statements of the company.
Investments designated as at fair value through profit or loss or as available
for sale are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains and
losses arising from changes in the value of investments designated as fair
value through profit or loss are included in net profit or loss for the period.
For available for sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in
fair value are recognised directly in equity until the investment is disposed
of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the
period. If, in the subsequent period, the fair value of the available for sale
investments, for which impairment was previously recognised, increases in
value, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Quoted investments are valued at bid price or the last traded price when a
bid price is not available. Unquoted investments are valued using recognised
valuation methodologies, based on the International Private Equity and
Venture Capital Guidelines, which reflect the amount for which an asset
could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arm’s
length basis. The portfolio valuation methodology is detailed on page 62.
Income
Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the
period on an ex-dividend basis. Where no ex-dividend date is available,
dividends receivable on or before the period end are treated as revenue for
the period. Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised
on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the
debt securities and shares. Interest receivable from cash and short term
deposits is accrued to the end of the period.
For trading subsidiaries, revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of
goods and services, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts and after
eliminating sales within the group. Sales of goods are recognised when
goods are delivered and title has passed. Sales of services are recognised in
the accounting period in which the services are rendered, by reference to
completion of the specific transaction, assessed on the basis of the actual
service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
The company’s share of net income receivable by investment limited
partnerships is recognised as revenue for the period on an accruals basis.
Expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis. Expenses of acquisition
of an investment designated as held at fair value through profit or loss or
expenses of an aborted acquisition of an investment are presented as
transaction costs and expenses of disposal of an investment are deducted
from the disposal proceeds of the investment.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never
taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that were applicable at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of
taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Investment trusts which have approval as such
under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not
liable for taxation on capital gains. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 35
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet
date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Dividend distribution
Interim and final dividends are recognised in the period in which they 
are declared.
Employee benefits
Pension schemes
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged
as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing
benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial
gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of the income statement and are presented in
the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits
are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over
the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted
for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of
scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in
future contributions to the plan.
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-
sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit
attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. 
The group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where
there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Share-based payment
The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ 
to all grants of equity instruments, including those granted on or before 
7 November 2002, for which the fair value has been publicly disclosed on
the company’s website.
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of
grant and the fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, based on the group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a trinomial model. The model takes account
of the early exercise behaviour of employees by assuming that exercise takes
place whenever the stock price reaches a certain multiple of the strike price.
The model also considers the possibility that employees will leave the
company early, before and after the vesting period.
An ESOP trust is used for distributing option shares to employees under
Caledonia’s share remuneration schemes. The trustee purchases shares with
money lent interest free by Caledonia and transfers shares to participating
employees on receipt of the requisite consideration.
The transactions the ESOP trust undertakes are considered to be performed
by the trust as an agent for Caledonia. The transactions of the ESOP are
included in the separate financial statements of the parent company and,
following the requirements of SIC 12, in the consolidated financial statements
as if they arose in that company. Own shares held by the ESOP trust as at the
balance sheet date are accounted for as if they were treasury shares.
National Insurance on share option scheme gains
National Insurance contributions payable on the exercise of certain employee
share options at the date of exercise have been charged as an expense. 
The charge is based on the difference between the market value of the
underlying shares at the balance sheet date and the option exercise price 
and calculated at the latest enacted National Insurance contributions rate.
Capital reserve
The company maintains a capital reserve, which it is prohibited from
distributing by virtue of its articles of association. The following items are
accounted for in the capital reserve of the company:
• Gains and losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
• Gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge the fair value of
investments.
• Expenses and finance costs incurred directly in relation to the capital
transactions.
In accordance with the company’s articles of association, the company is
permitted to utilise this reserve for share repurchases.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land
or properties under construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the
straight-line method, on the following bases:
Property 25-40 years
Plant 10-15 years
Equipment 3-8 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful
lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of
the relevant lease.
The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as
the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the
asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Investment property
Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or for capital
appreciation, is stated at its fair value at the balance sheet date. Gains and
losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are
included in the income statement for the period in which they arise.
Brands and trademarks
Brands and trademarks acquired by the group are stated at cost less
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 20 years.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of
acquisition over the group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly
controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least
annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is
not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the
profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has
been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for
impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP
prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment of assets
At each balance sheet date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its
tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, an
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying
amount exceeds its recoverable amount, if any. The recoverable amount is the
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes
of assessing impairment, intangible assets are grouped at the lowest levels for
which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). 36 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006
Accounting policies
continued
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost
comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their
present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the first-in, first-out
method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling
and distribution.
Properties that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business or are
being developed for future sale are classified as inventories.
Receivables
Receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as
reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are
short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted 
for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest
method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. The effective interest
method allocates the interest expense over the life of the instrument so as to
reflect a constant return on the carrying amount of the liability.
Borrowings include a component of the company’s deferred ordinary shares
and preference shares in subsidiaries held by third parties that fall under the
definition of financial liabilities under IAS 32.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the company has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that
an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the
effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future
cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Share capital
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs.
Where any group company and the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share
Trust purchases the company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid,
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is
deducted from equity attributable to the company’s equity holders until the
shares are cancelled, reissued or sold. Where such shares are subsequently 
sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included 
in equity attributable to the company’s equity holders.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into
and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are
designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised
directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in
the income statement. The amount in equity is released to income when
the forecast transaction impacts profit or loss.
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value, the
hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk
being hedged, with the corresponding entry in the income statement. Gains
or losses from re-measuring the derivative, or the fair value movement of
the entire component of the risk that is being hedged for non-derivatives,
are recognised in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments where hedge
accounting is not applied are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument or the
hedged item expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies
for hedge accounting.
Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the group that is engaged
either in providing products or services (business segment), or in providing
products or services within a particular economic environment (geographical
segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those
of other segments.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
the company and entities controlled by the company (its subsidiaries) made
up to the balance sheet date. Control is achieved where the company has
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee
entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a
subsidiary are measured at fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of
the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired
is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the
fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is
credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. The interest of
minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values 
of the assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to
the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the
interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are
included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used 
by the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated
on consolidation.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise
significant influence, but not control or joint control, through the financial
and operating policy decisions of the investee.
As Caledonia is an investment trust company, and its investments held 
in associates are designated as held at fair value through profit or loss, 
the provisions of IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates’ do not apply. Such
investments are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they occur.
No other group company held investments in associates.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties
undertake an economic activity that is the subject of joint control.
As Caledonia is an investment trust company, and its interests in joint ventures
are designated as held at fair value through profit or loss, the provisions of 
IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ do not apply. Such interests are measured
at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss in the period
in which they occur. However, the provisions of IAS 31 do apply to interests 
in joint ventures held by other companies in the group, as set out below.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in
these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except
when classified as held for sale. Interests in joint ventures are carried in the
balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the group’s
share of net assets of the joint ventures, less any impairment in the value of
individual investments. Losses of the joint ventures in excess of the group’s
interest in those joint ventures are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s share of the fair values
of the identifiable net assets of the joint ventures at the date of acquisition is
recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the
group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets at the date of
acquisition is credited in profit or loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a group company transacts with joint ventures of the group, profits
and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the relevant
joint ventures. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 37

Share-based payments
The company currently has three executive share option schemes, an
original scheme established in 1988, a 1998 scheme and a 2005 scheme.
These schemes entitle senior employees to purchase shares in the company
at the market price of the shares at the date of grant and on similar terms,
subject to service and company performance criteria. Under the terms of
the schemes, options may be exercised between three and ten years after
the date of grant, although only one-third of the options may be exercised
after three years from grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming
exercisable six years after grant. A number of grants have been made under
these schemes.
A number of grants under the original and the 1998 schemes were made
before 7 November 2002. IFRS 2 has been applied to these grants as the fair
value of these share options has been publicly disclosed.
In addition, the company has special options arrangements for Mr Ingram
and Mr May. The terms of grants under these arrangements are similar to
that for options granted under the 1998 scheme other than in respect of the
performance retesting criteria. Details of these options are set out on page
56 of the directors’ remuneration report.
The terms and conditions of the grants of options outstanding as at 
31 March 2006 were as follows, whereby all options are settled by physical

19. Employee benefits continued
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are
measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted. The estimate
of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Hull-White
Employee Stock Option Valuation model, a binomial or trinomial lattice model
that extends the theory of the Black-Scholes model to take account of the
impact of future events, such as early exercise by employees, or employee exit
rates after vesting. Also, the Hull-White model defines the conditions under
which employees are expected to exercise their options after vesting in terms
of the share price reaching a certain multiple of the exercise price.
The weighted average fair value at the measurement date of share options
granted during the year, and parameters used to derive the fair value, was 
as follows:
Senior Senior 
employees employees 
2006 2005 
Fair value at measurement date 264p 200p
Share price 1580p 1055p
Exercise price 1580p 1055p
Expected volatility 11.9% 17.4%
Exercise multiple 2.0 2.0 
Expected dividends 2.1% 3.1%
Risk-free interest rate (based on national government bonds) 4.2% 5.0%
The expected volatility is calculated from historic volatility data using a
sophisticated GARCH model that takes account of volatility clustering and
mean reversion.
Share options are granted under a service condition and non-market
performance conditions. Such conditions are not taken into account in the
grant date fair value measurement of the services received. There are no
market conditions associated with the share option grants.

statement in gains and losses on investments held at fair value through
profit or loss.
Provisions relate to the disposal or mandated disposal of investments. 
The provision is based on an assessment of matters relating to the disposal 
or mandated disposal. These matters are expected to be resolved over the
next year.
21. Financial instruments
The group’s financial instruments comprise securities and other investments,
cash balances, borrowings and receivables and payables that arise from its
operations. The group’s investment portfolio includes quoted and non-
quoted equity investments, debt instruments and investments in other 
funds that are intended to be held for the long term.
The main types of financial risk to which the group is exposed are market
risk and credit risk.
The nature and extent of the financial instruments outstanding at the balance
sheet date and the risk management policies employed are discussed below.
Market risk
Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes
currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk.
The group’s strategy on the management of market risk is driven by its
investment objective, which is to outperform the FTSE All-Share Total
Return index over five and ten years and to achieve consistently a positive
return over five years. The group invests in a range of investments, including
quoted and unquoted equity securities, debt instruments and non-equity
investment funds in a range of sectors and regions.
The board monitors the group’s investment exposure against internally set
guidelines specifying the maximum proportion of total assets that may be
invested in various sectors and regions. The board also reviews the position,
prospects and exit strategy for all substantial investments at least once a
year, on a rolling basis.
Details of the group’s investment portfolio at the balance sheet date are
disclosed in the table of significant investments set out on pages 60 and 61.
Individual investments in debt and equity instruments are disclosed separately.
Currency risk
The group may invest in financial instruments and enter into transactions
denominated in currencies other than its functional currency. Consequently,
the group is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its functional
currency may change relative to other currencies in a manner that has 
an adverse effect on the value of that portion of assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
The group’s policy is not to enter into any structural currency hedging
transactions. However, when a decision is taken to realise a currency
denominated investment, derivatives may be used to hedge against
currency fluctuations to the expected date of realisation, depending on the
directors’ view of the likely movement in the exchange rate to anticipated
disposal. The policy has changed over the year. At 31 March 2005, the policy
was to hedge all exposure to US dollar denominated investments and that
exposure to the euro and other currencies in aggregate should each not
exceed 10% of net assets. At 31 March 2006, the company and group had 
no currency hedging positions (2005 – £163.0m).
The total net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates at
the balance sheet date was as follows:

Canadian dollar 3.5 – 3.5 – 
Australian dollar – – 1.8 1.3 
268.4 69.4 303.8 113.8 
Interest rate risk
The majority of the group’s financial assets are non-interest bearing. Interest-
bearing financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities mature or
reprice in the short term, no longer than twelve months. As a result, the 
group is subject to limited exposure to fair value interest rate risk due to
fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates. Any excess cash
and cash equivalents of the group are invested in term deposits with the term
to maturity of up to three months and money market funds. Investments 
in debt securities are fixed rate instruments with the term to maturity of 
up to twelve months. The maturity dates of the fixed income instruments
correspond to their repricing dates.
The group uses interest rate collars to manage its interest rate risk exposure.
At 31 March 2006 and 2005, the group had collars limiting interest rates to
between 4.5% and 6.5% on £20.5m of the group’s borrowing. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 45

Price risk
Price risk is risk that the value of an instrument will fluctuate as a result of
changes in market prices, whether caused by factors specific to an individual
investment, its issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded in the market.
As the majority of the company’s financial instruments are carried at fair
value with fair value changes recognised in the income statement, all
changes in market conditions will directly affect net investment income.
Price risk is mitigated by constructing a diversified portfolio of instruments
traded on various markets and direct involvement in the management of
the investment portfolio.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to
discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the
group. The group has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is
monitored on an ongoing basis.
At 31 March 2006, the financial assets exposed to credit risk were as follows: 
Company Group
2006 2005 2006 2005 
£m £m £m £m 
Investments in debt instruments 56.5 58.4 31.6 47.0

Cash and cash equivalents 103.8 39.6 164.7 51.3 
240.3 103.9 299.9 131.0 
The group invests in debt instruments as part of its investing activities. Prior 
to making investments, management has in place a process of review that,
amongst other things, evaluates a potential investee’s ability to service 
and repay its debt. Management reviews the financial position of investee
companies, including their continuing ability to service and repay debt, 
on a regular basis.
The exposure to credit risk on operating and other receivables is mitigated 
by performing credit evaluations on major customers.
Credit risk arising on money market funds and cash and cash equivalents is
mitigated by spreading investments and deposits across a number of investment
grade banks with a credit rating of ‘AA3’ or better as determined by Moody’s
rating agency. The company receives a monthly rating update, and relevant
credit risks are reviewed accordingly.
All transactions in listed securities are settled on delivery using approved
brokers. The risk of default is considered minimal, as delivery of securities sold
is only made once the broker has received payment. Payment is made on a
purchase once the securities have been received by the broker. The trade will
fail if either party fails to meet their obligation.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk to counterparties at 
31 March 2006. 
Fair value
Most of the group’s financial instruments are carried at fair value on the
balance sheet. For certain other financial instruments, specifically operating
and other receivables and payables, the carrying amounts approximate fair
value due to the immediate or short term nature of these financial instruments.
The principal methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of
investments are disclosed on page 62.

The company has also issued share options (note 19).
As at 31 March 2006, the authorised share capital comprised 112,592,000
ordinary shares (2005 –112,592,000) and 8,000,000 (2005 – 8,000,000)
deferred ordinary shares. The ordinary and deferred ordinary shares have 
a par value of 5p.
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as
declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at
meetings of the company. In respect of the company’s shares that are 
held by the group, all voting rights are suspended.
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are not redeemable.
They carry the right to a fixed cumulative preference dividend of 1% per
annum (exclusive of any associated tax credit) of the nominal value of such
deferred ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or £4,000 in aggregate, 
for all such shares currently in issue. The company is required to pay the
dividend to the extent that it has distributable profits. On a winding-up or
other return of capital, the deferred ordinary shares carry the right to the
payment of the amount paid up on such shares only after holders of the
ordinary shares have received the sum of £100,000 in respect of each such
ordinary share. All of the deferred shares are held by Sterling Industries PLC,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Caledonia.
These shares are considered compound financial instruments under IAS 32
and are required to be separated into a debt and an equity component. 
The debt component, a perpetual debt, represents the present value of 
the fixed cumulative dividend of 1% per annum calculated on the date the
deferred shares were issued. This component of the deferred shares has  46 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006

been classified as non-current liabilities in the financial statements of the
company. The fixed cumulative dividend has been reclassified from dividend
to interest expense in the income statement of the financial statements of
the company.
Authority to purchase own shares
At its annual general meeting on 13 July 2005, the company obtained
shareholders’ approval for the renewal of its authority to make market
purchases of up to 6,410,500 of its own ordinary shares, being approximately
10% of the ordinary share capital then in issue, at a price not more than 
5% greater than the average of the middle market quotations for such
ordinary shares during the five business days preceding any such purchase.
The authority expires on 1 January 2007 or, if earlier, at the conclusion of 
the next annual general meeting.
On the same date, non-Concert Party shareholders gave their approval 
for a waiver by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers of the obligation that
could arise on the Cayzer Concert Party under Rule 9 of the City Code 
on Takeovers and Mergers to make a general offer for Caledonia on the
implementation by the company of the above authority to purchase its own
shares. The approval was subject to the maximum percentage of voting
rights of shares held by the concert party not exceeding 49.9% of the total
voting rights of the ordinary share capital of the company as a result of
purchases by the company. This waiver expires on 13 July 2006.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve comprises the nominal value of those shares
purchased by the company out of its own profits and cancelled. At 31 March
2006, the capital redemption reserve was £1.2m (2005 and 2004 – £1.2m).
There was no movement in the capital redemption reserve in the current or
prior years.

30. Accounting estimates and judgments
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Fair values of financial instruments
Many of the group’s financial instruments are measured at fair value on the
balance sheet and it is usually possible to determine their fair values within 
a reasonable range of estimates.
For the majority of the group’s financial instruments, quoted market prices
are readily available. However, certain financial instruments, such as
unquoted securities, are fair valued using valuation techniques, including
reference to the current fair values of instruments that are substantially the
same (subject to the appropriate adjustments).
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on market
conditions and information about the financial instrument. These estimates
are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgement (e.g. interest rates, volatility, estimated cash flows, etc) and
therefore, cannot be determined with precision. 48 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006

31. Subsequent events
Elective special dividend and capital reduction
On 17 March 2006, Caledonia announced that it intended to propose a
return of funds to shareholders of around £128m by way of an elective
special dividend and capital reduction.
The payment of the elective special dividend will be conditional upon, inter
alia, the approval of ordinary shareholders and the consent of the Court.
Subject to the necessary consents being received, the special dividend is
planned to be paid on or around 13 July 2006.
32. Explanation of transition to IFRS

In the table above, the UK GAAP numbers incorporate the results previously
reported in the consolidated profit and loss account and in the consolidated
statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Notes to the reconciliations from UK GAAP to IFRS.
The accounting policies have been applied in preparing the financial
statements for the year ended 31 March 2006, the comparative information
presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005
and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004 
(the company’s and group’s date of transition).
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the company and group has
adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in
accordance with its old basis of accounting (previous GAAP).
a Under UK GAAP, trademarks and brands were included in ‘Tangible
assets’. Under IFRS, these have been reallocated to ‘Intangible assets’.
b Under IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’, investment property, which is
property held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation, is stated 
at its fair value at the balance sheet date. Under UK GAAP, certain
property was included in ‘Tangible assets’ at cost less depreciation and 
in ‘Investments’ at fair value. This adjustment reallocates investment
property to IFRS ‘Investment property’, reverses the previously charged
depreciation and charges the loss arising from changes in the fair value
to profit or loss. The gains or losses arising on changes in the fair value
have been included in the income statement.
c Under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, goodwill acquired in a business
combination is recognised as an asset and subject to impairment testing
in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Under UK GAAP,
goodwill on acquisitions was capitalised and written off over its useful
economic life. This adjustment represents the write back of goodwill
amortisation during the year ended 31 March 2005, less any impairment. 
d In separate financial statements, IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate
Financial Statements’ requires investments in subsidiaries to be
accounted for at cost or in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. Most investments in
subsidiaries are regarded as part of the company’s investing business
and are therefore designated as measured at fair value through profit 
or loss. Other investments in subsidiaries that do not form part of the
company’s investing business have been reallocated from UK GAAP
‘Investments’ to IFRS ‘Investments in subsidiaries’ and accounted for 
at cost.
e Under IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’, joint ventures should be
identified and stated as a one line item at cost plus the investor’s share 
of retained post-acquisition profits and other changes in net assets,
where accounted for using the equity method. Under UK GAAP, interests
in joint ventures were not considered to be material and were included 
in ‘Investments’ at cost less provision. This adjustment represents the
reallocation of interests in joint ventures stated at net assets at the date
of transition to IFRS and the movement in post-acquisition profits and
other changes in net assets since.
f Investments have been designated as held at fair value through profit or
loss and, under IFRS, instruments quoted on a stock market should be
valued at bid prices on the reporting date. This adjustment represents
the decrease in the values of quoted investments at the reporting dates
and the movement in the period when valued at bid prices compared
with valuing at mid-market price under UK GAAP.
g Investments held by trading subsidiaries that are not considered to be
part of the group’s business of investing in financial assets, are classified
as available for sale and held at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognised in equity. Under UK GAAP, these holdings were included in
‘Investments’ at fair value. This adjustment reallocates such investments
to IFRS ‘Available for sale investments’.
h Under IFRS, amounts due to and from counterparties in respect of
forward currency contracts are shown in other operating receivables or
payables. Under UK GAAP, these contracts were included in investments.
i The deferred tax has been recalculated in accordance with IAS 12. 
This adjustment comprises a number of items. A deferred tax liability 
has been recognised for the amount of tax calculated on the unrealised
gains of investments in controlled foreign companies – deferred tax 
on unrealised gains was not permitted under UK GAAP, but is required
under IFRS. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 
the pension deficit recognised in the balance sheet in accordance 
with IAS 19 (note ‘r’) to the extent that the asset is considered to be
recoverable. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 
the National Insurance contributions provided on share option gains
(note ‘s’) to the extent that the asset is considered to be recoverable. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 51
j Under IAS 1, tax assets and liabilities should be shown separately from
other assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. Current tax
assets and liabilities previously included in UK GAAP ‘Debtors’ and
‘Creditors falling due within one year’ have been reallocated to IFRS
‘Current tax assets’ and ‘Current tax liabilities’.
k Under UK GAAP, ‘Short term deposits’ were shown separately from ‘Cash
at bank and in hand’. Under IFRS, these lines have been combined into
‘Cash and cash equivalents’. 
l Under UK GAAP, ‘Short term borrowings’ included bank overdrafts,
which has been reallocated to IFRS ‘Bank overdrafts’.
m Under UK GAAP, ‘Creditors falling due within one year’ included a loan
from a subsidiary, which has been reallocated to IFRS ‘Interest-bearing
loans and borrowings’.
n Under IFRS, dividends proposed after the balance sheet date are treated
as a non-adjusting post balance sheet event and are not accrued. This
adjustment represents the change in treatment from UK GAAP, under
which dividends proposed after the balance sheet date were accrued in
the financial statements.
o Under UK GAAP , ‘Creditors falling due within one year’ included employee
benefits, which have been reallocated to IFRS ‘Employee benefits’.
p Under UK GAAP, ‘Creditors falling due within one year’ included
provisions, which have been reallocated to IFRS ‘Provisions’.
q IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ defines
equity instruments as any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Certain
subsidiaries of the company have outstanding preference shares held by
third parties. Under UK GAAP, these instruments have been included in
‘Minority interests – non-equity’ in the balance sheet. Under IFRS, they
should be treated as non-current liabilities. This adjustment reflects the
change in accounting treatment. Preference dividends payable to the
holders of these shares have been reallocated to finance costs.
r Under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, the pension scheme deficits should 
be included in the balance sheet. This adjustment reflects the change in
treatment from UK GAAP where, under SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension
Costs’, the pension scheme deficits were not included in the balance sheet.
s Under IFRS, National Insurance contributions payable on the exercise 
of employee share options should be provided in full when the options
are granted. This adjustment represents the change in treatment 
from UK GAAP, which, in accordance with UITF 25 ‘National Insurance
contributions on share option gains’, requires the National Insurance
contributions to be charged to profit and loss over the performance
period. This calculation resulted in an immaterial amount and,
accordingly, no provision was made under UK GAAP.
t Under UK GAAP, the company’s ‘Capital reserve (non-distributable)’
included the capital redemption reserve. This has been reallocated to the
IFRS ‘Capital redemption reserve’.
u In accordance with IFRS, a foreign currency translation reserve has 
been recognised in respect of the exchange movements arising on
consolidation since 31 March 2004. IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in
Foreign Exchange Rates’ requires the revenue and expenses of a foreign
entity to be translated at exchange rates at the dates of the relevant
transactions or at an appropriate average rate. This adjustment
represents the difference in treatment from UK GAAP, where the profit
and loss of foreign entities was translated at the closing rates.
v Under IFRS, consolidated reserves are presented as the single line
‘Retained earnings’. Under UK GAAP, reserves have been shown as 
split between ‘Revaluation reserve’ and ‘Profit and loss account’. 
This reallocation combines these two reserves.
w Under UK GAAP, the minority’s share of the retained losses of certain
subsidiaries was set off against minority interests. Under IAS 27, this is
required to be written off, unless there is an obligation on the minority
to fund the loss.
x Under UK GAAP, ‘Own shares’ are shown separately. This has been
reallocated to the company IFRS ‘Capital reserve (non-distributable)’ 
and the group IFRS ‘Retained earnings’.
y Under IAS 39, transaction costs on investments designated as measured
at fair value through profit or loss are charged immediately to the
income statement. Under UK GAAP, costs relating to the acquisition 
of investments were included in the cost of the investment. This
adjustment represents the change in treatment from UK GAAP.
z Under IFRS 2, the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments 
is required to be expensed in profit or loss over the vesting period. 
An equivalent charge was not required to be made under UK GAAP. 
This adjustment represents the change in treatment from UK GAAP.
Cash flow statement
The company and group cash flow statements have been prepared in
accordance with IAS 7 ‘Cash Flow Statements’. Under IAS 7, the cash flow
statements show the movement in cash and cash equivalents, being defined
as cash in hand, demand deposits and short term highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are
subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Under UK GAAP, the
company and group cash flow statements showed the movement in cash
repayable on demand only and in particular, excluded short term deposits.
For the year to 31 March 2005, the UK GAAP decrease in cash of £2.8m in
the company and £0.5m in the group changed to an increase in cash and
cash equivalents of £0.8m in the company and a decrease of £2.3m in the
group under IFRS.
All other adjustments made to the cash flow statements from IFRS represent
reclassifications between line items and have not impacted actual cash flows. 52 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006
Directors’ remuneration report
This report has been prepared to comply with the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’). The tables included in the
statements below on directors’ remuneration, pensions and share options
have been audited.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a standing committee of the board 
whose members throughout the year were Mr M E T Davies (chairman), 
Mr C M Allen-Jones and Mr J R H Loudon.
The Committee, whose written terms of reference are published on the
company’s website and are available on request from the company
secretary, has been established for the following purposes:
• To determine and agree with the board the framework and broad policy
for the remuneration of the executive directors and such other members
of the executive management as it is requested by the board to consider
and to review the on-going appropriateness and relevance of the
remuneration policy.
• To approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance
related pay schemes operated by the company and to approve the total
annual payments made under such schemes.
• To review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the 
board and shareholders and, for any such plans, to determine each year
whether awards will be made and, if so, the overall amount of such
awards, the individual awards to executive directors and other senior
executives and the performance targets to be used.
• Within the terms of the agreed policy, to determine the total individual
remuneration packages of each executive director (and, if requested by 
the board, other senior executives) including, where appropriate,
bonuses, incentive payments, share options and other awards.
• To determine the policy for and scope of pension arrangements, 
service agreements, termination payments and compensation
commitments for executive directors and, if requested by the board,
other senior executives.
• To review and assess annually the remuneration trends across 
the company.
References to executive directors also include the chairman.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice from Towers
Perrin, independent remuneration consultants appointed by the Committee.
Towers Perrin advised the Remuneration Committee on the design of the
new executive share option scheme and deferred bonus plan implemented
following a thorough review of the company’s remuneration policy in the
previous year and approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting 
of the company held on 13 July 2005. Towers Perrin also assessed the
comparability of senior executive remuneration packages with the market
place for the purpose of setting executive directors’ salaries for the year
commencing 1 April 2006. In addition, the Remuneration Committee
received advice from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in relation to the new
executive share option scheme and deferred bonus plan. Towers Perrin only
advised in relation to the remuneration of executive directors and senior
management and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer are the company’s main
legal advisers. The Remuneration Committee also consulted with the
chairman, Mr P N Buckley, and the chief executive, Mr T C W Ingram, in
relation to the remuneration of all of the executive directors other than their
own. Internal support was provided to the Remuneration Committee by the
company secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The Remuneration Committee has adopted a remuneration policy with the
following objectives:
• Performance related remuneration should seek to align the interests of
the executive directors with those of the shareholders.
• A significant portion of the executive directors’ remuneration packages
should be linked to the performance of the company.
• Remuneration packages for the executive directors should be
competitive in terms of market practice in order to attract, retain and
motivate executive directors of the quality needed to manage and grow
the company successfully.
In determining executive directors’ remuneration, consideration is given to
matters specific to the company such as the performance of its net asset
value, both in absolute terms and as measured against the FTSE All-Share
index, to the experience and performance of individual directors and their
areas of responsibility and to comparable external market remuneration
data and levels of remuneration elsewhere in the company.
It is currently intended that the policy statement set out in this report will
apply for the year to 31 March 2007 and for subsequent years. However, the
Remuneration Committee considers that an effective remuneration policy
needs to be sufficiently flexible and kept under review in order to take
account of future changes in the company’s business environment and in
remuneration practice. Accordingly, the policy may be further amended in
future years. Any changes in policy for financial years after 31 March 2007
will be described in future directors’ remuneration reports, which will
continue to be subject to an advisory vote of shareholders. All statements in
this report in relation to remuneration policy for years after 31 March 2007
should be read in this light.
Policy on individual components of executive directors’ remuneration
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference to
the experience and responsibilities of the director concerned and taking into
account external market research. The company’s policy is to pay salaries
and other benefits which are competitive, but not excessive, in relation to
the marketplace. The company provides a range of benefits, such as cash
allowances in lieu of company cars, life insurance, permanent health
insurance, and private medical cover.
Bonus
The company operates a discretionary annual bonus scheme for executive
directors, which takes into account both the performance of individual
directors and the performance of the company over the short and medium
term. For the financial year ended 31 March 2006, the bonuses will either be
paid in cash or as an employer contribution to Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs (‘HMRC’) approved pension schemes. The method of payment will
be determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The maximum potential bonus that may currently be awarded is 100% of
basic salary. For the year ended 31 March 2006, the amount of bonus payable
was dependent on a combination of the level of the outperformance of
Caledonia’s net asset value per share (‘NAV per share’) with dividends added
back over the FTSE All-Share Total Return index, but measured over the
financial year, and on the individual director’s performance. For the year
ending 31 March 2007 and future years, the company performance related
element of bonus will be determined by reference to the outperformance of
the company’s NAV per share over the FTSE All-Share index, to provide
consistency with the performance targets of the company’s share option
schemes and deferred bonus plan and also of the bonus schemes operated
for the company’s other employees. The Remuneration Committee has the
discretion to reduce the amount of bonus payable if Caledonia’s NAV per
share growth in the financial year is negative and/or Caledonia’s NAV per
share outperformance over the relevant financial year is greater than that of
the previous three financial years and, therefore, represents recovery from
previous underperformance. The payment of any such bonus is subject to the
overriding discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee may also award bonuses outside the terms of
the company’s annual bonus scheme. No bonus payments are pensionable.
Deferred bonus plan
The company’s bonus arrangements are also designed to align the interests
of directors with those of shareholders and to encourage retention by
requiring, in the Remuneration Committee’s absolute discretion, that a
proportion of any bonus paid to a director is compulsorily invested in shares
under the company’s deferred bonus plan. The Remuneration Committee’s
current policy is that any annual bonus paid, the amount of which is above
50% of a director’s basic salary for the financial year to which the bonus
relates, must be so compulsorily invested.
In addition, the deferred bonus plan entitles directors to convert voluntarily
a proportion of any remaining cash bonus to a conditional entitlement to
shares. The Remuneration Committee’s current policy is that up to half of
any bonus not subject to compulsory deferral may be voluntarily converted
into shares. The shares so invested are eligible for matching, on a one for
one basis, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions over a
period of three years. 
No awards under the plan will be made to executives within six months of
their anticipated retirement. Awards under the plan are not pensionable.
Pensions
The company’s policy on pension provision is to provide a means whereby
executive directors either receive a pension at retirement age from the
company, or are funded to operate their own money purchase pension 
plans or other arrangements. Mr P N Buckley, Mr J H Cartwright and the 
Hon C W Cayzer are members of the Caledonia Pension Scheme, which is 
a defined benefits scheme and is contributory for employees who joined 
the company after 1 April 1988, but which is now closed to new members.
The scheme provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 53
salary on retirement dependent on length of service and also provides for
dependants’ pensions. All of the executive directors participating in the
scheme, other than Mr J H Cartwright, transferred into the scheme from 
The Union-Castle Line Superannuation Scheme which was non-contributory,
and this status has been preserved. Mr T C W Ingram and Mr J M May do not
participate in any company pension scheme, but instead a fixed percentage
of basic salary is paid into personal pension arrangements or, in the case of
Mr Ingram, as a cash supplement, which is reduced by such amount as is
necessary to cover the company’s National Insurance costs. The percentage
of basic salary is 25% for Mr Ingram and 10% for Mr May. Mr J M B Cayzer-
Colvin and Mr W P Wyatt participate in the Caledonia Group Personal
Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme into which employer
contributions of 10% of basic salary are made on each of their behaves.
It is the company’s policy that any future executive directors recruited from
outside the company will be funded to operate their own pension arrangements
or offered participation in a defined contribution scheme and that the company
will not offer participation in any defined benefits arrangements.
Share options
A key objective of the company’s remuneration policy is to motivate
executive directors to deliver long term shareholder value. The Remuneration
Committee believes that this is best achieved through the grant of share
options, exercisable only if a demanding performance condition is met. 
The grant of options is considered to be a key element of the remuneration
package, alongside annual salary, annual bonus and the deferred bonus plan.
The maximum value of options that may be granted in any year to a director
is 150% of salary. The Remuneration Committee may exceed this limit for
individual directors where it considers it necessary to do so to secure their
appointment, provided that the maximum value that may be granted in
such circumstances shall not exceed 250% of salary.
No options are granted at a discount.
Policy on executive directors’ service contracts
It is the policy of the company that no executive director should be offered a
service contract that cannot be terminated within one year or which contains
provision for predetermined compensation in excess of one year’s total
emoluments. All existing directors’ service contracts comply with this policy.
The Remuneration Committee has regard to compensation commitments
and believes that these are best addressed by restricting the term of the
contract. In the event of a termination, the Remuneration Committee would
consider all the relevant factors and circumstances and seek a just solution.
Policy on external non-executive directorships held by 
executive directors
It is the company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold external non-
executive directorships unrelated to the company’s business, provided that
the time commitment required is not material. Normally the company will
retain any fees arising from such non-executive directorships, but may
permit the executive director to retain fees in certain circumstances. 
Details of any such fees retained by executive directors are disclosed 
in the statement on directors’ remuneration below.
Policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration and terms 
of appointment
It is the company’s policy that non-executive directors should be appointed
for fixed periods of no more than three years (from the next general meeting
following their initial appointment in the case of new non-executive directors)
and that re-appointment at the end of such periods should not be automatic.
Non-executive directors are paid an annual fee determined by the board as a
whole within the overall limit contained in the articles of association, but do
not receive any other benefits for their service as non-executive directors from
the company. The basic fee for non-executive directors was £28,000 (2005 –
£27,000) and fees of £3,000 per annum (2005 – £3,000) were paid for the
chairmanships of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, with a further
£3,000 (2005 – £3,000) paid to Mr C M Allen-Jones for his role as senior
independent non-executive director and chairman of the Governance
Committee. Non-executive directors may also be paid additional fees agreed
by the board where they have performed services that, in the opinion of the
board, are over and above their normal duties.
The company is entitled to terminate a non-executive director’s
appointment at any time without compensation.
Performance graph
The graph below shows the company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’)
against that of the FTSE All-Share Total Return index for the five financial
periods ending on 31 March 2006 and has been prepared in accordance
with the Regulations. TSR has been calculated assuming that all dividends
are reinvested on their ex-dividend date. The FTSE All-Share Total Return
index has been chosen as it is the benchmark by which the company
measures its delivery of shareholder value over the longer term.

54 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006
The deferred bonus column in the above table shows the amount of bonus
compulsorily deferred into shares under the company’s deferred bonus plan
approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 13 July 2005.
In addition, up to 50% of the remaining cash bonus may be voluntarily invested
into shares under the deferred bonus plan. The number of shares awarded 
for both the compulsory and voluntary deferral of bonus is determined by
reference to the market value of a share at the time the award is made, which
occurs shortly after the announcement of Caledonia’s results for the financial
year to which the bonus relates (or following the occurrence of exceptional
circumstances justifying the making of awards). In both cases, the number of
shares is set on a pre-tax basis (as the shares will be subject to income tax and
national insurance on release). The number of matching shares is equal to the
number of shares awarded in respect of the voluntary deferral of bonus.
The shares comprised in a compulsory deferral will normally only vest
(together with an amount equal to the dividends that would have accrued
on those shares) if the director remains an employee of the Caledonia group
for a three year period following the award. The vesting of these shares is
not subject to a further performance condition.
The shares comprised in a voluntary deferral are not subject to a
performance condition and will vest (together with an amount equal to the
dividends that would have accrued on those shares) at the earlier of three
years from the date of the award or the date the director ceases to be an
employee of the Caledonia group for any reason.
The vesting of the matching shares is dependent on the company’s
performance over a three year period, by reference to two separate
performance conditions. Both performance conditions relate to the
performance of Caledonia’s net asset value per share over the three financial
years starting with the year in which the award is made (the ‘Prescribed
Period’). This performance of net asset value per share will be compared
against different indices as follows:
• 50% of the matching shares will only vest if Caledonia’s net asset value
per share over the Prescribed Period outperforms the Retail Price Index
by at least 9%.
• The remaining 50% of the matching shares will only vest if Caledonia’s
net asset value per share over the Prescribed Period outperforms the
FTSE All-Share index by at least 3%.
There will be no retesting of either performance condition.
The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance target if events
occur that would make the amended target a fairer measure of performance
and provided that any amended target is no more difficult to satisfy. The
Remuneration Committee will also have the ability to impose different
performance targets in the future, provided that any targets that are
imposed are no less demanding than that described above. Any such
amended or different performance targets will be described in the 
directors’ remuneration report for the relevant year.
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, Mr T C W Ingram was 
paid an amount of £51,450 (2005 – £44,758), before tax, in lieu of contributions
to his personal money purchase pension arrangements as described in the
statement on directors’ pensions below. Similarly, Mr W P Wyatt was paid 
an amount of £3,460 (2005 – £nil) in lieu of contributions to the Caledonia
Group Personal Pension Plan, also as described in the statement on directors’
pensions below. Certain executive directors also hold external non-executive
directorships unrelated to the company’s business, where it has been agreed
that they may retain the fees arising therefrom. Mr T C W Ingram is a non-
executive director of Sage Group, for which he received fees during the year 
of £42,477 (2005 – £37,500). Mr Ingram was appointed to the board of Sage
Group before he joined Caledonia. During the year, Mr J M May received a fee of
£722 (2005 – £20,000) for his services as chairman of Covenant Healthcare until
his resignation on 14 April 2005. From 1 January 2006, Mr May also received a
fee from Catapult Venture Managers, amounting in the year to £4,531 (2005 –
£nil). Both of these fees were paid to a private company owned by Mr May and
his wife and both directorships were held prior to his joining Caledonia.

1. Except for Mr P N Buckley, the accrued pensions shown in row (1) were the amounts that would be
paid at normal retirement age, ignoring any revaluation, if the director had left service at 31 March
2006. Mr P N Buckley reached normal retirement age on 23 September 2004 but has continued in
employment. The amount shown in row (1) for Mr Buckley represents the accrued pension that
would have been paid at 31 March 2006. During the year, the Hon C W Cayzer’s normal retirement
age was reduced from 62 to 60, which resulted in an increase in the value of his accrued pension as
at 31 March 2006.
2. The increase in accrued pension, net of inflation, in row (3) is calculated by subtracting the pension
accrued to 31 March 2005 (23 September 2004 for Mr Buckley), multiplied by the increase in the
Retail Prices Index for the year to 31 March 2006, from the accrued pension to 31 March 2006. In the
case of Mr Buckley, who has not yet drawn any retirement benefits and remains a deferred pensioner
within the scheme, the increase in accrued pension shown is the increase over the period from his
pension at his normal retirement date of 23 September 2004 to 31 March 2006, a period of
approximately 18 months. As Mr Buckley ceased accruing pension benefits at his normal retirement
date, this increase is made up entirely of increases due to the late payment of his pension.
3. The transfer value shown in row (4) represented the value of the increase in accrued pension during
the year, as set out in row (3), minus director’s contributions.
4. During the year, Mr Buckley’s bonus award of £199,010 for the year ended 31 March 2005 was paid by
the company as a contribution into the scheme in order to enhance Mr Buckley’s cash lump sum benefit
on retirement. The amounts in rows (1) to (4) do not include allowance for this contribution. The transfer
value at 31 March 2006 set out in row (5) does however include the value of this contribution.
5. The change in transfer value over the year shown in row (7) (calculated as row (5) less row (6) and
any directors’ contributions) reflected the impact on transfer values of factors beyond the control
of the company and the directors, such as movements in stock markets. These can cause transfer
values at different points in time to fluctuate significantly. Disclosed changes in value may therefore
be subject to a large degree of volatility and may even be negative.
6. The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the guidance note ‘GN11’, published
by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
In April 2006, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion to pay
£50,000 of Mr P N Buckley’s bonus award for the year ended 31 March 2006
as an employer contribution to secure additional lump sum benefits for him
under the Caledonia Pension Scheme. This contribution is not included in
the above table of pension benefits accrued by directors during the year.
During the year, the company made contributions to a money purchase
personal pension plan for the benefit of Mr T C W Ingram of £36,960 (2005 –
£35,700), being the maximum amount permitted for this tax year under
HMRC limits. As described above, and in accordance with his service contract,
Mr Ingram elected to receive the balance of his agreed pension entitlement 
by way of a cash payment of £51,450 (2005 – £44,758), before tax, in lieu 
of pension contribution. The company also made contributions during the
year of £28,250 (2005 – £26,415) to a money purchase pension plan for the
benefit of Mr J M May. Messrs J M B Cayzer-Colvin and W P Wyatt are members
of the Caledonia Group Personal Pension Plan (‘GPPP’), a defined contribution
scheme. During the year, employer contributions of £14,000 (2005 – £nil)
were paid to the GPPP on behalf of Mr Cayzer-Colvin. Employer’s contributions
of £10,540 were paid on behalf of Mr Wyatt into the GPPP and £3,460 in cash.
Mr Wyatt received a cash payment in lieu of part of his pension contributions,
as contributions brought forward from the previous year were paid into the
GPPP in the year under review, which meant that the group was unable to pay
the full 10% of his salary into the GPPP due to HMRC limits.

56 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006
The company currently has three executive share option schemes – an
original scheme established in 1988, which expired in April 1998 for the
purposes of new option grants, a 1998 scheme approved by shareholders in
July 1998, under which option grants were made from September 1998 to
May 2004, and a scheme approved by shareholders in July 2005, under
which option grants commenced in August 2005.
Under the terms of all of the above schemes, options may be exercised
between three and ten years after the date of grant, although only one-third
of the shares comprised in an option may be exercised after three years
from grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming exercisable six years
after grant. Options may only be exercised if a performance target is met.
For options granted from 1996 to 1997 under the original scheme, the
target requires the company’s adjusted net asset value per share to
outperform the average of the increases in the FTSE All-Share and the
FT/S&P Actuaries World Pound Sterling indices over any consecutive three
year period to expiry. For options granted from 1998 to 2001 under the
1998 scheme, the target requires the company’s adjusted net asset value
per share to outperform either the Retail Price Index by 3% per annum, or
the average of the increases in the FTSE 250 and the FT Investment
Companies indices, over any consecutive three financial years prior to
expiry. For options granted in 2002 and 2003, the performance target
requires the company’s adjusted net asset value per share to outperform
either the Retail Price Index by 3% per annum, or the FTSE All-Share index,
over any consecutive three financial years prior to expiry.
For options granted in 2004, the performance target is such that 50% of the
shares comprised in an option will vest if the company’s net asset value per
share outperforms the Retail Price Index by at least 9% over the relevant
measurement period, with the other 50% vesting if the company’s net asset
value per share outperforms the FTSE All-Share index over the relevant
measurement period. The performance measure has to be achieved either
over the first three years, or over the first four years, after the date of grant.
If the performance measure is not achieved four years after the date of
grant, the options will lapse.
The performance target for the 2005 scheme requires that 50% of the shares
comprised in an option will vest if Caledonia’s net asset value per share
outperforms the Retail Price Index by at least 9% over the measurement
period. The other 50% of the shares comprised in the option will vest if
Caledonia’s net asset value per share outperforms the FTSE All-Share index
by at least 3% over the measurement period. The measurement period for
these purposes will be a period of three financial years measured at the end
of the third financial year following the date of grant of the options. There is
no retesting of the performance targets. To the extent that the performance
target is not met over this three year period, an option will lapse.
The performance targets have been met for all options granted under the
1998 scheme from 1998 to 2003. The Remuneration Committee has
selected the targets referred to above because it believed they provided an
appropriate benchmark of the company’s longer term performance.
The company has prepared its accounts under International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) commencing with the year ending 31 March
2006. A reconciliation of the company’s last audited balance sheet as at 
31 March 2005 from UK GAAP to IFRS has been undertaken and the difference
amounted to an increase in net asset value under IFRS of £5.3m, equating to
approximately 0.5% of net assets. Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee
does not expect the adoption of IFRS to have a material effect on the
performance targets for options already granted under the 1998 and 2005
schemes but, if necessary, will make adjustments to the extent considered
appropriate to ensure that the basis of calculation of net asset value per share
is consistent over the relevant performance measurement period.
Included in the options originally granted to Mr Ingram on 5 July 2002 were
options over 83,000 shares granted outside the 1998 scheme and subject to
special performance-related terms. As in the case of options granted under
the 1998 scheme, only one-third of the shares under these special options
were exercisable three years after grant, with the remaining two-thirds
becoming exercisable six years after grant. The special options are subject to
a stretching performance condition requiring Caledonia’s total shareholder
return (‘TSR’) to outperform the FTSE All-Share Total Return index (‘Index’)
over the measurement period, which commenced on the date of grant. 
A tranche will vest in full if Caledonia’s TSR exceeds that of the Index by 
an average of at least 2% per annum over the relevant measurement period. 
If Caledonia’s TSR equals that of the Index, none of that tranche will be
exercisable and there will be proportionate vesting of a tranche if Caledonia’s
TSR exceeds that of the Index by an average of between zero and 2% per
annum. For the one-third tranche, the performance measure was to be first
applied three years after grant, with two re-test opportunities four and five
years after grant. The performance target for the one-third tranche was
tested on 5 July 2005 and met in full. Accordingly, Mr Ingram subsequently
exercised all of the one-third tranche (27,666 shares) during the year. For the
remaining two-thirds tranche (55,334 shares), the performance measure will
be first applied five years after grant, with two re-test opportunities six and
seven years after grant. If Mr Ingram remains in service until retirement at
age 62, the option will remain exercisable until ten years from grant if the
performance conditions are met. Otherwise, Mr Ingram must normally be in
employment to be able to exercise the options. The shares required to satisfy
Mr Ingram’s special options either have been or will be transferred from the
Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust. The remaining terms of 
the special options are based on the rules of the 1998 scheme, and include
provisions that any benefits obtained from the special options will not be
pensionable and that the terms of the special options will not normally be
capable of amendment to the advantage of the option holder without the
prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
Included in Mr May’s options granted on 20 November 2003 are options
over 28,000 shares granted outside the 1998 scheme. The performance
conditions and other terms of these options are the same as those set 
out above for Mr Ingram.
As at 31 March 2006, the market price of the company’s shares was 1980p
(2005 – 1367p) and the range during the year was 1260p to 2015p.
Statement on directors’ service contracts and non-executive directors’
letters of appointment
Executive directors have service contracts with Caledonia Group Services
Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, details of which are
summarised below:
Name Date of contract Notice period Unexpired term
P N Buckley 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months
T C W Ingram 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months
J H Cartwright 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months

J M May 01.09.03 12 months Rolling 12 months
W P Wyatt 02.06.05 12 months Rolling 12 months
Directors’ service contracts contain provisions whereby the company may in
its discretion terminate the contract without notice and make a payment in
lieu of notice to the director and whereby a liquidated sum is payable by the
company in the event of termination within one year following a change of
control. Any such payment in lieu of notice or liquidated sum would be
equivalent to no more than one year’s total emoluments.
The service contracts of Mr J H Cartwright and the Hon C W Cayzer are also
subject to provisions whereby, in the event of a payment in lieu of notice or
payment of a liquidated sum on termination, the director concerned would
also be entitled to an increase in his pensionable service equivalent to the
unexpired period of notice under his contract.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but are appointed
under letters of appointment which provide for termination without notice
or compensation.
Executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive directors’
appointment letters are available for inspection at the registered office 
of the company.
The directors’ remuneration report was approved by the board on 
31 May 2006 and signed on its behalf by:

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 57
Corporate governance report
Statement of compliance
The board recognises the importance of good corporate governance and
this report describes how the company has applied the principles of good
corporate governance as set out in section one of the Combined Code
issued in July 2003 (the ‘Combined Code’). Shareholders registered on the
company’s New Zealand branch register should note that the principles of
good corporate governance set out in the Combined Code may materially
differ from the New Zealand Exchange Limited’s corporate governance rules
and the principles of its Corporate Governance Best Practice Code. A copy 
of the Combined Code is available on the website of the Financial Services
Authority at www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/ukla/lr_comcode2003.pdf.
The board
Overall responsibility and operation
The board as a whole is responsible for the group’s objectives and policies
and the management of its resources. It has eleven scheduled meetings a
year, but also convenes at additional times when required. The board has
adopted a Schedule of Authorities which sets out matters specifically
reserved to it for decision. Such matters include the approval of strategy,
the annual budget, material capital and revenue transactions and changes 
in business activities, treasury policies, risk management and internal 
policy limits relating to the company’s investment activities. The Schedule
of Authorities also sets out the authorities that are delegated to board
committees and to executive management. The Schedule of Authorities 
is reviewed annually by the board.
All directors receive appropriate and timely information to ensure that 
they are properly briefed in advance of board meetings and have unlimited
access to the advice and services of the company secretary and other 
senior management should further information be required. Non-executive
directors have access to independent professional advice at the company’s
expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities 
as directors.
Appointment, induction and training
All new directors appointed by the board are required to seek election by
shareholders at the next general meeting of the company following their
appointment and subsequently all directors are required to retire by rotation
at least every three years. Any non-executive director who has served on the
board for over nine years is subject to annual re-election. On appointment,
new directors are offered induction and training considered appropriate by
the board and subsequently as necessary. The company secretary provides
details of, and where requested arranges attendance at, external courses to
assist in directors’ professional development.
Board composition
The directors who served during the year are listed in the directors’ report
on page 24.
The board currently comprises twelve directors. Excluding the chairman, 
six of the directors are executive and five non-executive. The non-executive
directors considered to be independent are Messrs C M Allen-Jones, M E T
Davies, R Goblet d’Alviella and D G F Thompson. In assessing Mr Goblet
d’Alviella’s independence, the board took account of his position as chief
executive officer of Sofina sa, which has a 4.7% shareholding in Caledonia,
but did not consider this shareholding to be significant in the context of
independence, particularly given the size of the Cayzer Concert Party’s total
interest in the company. Moreover, in the context of Caledonia, the board
regards as key in assessing independence Mr Goblet d’Alviella’s ability, given
the shareholding of Sofina sa and his past investment banking experience,
to look at the interests of the general body of shareholders, independent 
of the Cayzer Concert Party and of Caledonia’s executive management.
Collectively, the directors throughout the year brought a wide range of
experience, skills and expertise to the stewardship of the company. The
individual biographies of the current directors appear on pages 22 and 23.
The board is led by the chairman, Mr P N Buckley, whose responsibilities
have been agreed and set out in writing in the Schedule of Authorities
adopted by the board. The chairman’s primary role is to ensure that the
board and individual directors are able to operate efficiently by setting the
agenda, style and tone of board discussions to promote constructive debate
and effective decision making. He has overall responsibility for monitoring
the development needs of the board as a whole and of individual directors
and for ensuring that the performance of the board, its committees and
individual directors are evaluated at least once a year. In conjunction with
the chief executive, the chairman is responsible for ensuring effective
communication with shareholders and that all board members develop an
understanding of the views of investors. This is primarily achieved by board
briefings following meetings with significant shareholders and private client
stockbrokers, some of which are also attended by the senior independent
non-executive director.
The chief executive, Mr T C W Ingram, heads the executive management
team and is primarily responsible for the implementation of the board’s
policies and strategies and for managing the activities of the company 
other than in relation to those matters specifically reserved to the board 
or delegated to its committees. His responsibilities have also been agreed 
and set out in writing in the Schedule of Authorities adopted by the board.
Except where the board gives specific direction otherwise, the chief
executive may delegate any of those matters to other members of the
executive management team or to executive committees, but ultimately he
is accountable to the board for the overall performance of the company.
A strong independent non-executive representation on the board is headed
by the senior independent non-executive director, Mr C M Allen-Jones. The
role of the non-executive directors, as set out in their letters of appointment,
is to challenge constructively, and contribute to, the development of
strategy; to scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed
goals and objectives and monitor their performance; to satisfy themselves
that financial information is accurate and that financial controls and systems
of risk management are robust and defensible; to determine appropriate
levels of remuneration for executive directors; and to have a prime role in
senior management appointments and succession planning.
The composition of the board is such that, throughout the year, the
company did not comply with provision A.3.2 of the Combined Code. 
The board however believes that the main objectives of board balance 
and independence set out in the Combined Code – that the board should
include a balance of executive and non-executive directors, and in particular
independent non-executive directors, such that no individual or small group
of individuals can dominate the board’s decision taking – are met.
The board is currently broadly comprised of three categories of directors –
the four independent non-executive directors; four directors (the chairman
and three executive directors, the Hon C W Cayzer and Messrs J M B Cayzer-
Colvin and W P Wyatt) who are involved in the affairs of The Cayzer Trust
Company Ltd (‘Cayzer Trust’), Caledonia’s largest shareholder; and three
other executive directors (Messrs T C W Ingram, J H Cartwright and 
J M May). 
Mr J R H Loudon does not fall into any of these categories as his eleven year
tenure as a non-executive director prevents his meeting the Combined
Code criteria for independence (although his length of experience with the
company, as well as his business career, are both considered significant
assets by the board) and, although a member of the wider Cayzer family, 
he is not involved in the affairs of Cayzer Trust. 
In addition to the balance on the board brought by these categories, the
Governance Committee, comprising solely independent non-executive
directors, was established in 2003 to keep under review corporate
governance and conflict of interest issues relating to the company and the
board and has authority to recommend that any director abstains from
participating in any decision of the board, or any board committee, where 
it believes that a conflict of interest could, or could be perceived to, arise.
The board believes that this structure ensures the necessary level of board
balance demanded by the Combined Code and safeguards against any
individual or small group of individuals being able to dominate the board’s
decision taking. Whilst not in strict compliance with provision A.3.2 of the
Combined Code, the board believes this structure is appropriate in the
context of a company with a large controlling shareholder whose stability
and support is fundamental to Caledonia’s business model as a long term,
supportive investor, and is therefore in the best interests of all shareholders.
As stated previously, the Combined Code requires that the members 
of the Remuneration and Audit Committees should all be independent 
non-executive directors. However, Mr Loudon’s membership of these
Committees, given that he is not considered independent by virtue of his
length of service as a non-executive director, means that provisions B.2.1
and C.3.1 of the Combined Code are not met. However, because of his
attributes described above, the board considers his membership of these
Committees to be in the best interests of the company.
Board committees
The board has delegated certain specific areas of responsibility to the
following standing committees, the terms of reference of which are
reviewed annually and are available on the company’s website or from the
company secretary on written request. The current membership of these
committees is noted on page 65. Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee, chaired by Mr P N Buckley, is responsible for 
the regular review of the structure, size and composition (including the skills,
knowledge and experience) of the board and for giving consideration to
succession planning for executive directors and, if requested by the board, for
other senior executives. It is responsible for identifying, using external search
consultants where necessary, candidates to fill board vacancies as and when
they arise and for making recommendations to the board in relation thereto
and for keeping under review the leadership needs of the company, both
executive and non-executive. It reviews the time required of non-executive
directors and ensures that they receive formal letters of appointment setting
out clearly what is expected of them in terms of time commitment,
committee service and involvement outside board meetings.
The Nomination Committee met once during the year in order to undertake
a formal review of the size and composition of the board following the 2005
annual board performance evaluation and to consider the contribution and
commitment of the non-executive directors retiring at the annual general
meeting, prior to giving recommendations for their election or re-elections.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Mr M E T Davies, is responsible 
for the review of executive remuneration policy. Within that policy, the
Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration packages of
executive directors and reviews those of other senior executive management.
It is also responsible for the design of, and grant of awards under, the
company’s share incentive schemes and deferred bonus plan and for the
determination of the policy for and scope of pension arrangements, service
agreements, termination payments and compensation commitments for
executive directors and, if requested by the board, for other senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee met seven times during the year and
completed the implementation of the new executive share option scheme
and deferred bonus plan designed to ensure that the company’s remuneration
policies remain sufficient to enable it to recruit and retain able executives and
that its performance related rewards continue to be competitive, following
the thorough review of senior executive remuneration undertaken in the
previous year. Further information on the company’s executive remuneration
policy and the work of the Remuneration Committee are included in the
directors’ remuneration report set out on pages 52 to 56.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, chaired by Mr C M Allen-Jones, is responsible for the
monitoring of the integrity of the financial statements of the company and 
any announcements relating to the company’s financial performance and for
reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements contained in them. 
It also reviews the company’s systems of internal financial control and
considers annually whether an internal audit function is required. The Audit
Committee believes that, in the context of the company’s business as an
investment trust, the key issues on which it has to satisfy itself are the integrity
of the application of the company’s policy for the valuation of its investments,
particularly those which are unquoted, and the robustness of the group’s
internal financial controls. The valuations of the company’s unquoted
investments are subject to formal six monthly reviews by an internal challenge
committee, independent of the investment executives, the results of which 
are then reviewed by the external auditors, and a formal report on the
effectiveness of the group’s internal financial control is prepared annually 
for the board by the group financial controller. It is the Audit Committee’s
current opinion that, in view of these control processes, the size of the 
entities controlled by Caledonia and the relatively straightforward control
considerations in relation to other investments, a separate internal audit
function is not necessary.
It is also the Audit Committee’s responsibility to review and monitor 
the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and the
effectiveness of the audit process and to develop and implement policy 
on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services. 
In this regard, the Audit Committee has approved a schedule of specific
non-audit activities which may not be undertaken by the external auditors,
within the broad principles that the external auditors should not audit 
their own work, should not make management decisions on behalf of the
company, should not be put into the role of advocate for the company and
that no mutuality of interest should be created between the company and
the external auditors. The Audit Committee believes that, by applying these
principles, the objectivity and independence of the auditors is maintained,
notwithstanding that non-audit work may be undertaken. On an annual
basis, the Audit Committee considers and makes a recommendation to the
board as to the appointment, re-appointment or removal of the external
auditors. The Audit Committee is also responsible for the company’s formal
whistleblowing arrangements whereby members of staff may raise any
issues of concern regarding possible impropriety in the conduct of the
company’s business and whereby any such concerns are properly
investigated and appropriate action taken.
The Combined Code recommends that at least one member of the 
Audit Committee should have recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Audit Committee considers that Mr J R H Loudon, who was formerly
group finance director of Blue Circle Industries, has such financial
experience. The chairman of the Audit Committee, Mr C M Allen-Jones, 
is also a member of the Financial Reporting Council.
The Audit Committee met five times during the year, including twice
without any of the executive directors present. During the year, the business
considered by the Audit Committee included:
• The scope of the annual audit and agreement with the external auditors
of the key areas of focus.
• The reports from the external auditors concerning their audit of the
annual financial statements of the company and their review of the
interim report.
• The financial disclosures contained in the annual and interim reports 
to shareholders.
• Reports from management on the effectiveness of the company’s
system of internal financial control.
• The need or otherwise for an internal audit function.
• The independence and objectivity of the external auditors, including
their system of quality controls and the level and nature of non-audit
services provided by them.
• The performance of the external auditors and the level of fees charged
for their services.
• The performance of the Audit Committee itself.
• The company’s preparation for the implementation of International
Financial Reporting Standards.
• The company’s compliance with the requirements for HMRC approval of
its investment trust status.
Governance Committee
The Governance Committee, chaired by Mr C M Allen-Jones, keeps under
review corporate governance issues relating to the company and is responsible
for the monitoring and review of the ability of each director to act in the
interests of shareholders as a whole and to exercise independence of
judgement free from relationships or circumstances which are likely to, or
could appear to, affect his judgement. Where it concludes that such criteria are
not satisfied with regard to any director, it may make such recommendations
to the board as it may think fit, including that the director abstains from
participating in any decision of the board or any of its committees on the
matter concerned. The Governance Committee met three times during 
the year.

Board performance evaluation
The board conducts an annual formal evaluation of its own performance and
that of its committees and individual directors. For the year ended 31 March
2006, the evaluation of the board as a whole and of its committees was led
by the chairman and was conducted by inviting individual board members to
complete a questionnaire regarding the operation and effectiveness of the
board as a whole and of its committees, the responses to which were collated
by the company secretary and discussed. The evaluation of the performance
of the chairman was led by the senior independent non-executive director
and involved private discussion with other members of the board of their
views on his performance, the results of which were then considered at
meetings of the non-executive directors, without the chairman present, 
and of the Governance Committee. The evaluation of the performance of 
the chief executive was undertaken by the chairman and the non-executive
directors. The performance of the non-executive directors was reviewed by
the chairman, the chief executive and the senior independent non-executive
director, with the senior independent non-executive director absent in
respect of his own performance appraisal. As part of this review, non-
executive directors were invited to complete self-assessment questionnaires
in relation to their own effectiveness. The performance of the executive
directors, which included further consideration of that of the chief executive,
was undertaken by the Remuneration Committee as part of the annual
executive salary review process.
The results of the evaluation of the board as a whole and of its committees
for the year ended 31 March 2006 were presented in a report to the board.
The Nomination Committee reviewed the size, structure and composition of
the board in the light of this report.
Internal control
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s system of internal
control, although the review of internal financial controls is delegated to 
the Audit Committee. The group’s system of internal control is designed to
manage, rather than eliminate, risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
It is recognised that such a system can only provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The board
confirms that the system of internal control operated by the group accords
with the guidance issued in September 1999 by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales (the Turnbull Committee guidelines) 
and has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of approval 
of these financial statements.
Major business risks facing group companies, including social, ethical 
and environmental issues, are identified in conjunction with operating
management and procedures agreed to address these as appropriate. 
Risks facing the group’s material investments are identified and evaluated
through board representation or regular contact.
Key risks identified are regularly monitored at group level by members of
the executive committee, who have clear mandates to assess and report 
on risk in their particular areas of responsibility. From these assessments, 
an ongoing risk profile of the group’s activities is updated half-yearly and
reviewed by the board. The board is also provided quarterly with a list of the
key risk issues identified by executive management at that particular time.
All of the company’s larger investments are reviewed at least annually by 
the board and the smaller portfolio holdings reviewed at least annually by
the executive investment management committee.
Specific control procedures are in place to ensure that the company continually
monitors and complies with the requirements for investment trust status. 
The board receives monthly compliance reports evidencing that the company
is meeting the various tests for investment trust status and also confirming that
the investment activities undertaken by executive management are within the
overall policy limits set by the board. A compliance committee, comprising 
the company secretary (chairman), the finance director and three associate
directors has been established, which meets weekly to review the company’s
ongoing compliance with its investment trust status and to monitor and
approve all investment activity from an investment trust compliance
perspective. The group financial controller also attends such meetings.
Financial performance is continuously measured by comparing total
shareholder returns and net asset value movements against the FTSE 
All-Share index. Performance statistics are reported monthly to the board.
Income and expenses are monitored by the board against an approved
annual budget and regularly updated forecasts. Valuations of unquoted
investments are subject to a rigorous six monthly review process
undertaken by a challenge committee independent of the investment
executives, the results of which are reviewed by the external auditors.
Since the year end, the directors have conducted their annual review of 
the operation and effectiveness of the group’s system of internal control.
Going concern
The directors confirm that they are satisfied that the group has adequate
resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. For this reason,
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.
Relations with shareholders
The company welcomes dialogue with institutional shareholders in order to
achieve a mutual understanding of objectives. The chief executive and the
finance director seek meetings with larger institutional shareholders and
private client stockbrokers after the announcement of year end and interim
results. The chairman and senior independent non-executive director attend
some of these meetings. The annual general meeting also provides a forum
for investors to meet the directors, both formally and informally.
The chairmen of all of the board’s committees will be available to answer
questions at the annual general meeting of the company. 60 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006

1. Income in the year represents dividends received (inclusive of any overseas withholding tax) and gross interest receivable in the year to 31 March 2006.
2. Net assets and earnings figures are taken from the most recent audited accounts of the investee business. The figures shown are the total earnings on ordinary activities after tax and net assets of each
business. Because of the varying rights attaching to the classes of shares held by the Group, it could be misleading to attribute a certain proportion of earnings and net assets to the proportion of equity
capital held. 62 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006
Portfolio valuation methodology
A description of the methodology used to value the company’s portfolio is
set out below. The methodology is based on IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement’ and the ‘International private equity and
venture capital valuation guidelines’ issued by the AFIC, BVCA and EVCA.
Basis of valuation
Investments are reported at the directors’ estimate of fair value at the
reporting date. Fair value represents the amount for which the directors
consider that an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing
parties in an arm’s length transaction.
General
In estimating fair value, we seek to use a methodology that is appropriate in
light of the nature, facts and circumstances of the investment. Methodologies
are applied consistently from period to period, except where a change would
result in a better estimation of fair value. Given the uncertainties inherent in
estimating fair value, a degree of caution is applied in exercising judgments
and making the necessary estimates.
Quoted investments
Investments quoted in an active market are valued at their bid price on the
reporting date. When a bid price is unavailable, the price of the most recent
transaction will normally be used.
Unquoted investments
The fair value is estimated as follows:
• The enterprise value is determined using an appropriate valuation
methodology adjusted for surplus assets, excess or unrecorded liabilities
and other relevant factors as appropriate.
• Any financial instruments ranking ahead of the highest instrument held
by the company is deducted from the enterprise value.
• An appropriate marketability discount is applied to give the net
attributable enterprise value.
• The net attributable enterprise value is apportioned between the
relevant financial instruments according to their rankings and allocated
the company’s holding in each financial instruments, representing their
fair value.
For most unquoted investments, the fair value is based on the price of
recent investment, earnings multiple or net assets valuation methodologies.
Price of recent investment
Where the investment being valued was itself made recently, its cost will
generally provide a good indication of fair value. Where there has been any
recent investment in the investee company, the price of that investment will
provide a basis of the valuation. Where the price at which a third party has
invested is being considered as the basis of valuation, the background to the
transaction will be taken into account to indicate whether or not the price
was wholly representative of the fair value at the time.
This methodology is likely to be appropriate only for a limited period after
the date of the relevant transaction. The length of period for a particular
investment will depend on the specific circumstances of the case, but a
period of one year is usually applied.
Earnings multiple
This methodology involves the application of an earnings multiple to the
earnings of the business being valued in order to derive a value for the
business. It is likely to be appropriate for an investment in an established
business with an identifiable stream of continuing earnings that can be
considered to be maintainable. It may also be applicable to companies 
with negative earnings, if the losses are considered to be temporary and a
‘normalised’ level of maintainable earnings can be identified.
When using the earnings multiple method, earnings before interest and tax
(‘EBIT’) are normally used, adjusted to a maintainable level and taxed at the
standard tax rate. Generally, the latest full year historical accounts are used
unless reliable estimated or forecast results are available. An appropriate
multiple is applied to these earnings. Normally the multiple will be the
average taxed EBIT multiple for a comparable quoted company, the
weighted average of a number of companies or the relevant sector of the
FTSE All-Share index.
Net assets
This methodology is likely to be appropriate for a business whose value
derives mainly from the underlying value of its assets rather than its
earnings, such as property holding companies and investment businesses.
This methodology may also be appropriate for a business that is not making
an adequate return on assets and for which a greater value can be realised
by liquidating the business and selling its assets. In the context of private
equity, it may therefore be appropriate, in certain circumstances, for valuing
investments in loss-making companies and companies making only
marginal levels of profits.
The net assets methodology derives an enterprise value using appropriate
measures to value the assets and liabilities, including contingent assets and
liabilities, of a business.
Marketability discount
The marketability discount relates to an investment rather than to the
underlying business and reflects the compensation that willing buyers 
will demand for the risk arising from the lack of marketability. The
marketability will vary from situation to situation and will generally be
between 10% and 30%.
Some of the factors that will be considered in determining the marketability
discount are the closeness to a realisation event, the investors influence over
the timing of realisation and the difficulty and risk of actions required to put
the business into a saleable condition.
Investment funds
The fair value of non-equity investment funds is generally estimated from
the latest net asset value provided by the fund manager or the fair value 
of underlying investments adjusted for other net assets or liabilities or
contingent assets or liabilities of the fund. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2006 63

company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by
CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s),
should note that CRESTCo does not make available special procedures in CREST for any
particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to
the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned
to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has
appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted
by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and,
where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular,
to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system
and timings.
The company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in
Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.

Chairman’s letter
Dear Shareholder
Your Board is pleased to report on 
another year of improving profits, our 
ninth successive year of underlying profit 
growth. By offering our customers an 
attractive combination of quality, value 
and service, underpinned by our strong 
values, we have continued to outperform 
our ‘Big Four’
1
 peers in a challenging 
market. As a result, our market share 
remains at its highest level for a decade. 
David Tyler, Chairman
Underlying profit before tax was up 5.3 per 
cent to £798 million. Underlying basic 
earnings per share rose 6.5 per cent to 32.8 
pence. Return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) 
increased by 19 basis points year-on-year to 
11.3 per cent
2
. 
This year, your Board recommends a final 
dividend of 12.3 pence per share, bringing 
the full year dividend to 17.3 pence, an 
increase of 3.6 per cent over the previous 
year, and covered 1.90 times by underlying 
earnings. 
The food retail sector remains under 
pressure, with the growth of the discounters 
and increasingly competitive pricing posing 
significant challenges. We continue to meet 
these challenges by investing in price, quality 
and service, and this, underpinned by our 
values, will ensure that Sainsbury’s 
continues to provide a strong, differentiated 
offer to customers. 
A winning team
Our continuing success is due to the 161,000 
colleagues who work in our stores, depots 
and store support centres. Their hard work 
and commitment is a key factor in the 
success of our business and it is thanks to 
them that we were named Supermarket of 
the Year for the sixth time in eight years
3
, 
Convenience Retailer of the Year for the 
fourth year running
3
 and Online Retailer of 
the Year for the second consecutive year
4
.  
We want Sainsbury’s to be a place where 
people love to work and shop and we invest 
in developing our colleagues and in ensuring 
they share in the success of our Company. 
I am delighted that a bonus of over £80 
million will be shared by colleagues this year. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 3
Grocery who has been appointed Food 
Commercial Director; and Jon Rudoe our 
former Director of Online who has become 
Digital and Technology Director. These 
changes follow the previously announced 
departures of Rob Fraser our former IT 
Director, Luke Jensen our Business 
Development Director and Neil Sachdev our 
Property Director who all stepped down 
earlier in the year. The Board thanks Rob, 
Luke and Neil for the significant 
contributions they made to Sainsbury’s and 
we wish them the very best for the future.
Sainsbury’s Bank
In January, we acquired the remaining 50 
per cent shareholding in Sainsbury’s Bank plc 
from Lloyds Banking Group. The opportunity 
to offer accessible, tailored products that 
reward customers who both bank and shop 
with Sainsbury’s will help boost customer 
numbers and loyalty across all our channels 
and services. 
We announced in January that Justin King 
will step down in July after ten years as Chief 
Executive. His ‘Making Sainsbury’s Great 
Again’ plan transformed our business and 
has seen Sainsbury’s consistently 
outperform the growth of the market. Under 
his leadership, customer transactions have 
increased by ten million a week to around 24 
million, annual sales have grown by £10.3 
billion to £26.4 billion and underlying profit 
before tax has trebled to £798 million. He has 
been a truly exceptional leader and, on 
behalf of your Board and all our colleagues,  
I thank him for his outstanding achievements.
I am delighted that Mike Coupe will lead 
Sainsbury’s on the next phase of its journey. 
Mike is a man of significant experience and a 
proven track record of success, well respected 
by colleagues and within the wider industry. 
No one knows Sainsbury’s – or retail – better 
than he does and he is the natural choice to 
take our Company forward.
A key part of our success is the strength of 
our leadership team, and our focus on 
developing talent from within, ensuring we 
have a great blend of innovative thinking and 
experience. We have made some important 
changes to our Operating Board in the last 
few months. Roger Burnley moved from 
being Managing Director of General 
Merchandise, Clothing and Logistics to 
become Retail and Operations Director, while 
Helen Buck transferred from her role as Retail 
Director to become Business Development 
Director. We are also very pleased to have 
promoted three new people to the Operating 
Board: Peter Griffiths the CEO of Sainsbury’s 
Bank; Paul Mills-Hicks our former Director for 
Outlook
Despite some signs of economic recovery, 
the food retail sector is likely to remain 
challenging for the foreseeable future. 
Customers continue to manage their 
household budgets cautiously and the 
discounters continue to grow market share. 
However, we have consistently performed 
well against this backdrop, and continue to 
see opportunities for growth across multiple 
channels. Our differentiated customer offer 
means we are well positioned to achieve our 
vision to be the most trusted retailer, where 
people love to work and shop.

Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s letter
Dear Shareholder,
In the context of a rapidly changing 
marketplace we have delivered 
good profit growth, outperforming 
our ‘Big Four’
1
 peers and growing 
sales in line with the market. Our 
market share remains at its highest 
for a decade. We are focused on 
delivering high quality, affordable 
products across all our channels, 
helping our customers Live Well for 
Less. Our long-term strategy 
positions us well to continue to 
deliver for customers, colleagues 
and shareholders. 
Consumer confidence has been slowly 
improving over the last 12 months, but 
budgets remain under pressure. The trend 
for ‘savvy shopping’ is now well entrenched, 
with customers shopping little and often, 
mixing visits to supermarkets, convenience 
and discount stores with online purchases.
This is changing the grocery retail landscape, 
with market growth overall being delivered in 
the discount, convenience and online 
channels. The share of market held by core 
grocery supermarkets has declined markedly 
in the last 12 months. 
Our customers care about where their 
shopping comes from and how it is 
produced. They trust us to make the right 
decisions on their behalf across all our 
ranges, from basics through to Taste the 
Difference. We believe this gives us a clear, 
long-term, strategic advantage and we are 
proud, for example, that we are the largest 
retailer of Fairtrade products in the world, 
that all our eggs are from non-caged hens 
and that we have been the largest retailer 
of Marine Stewardship Council sustainable 
seafood for the past four years. 
Our vision is to be the most trusted retailer 
where people love to work and shop, and 
this year we recorded around 24 million 
customer transactions per week, an increase 
of one million since last year. We have 
161,000 colleagues working in our stores, 
depots and store support centres and it is 
down to their hard work and commitment 
that our service standards remain 
consistently high, a fact recognised in 
key industry awards. 
About 12 million people regularly use their 
Nectar card when they shop with us. 
Together with coupon-at-till technology, this 
gives us significant competitive advantage 
and allows us to provide our customers truly 
targeted offers which reflect what they buy 
and incentivises multi-channel shopping. In 
addition, Brand Match, now in its third year, 
continues to reinforce the competitiveness of 
our price position.
Despite the broader economic challenges 
and growing competition, we were the only 
‘Big Four’ supermarket to maintain market 
share this year – at 16.8 per cent
2
. Our 
own-brand food and general merchandise 
ranges, with their focus on quality, value and 
provenance, are growing market share. Our 
supermarkets and our key growth channels 
of convenience and online allow customers 
to shop with us whenever and however they 
want. As a business we are focused on 
investing to ensure that Sainsbury’s 
continues to bring customers an attractive 
differentiated offer, underpinned by our 
quality, service and values.
Justin King, Chief Executive J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 5
Great food
We have invested in our own-brand ranges 
which are growing at over twice the rate of 
branded lines and account for over half our 
food sales. From basics through to Taste the 
Difference, our values and the integrity of our 
products are the same across all our ranges. 
We have long supported British farming and 
this year we achieved 100 per cent British 
sourcing for all our fresh pork, breaded and 
roast chicken, frozen chicken and chicken 
portions. Our popular fresh and hot food 
counters are now in more than 500 stores 
and to date, more than 29,000 colleagues 
have received City & Guilds-accredited 
training through our seven Food Colleges. 
Compelling general merchandise 
and clothing
We offer a winning formula of high street 
style and quality at supermarket prices. 
Non-food sales are growing at over twice the 
rate of food and we are increasing market 
share in key categories. Our non-food ranges 
are on sale in over 400 stores and 34 per cent 
of our customers can now access, within a 
15 minute drive, the full non-food offer, 
compared to 11 per cent six years ago. 
However, with only one in five of our 
supermarkets offering the full range, we still 
have opportunities for growth in this area. 
Currently in 53 stores, our new ‘department 
store’ layout has proved to be popular with 
our customers and this concept will be in 
over 150 stores by the end of next year.
Complementary channels and 
services
Developing channels and services 
complementary to our existing supermarket 
business is key to our long-term strategy for 
growth. Ensuring people can shop whenever 
and however they want is a strong driver of 
loyalty – average spend more than doubles
3
 
when customers shop in our supermarkets, 
convenience stores and online. We now have 
more convenience stores than supermarkets 
in our store estate, and convenience sales 
have grown at around 19 per cent. This year, 
we opened our first Convenience Training 
College in Brixton, London, which will provide 
training courses to colleagues and support 
our growth in the convenience market. 
Groceries Online reached the significant 
milestone of £1 billion in annual sales this 
year, representing growth of over 12 per cent. 
In January, we acquired the remaining 50 
per cent of Sainsbury’s Bank from Lloyds 
Banking Group. The Bank is now a wholly-
owned subsidiary and we expect it to 
become an increasingly important part of 
the value that customers receive from 
Sainsbury’s, further driving customer loyalty. 
Developing new business
Identifying new areas of growth beyond our 
core is also part of our long-term strategy, 
although growth in this area has been slower 
than we would have liked. We are continuing 
to develop our digital entertainment offer 
enabling customers to enjoy their favourite 
ebooks, films and music when, where and 
how they want. Our pharmacy business 
continues to develop through in-store and 
hospital outpatient pharmacies. 
Growing space and property value
We are delivering space growth in line with 
our plans and have increased our estate by 
1 million sq ft, opening 13 supermarkets, six 
extensions and 91 convenience stores during 
the year. We are leveraging our property 
assets working with joint venture partners to 
deliver residential, commercial and leisure 
opportunities alongside new trading space. 
Following a review of our property pipeline 
earlier this year, we identified some sites 
where we no longer wish to build a 
supermarket, resulting in a £92 million 
impairment. Nonetheless we continue to see 
opportunities for future growth. Our property 
portfolio is valued at £12.0 billion whilst sale 
and leaseback activity during the year 
generated profits of £52 million. 
Our values make us different
Our values are part of our 145-year heritage, 
differentiating us from other retailers and 
providing a real competitive advantage. We 
have continued to make progress against our 
20x20 Sustainability Plan across each of our 
five values. I am particularly proud that 
Sainsbury’s is recognised as a great place to 
work – through the development, support 
and the motivation of our colleagues we 
were again awarded Investors in People Gold 
Accreditation, the only supermarket to 
receive this accolade. 
Handing over to Mike Coupe
After ten wonderful years at Sainsbury’s, 
I will leave the business at our AGM in July 
and will hand over to Mike Coupe, our Group 
Commercial Director. Mike played an 
instrumental role in our ‘Making Sainsbury’s 
Great Again’ plan and is ideally equipped to 
lead Sainsbury’s as the Company continues to 
develop and grow in tune with the changing 
consumer and industry environment. 
It has been a privilege to lead the Company 
over the last ten years. I am very proud of 
the team and of what we have achieved 
together. It is the 161,000 colleagues that 
make Sainsbury’s so special and I would like 
to thank them for their amazing efforts over 
the last decade.

Strategic Report
Our marketplace
The changes in consumer 
behaviour we began to see a few 
years ago are now entrenched, 
with increasingly savvy shoppers 
shopping more frequently,  
topping up their supermarket  
and online shop in convenience 
stores and discounters throughout 
the week to manage their budget 
and food waste. 
Sainsbury’s has a clearly differentiated offer, 
based on quality own-brand products, 
sourced with integrity, priced fairly and 
labelled transparently, and supported by a 
great in-store experience. Our high standards 
and investments in quality were evident 
during the horsemeat contamination issue 
in 2013 – with no horsemeat found in any 
Sainsbury’s product. Our strong multi-
channel presence has been a key reason 
why we were the only one of the ‘Big Four’ 
supermarkets to maintain market share over 
the last year – allowing customers to mix 
visits to supermarkets or convenience stores 
with shopping online (chart 3).
 
Despite high levels of promotional activity 
across the sector, Brand Match continues to 
reinforce the competitiveness of our price 
position. Nectar gives us a key competitive 
advantage and, in conjunction with coupon-
at-till technology, enables us to offer our 
customers truly targeted offers on products 
that they want to buy and to incentivise 
multi-channel shopping.
 
The non-food markets in which we operate 
have seen stronger volume and value growth 
in the last year and we expect these markets 
to be more buoyant as the economy returns 
to growth. In contrast to food retailing, the 
recession and the growth of online shopping 
have led to a reduction in the number of 
physical outlets in many non-food areas. 
This increases the attractiveness of 
supermarkets that offer a wide selection of 
non-food ranges which are convenient to 
purchase alongside the supermarket shop 
(chart 5). 
Although consumer confidence is gradually 
recovering, household budgets remain under 
pressure. Whilst disposable income is 
returning to growth, it remains below its 
pre-financial crisis level and a key concern 
for many shoppers. This, together with rising 
utility bills and housing costs, means that 
savvy shopping behaviour learned over the 
past five years has become the norm and 
is unlikely to change in the short term 
(charts 1 and 2).
The UK grocery market remains intensely 
competitive and the lack of volume growth 
means that retailers must work harder than 
ever to attract and retain customers. The 
growth of the discounters has put pressure 
on the ‘Big Four’ and contributed to a high 
level of price investment across the sector, 
particularly on everyday food items, and 
conditions are likely to remain challenging 
for the foreseeable future. However, 
consumers continue to value quality, 
freshness and provenance when choosing 
where to shop (chart 4).

Fresh and hot food counters  
are now in more than  
500 stores
From basics to Taste the Difference, our focus 
on the quality and integrity of our own-brand 
food gives us a clear competitive advantage. 
We continue to invest in our own-brand offer 
and, whilst growth in own-brand is 
deflationary to the top line, it is growing at 
over twice the rate of branded goods and 
accounts for over 50 per cent of food sales. 
Our re-launched by Sainsbury’s range now 
has over 7,000 lines and is driving own-brand 
penetration, with 97 per cent of customers 
buying by Sainsbury’s products. Our 
premium Taste the Difference range achieved 
double-digit growth and reached over 
£1.1 billion in annual sales. In September, a 
state-of-the-art factory opened in Fakenham 
to create Taste the Difference desserts using 
British ingredients and employing 200 people. 
This year, readers of Good Housekeeping 
Magazine voted Taste the Difference the most 
popular supermarket own-brand food range. 
Our basics brand remains the second largest 
value range in the market, bought by nearly 
70 per cent of our customers. Although 
basics sales declined over the year, we 
re-launched the brand with new packaging 
and marketing to drive penetration. 
Our popular fresh and hot food counters are 
in more than 500 stores and we have 316 
award winning in-store cafés. To date, more 
than 29,000 colleagues have received City & 
Guilds-accredited training through our seven 
Food Colleges, and their knowledge and skills 
are helping to drive sales in this area. Our 
‘Make Your Roast Go Further’ campaign 
was a success with our customers, who 
appreciated the easy, budget-beating recipes 
from authentic food-lovers showing how to 
get the most out of leftovers. 
We remained the most trusted food retailer 
of the ‘Big Four’ supermarkets, before, during 
and after last year’s horsemeat contamination 
– with no horsemeat found in any of our 
products. We have conducted isotope testing 
on foods for 20 years, and DNA testing for 10 
years, to guarantee quality and provenance. 
This year we have increased our investment 
in food testing, expanding our laboratory and 
the number of unannounced supplier audits 
we undertake. In addition, we have strong 
working relationships with our 2,500 farmers 
and growers and have invested more than 
£40 million in our farmer development 
groups since 2006. In September 2013, we 
were the first of the ‘Big Four’ supermarkets to 
implement the Department of Health’s new 
universal front of pack nutritional labelling. 
Our customers want to buy British when it is 
available, and we are committed to doubling 
the amount of British food we sell by 2020. 
This year we achieved 100 per cent British 
sourcing for all our fresh pork, breaded and 
roast chicken, frozen chickens and chicken 
portions – our fresh chicken has been British 
for over 10 years. In addition, our fresh and 
frozen beef is British or Irish and the beef in 
our fresh ready meals, pies, sandwiches, 
quiches and soups is British, as are our fresh 
pork sausages, ham and fresh lamb when in 
season. Extending the season is important to 
our growers and is another way we can buy 
more home-grown produce. Last summer,  
we sold over 17 million punnets of British 
strawberries and in August we became the 
only ‘Big Four’ supermarket to sell UK-grown 
fresh figs. We have been the leading retailer of 
British apples and pears for the past five years, 
selling over 200 million pieces, accounting 
for one in every four sold in the UK. 
Improved operating systems and the 
simplification of in-store and depot processes 
have increased productivity and reduced 
food waste without compromising the 
customer experience. Our new ‘Real Time’ 
supply chain system enables us to deliver to 
stores using the most up-to-date stock 
information – improving availability for 
customers and minimising waste. In 
addition, we are introducing an improved 
method of transporting and displaying our 
eggs which reduces breakages significantly, 
leading to less food waste.

Our strategy continued
Compelling general 
merchandise and 
clothing
Offering customers high-street 
quality at supermarket prices 
is key to our success. Sales are 
increasing at over twice the rate  
of food, with a strong performance 
in cookware, kitchen electricals 
and clothing. 
£1bn+
annual sales in  
general merchandise  
and record market share
J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 10 Our general merchandise and clothing 
proposition has a strong focus on quality 
and design and this year we created a 
contemporary department store look and 
feel, with clothing and homeware co-
ordinated and displayed to enhance 
customers’ shopping experience. Currently 
in 53 stores, the response has been positive 
and this concept will be in over 150 stores 
by the end of next year. 
The re-launch of our Tu clothing brand in 
the autumn of 2013 represented the single 
biggest investment in our clothing business 
since 2004. The range is now merchandised 
in more than 400 stores, and is the seventh 
biggest clothing line in the UK by volume, 
and 11
th
 by value. More than 7.5 million 
customers buy the range and it generates 
annual sales of approximately £750 million. 
In January, we signed a new two-year deal 
with Gok Wan, extending a successful 
collaboration with the designer whose 
fashionable, flattering designs are hugely 
popular with our customers.
We are a destination shop for parents looking 
to buy good quality, reasonably priced 
clothing for their children. Tu is the sixth 
largest UK retailer of childrenswear by volume 
and we retained fourth position by volume in 
the schoolwear market. Our Back-to-School 
event in the summer was the most 
successful ever.
Annual sales in general merchandise is over 
£1 billion and continues to grow, making us 
the sixth largest retailer of homeware by 
value and taking us to record levels of market 
share. Building on the success of our 
by Sainsbury’s food offer, we are extending 
the brand into all general merchandise 
categories. Our hero categories, such as 
cookware and kitchen electrical ranges, 
complement our food offer and have 
delivered double-digit growth this year. The 
premium Collection range has performed 
particularly well and our Cook’s Collection 
cast iron range is now bigger than the UK’s 
market-leading brand by volume. 
We have outperformed the market by 
volume in all our entertainment categories 
– games, books, DVDs and CDs – enjoying 
particular success with PS4 and Xbox One 
consoles, own-brand cookery and 
children’s books. 
We continue to engage with our customers 
and enhance our reputation as a credible 
clothing and home retailer through point-of-
sale material, blogs, videos, social media and 
our new website sainsburyshome.co.uk. Our 
strong in-house buying team designs and 
sources attractive, good quality products and 
our offices in the Far East, India and 
Bangladesh build strong relationships with 
suppliers to ensure rigorous checks are 
carried out and that our ethical and quality 
standards are maintained.
Our non-food ranges are on sale in over 400 
stores and 34 per cent of our customers can 
now access, within a 15 minute drive, the full 
non-food offer, compared to just 11 per cent 
six years ago. However, with only one in five 
of our supermarkets merchandising the full 
non-food offer, we still have further 
opportunity for growth.

Our strategy continued
Complementary 
channels and services
Developing channels and services 
that complement our existing 
supermarket business is a key part 
of our long-term strategy for growth. 
By investing in our online and 
convenience businesses, and through 
the acquisition of Sainsbury’s Bank, 
we are focused on driving sales 
through increasing customer loyalty. 
190,000+
deliveries to customers  
each week
£1bn+
annual grocery  
online sales 
J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 12 The trend continues for customers to shop 
across a range of channels – supermarkets, 
convenience stores and online, from home 
and on the go. Helping people shop where, 
when and how they want, across all 
channels, is a key driver of loyalty, and 
where customers shop all three channels 
their total spend is more than double the 
average of a supermarket-only shopper. 
As well as doing their main supermarket 
shop, our customers increasingly top up 
locally, helping them to stick to a budget and 
cut waste and fuel consumption. We opened 
91 convenience stores last year and, with 
over 600 stores, we now have more 
convenience stores than supermarkets in our 
store estate. Our convenience stores now 
account for a third of Britain’s convenience 
market growth. We recently opened our first 
Convenience Training College in Brixton, 
London, which will provide training to 
colleagues and support our growth in this 
market. Thanks to the hard work of over 
16,000 convenience colleagues we were 
named Convenience Retailer of the Year for 
the fourth year running at the Retail Industry 
Awards in September 2013. 
Great locations and an emphasis on fresh 
food have helped our convenience stores 
deliver sales growth of around 19 per cent 
year-on-year, with around six million 
customer transactions each week and an 
annual turnover of over £1.8 billion. 
Christmas Eve was our biggest ever day in 
convenience – with sales of almost £7 million 
recorded. Securing appropriate sites has 
become increasingly competitive, but with 
fewer than one in ten of the population living 
within a 15 minute walk of a Sainsbury’s 
Local, there is plenty of opportunity for us 
to grow, creating jobs for local people and 
helping revitalise high streets through the 
increased footfall and trade our stores 
often bring. 
This year our groceries online business 
reached the significant milestone of £1 
billion in annual sales. Our focus on quality, 
customer service and product availability has 
resulted in customer satisfaction scores that 
are at an all-time high. We were named 
Online Retailer of the Year for the second 
consecutive year at the Grocer Gold Awards 
– a testament to the commitment of the 
14,000 colleagues who make our online 
operation a success. Over the past year we 
have enhanced our groceries online website 
to give customers faster and more intuitive 
product search, and an improved recipe and 
ideas section. In addition, our new mobile 
website gives us a strategic platform on 
which to build new functionality in future 
years. Our groceries online business has 
grown by over 12 per cent during the year, 
delivering to over 190,000 customers each 
week. There was a reduction in the growth of 
marketing spend whilst we re-platformed the 
website which impacted on sales growth in 
the short term. Over 30,000 online customers 
have already purchased our annual online 
delivery pass, which we launched in 
November. We also announced plans to open 
a dedicated online fulfilment centre within 
the next few years in Bromley-by-Bow to 
help meet the growing demand for our 
online grocery service in London and the 
South East. When fully operational this new 
facility will allow us to serve an additional 
20,000 online customers each week.
Our general merchandise website offers 
thousands of own-brand and branded 
products across home, garden, appliances, 
technology, toys, sports and leisure. We are 
continuing to rebalance the online product 
mix, focusing on categories such as cookware 
and kitchen electricals, away from high-
ticket, less profitable electrical items. Over 
half our customers collect their orders 
in-store via our Click & Collect service, 
available in more than 1,000 of our stores.

Our strategy continued
Sainsbury’s Bank is committed to offering 
Sainsbury’s customers banking and financial 
services tailored to their specific needs. 
We consistently offer competitive financial 
products built on value, quality and reward. 
Now that the Bank is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Sainsbury’s, our finance 
products will be even more closely integrated 
with the Sainsbury’s shopping experience.
With the aim of sustaining prudent growth, 
the Bank will continue to manage a 
42-month transition to become a stand-
alone bank. In this time, we will build a new 
banking platform, migrating from Lloyds 
Banking Group systems and contact centres, 
and evolve our risk and control framework. 
We will also build greater people capability 
including the transfer of banking contact 
centre colleagues. The new platform has 
been designed with our customers in mind 
and will offer additional functionality that 
will make doing business with us even easier. 
As we build the new systems, profit growth 
will be constrained by double running costs. 
We will incur a total of £260 million in 
transition costs and capital expenditure 
moving to the new platform.

31%
year-on-year increase 
in the number of Nectar 
points awarded to our 
banking customers
We acquired the remaining 50 per 
cent shareholding of Sainsbury’s 
Bank from Lloyds Banking Group 
on 31 January 2014. Our strategy 
is to increase the number of Bank 
customers and enhance loyalty. 
J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 14 In a challenging marketplace, we have 
continued to see growth in banking against 
a backdrop of falling net interest margins. 
Sainsbury’s Bank offers a range of 
insurance products, savings accounts, credit 
cards, loans and travel money. We currently 
have 1.6 million active customer accounts 
and on average 1.8 million visitors to 
sainsburysbank.co.uk each month.  
27 per cent of these visits are from mobile 
devices, an increase of 54 per cent year-on-
year. We see significant opportunities for 
growth as only one in 20 Sainsbury’s 
customers has a Sainsbury’s Bank product. 
Our financial products and services are 
designed specifically for our customers. 
These include a Nectar Credit Card which 
gives extra points on Sainsbury’s purchases. 
Customers are also rewarded for their 
ongoing loyalty with a range of Bank 
products offering double Nectar points for 
two years. We have seen a 31 per cent 
year-on-year increase in Nectar points 
awarded to our banking customers. 
Our loans regularly feature in best buy  
tables, with Moneynet naming us Most 
Consistent Best Buy Loan Provider 2014.  
The insurance market has become 
increasingly price-driven, reducing retention 
and profitability; despite this, Sainsbury’s 
Home Insurance recorded its best ever sales 
in July and August 2013. In addition, our  
138 in-store Travel Money bureaux recorded 
their best ever performance last summer 
with sales increasing 23 per cent compared 
to 2012. We also opened 107 ATMs in the  
last year and now have over 1,400 across  
our store estate. 
We continue to report industry-low levels of 
customer complaints. Over the last year, 
complaints per 1,000 customers have 
reduced by 30 per cent, a reflection of our 
commitment to delivering the quality of 
service customers expect from Sainsbury’s.
Our strategy for long-term growth is focused 
on unlocking value by offering shoppers 
compelling reasons to bank and shop with 
Sainsbury’s. Customers who take out a Bank 
product spend more with us in-store (up to 
15 per cent more per month once they have 
been with us 24 months), demonstrating 
increased brand loyalty.

Developing  
new business
Developing new business and 
investing beyond our core is part 
of our long-term strategy for the 
future. All new ventures carry a 
certain amount of risk and require 
investment and time to grow, and 
some of the businesses in this area 
are not yet progressing as quickly  
as we would have liked. 
275
in-store pharmacies 
and four outpatient 
pharmacies
J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 16 We are committed to providing in-store 
healthcare services to our customers. Last 
year, pharmacists in our 275 in-store 
pharmacies carried out over 290,000 
consultations, giving 86,000 flu vaccinations 
and conducting over 85,000 cholesterol 
checks. Our stores host 35 NHS GP or 
nurse-led surgeries and 24 private dental 
surgeries – our convenient locations and 
good parking facilities lend themselves 
perfectly to these services. We have four 
hospital outpatient pharmacies offering 
excellent levels of service to the NHS and 
to patients. 
Our mobile phone network – Mobile by 
Sainsbury’s – is still in its first year of 
business and, although we have not 
progressed as quickly as expected, we 
continue to test and learn from the dynamic 
market in which the business operates. 
Mobile by Sainsbury’s is a joint venture with 
Vodafone, offering value-for-money mobile 
phone tariffs and handsets, and incentivising 
customers by offering double Nectar points 
on their grocery and fuel spend in 
Sainsbury’s. As part of our strategy, we have 
introduced dedicated phone shops in some 
of our larger stores, offering customers 
specialist service and advice. In addition, 
we sell SIM cards in our stores, with 300 
stores also offering a range of handsets.

Growing space
and creating  
property value
This year we opened 13 new supermarkets, 
91 convenience stores and extended six 
supermarkets, a total of one million sq ft of 
additional space, in line with our targets. We 
continue to invest strategically in our store 
estate through a programme of extensions 
and refurbishments. 
Our convenience stores accounted for a third 
of Britain’s convenience market growth, with 
sales of over £1.8 billion and year-on-year 
growth of around 19 per cent. We reached a 
milestone in January with the opening of our 
Balsall Common Local, when the number of 
convenience stores in our estate overtook the 
number of supermarkets. Convenience stores 
deliver higher returns and make a valuable 
contribution to the local community, 
bringing increased trade and footfall and 
providing jobs for local people. We continue 
to open around two new Sainsbury’s Locals 
per week. 
Our supermarket opening programme included 
a 50,000 sq ft store in Penzance which opened 
in November, giving a welcome economic and 
employment boost to the area. We recruited 
300 local people, many of whom had 
previously faced tough barriers to employment. 
In the past five years our property 
portfolio has grown by £4.5 billion, 
and its market value is now 
£12.0 billion. Activity during the 
year delivered property profits 
of £52 million and, over five years, 
we have raised £1.2 billion through 
disposals, realising property profits 
of over £335 million. 
Maximising 
our assets
We are maximising our property

status through offsetting partnerships in the 
local community, ensuring that the total 
amount of water used within the catchment 
area will not increase as a result of our stores. 
Following a review of our property pipeline 
we identified a number of sites that we no 
longer wish to develop, resulting in a £92 
million impairment within one-off items.  
Our property valuation as at 15 March 2014 
is £12.0 billion mainly as a result of an 
improvement in yields to 4.7 per cent. We 
continued to take advantage of these good 
property yields, achieving over £300 million 
in property disposal proceeds, generating a 
profit on disposal of £52 million.
To reduce our operational carbon emissions 
by 30 per cent, we have started to build 
highly sustainable, low carbon stores such as 
our new ‘Triple Zero’ stores in Leicester and 
Weymouth. In both these stores we use

residential and commercial opportunities 
whilst adding trading space to our estate. 
We are delivering a £500 million project with 
Barratt London at Nine Elms, building 737 
new homes, a new 80,000 sq ft Sainsbury’s 
store and 27,000 sq ft of local shops, 
restaurants and office space, complementing 
the new Nine Elms tube station development 
on the Northern Line extension. 
We are also investing in our logistics 
infrastructure and opened a new £30 million 
convenience depot in Thameside and, when 
fully operational, the facility will employ over 
600 colleagues, to support the growth of our 
convenience store network in London and 
the South East. Our first dedicated online 
fulfilment centre will also open in the next 
few years and work has begun on a new one 
million sq ft distribution facility in Daventry 
which will create over 900 jobs and support 
our growing general merchandise business. 
Due to open in 2015, it has both road and rail 
operations including a new intermodal 
terminal connected to the existing railway 
infrastructure. Separately, we have relocated 
some other roles from London to our store 
support centres in Coventry and Manchester.

Strategic Report
Our principal risks and uncertainties
The risk management process is closely aligned to our strategy.  
Risk is an inherent part of doing business. The management of these 
risks is based on a balance of risk and reward determined through 
careful assessment of both the potential likelihood and impact as 
well as risk appetite. Consideration is given to both reputational as 
well as financial impact, recognising the significant commercial value 
attributable to the Sainsbury’s brand. Each principal risk and 
uncertainty is considered in the context of how it relates to the 
achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. The current  
business strategy and objectives are categorised into five areas  
of focus as follows:
The risk discussion includes assessment of both gross and net risk, 
where gross risk reflects the risk exposure and risk landscape before 
considering the mitigations in place, and net risk reflects the residual 
risk after mitigations. The gross risk movement from prior year for 
each principal risk and uncertainty has been assessed and is 
presented as follows:
 
No change Increased gross  
risk exposure 
Reduced gross  
risk exposure 
 
Mitigations in place supporting the management of the risk to a net 
risk position are also described for each principal risk and 
uncertainty.
Key risk movements
The key risks are discussed and monitored throughout the year 
to identify changes to the risk landscape. Over the last year, this 
ongoing monitoring of risk has identified the opportunity to 
recognise the challenge around property, optimisation of space 
and the impact of the increasingly competitive landscape as a key 
corporate risk. This has resulted in an additional risk disclosure 
around ‘Space and Property’. Also reflected in the current year 
disclosure is the risk associated with a change in leadership and the 
potential impact on colleague engagement. Finally, the Financial and 
Treasury risk now includes reference to the financial risk exposure to 
the Group post acquiring full ownership of Sainsbury’s Bank.
The most significant principal risks identified by the Board and  
the corresponding mitigating controls are set out below in 
alphabetical order. 
Business continuity and major incidents response
Risk
A major incident or catastrophic event could impact on the 
Group’s ability to trade.
Mitigation
Sainsbury’s has detailed plans in place, supported by senior 
representatives who are trained in dealing with major incidents  
and have the authority levels to make decisions in the event of  
a potentially disruptive incident.
The Business Continuity Steering Group meets quarterly to ensure 
that the business continuity (‘BC’) policy and strategy is fit for 
purpose. In addition, it oversees the mitigation of all risks associated 
with BC and IT disaster recovery. In the event of any unplanned or 
unforeseen events the Business Continuity Management Team is 
convened at short notice to manage the response and any associated 
risk to the business.
All key strategic locations have secondary backup sites which would 
be made available within pre-defined timescales and are regularly 
tested.
Business strategy
Risk
If the Board adopts the wrong business strategy or does not 
communicate or implement its strategies effectively, the 
business may be negatively impacted. Risks to delivering the 
strategy need to be properly understood and managed to 
deliver long-term growth for the benefit of all stakeholders.
Mitigation
A clear strategy remains in place with five key areas of focus:
• 
Great food;
• 
Compelling general merchandise and clothing;
• 
Complementary channels and services;
• 
Developing new business; and
• 
Growing space and creating property value.
Progress against these areas of focus and any risks to delivery, such 
as the availability of suitable new store sites, are regularly reviewed 
by the Board and the overall strategy is reviewed at the annual 
two-day Strategy Conference. The Operating Board also holds regular 
sessions to discuss strategy. This activity is supported by a dedicated 
strategy team. To ensure the strategy is communicated and 
understood, the Group engages with a wide range of stakeholders 
including shareholders, colleagues, customers and suppliers on  
a continual basis.

Colleague engagement, retention and capability
Risk
The Group employs 161,000 colleagues who are critical  
to the success of our business. Attracting and maintaining  
good relations with talented colleagues and investing in their 
training and development is essential to the efficiency and 
sustainability of the Group’s operations. Delivery of the strategic 
objectives, including development of new businesses and 
progress on multi-channel, increases the risk of ability to attract 
and retain talent, specific skill sets and capability. In addition, 
the change of leadership in 2014 will require careful 
management to ensure colleague engagement is maintained 
during the period of transition.
Mitigation
The Group’s employment policies and remuneration and benefits 
packages are regularly reviewed and are designed to be competitive 
with other companies, as well as providing colleagues with fulfilling 
career opportunities. Colleague surveys, performance reviews, 
communications with trade unions and regular communication of 
business activities are some of the methods the Group uses to 
understand and respond to colleagues’ needs. Processes are also in 
place to identify talent and actively manage succession planning 
throughout the business. Ongoing reviews are performed to 
understand the nature of capability and specific skill sets required 
to deliver objectives. This is supported by embracing new ways of 
attracting talent and our corporate value ‘ A great place to work’ 
reinforces our commitment to giving people the opportunity to be 
the best they can be.
A plan is in place to manage the leadership transition and the 
methods described above will continue to be employed to 
understand and maintain colleague engagement during this period. 
Data security
Risk
It is essential that the security of customer, colleague and 
Company confidential data is maintained. A major breach of 
information security could have a major negative financial and 
reputational impact on the business. The risk landscape is 
increasingly challenging with deliberate acts of cybercrime on 
the rise targeting all markets and heightening the risk exposure. 
Mitigation
A Data Governance Committee is established and is supported by 
focused working groups looking at the management of colleague 
data, customer data, information security, commercial data and 
awareness and training. Various information security policies and 
standards are in place which focus on encryption, network security, 
access controls, system security, data protection and information 
handling. A review of key third parties who hold sensitive customer or 
colleague data continues to take place, and progress is monitored by 
the Information Security team. A risk-based security testing 
approach across Sainsbury’s IT infrastructure and applications is in 
place to identify and remediate ongoing vulnerabilities. 
Developing new business
Risk
Exploring a range of new opportunities beyond our core 
business forms part of our five areas of focus. Robust 
identification and management of risks associated with the 
new business development agenda is essential to support 
successful delivery of objectives.
Mitigation
The existing risk management framework and processes embedded 
in the business extend to projects exploring new opportunities 
beyond the core. All projects have a steering group and subject 
matter experts are engaged as appropriate. A formal review and 
approval governance structure is also in place. 
Environment and sustainability
Risk
Environment and sustainability are core to Sainsbury’s values. 
The key risk facing the Group in this area relates to reducing  
the environmental impact of the business with a focus on 
reducing packaging and new ways of reducing waste and 
energy usage across stores, depots and offices.
Mitigation
A number of initiatives are in place, which are being led by the 
Environmental Action Team and the Corporate Responsibility Steering 
Group, to reduce our environmental impact and to meet our 
customers’ expectations in this area. Further details are included in 
the Corporate Responsibility review on pages 47 to 49.
Financial and treasury risk
Risk
The main financial risks are the availability of short and 
long-term funding to meet business needs and fluctuations  
in interest, commodity and foreign currency rates. The business 
has now acquired full ownership of Sainsbury’s Bank which 
presents a risk that the Group’s financial performance and 
position may be negatively impacted if the Bank transition  
and performance is not delivered as planned.
Mitigation
The Group Treasury function is responsible for managing the Group’s 
liquid resources, funding requirements, interest rate and currency 
exposures and the associated risks as set out in note 28 on page 114 
to 119. The Group Treasury function has clear policies and operating 
procedures which are regularly reviewed and audited.
Sainsbury’s Bank operates an enterprise wide risk management 
framework. The principal financial risks relating to the Bank and 
associated mitigations are set out in note 28 to the financial 
statements on page 119 to 120.  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 26
Strategic Report
Our Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued
Health and safety – people and product
Risk
Prevention of injury or loss of life for both colleagues and 
customers is of utmost importance. In addition it is paramount 
to maintaining the confidence our customers have in our 
business.
Mitigation
Clear policies and procedures are in place detailing the controls 
required to manage health and safety and product safety risks across 
the business and comply with all applicable regulations. These cover 
the end-to-end operation, from the auditing and vetting of 
construction contractors, to the health and safety processes in place 
in our depots, stores and offices, to the controls in place to ensure 
people and product safety and integrity. 
In addition, established product testing programmes are also in place  
to support rigorous monitoring of product traceability and provide 
assurance over product safety and integrity. Supplier terms and 
conditions and product specifications set clear standards for product/
raw material safety and quality which suppliers are expected to 
comply with.
Process compliance is supported by external accreditation and 
internal training programmes, which are aligned to both health and 
safety laws and Sainsbury’s internal policies. In addition, resource  
is dedicated to manage the risk effectively, in the form of the Group 
Safety Committee and specialist teams including Convenience Risk 
Managers and Logistics and Commercial Safety Specialists.
IT systems and infrastructure
Risk
The Group is reliant on its IT systems and operational 
infrastructure in order to trade efficiently. Inadequate systems 
or failure of key systems could have a significant impact on our 
business.
Mitigation
The Group has extensive controls in place to maintain the integrity 
and efficiency of its systems including detailed recovery plans in the 
event of a significant failure. New innovations and upgrades to 
systems are ongoing to improve both the customer experience and 
colleague efficiency. Prior to introducing system changes, rigorous 
testing is completed. 
Pension risk 
Risk
The Group operates a number of pension arrangements. These 
are subject to risks in relation to liabilities as a result of changes 
in life expectancy, inflation and future salary increases, and to 
risks regarding the value of investments and the returns derived 
from such investments. 
Mitigation
An investment strategy is in place which has been developed by the 
pension trustee, in consultation with the Company, to mitigate the 
volatility of liabilities, to diversify investment risk and to manage 
cash. In September 2013, the Sainsbury’s Defined Benefit Pension 
Scheme was closed to future contributions which will help us to 
manage the escalating costs of pensions and protect the pensions 
that colleagues have already built up in the Scheme. 
Regulatory environment 
Risk
The Group’s operations are subject to a broad spectrum of 
regulatory requirements. Key areas subject to regulation include 
planning, competition, environmental, employment, pensions 
and tax laws and regulations over the Group’s products and 
services.
Acquiring full ownership of Sainsbury’s Bank introduces risk 
around the Bank failing to meet the requirements of legislation 
and regulatory requirements as defined by the Prudential 
Regulation Authority, Financial Conduct Authority and any 
other relevant regulatory bodies.
Failure to comply with laws and regulations could lead to civil 
and/or criminal legal prosecution and fines or imprisonment 
imposed on Sainsbury’s or our colleagues. In addition, a breach 
could lead to reputational damage.
Mitigation
There is an established governance process in place at both 
Sainsbury’s and Sainsbury’s Bank to monitor regulatory 
developments and to ensure that all existing and forthcoming 
regulations are complied with. 
At Sainsbury’s Bank, conduct risk considerations are fully embedded 
into all relevant Bank activities and the colleague performance 
management framework.
At Sainsbury’s, regular reviews are completed across the estate to 
ensure compliance and that training needs are addressed as required.
Processes for monitoring and embedding training for key new 
legislation are in place and Sainsbury’s also has a dedicated internal 
legal department to provide the relevant colleagues impacted by the 
regulations with advice and guidance. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 27
Space and property
Risk
The Group continues to invest in the core business. Acquiring 
the targeted volume of the right sites and operating new and 
existing space in line with targeted levels of profitability 
presents a risk in an increasingly competitive market. Failure  
to manage this risk may impact delivery of financial targets or 
strategic objectives.
Mitigation
A property pipeline is established and formal approval processes  
are in place to support investment decisions. The performance of  
the estate is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis and a 
refurbishment and refresh programme for supermarkets and 
convenience is in place to maintain and optimise the estate. 
Trading environment
Risk
Effective management of the trading account is key to the 
achievement of performance targets. The continued challenging 
economic environment and competitive retail pressure could 
affect the performance of the Group in terms of sales, costs and 
operations, through:
• 
the ongoing challenges to household disposable income;
• 
competitor pricing positions and continued challenging 
competitive environment; 
• 
the reduction of the industry profit pool; 
• 
commodity costs driving up the cost of goods; and
• 
changing competitive landscape.
There is also a risk of supplier failure, with possible operational 
or financial consequences for the Group.
Mitigation
We adopt a differentiated strategy with a continued focus on 
delivering quality products with ‘universal appeal’, at a range of price 
points ensuring value for all our customers. This is achieved through 
the continuous review of our key customer metrics, monitoring of 
current market trends and price points across competitors, active 
management of price positions, development of sales propositions 
and increased promotion and marketing activity. While external cost 
pressures including oil-related costs, commodity pricing and business 
rates affect our business, the Group continues to work hard to 
mitigate the impact of these cost pressures on customers and on our 
overall profitability through the delivery of cost savings. Sainsbury’s 
undertakes credit checks on suppliers and maintains regular, open 
dialogue with key suppliers concerning their ability to trade.
Transition risk – Sainsbury’s Bank
Risk
Acquiring full ownership of Sainsbury’s Bank introduces 
change-driven operational risk in particular through the 
transitional period. This transitional risk could have an adverse 
impact on people, processes, regulatory compliance and 
technical infrastructure. Failure to transition successfully may 
have an adverse impact on the Sainsbury’s brand. A robust risk 
management process is essential to support successful 
transition. 
Mitigation
Executive sponsorship and a change governance structure is in place 
to manage and oversee the transition including engagement of 
management with financial services experience. The risk 
management process includes early identification of key transitional 
risks along with mitigation plans. Tracking of risk mitigation 
effectiveness will be ongoing throughout the transitional period. 
The Bank has also identified transitional risk as a new and emerging 
risk to the Bank. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 28
Strategic Report
Financial Review
The continued progress of our multi-channel strategy, allowing 
customers to choose where, when and how they shop, enabled us to 
differentiate our offer from that of our competitors. Our convenience 
business grew at around 19 per cent, well ahead of the market, and 
annual sales are now over £1.8 billion. Our online grocery business 
grew at over 12 per cent and annual sales are now over £1.0 billion. 
Own-brand continues to go from strength to strength with strong 
growth in the by Sainsbury’s and Taste the Difference ranges. Brand 
Match continued to reinforce the competitiveness of Sainsbury’s price 
position along with Nectar and coupon-at-till technology, ensuring 
customers are rewarded with relevant offers.
We completed the purchase of the remaining 50 per cent of 
Sainsbury’s Bank on 31 January 2014. Our research shows that 
Sainsbury’s shoppers who also have a Bank product are more loyal 
and spend more in-store, and full ownership provides us with 
significant opportunities to unlock further value by driving additional 
sales through both our financial services and retail businesses.
Sainsbury’s Bank has been equity accounted for the 46 weeks to 
31 January 2014 and 100 per cent consolidated for the four weeks to 
28 February 2014. Sainsbury’s Bank contributed £24 million to UPBT 
in 2013/14, compared to £22 million in 2012/13.
Sainsbury’s achieved around £120 million of operational cost savings 
which offset the impact of inflationary pressures on costs during the 
year. Retail underlying operating profit increased by 5.1 per cent to 
£873 million (2012/13: £831 million), with retail operating margin 
improving by eight basis points (seven basis points at constant 
fuel prices).
Following a review of our property pipeline, we identified some sites 
where we no longer wish to build a supermarket, resulting in a 
£92 million impairment included within one-off items.
Accounting for VAT on the redemption of Nectar points has been  
the subject of a legal case over a number of years between HMRC  
and Aimia, the company which administers the Nectar scheme.  
A Supreme Court ruling in June 2013 ruled in favour of Aimia, thereby 
enabling Sainsbury’s to recognise a credit of £76 million relating to 
historic VAT overpayments.
Dear Shareholder,
Despite the continuing tough 
economic environment, 
Sainsbury’s grew underlying Group 
sales (including VAT) by 2.8 per cent 
to £26,353 million
1
 (2012/13: £25,632 
million) and underlying profit 
before tax (‘UPBT’) by 5.3 per cent 
to £798 million (2012/13
2
: £758 
million). We maintained market 
share at 16.8 per cent despite the 
strong growth of the discounters 
in the retail sector, outperforming 
our ‘Big Four’ peers.
John Rogers, Chief Financial Officer J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 29
In July 2013, we confirmed we would proceed with the proposal 
to close the Sainsbury’s defined benefit pension scheme to future 
accrual. The closure generated a one-off net credit of £148 million 
within one-off items, including £10 million of defined contribution 
transition payments. The defined benefit pension scheme was 
subject to a triennial valuation as at 17 March 2012 that resulted 
in an actuarial deficit of £592 million. This was a decrease of 
£635 million from the March 2009 deficit, mainly as a result of the 
scheme’s £600 million interest in a property partnership. As a result, 
the Company will continue with the recovery plan that was agreed 
after the March 2009 valuation, that included a £49 million annual 
cash contribution towards the deficit.
New space and the investments made over the past few years 
continue to deliver an expected return above the Group’s required 
hurdle rate, with core retail capital expenditure this year lower at 
£888 million (2012/13: £1,040 million). New space delivered a 2.5 per 
cent contribution to sales growth, in line with our expectations.
Return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) is impacted by the consolidation 
of Sainsbury’s Bank, which increased closing capital employed by 
£243 million for only the final four weeks of the year. Adjusting for 
this, ROCE increased by 19 basis points to 11.3 per cent, enhanced 
by the movement in the net pension deficit, which reduces capital 
employed. Excluding the pension fund deficit and adjusting for 
Sainsbury’s Bank, ROCE was 10.4 per cent, in line with the prior year. 
ROCE growth was held back by slower sector growth and reduced 
industry profitability, although this was offset by an improved 
Sainsbury’s underlying operating margin and the property pipeline 
review which resulted in an impairment of £92 million, reducing 
closing capital employed.
Sainsbury’s took advantage of continued good property yields and 
generated funds through the selective sale and leaseback of 
supermarkets that have no further development potential, generating 
£301 million of proceeds through property transactions (2012/13: 
£202 million). This delivered a profit from the disposal of properties of 
£52 million (2012/13: £66 million). The estimated market value of 
the Group’s overall property portfolio increased by £0.5 billion to 
£12.0 billion (16 March 2013: £11.5 billion).
The balance sheet remained strong and the business has funding 
in place of over £3.5 billion, including a new revolving credit facility 
of over £1.1 billion, of which only £0.2 billion was drawn at the 
year-end. Net debt ended the year at £2.4 billion, slightly lower 
than expected, driven by lower capital expenditure.
Underlying basic earnings per share increased to 32.8 pence 
(2012/13: 30.8 pence), a 6.5 per cent improvement year-on-year.  
This was higher than the increase in underlying profit, primarily  
due to the impact of the reduction in the statutory corporation tax 
rate. Basic earnings per share increased by 17.8 per cent to 37.7 
pence (2012/13: 32.0 pence), higher than the underlying measure  
as a result of a profit of £100 million on items excluded from 
underlying results.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 12.3 pence (2012/13: 
11.9 pence), making a full year dividend of 17.3 pence, up 3.6 per 
cent year-on-year (2012/13: 16.7 pence) and covered 1.90 times by 
underlying earnings.
Despite the challenging economic climate, next year will be an 
exciting one for Sainsbury’s as we progress with the programme to 
integrate Sainsbury’s Bank into the business and continue the pace 
of our convenience store opening programme. Alongside this, our 
priority is to maintain tight cost control including an increased 
focus on delivering cross-functional efficiency savings, improving 
operational cash flow and working capital management and driving 
returns from our investments.

Retailing
Retail sales (including VAT) and space
Retail sales (including fuel) increased by 2.7 per cent to  
£26,328 million (2012/13: £25,632 million).
This includes a 2.7 per cent contribution from new space (excluding 
extensions and replacements) and flat like-for-like (‘LFL ’) sales.

Net new space (excluding extensions and replacements) 2.7 2.5
Total sales growth 2.7 4.6
Retail sales (excluding fuel) grew by 2.7 per cent, with LFL growth of 
0.2 per cent, which was higher than the sales including fuel number 
due to a LFL fuel sales decline, with retail price deflation in fuel more 
than offsetting growth in LFL fuel volumes. The LFL growth reflected 
the continued challenging market conditions and was below 
Sainsbury’s full year guidance of 1.0 to 1.5 per cent. Sainsbury’s 
growth was in line with the market, with market share flat year-on-
year at 16.8 per cent for the 52 weeks to 2 March 2014 (as measured 
by Kantar) and growth ahead of our ‘Big Four’ peers.
LFL sales growth (excluding fuel) reduced from 1.4 per cent in the  
first half to a decline of 1.1 per cent in the second half. Sainsbury’s 
delivered LFL growth of 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, driven 
by a very tough sales environment throughout October and 
November. LFL growth declined by 3.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, 
as Sainsbury’s annualised strong performance in the previous 
year driven by the horsemeat cross-contamination issue which 
impacted competitors.
The contribution from net new space (excluding extensions and 
replacements) of 2.5 per cent was in line with Sainsbury’s expectations.
Our multi-channel strategy enables customers to shop where, when 
and how they want. The convenience business grew sales by around 
19 per cent to over £1.8 billion, well ahead of the market, and 
groceries online delivered over £1.0 billion of sales, a year-on-year 
increase of over 12 per cent, lower than the previous year’s growth, 
reflecting a reduction in the growth of marketing spend whilst the 
new website was launched. Sainsbury’s non-food offer continued to 
grow ahead of the market and at over twice the rate of the food 
business, supported by continued range development and the roll 
out of our new ‘department store’ concept to 53 stores.

1. This includes a 0.2 per cent contribution from stores extended in 2013/14, net of disruptions.
Average trading intensity (‘TI’) excluding fuel declined to £18.93 per 
sq ft per week (2012/13: £19.27 per sq ft per week), caused by the 
higher proportion of space for general merchandise and clothing 
(which trades less intensively than food) and a drop in TI in the 
underlying estate due to the challenging economic environment. 
Convenience TIs continued to grow driven by improving TIs in the 
mature estate, supported by the strong performance of new stores.
New space, excluding extensions and replacements, contributed 
2.5 per cent of the 2.7 per cent sales growth (excluding fuel).
Sainsbury’s added a gross 1,013,000 sq ft of selling space in the year 
(including replacements and extensions), an increase of 4.8 per cent 
(2012/13: 1,007,000 sq ft and 4.9 per cent). Including the impact of 
closures, this translated into net space growth of 895,000 sq ft, an 
increase of 4.2 per cent since the start of the year (2012/13: 918,000 
sq ft and 4.5 per cent). Hurdle rates for new supermarkets have been 
raised to ensure that we continue to deliver good returns on our 
future developments and a rationalisation of the property pipeline in 
the year resulted in a £92 million impairment.
Space growth included 13 new supermarkets, of which three were 
replacement stores (2012/13: 14 new supermarkets, of which two 
were replacements). These generated an additional 582,000 sq ft of 
gross selling space (a net 470,000 sq ft), with one store closure. 
Sainsbury’s reduced the number of supermarket refurbishments to 
15 stores and also reduced the number of extensions to six, adding 
218,000 sq ft of selling space (2012/13: eight extensions and 20 
refurbishments added 185,000 sq ft). As part of the refurbishment 
programme we regularly review stores to ensure that we maintain 
the high standards our customers expect.
Convenience continues to be a key area of growth, with 91 stores 
added during the year (2012/13: 87 stores). Three stores were closed 
(2012/13: four stores) and 39 refurbished (2012/13: 15 stores),  
with net convenience space growth of 207,000 sq ft, an increase of 
17.1 per cent since the start of the year (2012/13: 182,000 sq ft and 
17.7 per cent), meeting our target of opening around two new stores 
per week.
Net of replacements, closures and disposals, closing space of 
22,160,000 sq ft was 4.2 per cent higher than last year (2012/13: 
21,265,000 sq ft). J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 31

In 2014/15, Sainsbury’s expects LFL sales and the contribution from 
extensions (net of disruptions) to be similar to 2013/14. Contribution 
from new space (excluding extensions and replacements) is expected 
to be around 2.0 per cent.
In 2014/15, Sainsbury’s expects to deliver around 750,000 sq ft of 
gross new space, with around two new convenience store openings 
per week.
Retail underlying operating profit
Retail underlying operating profit increased by 5.1 per cent to 
£873 million (2012/13: £831 million), reflecting cost savings of 
around £120 million in the year, offsetting the impact of cost inflation.
Retail underlying operating margin improved by eight basis points 
year-on-year to 3.65 per cent (2012/13: 3.57 per cent), which was a 
seven basis point improvement at constant fuel prices. Retail 
underlying EBITDAR margin increased by 21 basis points to 8.05 per 
cent, an 18 basis point improvement at constant fuel prices.
In 2014/15, Sainsbury’s expects cost inflation towards the lower end 
of the two to three per cent range and efficiency savings of around 
£120 million to £130 million.

Financial services – Sainsbury’s Bank
Sainsbury’s completed its purchase of the remaining 50 per cent of 
Sainsbury’s Bank on 31 January 2014. Sainsbury’s Bank has been 
equity accounted for the 46 weeks to 31 January 2014 and 100 per 
cent consolidated for the four weeks to 28 February 2014. The Bank 
contributed £24 million to 2013/14 UPBT (2012/13: £22 million).

6.  Year-end tier one capital divided by year-end risk-weighted assets.
Sainsbury’s Bank total income fell by 4.2 per cent to £229 million 
(2012/13: £239 million), mainly due to a reduction in the earned 
interest rate on the loans book driven by strong competition and a 
decline in commission income driven by price deflation in insurances, 
particularly car insurance.
Sainsbury’s Bank delivered an underlying operating profit of 
£53 million, a 10.2 per cent decrease year-on-year. This reduction 
was driven by reduced total income and a provision relating to 
potential customer redress payable in respect of Card Protection Plan 
insurance and similar products. This provision is in line with the 
outcome of a market review by the Financial Conduct Authority, 
which found that these had been widely mis-sold by several financial 
institutions. This was partly offset by favourable bad debt levels, 
which as a percentage of lending improved to 1.1 per cent 
(2012/13: 1.3 per cent).
Net interest margin increased by 35 basis points year-on-year to 
3.1 per cent (2012/13: 2.7 per cent) mainly driven by changes to the 
funding structure. The tier one capital ratio increased by 98 basis 
points year-on-year to 13.6 per cent (28 February 2013: 12.6 per 
cent), reflecting the improvements in the underlying capital position.
In 2014/15, Sainsbury’s Bank is expected to make a similar level of 
underlying operating profit to 2013/14. Strategic Report

J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 32
Property and other joint ventures (‘JV’)
Sainsbury’s underlying share of post-tax profit from its JV with British 
Land was £14 million (2012/13: £14 million). Its underlying share of 
post-tax profit from the JV with Land Securities was £2 million 
(2012/13: £2 million).
At the year-end, there was no surplus or loss on revaluation 
recognised within the share of post-tax profit from the JVs in the 
income statement (2012/13: £10 million loss). An increase in the 
average yield to 5.2 per cent (2012/13: 5.1 per cent) was offset by 
rental increases.
Two JVs were set up post half-year 2012/13, Mobile by Sainsbury’s 
and I
2
C, which recognised a net loss of £4 million, driven by initial 
start-up costs.
In 2014/15, Sainsbury’s expects the property JVs to make a similar 
level of profit to 2013/14. The start-up JVs are expected to make a 
similar level of loss to 2013/14.
Underlying net finance costs
Underlying net finance costs were in line with the prior year at 
£111 million (2012/13: £111 million), with a reduction in capitalised 
interest offset by savings on gross interest mainly due to a decrease 
in the inflation rate on the Group’s inflation-linked debt

Sainsbury’s expects underlying net finance costs in 2014/15 to

£20 million.
Items excluded from underlying results
Items excluded from underlying results totalled £100 million 
(2012/13: £14 million), mainly due to one-off items, profit on 
disposal of properties and acquisition adjustments, partly offset by

defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual (including £10 
million of defined contribution transition payments); an impairment 
of £92 million to write down the value of certain sites where the 
Group no longer intends to build a supermarket to their recoverable 
amount; £76 million relating to historic VAT overpayments made in 
relation to Nectar redemptions of points in-store; £45 million in 
relation to the purchase of the remaining 50 per cent of Sainsbury’s 
Bank and transitioning the Bank to a new, more flexible banking 
platform; and other one-off costs of £19 million mainly in relation 
to internal restructuring and a provision for a commercial item, for 
which we intend to defend our position.

transitioning to a new, more flexible banking platform are expected 
to be around £45 million (capital costs relating to the transition are 
expected to be around £60 million).
Taxation 
The income tax charge was £182 million (2012/13

with an underlying tax rate of 21.9 per cent (2012/13

: 23.6 per cent) 
and an effective tax rate of 20.3 per cent (2012/13
1
: 22.0 per cent). 
The underlying and effective tax rates were lower than last year, 
primarily as a result of the one per cent lower statutory corporation 
tax rate and the impact of further reductions in the statutory rate on 
the revaluation of deferred tax balances.

In 2014/15, Sainsbury’s expects the underlying tax rate to be 
between 23.5 and 24.5 per cent. In 2013/14, the revaluation of 
deferred tax balances reduced the underlying tax rate, but there will 
be no such adjustment in 2014/15, causing the rate to increase 
despite the one per cent fall in next year’s statutory corporation 
tax rate. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 33
In the UK, there are a large number of taxes, of which many are 
relevant for Sainsbury’s. In 2013/14, Sainsbury’s paid £1.8 billion 
(2012/13: £1.5 billion) to the UK government, of which £825 million 
(2012/13: £773 million) was borne by Sainsbury’s and the remaining 
£949 million (2012/13: £761 million) was collected on behalf of our 
colleagues, customers and suppliers. Sainsbury’s participate in the 
Total T ax Contribution PwC Survey for The 100 Group of Finance 
Directors. In the year to March 2013, our total taxes borne ranked 
seventh amongst the survey participants.
The key taxes paid by Sainsbury’s were business rates of £432 million 
(2012/13: £396 million), employers’ national insurance of £141 million 
(2012/13: £128 million) and UK corporation tax of £140 million 
(2012/13: £143 million). Other taxes including customs duty, excise duty, 
VAT and energy taxes totalled £112 million (2012/13: £106 million).
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share increased by 6.5 per cent to 
32.8 pence (2012/13: 30.8 pence), reflecting the improvement in 
UPBT and the lower underlying tax rate year-on-year, partially offset 
by the effect of additional shares issued during the year.
The weighted average number of shares in issue was 1,896.8 million 
(2012/13: 1,881.5 million), an increase of 15.3 million shares or 
0.8 per cent. Basic earnings per share increased to 37.7 pence 
(2012/13: 32.0 pence). Basic earnings per share were higher than the 
underlying basic earnings per share due to the items excluded from 
underlying results.

Dividends
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 12.3 pence per 
share (2012/13: 11.9 pence), which will be paid on 11 July 2014 to 
shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business 
on 16 May 2014, subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM. 
This will increase the full year dividend by 3.6 per cent to 17.3 pence 
per share (2012/13: 16.7 pence). The dividend is covered 1.90 times 
by underlying earnings (2012/13
1
: 1.84 times).
The proposed final dividend was recommended by the Board on 
6 May 2014 and, as such, has not been included as a liability as at 
15 March 2014.
Sainsbury’s remains focused on delivering returns to shareholders. 
The Board intends to continue to increase the dividend each year and 
to build cover to two times over the medium term, although cover 
may fall in 2014/15 given the updated tax rate guidance.
1.  The prior year financial information has been restated to reflect the adoption of IAS 19 Revised.
Financing
The Group’s key financing objectives are to diversify funding sources, 
to minimise refinancing risk and to maintain appropriate standby 
liquidity. As at 15 March 2014, the Group had drawn borrowing 
facilities of £2.7 billion and undrawn but committed borrowing 
facilities of £950 million at its disposal.
The principal elements of the Group’s core borrowings comprise of 
two long-term loans of £929 million due 2018 and £829 million due 
2031, both secured over property assets. In addition, the Group has 
unsecured borrowings totalling £204 million with maturities ranging 
from 2014 to 2017, unsecured private placement loans totalling £184 
million with maturities ranging from 2015 to 2017, a £190 million 
public issue convertible bond due July 2014 and £188 million of hire 
purchase facilities and other finance leases.
In February 2014, the Group entered into a new syndicated 
committed revolving credit facility for £1,150 million, replacing the 
£690 million facility which was due to mature in October 2015. The 
new facility is split into two tranches, a £500 million facility maturing 
in March 2017 and a £650 million facility maturing in March 2019. 
As at 15 March 2014, £200 million had been drawn under the £500 
million facility (2012/13: £nil). The £1,150 million facility, bank loans 
and private placement loans contain only one financial covenant, 
being the ratio of EBITDAR to consolidated net interest plus net rental 
expenditure, the ‘Fixed Charge Cover’ ratio. As at the year-end, 
Sainsbury’s comfortably passed this covenant test.
Net debt and cash flows
Sainsbury’s net debt includes the cost of acquiring Sainsbury’s 
Bank, but excludes Sainsbury’s Bank’s own net debt balances.  
As at 15 March 2014, net debt was £2,384 million (2012/13: £2,162 
million), an increase of £222 million year-on-year. This was driven 
primarily by the additional funding used to acquire Sainsbury’s Bank 
and an increase in working capital, offset by cash generated from 
sale and leasebacks and lower investments in new space.
Operating cash flows before changes in working capital increased 
by 5.6 per cent to £1,366 million (2012/13: £1,294 million), but 
cash generated from operations decreased by 3.2 per cent to £1,227 
million (2012/13: £1,268 million, 1.8 per cent decrease) due to an 
adverse movement in working capital.
Working capital increased by £139 million year-on-year (2012/13: £26 
million increase) mainly driven by a decrease in trade payables of £62 
million driven by the phasing of Easter, a decrease in other payables 
of £67 million and £10 million of other working capital movements.
The net cash used in investing activities of £590 million was £272 
million lower year-on-year (2012/13: £862 million) driven by lower 
capital expenditure and higher proceeds from property transactions.
The £1,016 million acquisition of Sainsbury’s Bank net of cash 
acquired, consists of £1,259 million cash acquired offset by the 
£243 million cash payment. Sainsbury’s Bank cash balances of 
£1,225 million, and derivatives, which relate to the working capital of

£200 million bank loan maturing in July 2014, a £50 million hire 
purchase facility maturing in June 2018 and a £200 million drawing 
under the new £1,150 million syndicated committed revolving credit 
facility part maturing in 2017 and 2019. The new debt offsets 
£439 million of borrowings repaid during the year. Strategic Report

Retail capital expenditure
Core retail capital expenditure decreased by £152 million year-on-
year to £888 million (2012/13: £1,040 million), due to a reduction in 
the value of land purchases and expenditure on future new stores, 
driven by the phasing of spend on larger-scope projects. Sainsbury’s 
stepped up its convenience store opening programme in the year 
with 91 new convenience stores (2012/13: 87 convenience stores) 
and completed 54 refurbishments (2012/13: 35 refurbishments), 
including 15 supermarkets (2012/13: 20 supermarkets) and 39 
convenience stores (2012/13: 15 convenience stores).
Core retail capital expenditure as a percentage of sales (including 
fuel, including VAT) was 3.4 per cent (2012/13: 4.1 per cent).
Sainsbury’s also took advantage of continued good property yields 
in the year to achieve £301 million in sale and leaseback proceeds 
(2012/13: £202 million), which contributed to a total profit on 
disposal of properties of £52 million (2012/13: £66 million). Net retail 
capital expenditure was £628 million (2012/13: £875 million).

In 2014/15, Sainsbury’s expects core retail capital expenditure 
(excluding Sainsbury’s Bank) to be similar to 2013/14. Core retail 
capital expenditure as a percentage of retail sales (including fuel, 
including VAT) is expected to be in line with 2013/14 at 3.4 per cent, 
reducing to below 3.0 per cent from 2015/16 onwards.
Return on capital employed
Return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) is impacted by the consolidation 
of Sainsbury’s Bank, which increased closing capital employed by 
£243 million. Adjusting for this, ROCE over the 52 weeks to 15 March 
2014 was 11.3 per cent (2012/13: 11.1 per cent), an increase of 19 
basis points year-on-year, enhanced by the increase in the net 
pension deficit, which reduces capital employed. 
ROCE excluding the net pension deficit and adjusting for Sainsbury’s 
Bank over the 52 weeks to 15 March 2014 was 10.4 per cent 
(2012/13: 10.4 per cent). ROCE growth was held back by slower sector 
growth and reduced industry profitability, although this was offset by 
an improved Sainsbury’s operating margin and the property pipeline 
review which resulted in an impairment of £92 million, reducing 
closing capital employed.

Summary balance sheet
Shareholders’ funds as at 15 March 2014 were £6,005 million 
(2012/13: £5,838 million), an increase of £167 million. This is mainly 
attributable to the continued profitable growth of the underlying 
business and investment in space to support future growth, offset by 
the increase in the net retirement benefit obligation (net of deferred 
tax) and net debt.
The book value of property, plant and equipment, including land and 
buildings, has grown by £58 million (£76 million when Sainsbury’s 
Bank is consolidated by line). This was driven by continued space 
growth offset by the sale and leaseback of stores with no further 
development potential and a £92 million write-down of certain sites 
where the Group no longer intends to build a supermarket.
Net debt was £222 million higher than at 16 March 2013 driven by a 
£243 million increase attributable to the acquisition of Sainsbury’s 
Bank and an increase in working capital. These increases were partly 
offset by the continued profitable growth of the underlying business 
and a reduction in capital expenditure year-on-year.
Net assets of £485 million as a result of the full consolidation of 
Sainsbury’s Bank have been included and separately identified.
Retail adjusted net debt to EBITDAR is 3.9 times (2012/13: 3.8 times) 
and interest cover improved to 8.2 times (2012/13: 7.8 times). Fixed 
charge cover remained consistent at 3.1 times (2012/13: 3.1 times). 
Gearing increased year-on-year to 39.7 per cent (2012/13: 37.0 per cent) 
mainly as a result of the increase in net debt. Excluding the pension 
deficit, gearing reduced to 35.7 per cent (2012/13: 33.7 per cent). J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 35

properties, including our 50 per cent share of properties held 
within property JVs, was £12.0 billion (2012/13: £11.5 billion). 
The £0.5 billion increase year-on-year was driven by a 27 basis point 
improvement in the yield to 4.7 per cent (2012/13: 4.9 per cent) 
contributing £0.6 billion and property value added of £0.2 billion, 
partly offset by sale and leasebacks of £0.3 billion.

Defined benefit pensions 
As a result of the amendments made under IAS 19 Revised, the 
Group has restated prior year financial information in accordance 
with the revised standard. Application of the revised standard has 
resulted in an increase to UPBT of £1 million (2012/13: £2 million) 
and an additional charge of £23 million outside of UPBT during the 
52 weeks to 15 March 2014 (2012/13: £18 million charge). Net assets 
increased by £104 million as at 17 March 2013 as a result of the 
removal of the expense reserve from the pension liability.

Following a comprehensive consultation, we announced the closure 
of Sainsbury’s defined benefit (‘DB’) pension scheme to future accrual 
from 28 September 2013. This plan amendment generates a past 
service credit of £172 million, offset by £14 million of enhanced early 
retirement costs. Additional transitional contributions of £10 million 
were also made to active members’ defined contribution (‘DC’) plans 
across the second half of the year.
As at 15 March 2014, the post-tax pension deficit was £679 million, 
£95 million higher year-on-year (16 March 2013: £584 million). The 
one-off past service credit as a result of the closure of the scheme to 
future accrual reduced the deficit by £158 million; however this was 
more than offset by a 0.3 per cent fall in the real discount rate and 
changes in other assumptions that increased the liability by £416 
million. This was partly offset by a slight outperformance of assets, 
which returned 5.7 per cent over the year.
The DB pension scheme was subject to a triennial valuation at March 
2012 by Towers Watson, the scheme’s independent actuaries. On the 
basis of the assumptions agreed, the actuarial deficit at 17 March 
2012 was £592 million, a decrease of £635 million from the March 
2009 deficit of £1,227 million, mainly as a result of the scheme’s 
circa £600 million interest in a property partnership. As a result, the 
Company will continue with the recovery plan that was agreed with 
the Group after the valuation as at March 2009. This incorporates a 
£49 million annual cash contribution towards the deficit. 
The IAS 19 Revised pension service cost included within UPBT for the 
52 weeks to 15 March 2014 was £34 million (2012/13: £59 million).
Sainsbury’s will not incur an IAS 19 Revised service cost post closure 
of the DB scheme to future accrual. Contributions to the DB scheme 
have been replaced by contributions to the DC schemes.

Directors’ Report
In this statement, I have picked out some aspects of governance which are 
particularly notable for shareholders. These are described in more detail in 
the following pages.
Succession
We take succession at Board and senior management level very seriously 
and we believe that we have a good record of identifying the resourcing 
needs of the business, developing our own people, attracting external talent 
and planning and implementing change. Managing the succession of a chief 
executive is a key priority for any board. In January, we announced that 
Justin King will stand down in July after ten very successful years as Chief 
Executive and that Mike Coupe will succeed him. Mike joined Sainsbury’s in 
2004 and was appointed to the Board in August 2007. Since July 2010, he has 
been Group Commercial Director. He has a deep understanding of Sainsbury’s 
and over 20 years of experience in retail businesses. Our Chief Executive 
succession planning process took place over a number of years. It included a 
comprehensive external search facilitated by Egon Zehnder International and 
enabled the Board to conclude that Mike was the best possible candidate to 
take the Company forward. One of the Board’s key priorities in the year ahead 
is to ensure and support a smooth transition from Justin to Mike.
Since I joined the Board as Chairman in November 2009, we have appointed 
three new Non-Executive Directors, Matt Brittin, Jean Tomlin and Susan Rice, 
who have brought new skills and experience to the Board, as well as adding 
to our broad diversity. With Mike’s succession as Chief Executive taking place 
after our AGM in July 2014, the Board has concluded that it is important to 
maintain Board stability as the Company goes through this important period 
of transition. 
As a result, although Gary Hughes reaches the ninth anniversary of his 
appointment at the 2014 AGM, the Board believes that it is in shareholders’ 
best interests for him to remain on the Board for another year, until the 2015 
AGM. This will also enable Gary to play a key role in the audit tender planned 
for later this year. The Board believes that Gary continues to make an 
outstanding contribution to the Company, particularly as Audit Committee 
Chairman, where his deep understanding of the business and robust 
leadership continue to be a source of great strength. The Board has concluded 
that Gary continues to be independent in every respect notwithstanding the 
time that he has spent on the Board. In the next 12 months we expect to 
appoint a Non-Executive Director who will succeed Gary as Audit Committee 
Chairman in July 2015.
David Tyler 
Chairman
Corporate Governance 
statement
Dear Shareholder,
Your Board remains committed  
to effective governance and to 
Sainsbury’s unique values and 
culture, which have played a key 
role in our success. 
Board evaluation
During the year, a thorough review of your Board’s performance was 
completed by Manchester Square Partners, who provide board evaluation and 
advisory services and have no other relationship with Sainsbury’s. Our last 
external review was completed in January 2011. This was also conducted by 
Manchester Square Partners, but by different partners. Since 2011, we have 
conducted comprehensive internal reviews which have ensured that we have 
continued to build on our strengths, and that we are working effectively. This 
year’s review, which is described in detail below, concluded that “the Board 
functions extremely well and in line with first class corporate governance with 
shared values, open dialogue, strong levels of trust, respect and collaboration, 
but also appropriate challenge”. We have identified a forward looking action 
plan to build on our strong foundations.
Diversity
One of our strengths continues to be our diversity, which is the result of a 
high proportion of women having been appointed on merit throughout the 
organisation. We have three women on our Board (30 per cent) and three on 
our Operating Board (27 per cent), exceeding the aspirational target of the 
Davies Report that 25 per cent of the Board positions at FTSE 100 companies 
should be filled by women by 2015. A review of our broad diversity targets is 
set out on page 46.
Remuneration
There continues to be a great deal of focus on Directors’ remuneration and 
the way it is disclosed. Under Mary Harris’ leadership, the Remuneration 
Committee has ensured that there is a direct link between pay and 
performance in the areas most valued by our shareholders. Our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, including Mary’s annual statement to shareholders, 
is set out on pages 55 to 73 and reflects the latest remuneration reporting 
regulations. At this year’s AGM, shareholders will have the opportunity to 
participate in a binding vote on our forward looking Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, as well as an advisory vote on the remainder of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Sainsbury’s has again this year complied with all provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. We believe that our strong governance, culture 
and values will continue to hold us in good stead for the future.
David Tyler
Chairman J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 41
The role of the Board
The Board is chaired by David Tyler and, at the year-end, there were three 
Executive Directors and six Non-Executive Directors. John McAdam is the 
Senior Independent Director. The Directors’ biographical details are set out 
on page 37. 
The Board’s key focus in helping to create long-term sustainable value for 
shareholders is on strategic leadership, performance management, investor 
relations, risk management, governance and succession planning, each of 
which is described below. The Board has a scheduled forward programme of 
meetings to ensure that we can allocate sufficient time to each of these key 
areas. This enables us to plan Board and Committee meetings appropriately 
and use the Board’s time most effectively. There is sufficient flexibility in the 
programme for specific items to be added to any particular agenda and this 
ensures that the Board can focus on the key matters relating to the business 
at the appropriate time. 
The Board’s scheduled forward programme includes the following items, 
some of which are considered at each meeting, and others are reviewed 
periodically throughout the year:
There are also a number of informal meetings of the Board, which enable all 
the Directors to spend more time together and to discuss specific areas of the 
business with individual Operating Board members. 
Our annual Board evaluation exercise enables us to review whether Board 
meetings are structured with a clear focus on the key issues facing the 
Company, with a full and open debate before major decisions are taken. We 
ensure that all Directors are aware of the key discussions and decisions of 
each of the four principal Committees – the Chairman of each Committee 
provides a detailed summary to all Directors at the Board meeting following 
the relevant Committee meeting. Minutes of Board and Committee meetings 
are circulated to Directors shortly after those meetings take place. The Board 
has a schedule of formally reserved powers, which it reviews each year, and 
receives a number of in-depth presentations during the year.
Strategic leadership
The Board continued to focus on strategic matters during the year. We held a 
two-day Strategy Conference in the autumn, which all the Operating Board 
Directors attended. This enabled the Board to conduct an in-depth review of 
relevant economic factors and their likely impact on customers and the 
market, to evaluate key opportunities and threats, consider the five-year 
corporate plan and agree the strategic goals for the short-term and longer 
term perspectives, and the five areas of focus described on pages 8 to 19. 
The Chief Executive and Group HR Director then presented a review of 
succession planning, talent and development to the Nomination Committee 
which enabled them to review the capability, succession planning and 
resourcing necessary to achieve the strategic priorities. The Board receives a 
detailed half-year strategy update on progress against the agreed priorities 
and then, to complete the cycle in July, agrees the objectives and principal 
areas of focus for the next conference. Specific projects are considered at 
other meetings during the year as necessary. Our 2014 Board evaluation 
exercise concluded that the Board continued to make good progress in driving 
the strategic debate during the year.
The Board was fully involved in the decision to acquire full ownership of 
Sainsbury’s Bank, announced in May 2013. In-depth reviews were presented 
at a number of Board meetings setting out the strategic opportunity, the risks  
and the funding options, together with the related regulatory requirements. 
In January 2014, we announced the completion of the acquisition. The Board 
will receive regular updates on the transition process and the Bank’s strategy. 
We expect the Bank to become an increasingly important part of the  
value that customers receive from Sainsbury’s and another driver of  
customer loyalty. 
Performance management 
Performance against delivery of the agreed key targets is reviewed at every 
meeting with particular reference to the detailed Group management 
accounts. The Chief Executive, Group Commercial Director and Chief Financial 
Officer comment on the market and current trading at each meeting and 
present comparative data and customer insight. 
Risk management
The Board reviews the Company’s principal risks on an annual basis, in 
addition to receiving regular updates on risk management and internal 
controls from the Chairman of the Audit Committee after each Committee 
meeting (see page 53 for further details). The Board also receives an annual 
update on all matters relating to safety, supported by quarterly updates, 
together with updates on other relevant controls and governance. Any 
specific issues on these and other matters which might affect the Company’s 
reputation are reported to the Board as they occur. 
Investor relations
The Board receives an annual independent survey at the Strategy Conference 
from Makinson Cowell which reports on the views of major shareholders  
and analysts, together with updates at each Board meeting on the Investor 
Relations (‘IR’) programme and feedback from major shareholders, 
particularly following each major announcement of the Company’s results. 
See page 43 for further details.
Division of responsibilities 
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive which is set out in writing and has been approved by the 
Board. The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring its 
effectiveness and setting its agenda to enable the Board to fulfil all aspects 
of its role. As set out above, we ensure that the Board has sufficient time 
to allocate to its key areas of focus throughout the annual cycle of Board 
meetings. The Chairman ensures effective communication with shareholders 
and that the Board is aware of the views of major shareholders. He facilitates 
the contribution of the Non-Executive Directors through a culture of openness 
and debate, and ensures constructive relations between Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors. 
The Chief Executive is responsible for the day-to-day management of the 
Company and executing the strategy, once agreed by the Board. He creates 
a framework of strategy, values, organisation and objectives to ensure 
the successful delivery of results and allocates decision making and 
responsibilities accordingly. He takes a leading role, with the Chairman,  
in the relationship with all external agencies and in promoting Sainsbury’s.

Compliance
The following sections explain how the Company applies the main 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’). The Board is 
committed to strong governance and, during the year, the Company has 
complied with all the provisions of the Code. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 42
Independence 
The Non-Executive Directors bring wide and varied commercial experience to 
Board and Committee deliberations. On appointment they confirm that they 
will have sufficient time available to be able to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. They are appointed for an initial three-year term, subject to 
election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment and at each 
AGM thereafter, after which their appointment may be extended for further 
terms, subject to mutual agreement. All members of the Board, other than 
Justin King, will retire by rotation and seek re-election by shareholders at this 
year’s AGM in accordance with the Code. 
The Chairman satisfied the independence criteria of the Code on his 
appointment to the Board in October 2009 and all the Non-Executive Directors 
are considered to be independent. Gary Hughes reaches the ninth anniversary 
of his appointment at the AGM in July. The Board has concluded that it is in 
shareholders’ best interests for him to remain on the Board for another year 
until the 2015 AGM in order to maintain Board stability as the Company goes 
through the important period of transition from Justin King to Mike Coupe.  
This will also enable Gary to play a key role in the audit tender planned for later 
this year. The Board believes that Gary, who has been our Audit Committee 
Chairman, since his appointment, continues to make an outstanding  
contribution to the Company, particularly as Audit Committee Chairman where 
his deep understanding of the business and robust leadership continue to be 
a source of great strength. The Board has concluded that Gary continues to be 
independent in every respect notwithstanding the time that he has spent on 
the Board. In the next 12 months we expect to appoint a Non-Executive 
Director who will succeed Gary as Audit Committee Chairman in July 2015.
The Board has specifically considered the executive or non-executive roles 
that some of the Non-Executive Directors have with companies who may be 
in competition with, or suppliers to, Sainsbury’s. The Board is satisfied that 
the independence of the Directors who have executive or non-executive roles 
with other companies is not compromised and that they all have sufficient 
time available to devote to the Company.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 provides that directors must avoid a situation where 
they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly 
may conflict, with the company’s interests. Directors of public companies may 
authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate, if a company’s 
articles of association permit. The Board has established procedures for the 
disclosure by Directors of any such conflicts, and also for the consideration 
and authorisation of these conflicts by the Board. In accordance with the Act, 
the Board considered and authorised each Director’s reported potential 
conflicts of interest during the year. Whenever a Director takes on additional 
external responsibilities, the Board considers any potential conflicts that may 
arise and whether the Director continues to have sufficient time to fulfil his or 
her role as a Director of the Company. The Board will continue to monitor and 
review potential conflicts of interest on a regular basis.
In the 2012 and 2013 reports, the Board disclosed that it had considered 
a potential conflict for Justin King, whose son, Jordan King, is one of the 
country’s top young racing drivers. His success is attracting interest from 
potential sponsors. Current sponsors include high net-worth individuals and 
companies with established interests in motor sport. Some of the sponsors are 
also suppliers to Sainsbury’s. Jordan King arranges his sponsorships through 
his company, 42 Racing Ltd. The Board has again satisfied itself that Justin 
King has no direct involvement in the trading relationship between Sainsbury’s 
and any supplier who may have an interest in 42 Racing Ltd. It remains 
satisfied that the governance of all supplier relationships is robust and that 
there is therefore no conflict of interest regarding these arrangements.
Information 
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all Directors are properly briefed 
on issues arising at Board meetings and that they have full and timely access 
to relevant information. The quality and supply of information provided to the 
Board is reviewed as part of the Board evaluation exercise. The conclusion 
from this year’s evaluation was that Board processes and documentation are 
thorough and comprehensive.
Directors’ induction and development
We have a programme for meeting Directors’ training and development 
requirements. Newly appointed Directors who do not have previous public 
company experience at Board level are provided with detailed training on 
their role and responsibilities. All new Directors participate in a 
comprehensive and tailored induction programme including store and depot 
visits and meetings with other members of the Board, members of the 
Operating Board, senior management and external advisors. The induction 
programme includes a full review of corporate responsibility and the 
Company’s values and culture. This programme is ongoing for Non-Executive 
Directors who often meet members of the management team on an 
individual basis to continue to build their knowledge of the Company, or visit 
stores, depots and suppliers. Subsequent training is available on an ongoing 
basis to meet any particular needs. 
Since her appointment to the Board in June 2013 Susan Rice’s induction 
programme has included each of the aspects described above, as well as a 
number of meetings with Sainsbury’s Bank. Her induction will continue into 
2014/15. Jean Tomlin has completed her formal induction programme during 
the year and continues to meet with members of the management team and 
to participate in other events to build her knowledge of the business. 
During the year, the Company Secretary, Tim Fallowfield, has provided 
updates to the Board on relevant governance matters, Directors’ duties and 
obligations, and new legislation and its impact on the Company. The Audit 
Committee regularly considers new accounting developments through 
presentations from management and the external auditors. This year this 
included updates on the introduction of the Strategic Report, changes to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, including the requirement to sign off the 
annual report as fair, balanced and understandable, and the proposed 
changes to audit tender and mandatory audit firm rotation rules by the 
Competition Commission and the EU respectively. The consultants to the 
Remuneration Committee advise the Committee on relevant governance 
and trends in remuneration. The Committee received updates on the new 
disclosure and voting requirements and the remuneration guidelines issued 
by investor representative bodies. 
The Board programme includes regular presentations from management and 
informal meetings which increase the Non-Executive Directors’ understanding 
of the business and the sector. During the year, the Board held a meeting at 
our store support centre at Ansty Park, Coventry and received presentations 
from members of the clothing and general merchandise teams and the 
property division on the key aspects of their areas of the business. In 
addition, they met a number of the broader management team during their 
visit. Directors have also visited stores and other sites as part of their 
continuing engagement with the business. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. 
He has responsibility for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and for 
governance matters. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary 
is one of the matters reserved for the Board. There is an agreed procedure by 
which members of the Board may take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense in the furtherance of their duties.
Board evaluation
This year’s Board Evaluation exercise was conducted by Manchester Square 
Partners (‘MSP’), who provide board evaluation and advisory services and who 
had no other relationship with Sainsbury’s. The annual evaluation exercise 
was last conducted on an external basis in 2011 when MSP also led the 
review, although the partners who conducted that exercise are no longer  
with MSP . 
The 2012 and 2013 reviews were carried out by the Company Secretary. These 
internal reviews followed an established process with full and open participation 
from all Directors, and considered the progress on the key points identified by 
MSP in 2011 and any emerging themes. They therefore provided consistency 
and continuity between the two external reviews in 2011 and 2014.
Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance statement continued J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 43
In preparation for the 2014 exercise, the Chairman and Company Secretary 
conducted a tender process in June 2013 in order to consider alternative 
board evaluation consultancies and the range of services they provide. MSP 
emerged as the most suitable supplier to conduct the review. They were 
provided with reports and questionnaires from the previous three years’ 
exercises in order to give more context and provide continuity. It was agreed 
that the scope of the review should be broad, including strategy, Board and 
management succession, Board culture, balance and diversity, meetings and 
processes, investor relations, risk management and Board Committees. Their 
questionnaire introduced some new specific areas for Directors’ consideration. 
The questionnaire was circulated to all Directors, the Company Secretary, the 
Group HR Director and the Group Development Director, each of whom has 
significant engagement with the Board or the Committees. This was followed 
up in separate discussions with each of the Directors and the other executives 
to take their detailed feedback on any emerging themes.
The MSP partners presented the principal conclusions to the Board at a 
meeting convened for that purpose and the Board discussed key points and 
agreed certain actions. 
Some of the key themes that were presented to the Board were as follows: 
• 
The Board functions well and in line with first class corporate governance. 
• 
The Board operates as a team with shared values, open dialogue, strong 
levels of trust, respect and collaboration, but also appropriate challenge. 
• 
The Non-Executive Directors are dedicated and committed and were highly 
valued by the Executives.
• 
The strategic debate has moved significantly up the agenda. 
• 
Focus on the core business and operational performance remains high, 
with shared Non-Executive/Executive appreciation of the importance of 
maintaining that focus. 
• 
Board processes and documentation are thorough and comprehensive.
The Board debated the findings and identified some areas that would remain 
on the agenda over the following year, including decision making processes, 
Board succession and Chief Executive transition, engagement with broader 
management and rising talent, and continued focus on our Digital strategy 
and Sainsbury’s Bank. The Board agreed the actions for further consideration 
and these have been or are being implemented. For instance, opportunities  
for the Board to meet a broader cadre of senior management have  
been identified.
As part of the Board Evaluation exercise, the Senior Independent Director 
reviewed the Chairman’s performance with the other Directors and 
subsequently met him to provide feedback. The Chairman provided feedback 
to each Director on their individual contribution to the Board and, with each 
of them, considered their development priorities. The Board anticipates that 
the 2015 Board Evaluation will be conducted on an internal basis by the 
Company Secretary.
Attendance
The following table shows the attendance of Directors at scheduled Board and 
Committee meetings. The Board scheduled eight meetings during the year, 
including the two-day Strategy Conference, and additional ad hoc meetings 
and conference calls were also convened to deal with specific matters which 
required attention between scheduled meetings.

The maximum number of meetings held during the year that each Director could attend is shown in brackets. 
John McAdam stepped down from the Audit Committee following the appointment to the Board of Susan Rice.
As referred to above, there were a number of informal meetings during the 
year when Directors met individual members of the Operating Board to 
receive updates on their specific areas of responsibility. In addition, the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors met without the Executive Directors 
being present, and the Non-Executive Directors also met without the 
Executive Directors or the Chairman being present. 
Investor relations 
The Company is committed to maintaining good communications with 
investors. Normal shareholder contact is the responsibility of Justin King, John 
Rogers and Mike Scott, Head of Investor Relations. The Chairman is generally 
available to shareholders and meets with institutional and other large 
investors; the Senior Independent Director is also available as required. 
The Company regularly meets with its large investors and institutional 
shareholders who, along with sell-side research analysts, are invited to 
presentations by the Company immediately after the announcement of the 
Company’s interim and full year results. They are also invited to participate in 
conference calls following the announcement of the Company’s trading 
statements. The content of these presentations and conference calls are 
webcast and are posted on the Company’s website (www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/
investor-centre) so as to be available to all investors. 
The Board receives feedback at each Board meeting on the views of major 
investors and the IR programme. In addition, Makinson Cowell provide 
investor relations consultancy services to the Company and provide an 
external analysis to the Board at the Strategy Conference on the views of 
institutional investors and sell-side analysts. Non-Executive Directors also 
receive regular market reports and broker updates from the Company’s  
IR department.
Shareholders have the opportunity to meet and question the Board at the 
AGM, which this year will be held on 9 July 2014. There will be a display of 
various aspects of the Company’s activities and Justin King will make a 
business presentation. A detailed explanation of each item of special business 
to be considered at the AGM is included with the Notice of Meeting which will 
be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. All 
resolutions proposed at the AGM will be taken on a poll vote. This follows best 
practice guidelines and enables the Company to count all votes, not just those 
of shareholders who attend the meeting. 
Information on matters of particular interest to investors is set  
out on pages 140 to 142 and on the Company’s website  
(www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investor-centre). J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 44
Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance statement continued
Board Committees 
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities to the Operating Board and 
to the Audit, Nomination, Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility and 
Sustainability Committees. The terms of reference for each Committee are 
available on the website (www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investor-centre/corporate-
governance). 
Operating Board
Day-to-day management of the Group is delegated to the Operating Board, 
which is chaired by Justin King. The Operating Board held ten scheduled 
meetings during the year and each Director’s responsibilities are set out on 
page 39. It has formal terms of reference setting out its key responsibilities. 
The Operating Board has delegated certain powers to the Trading Board, the 
Investment Board, the Group Safety Committee, the Corporate Responsibility 
and Sustainability Steering Group and the Data Governance Committee, each 
of which has approved terms of reference setting out its areas of responsibility. 
Given that a major breach of information security could have a significant 
impact on the business (see page 25), the Operating Board strengthened the 
data governance structure in September 2013 and brought together both 
information security and data protection governance with clear lines of 
accountability. The Data Governance Committee is chaired by Tim Fallowfield 
to drive a business-led focus on data security, with five working groups 
covering information security, customer data, colleague data, financial  
and commercial data, and communications, awareness and training.  
Tim Fallowfield provides an update to the Operating Board following each 
meeting and reports to the Audit Committee at least twice a year.

In my statement on page 40 I have already referred to succession and 
diversity at Board and senior management levels, both of which are key 
aspects of our Nomination Committee agenda. 
The Committee’s priorities over recent years have been:
• 
to refresh and rotate the Non-Executive Directors on the Board, ensuring 
appropriate skills and diverse experience;
• 
to plan the succession process for the Chief Executive and ensure a smooth 
transition;
• 
to support succession at Operating Board and senior management levels 
so that change can be implemented as smoothly as possible; and
• 
to oversee the Company’s approach to resourcing the needs of the 
business, developing our colleagues and recruiting new talent.
This has stood us in good stead over the last year, which has seen the 
appointment of Susan Rice as a Non-Executive Director, the planned 
succession from Justin King to Mike Coupe as Chief Executive, and the 
internal appointment of Jon Rudoe, Paul Mills-Hicks and Peter Griffiths at 
Operating Board level, as well as the departures that I have referred to on 
page 3. We are well placed to support Mike’s transition as he takes on his 
new role in July.
Turning to diversity, I have already commented on our strong representation 
of women on the Board and Operating Board. Diversity on a broader basis is 
an important feature of the Committee’s agenda and a detailed summary of 
the Company’s priorities is set out below.

management very seriously. All of the Non-Executive Directors are members 
of the Nomination Committee which is chaired by David Tyler. Justin King is 
not a member of the Committee although he is invited to attend meetings. 
As stated above, our Board evaluations consider the balance, skills and diversity 
of the Board. They also consider succession planning, reviewing whether it is 
working effectively. The evaluation reviews any senior appointment processes 
during the year and identifies priorities for the year ahead. 
We believe we have good balance and diversity amongst our Non-Executive 
Directors with several having deep experience of consumer-facing businesses 
and other highly relevant skills partly derived from serving in a range of major 
executive and non-executive positions throughout their careers. Each of our 
Non-Executive Directors have been recruited following a robust selection 
process which has been facilitated by Egon Zehnder International, who 
provide search and recruitment services for the Company. The process which 
led to the appointments of Jean Tomlin and Susan Rice was described in 
detail in the 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Our Non-Executive Directors’ tenure on our Board as at the year-end is as 
follows:
 
Board tenure 
Non-Executive Number Percentage
0-1 years 2 29
2-3 years 2 29
4-5 years 1 14
6-7 years 1 14
8-9 years 1 14
The above table includes the Chairman. Tenure taken from first AGM appointment.
At the time of the annual Strategy Conference, the Committee reviews 
succession plans for the Operating Board, as well as Divisional Director 
development, talent management and the graduate programme.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the website and set 
out the Committee’s responsibilities. The Committee meets on such 
occasions as are necessary and in 2013/14 held three formal meetings 
and a number of other updates, particularly relating to the process which 
led to the appointment of Mike Coupe as Chief Executive. The terms of 
reference of the Committee are available on the website at  
www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investor-centre/corporate-governance. 
Nomination Committee
Dear Shareholder
Succession and diversity at Board 
and senior management levels are 
key aspects of our Nomination 
Committee agenda.  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 46
Diversity
Our diversity and inclusion vision is to be ‘the most inclusive retailer’. We will 
achieve this aspiration by recruiting, retaining and developing diverse and 
talented people and creating an inclusive environment where everyone can 
be the best they can be and where diverse views are listened to. This will 
enable us to anticipate and accommodate the needs of our diverse 
customers, reflecting the communities we serve. 
Four Operating Board Sponsors lead our diversity strategy: Roger Burnley 
(gender), Helen Buck (race and age), Tim Fallowfield (disability and carers) 
and Sarah Warby (sexual orientation). Our Board Sponsors, together with our 
Group HR Director, Angie Risley, form our Diversity Steering Group. The Group 
leads our strategy, meeting monthly to govern progress. They are also 
responsible for updating the Board and Operating Board. Over the last year we 
have conducted extensive listening with our colleagues in our business which 
has informed our strategy. We have over 150 Diversity Champions who 
support the agenda in every part of our organisation. 
This year, we were listed in The Times Top 50 Employers for Women. We are 
taking active steps to support talented women to develop their careers in 
management where, like in many organisations, women are under-
represented. Our Inspiring Women programme gives colleagues confidence 
that we support their career aspirations and that gender is no barrier to 
fulfilling their potential. The Davies report recommends businesses attain 25 
per cent women on boards by 2015. Women already make up 30 per cent of 
our Board and 27 per cent of our Operating Board. This compares with an 
average of 20.8 per cent women on FTSE 100 boards. A number of our senior 
women hold non-executive director positions in other organisations and two 
are currently participating in the FTSE 100 Cross-Company Mentoring 
Programme. Over 300 of our colleagues have signed up to the Inspiring the 
Future campaign, sharing their careers experience with schools and colleges.
Male Female
Board 70% 30% 
Operating Board 73% 27% 
Senior executive positions* 68% 32% 
Company 45% 55% 
*  If the definition of senior management were to include individuals appointed as directors of Group subsidiary companies 
(including dormant companies, excluding joint venture and pension companies) the percentage of senior management who are 
female would reduce to 29 per cent.
We are Champion members of Race for Opportunity. 14 per cent of the 
population of England and Wales and 11 per cent of the UK workforce is  
from a BAME (Black Asian Ethnic Minority) background. This compares  
with 14 per cent of all Sainsbury’s colleagues. We are working to increase  
the representation of BAME colleagues at middle manager grades by 
encouraging talented colleagues to progress within the business; for example 
BAME colleagues are participating in Race for Opportunity’s cross-
organisational mentoring circles. 
We aspire to take a leadership approach to disability, commensurate with our 
Paralympic commitment to create a legacy of greater inclusion for people 
with disabilities. We sit on the Paralympic Legacy Advisory Group and take an 
active role in the Government’s Disability Confident campaign. We are Partner 
members of the Business Disability Forum. Our ‘You Can’ programme has 
attracted over 21,600 people traditionally considered ‘harder to reach’ into 
jobs with Sainsbury’s. In January 2014, we held the parliamentary launch of 
our Active Kids for All programme, supporting teachers to include disabled 
children in physical education and school sport.
We are one of few FTSE 100 companies with a carers policy and have worked 
with Carers UK for 15 years. 2013 saw our most successful Carers Week yet as 
over 1,000 Sainsbury’s stores across the country hosted events for local 
support and community groups. We sponsored the Carers Rights Day Caring 
for Someone booklet again this year, and the booklet was made available to 
our colleagues as well as to other organisations. We are proud to chair the 
Retail Group of the Prime Minister’s Dementia Challenge.
Directors’ Report
Nomination Committee continued J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 47
As Chairman of the Board’s Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 
Committee, I oversee the governance across each of our five values of ‘Best 
for food and health’, ‘Sourcing with integrity’, ‘Respect for our environment’, 
‘Making a positive difference to our community’ and ‘ A great place to work’, 
as well as the 20x20 Sustainability Plan, which sets out the 20 commitments 
for 2020 across the five values.
As part of this, we talk regularly to customers, suppliers, colleagues, 
stakeholders and experts, including non-government organisations and the 
Government and its agencies. Our annual public review of 20x20 took place 
in November, attended by over 180 stakeholders with live debates also hosted 
by the Guardian website. Separately, over the year, Justin and I co-hosted a 
number of discussions focused on the five values, including an examination 
of the way we better connect our stores to the communities they serve. 
This year the Committee also looked in depth at ‘Sourcing with integrity’ and 
the team’s programme to ensure Sainsbury’s provides customers with quality 
products at fair prices, in a way that is better for the farmers, growers, 
packers, processors, manufacturers and animals, whilst also minimising the 
impact on the environment. Plans for an independent Sainsbury’s sustainable 
sourcing standard for all key raw materials, both in the UK and globally, were 
also announced in November.
I am pleased to say that the Company’s work across corporate responsibility 
has once again been recognised externally. In particular, we were listed in 
the 2013 Dow Jones Sustainability Index (‘DJSI’) review for the seventh 
consecutive year and highly ranked in the FTSE4Good Index, which we have 
been part of since its inception in 2001. Excellent progress in ‘Respect for our 
environment’ was recognised by the Company’s highest ever ranking in the 
Carbon Disclosure Project and in a number of awards, including the Energy 
Awards for successfully reducing water use by 53 per cent across our stores, 
and the 2013 Green Economy awards for our progress in our ongoing carbon 
reduction programme. 
Further updates about the team’s approach are published at  
www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/responsibility with quarterly updates also given as 
part of the Company’s broader trading statements.

Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee
During the year the Committee was chaired by Jean Tomlin, with Justin King 
and Mary Harris as its members. David Tyler attended each meeting. It met 
twice during the year. Its terms of reference include approval of the Corporate 
Responsibility Report and consideration of the broad Corporate Responsibility 
and Sustainability Policy, taking into account the Company’s desired 
corporate responsibility positioning and objectives, related costs and benefits, 
the overall strategic plan, and relevant external and other factors. These formal 
Committee meetings were supported by Corporate Responsibility and 
Sustainability (‘CR&S’) strategic meetings that were hosted by Jean Tomlin 
and Justin King. Each meeting is based around one of the five values and 
key external stakeholders are invited to attend. During the year five such 
meetings were held, relating to each of the values, framed within our 
20x20 Sustainability Plan which was launched in October 2011.
The Committee is supported by an internal governance structure whereby 
members of the Operating Board have responsibility for each of our five 
values and sit on the Chief Executive’s CR&S Steering Group, which meets 
quarterly and is chaired by Justin King. The members of the Steering Group 
are shown below. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the website 
(www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investor-centre/corporate-governance).
Our 20x20 Sustainability Plan
In many ways, the commitments encapsulated in our 20x20 Sustainability 
Plan are not new to Sainsbury’s. We have sought throughout our 145-year 
history to lead in matters of business responsibility and sustainability. 
Examples of our contribution over the past decade include transforming the 
markets for fairly traded products and sustainable seafood, improving animal 
welfare, supporting British farming, championing community investment and 
sponsorship of the British Athletics and the Paralympics.
With our 20x20 Sustainability Plan, we formalise our action against our values, 
as well as recognising the new and changing issues which today’s world faces.
In developing the plan, in 2011 we undertook a detailed internal auditing 
and materiality process. Since its launch, we have continued to listen to 
our customers, suppliers and opinion formers to ensure we have the most 
effective agenda, and leverage the knowledge of experts to remain at the 
forefront of sustainability.
We are focused on its delivery, whilst also ensuring we continue to engage 
and look beyond 2020.
Our 20x20 Sustainability Plan update was published in November.

Greenhouse gas emissions
We have measured our greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) footprint since 2005 and set 
ourselves a challenging target to reduce our emissions by 30 per cent  by 2020, 
compared with our  baseline (and 65 per cent relative to Company growth). 
For further information on initiatives to reduce our GHG footprint, please refer to 
our 20x20 Sustainability Plan available on our external web pages.

Intensity measurement (tCO

In 2013/14, our emissions reduced by over seven per cent. This is a result of 
carbon reduction activities across our operations and in particular our 
programme to replace HFC refrigerants in our fridges and freezers with 
natural alternatives.
Intensity ratio
In order to express our annual emissions in relation to the growth of our 
business, we  report an emissions intensity measurement, calculated using 
sales area (’000 sq ft). Using this measure, our emissions intensity reduced by 
11 per cent in 2013/14.
Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. We have 
calculated and reported our emissions in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition) and emission factors 
from UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2014. 
The reporting period is the financial year 2013/14, the same as that covered 
by the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The boundaries of the GHG 
inventory are defined using the operational control approach. In general, the 
emissions reported are the same as those which would be reported based on a 
financial central boundary. Due to the short time between financial year-end 
and report publication, it was necessary to estimate some gas and electricity 
consumption data. Gas and electricity emissions calculations could be subject 
to minor change. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 50
Directors’ Report
Susan Rice joined the Committee during the year and her wide experience 
as a Non-Executive Director and her career in retail banking have extended 
the balance of skills and experience of the Committee at a time when the 
Company is expanding its interests in financial services with the full 
acquisition of Sainsbury’s Bank. We are supported by a strong internal audit 
function and an executive management team who have instilled a strong and 
positive culture of controls throughout the business over many years. We 
believe that our discussions with the management team are open, thorough, 
constructive and appropriately challenging. Our external auditors also give  
us a high level of confidence in relation to the work they do with respect to 
the Company’s financial controls and related risk environment. The most 
recent annual Board and Committee evaluation conducted by Manchester 
Square Partners confirmed that governance of risk, and the processes that 
support this, remain strong and that the Audit Committee continues to 
work effectively. 
As a Committee, we are keen to ensure that the identification and 
management of all significant risks is embedded across all areas of the 
business, with continuous and effective oversight coming from the Operating 
Board. We regularly review the risk profiles across each part of the business, 
the actions being taken and the processes they have in place to manage or 
mitigate these risks. In addition, we frequently receive updates on specific 
areas of identified risk with the relevant members of the management team. 
We are satisfied that the business has maintained robust risk management 
and internal controls, supported by strong overall governance processes, and 
that management have instilled a strong risk management culture across 
the business. 
The following pages describe the Committee’s principal activities during the 
year and its oversight responsibility towards risk management and internal 
controls. One of our key priorities during the year has been to ensure that the 
governance of Sainsbury’s Bank continues to be strong following completion 
of our full acquisition of the Bank. The Bank has a robust internal operating 
structure, with a Non-Executive Chairman and four Independent Non-
Executive Directors on its Board, as well as its own Audit and Risk 
Committees. We receive updates on the key agenda items discussed at the 
Bank’s Audit Committee and on all important operating and regulatory 
matters including its liquidity, cash flows, capital adequacy and risk 
management processes. Representatives from the Bank Audit Committee 
and the Bank Internal Audit team now attend meetings of the Committee 
at least twice a year. We are also very satisfied that there is good alignment 
between the Sainsbury’s Internal Audit function and their colleagues within 
Sainsbury’s Bank’s Internal Audit team. 
During the year, the Committee has significantly increased its involvement 
with respect to data governance across the organisation, especially given the 
increasing number of high profile breaches of information security that have 
affected other companies, including some of those in direct competition with 
Sainsbury’s. A major breach of information security could have a material and 
significant impact on the business and its reputation and therefore the 
Committee will continue to receive regular presentations on data governance 
throughout the Group going forward. The Company’s Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties are set out on pages 24 to 27. We have reviewed these in detail 
and are comfortable that the business has addressed them appropriately 
within its ongoing operating model and priorities.
In the coming year, the Board has agreed that the Committee should conduct 
a tender for the external auditor appointment which will take effect from the 
2015/16 financial year. In the meantime the Board is happy to recommend to 
shareholders that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be reappointed as auditors for 
the 2014/15 financial year.

Committee membership
The Audit Committee is chaired by Gary Hughes, with Susan Rice and Matt 
Brittin as its other members, all of whom are independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Board has determined that Gary Hughes has recent and 
relevant financial experience. David Tyler, Justin King, John Rogers, Susannah 
Hall (Director of Internal Audit), other senior members of the Finance Division 
and the external auditors are invited to attend Committee meetings. Tim 
Fallowfield is secretary to the Committee.
The terms of reference for each Committee are available on the website at 
www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investor-centre/corporate-governance.
Activities during the year
During the year, the Committee met on four occasions and the external auditors 
and the Director of Internal Audit were given the opportunity after each 
meeting to meet with the Committee, without management being present.

Sainsbury’s Bank report
During the year, the Committee has considered a number of matters under the 
general headings above. It monitored the integrity of the financial statements 
and any formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial 
performance and reviewed any significant financial judgements contained in 
them. Within the accounting update it considered provisions made by the 
Company, dilapidations of properties and land, impairments, promotional 
monies and the related accounting, and pensions. In addition, the Committee 
regularly reviewed the Company’s funding and liquidity position and has 
considered its impact on the Company’s financial and operational capabilities. 
The Committee’s detailed review of the year-end position assisted the Board 
in making the going concern statement set out on page 75.
During the year the Committee increased its focus on Sainsbury’s Bank risk 
management and control processes. To enable the Committee to obtain 
assurance, it receives updates on the key agenda items discussed at the 
Bank’s Audit Committee and on all important operating and regulatory 
matters including its liquidity, cash flows, capital adequacy and risk 
management processes. Representatives from the Bank Audit Committee 
and the Bank Internal Audit team now attend meetings of the Committee at 
least twice a year. During the year, the Committee has significantly increased 
its involvement with respect to data governance across the organisation and 
has received regular presentations and updates. 
At each meeting, the Committee receives a report on the internal controls 
framework and the Internal Audit department’s activities. This year, it received 
information on major IT projects, data security, business continuity planning 
and details of any invocation of the business continuity management team. 
The Committee reviews the quarterly results of the store safe and legal audits 
to ensure that appropriate standards are being maintained. 
The Committee also reviews:
• 
the effectiveness of the Company’s financial controls and the systems 
of internal control by approving the Internal Audit plans twice yearly, 
reviewing the findings quarterly and by reviewing the scope of work and 
reports of the external auditors. The detailed actions for resolution of any 
identified weaknesses are closely monitored by the Committee through to 
completion; and
• 
the management of risk by reviewing the risk assessment process and 
corporate and divisional risk maps and registers twice yearly. These form 
the basis of the Internal Audit planning process.
Full descriptions of the risk management and internal controls processes are 
set out below. 
The Company’s ‘whistleblowing’ procedures ensure that arrangements are in 
place to enable colleagues and suppliers to raise concerns about possible 
improprieties on a confidential basis. All issues raised have been investigated 
and appropriate actions taken. Any significant issues are highlighted to the 
Audit Committee.
The Company has a fraud policy and a Serious Fraud Committee, which 
convenes in the event of serious incidents to oversee case management and 
ensure appropriate actions are taken. The Audit Committee receives a fraud 
update at each meeting. 
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment
One of the new compliance requirements of the Code is for the Board to 
confirm that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable (see page 76). To enable the Board to 
make this declaration, a formal process is embedded in the year-end review 
to ensure the Committee, and the Board as a whole, has access to all relevant 
information and in particular, management’s papers on significant issues faced 
by the business. The Committee receives a paper from management detailing 
the approach taken in the preparation of the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements. The Committee, and all other Board members, also receive drafts 
of the Annual Report and Financial Statements in sufficient time to facilitate 
their review and enable them to challenge the disclosures where necessary. 
In addition, the Group’s external auditors review the consistency between the 
narrative reporting of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements.
Financial statements and significant issues
An accounting and tax paper is prepared by management and presented to 
the Audit Committee four times a year, which provides detail on the main 
financial reporting judgements. Specific accounting papers have also been 
prepared when considered necessary.  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 52
Significant financial and reporting issues considered in the year, in no 
particular order, were as follows:
Significant financial 
and reporting issue How the issue has been addressed
Impairment 
of financial 
and non-
financial 
assets
As disclosed in note 2, a review for impairment triggers is 
performed at each reporting date by considering if any current 
or future events suggest the recoverable value of certain 
assets may be less than their carrying value. The Committee 
reviewed management’s assessment of recoverable value 
and relevant judgements made. As a result, a £92 million 
impairment has been recognised during the year to write 
down the value of certain sites held for development as 
disclosed in note 3. 
Complex 
property 
transactions
The Committee has reviewed a number of complex 
property transactions executed during the year to ensure 
that all accounting and tax issues are identified and 
appropriately presented in the accounts. This includes 
whether amounts recognised reflect the overall substance 
of these transactions and in particular that sale and 
leaseback transactions are treated correctly. Please refer 
to note 3 for property profits recognised in the year.
Pensions 
accounting
The Committee reviewed a summary of the key 
assumptions used in arriving at a valuation for the defined 
benefit pension scheme. There have been two significant 
changes in the accounting for the defined benefit pension 
scheme in the year; the Group has implemented the 
required changes for the revision to IAS 19: Employee 
Benefits (‘IAS 19 Revised’) and the defined benefit scheme 
has been closed to future accrual. 
The Committee has ensured that the required additional 
accounting and tax disclosure as a result of both pension 
changes has been adequately presented in the financial 
statements. See note 2 for disclosure of the impact of 
applying the revised standard, note 3 for disclosure of 
relevant amounts presented outside of underlying profit 
and note 30 for new disclosures implemented as a result of 
IAS 19 Revised.
The 
acquisition of 
the remaining 
50 per cent of 
Sainsbury’s 
Bank
This has required consideration of complex accounting 
due to the change from joint venture equity accounting 
to a fully consolidated subsidiary. Integration of the Bank 
within the Group’s ongoing reporting processes has also 
been discussed extensively. The Committee has reviewed 
management’s papers on the accounting and consolidation 
of Sainsbury’s Bank along with the required disclosures. 
The use of judgement has been required when assessing 
the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities of 
Sainsbury’s Bank and the Committee is satisfied that 
management has used reasonable assumptions in their 
assessment of fair value. Refer to note 37 for the required 
business combination disclosures. 
Items 
excluded 
from 
underlying 
results
The Committee is satisfied that the Group’s definition 
of items excluded from underlying results remains clear 
and further disclosure is included where appropriate. The 
definition has been updated this year to present both 
defined benefit pension scheme expenses within the 
amounts excluded as a result of the closure of the scheme 
to future accrual and acquisition adjustments which do 
not reflect the Group’s underlying performance. Other 
items such as the recovery of historic VAT overpayments 
in relation to Nectar have also been included within this 
disclosure on the basis that it is a one-off material item not 
relating to the Group’s ongoing activities. Please refer to 
note 3 for further detail. 
The Audit Committee remains satisfied that reasonable judgements have been 
made by management and adequate disclosures provided where appropriate.
Internal Audit
The Committee has regularly reviewed the Internal Audit department’s 
resources, budget, work programme, results and management’s 
implementation of its recommendations. 
The Director of Internal Audit, Susannah Hall, reports to the Committee 
Chairman and has direct access to all members of the Committee and the 
Chairman. She is given the opportunity after each meeting to meet with the 
Committee separately without management being present. She has regular 
meetings with all Committee members. The purpose, authority and 
responsibility of Internal Audit are defined in the Internal Audit Charter. 
The Committee reviews the Charter annually. 
External Audit
The Committee reviewed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s (‘PwC’) overall 
work plan, and approved their remuneration and terms of engagement. 
It considered in detail the results of the audit, PwC’s performance and 
independence and the effectiveness of the overall audit process. 
Changes made to the Code in 2012 recommended that the external audit is 
put out to tender at least every ten years. PwC have been the Company’s 
auditors since 1995 and it is more than ten years since the external audit was 
tendered. PwC are required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the 
Group audit every five years. 
Following new proposed regulation regarding audit tendering and audit firm 
rotation, the FRC plans to consult on the tendering provision within the Code 
in 2016. In late 2013, the UK Competition Commission (‘CC’) proposed a 
regime of mandatory audit tendering of FTSE 350 audit appointments at 
least every ten years. This was followed by the European Union (‘EU’) who 
issued draft legislation proposing mandatory audit firm rotation every 20 
years (subject to a tender after ten years). In March 2014, the European 
Parliament voted to approve the proposed EU audit legislation, with the time 
frame for application likely to be June 2016. Given that the EU legislation 
has been voted in, it is expected that the CC will follow and align their rules 
with the EU.
Richard Hughes, the current audit partner, was appointed in July 2010 and 
is therefore due to rotate following the conclusion of the audit for 2015. 
On this basis and in light of regulatory changes referred to above, the 
Committee has determined that an external tender should commence after 
the AGM for the 2015/16 audit. 
Independence
In order to ensure their independence, the Committee has overseen the 
Company’s policy which restricts the engagement of PwC in relation to 
non-audit services. The majority of the non-audit work undertaken by PwC 
during 2013/14 was audit related assurance services such as the interim 
review and the provision of accounting advice, which totalled £0.2 million. In 
addition, PwC earned fees for other non-audit work of £0.1 million. The audit 
fee for the year in respect of the Group, Company and its subsidiaries totalled 
£0.9 million. The Committee remains satisfied with PwC’s independence and 
their overall challenge to management. 
The policy was reviewed during the year and is consistent with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards No. 5 – Non Audit Services. The policy is 
designed to ensure that the provision of such services does not have an 
impact on the external auditors’ independence and objectivity. It identifies 
certain types of engagement that the external auditors shall not undertake, 
including internal audit and actuarial services relating to the preparation of 
accounting estimates for the financial statements. It also requires that 
individual engagements above a certain fee level may only be undertaken 
with appropriate authority from the Committee Chairman or the Committee. 
Directors’ Report
Audit Committee continued J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 53
The policy also recognises that there are some types of work, such as 
accounting and tax advice, where a detailed understanding of the Company’s 
business is advantageous. The policy is designed to ensure that PwC is only 
appointed to provide a non-audit service where it is considered to be the most 
suitable supplier of the service. The Committee receives a report at each 
meeting on the non-audit services being provided and the cumulative total of 
non-audit fees. In the event that cumulative non-audit fees exceed the audit 
fee then all subsequent non-audit expenditure must be approved by the 
Committee Chairman. 
Sainsbury’s Bank
Sainsbury’s Bank is a subsidiary of the Company which has an independent 
board which has the responsibility for setting the Bank’s strategy, risk 
appetite and annual business plan as well as the day-to-day management of 
the business. The Board of the Bank has an independent Chairman and six 
Non-Executive Directors, four of whom are considered to be independent, 
whilst the other two are appointed by the Company.
The Bank will continue to provide an update on performance to each Audit 
Committee  and the Chair of the Bank’s Audit Committee and representatives 
from the Bank’s Internal Audit team will present to the Audit Committee at 
least twice a year. There is alignment between the Sainsbury’s Internal Audit 
function and their colleagues within the equivalent Sainsbury’s Bank team.
Grocery Supply Code of Practice 
In February 2010, a new Grocery Supply Code of Practice (‘GSCOP’) was 
implemented following the recommendation of the Competition 
Commission. Each grocery retailer to which it applies had to appoint a Code 
Compliance Officer whose duties include hearing disputes between suppliers 
and the relevant retailer. Sainsbury’s appointed the Director of Internal Audit 
as its Code Compliance Officer.
GSCOP requires that each grocery retailer (to which it applies) delivers an 
annual compliance report to the Groceries Code Adjudicator which has been 
approved by the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Furthermore, a summary 
of the compliance report must be included in our Annual Report and 
Financial Statements.
Summary Annual Compliance Report
Sainsbury’s has invested significant time and resource in providing 
comprehensive training to all relevant colleagues as required under GSCOP 
which is reinforced by online knowledge testing. Sainsbury’s has also 
dedicated internal resource to provide all relevant colleagues with day-to-day 
advice and guidance. The Trading Division, in consultation with the Legal 
Services Team and the Code Compliance Officer, continues to assess the 
adequacy of policies and procedures in place to support GSCOP awareness 
and compliance.
A small number of alleged breaches of GSCOP have been received in the 
reporting period, which were dealt with within the Trading Division using our 
standard internal escalation procedure. The resolution of one of these alleged 
breaches was facilitated by the Code Compliance Officer. 
Risk management and internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and the system of 
internal controls and for reviewing their effectiveness. Certain of these 
responsibilities have been delegated to the Audit Committee as outlined on 
pages 51 and 52. The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve the Company’s business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The risk management process and the system of internal controls have been 
in place for the whole year, up to the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements, and accord with the Turnbull guidance and the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls and has ensured that any required remedial action on any identified 
weaknesses has been, or is being taken.
Risk management
Accepting that risk is an inherent part of doing business, the risk 
management system is designed to identify key risks and to provide 
assurance that these risks are fully understood and managed. The 
effectiveness of the process is reviewed twice a year by the Audit Committee. 
The Board carries out an annual review of the significant risks facing the 
business which includes reviewing risk appetite. 
The Operating Board maintains an overall corporate risk register which is 
reviewed twice yearly by the Audit Committee and formally discussed with 
the Board. The risk register contains the significant risks faced by the 
business and identifies the potential impact and likelihood at both a gross 
level (before consideration of mitigating controls) and net level (after 
consideration of mitigating controls). This gives the Board the opportunity to 
review the level of risk that the business is prepared to accept. The register 
also contains the assurance provided over current key mitigating controls. 
Where further actions have been identified to mitigate risks to a level deemed 
acceptable, these are agreed with specific timelines for delivery and progress 
on implementation of these actions is monitored. 
The risk management process is embedded at the Operating Board level and 
through the review of the risk registers of each of the operating divisions of 
the business:
• 
the divisional operating management teams are responsible for 
managing the risks to their business objectives and for identification and 
implementation of internal controls so as to provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance that the risks in their areas of responsibility are 
appropriately identified, evaluated and managed;
• 
this divisional risk process is achieved through twice yearly workshops 
held by the divisional management and facilitated by Internal Audit. 
Each divisional management team produces and maintains a divisional 
key risk register. The likelihood and impact of each key risk is evaluated, 
management’s risk appetite is discussed and any further actions deemed 
necessary to mitigate the risk are identified. In addition, the risks and the 
robustness of the mitigating controls are regularly reviewed by divisional 
management as part of their normal business activities;
• 
management certify annually that they are responsible for managing their 
business objectives and that the internal controls are such that they provide 
reasonable but not absolute assurance that the risks in their areas of 
responsibility are appropriately identified, evaluated and managed;
• 
the Operating Board reviews and challenges the output of the divisional risk 
process and then updates the overall corporate risk register as appropriate;
• 
game-changer and horizon scanning risk workshops are held annually to 
focus on external and unknown risks. Key themes and outputs from these 
are reviewed by the Operating Board and the potential impact on key risks 
is discussed;
• 
the corporate and divisional risk registers form the basis of the risk-based 
plan of Internal Audit for the subsequent half-year period; 
• 
Internal Audit provides independent assurance to management and the 
Audit Committee as to the existence and effectiveness of the risk 
management process; and
• 
the Board reviews the risk process and corporate risks in May and approves 
the Company’s Principal Risks and Uncertainties (as set out on page 24  
to 27). J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 54

Internal controls
The system of internal control encompasses all controls, including those 
relating to financial reporting processes (including the preparation of the 
consolidated Group accounts), operational and compliance controls and those 
relating to risk management processes. It also includes the controls over 
Sainsbury’s interests in joint ventures.
The Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of the internal controls 
systems on an ongoing basis, enabling a cumulative assessment to be made. 
The processes used during the year to support this assessment are as follows:
• 
discussion and approval by the Board of the Company’s strategy, plans and 
objectives, and the risks to achieving them;
• 
review and approval by the Board of budgets and forecasts, including those 
for both revenue and capital expenditure;
• 
regular reviews by management of the risks to achieving objectives and 
mitigating controls and actions;
• 
regular reviews by management and the Audit Committee of the scope and 
results of the work of Internal Audit across the Company and of the 
implementation of their recommendations;
• 
regular reviews by the Audit Committee of the scope and results of the work 
of the external auditors and of any significant issues arising; 
• 
regular reviews by the Audit Committee of accounting policies and levels of 
delegated authority; and
• 
regular reviews by the Board and the Audit Committee of material fraudulent 
activity and any significant whistleblowing by colleagues or suppliers and 
actions being taken to remedy any control weaknesses.

Committee
J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 55
Dear Shareholder ,
In the current competitive environment  
it is vitally important that our remuneration  
policy is aligned to our business objectives  
and is motivational for our executives to  
ensure that we grow the business and deliver  
returns to shareholders over the longer term.
During the year we delivered good performance, 
despite tough trading conditions. As summarised 
on page 56, we have increased retail sales by 2.7 
per cent (including VAT , excluding fuel), improved 
underlying profit before tax by 5.3 per cent and 
maintained our market share at 16.8 per cent. 
This performance has been reflected in the level 
of payments under our incentive plans. 
• 
Annual bonus – our profit growth over the year 
has resulted in a bonus pool of over £80 million, 
which was shared by colleagues across the 
business. For the Executive Directors the 
payments were between 60 and 65 per cent of 
the maximum (compared to between 84 and 
87 per cent last year). 
• 
Deferred Share Award – following the delivery of 
strong financial, strategic and relative 
performance during the year, awards were made 
at 80 per cent of the maximum (compared to 
83 per cent last year).
• 
Value Builder – in May 2014, the sixth cycle of 
Value Builder, in which over 230 managers 
participate, will mature at a performance 
multiplier of 1.6 times (40 per cent of the 
maximum), reflecting our performance over the 
previous three years. 
The last year was particularly busy for the 
Committee. In January, we announced that Justin 
King will be stepping down as Chief Executive in 
July. The Committee carefully considered Justin’s 
leaving terms, together with the remuneration 
arrangements for Mike Coupe, who succeeds him. 
The details were included in the announcement at 
the time and are repeated in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. The agreed departure terms for 
Justin ensure that any remaining payments to 
him are aligned with the performance of the 
Company following his departure. 
I am very pleased that Mike will be leading the 
Company through its next chapter. Following his 
appointment as Chief Executive, his salary will be 
£900,000 per annum, reflecting his experience and 
knowledge of Sainsbury’s. While the total variable 
pay opportunity (as a percentage of base salary) 
remains the same as Justin’s, we have rebalanced 
this towards the longer-term element of the 
package, to align his interests with the long-term 
interests of shareholders.
The Committee receives regular updates on the 
pay and conditions of colleagues throughout the 
Company and our normal approach to pay awards 
is for increases to Executive Directors to be in line 
with colleagues, unless there are exceptional 
circumstances. Following the most recent annual 
review we have increased John Rogers’ salary to 
£600,000, reflecting his expanding role on the 
Board and also in light of the full purchase of the 
Bank. He is now responsible for a larger consolidated 
Group and he has a particularly important role 
with the Bank, being the only Group Director to sit 
on the Bank Board. John is a high performing and 
well-respected CFO in the marketplace and this 
adjustment recognises his growth in the role and 
most importantly his increased responsibilities. 
During the year, we also undertook a review of our 
long-term incentive plan – Future Builder. We 
reviewed the plan and the performance targets to 
ensure they support our business plan and align 
the interests of executives and shareholders. 
Following conversations with our shareholders, we 
have increased the threshold and maximum Cash 
Flow hurdles by £250 million (the range is now 
£5,750 million to £6,750 million). The ROCE and 
relative sales targets remain unchanged. Prior to 
any vesting for this award, the Committee must 
also be satisfied that the Company’s underlying 
performance over the period justifies the level of 
vesting. Further details are set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration. 
The changes we have made during the year 
support the over-arching principles of our 
remuneration policy which are to balance reward 
with performance, drive the achievement of our 
business objectives and encourage sustainable 
shareholder value creation. 
In addition, to ensure we are being appropriately 
advised, we reviewed the remuneration advisers to 
the Committee. Following an extensive tender 
process, we reappointed Deloitte LLP , who the 
Committee believes provides robust, objective, 
independent advice.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report, consisting  
of this Annual Statement, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration, is compliant with the new reporting 
requirements. Unfortunately by necessity this has 
made the report longer but we hope that you find 
the additional information and analysis useful. 
To assist shareholders, we have provided overleaf  
a summary of our performance, the payments 
for 2013/14 and the structure of remuneration 
arrangements for 2014/15. 
I hope you can see from this report that we 
remain committed to being focused on pay for 
performance and rewarding the leadership team 
in a way which aligns with the experience of 
long-term shareholders, while staying true to our 
Company values.

Remuneration principles
Our colleagues are central to the Company’s ongoing success and  
the Company’s overall reward strategy supports this. Our objective is  
to have a fair, equitable and competitive total reward package that  
supports our vision of being the most trusted retailer where people  
love to work and shop, encourages colleagues to perform in  
ways that deliver great service for customers, drives sales and  
provides opportunities for colleagues to share in Sainsbury’s success.  
This overall reward strategy is the foundation for the remuneration  
policy for senior executives.
The over-arching objectives of the remuneration policy are to ensure  
rewards are performance-based and encourage long-term shareholder  
value creation. The remuneration policy for senior executives is based  
on the following principles: 
The Committee takes a rounded approach to pay and considers a variety of 
factors when determining, and subsequently implementing, the remuneration 
policy for senior executives. It believes it is important to exercise suitable 
judgement at all stages during the process to ensure that executive pay  
levels appropriately reflect performance and are aligned with the interests 
of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the overall structure of 
remuneration for senior executives to ensure that it continues to evolve and is 
aligned to the corporate plan and business goals as well as supporting the 
interests of shareholders.
When reviewing or amending remuneration arrangements, the Committee 
considers pay practices across the Company, the impact on colleague behaviour, 
the cost to the Company, share dilution, stakeholder views (including 
shareholders, governance bodies and colleagues), best practice corporate 
governance and market competitiveness, particularly within the retail sector. 
It also considers the overall performance of the Company within the context 
of the retail market and the wider economic environment.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy and Annual Report of Remuneration provide 
further details of our approach to pay. In line with the new regulations, at the 
2014 AGM, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be subject to a binding vote 
and the remainder of the Directors’ Remuneration Report will be subject to an 
advisory vote.

Shareholding Guidelines 
Purpose and link to strategy Alignment of Executive Directors with shareholders.
Operation Guideline expected to be met within five years of appointment.
Guidelines are: Chief Executive 2.5 times salary, other Executive Directors 1.5 times salary.
*The 2014/15 incentive opportunities for Mike Coupe will take effect from his appointment as Chief Executive on 9 July 2014 and awards will be pro-rated to reflect time in role. Further details are included on page 64. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 60
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Setting performance measures and targets
The Committee believes it is important that the performance conditions 
applying to incentive arrangements support the short and long-term 
corporate ambitions of the Company. We operate in a dynamic market with 
evolving challenges and the Committee reviews the performance measures 
and targets each year to ensure that they remain relevant and stretching. 
Further details of the performance measures are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
The performance measures in the annual bonus and Deferred Share Award 
are selected as they are the key drivers of business performance. The targets 
for the annual bonus and DSA are set with reference to the corporate strategy 
and internal budgets as well as the external context (e.g. market forecasts). 
This approach seeks to ensure that the threshold and stretch targets are 
appropriately challenging. 
The Future Builder performance measures focus on longer term growth and 
returns to shareholders, and a similar target-setting approach is used. Future 
Builder awards are currently linked to the following measures:
ROCE
Reflects the return generated for shareholders and 
as such is a critical measure of the quality of our 
business activity and the efficiency of capital use
Cumulative underlying 
cash flow from retail 
operations
Measures the total flow of cash in and out of the 
business as well as providing an assessment of 
underlying profitability
Relative sales
This is an important metric used across the retail 
sector – outperforming our direct peers on sales 
will be a key source of value for our shareholders 
and like-for-like sales are the biggest driver for 
profitability and returns
Performance gateway
Ensures that any payout reflects the underlying 
performance of the Company
The Committee may vary or rebalance the weighting of the performance 
metrics for future annual bonus, DSA and Future Builder awards, in order to 
ensure that they remain aligned with the Company’s strategic objectives. 
The Committee may also adjust the calculation of performance measures 
and vesting outcomes (for instance for material acquisitions or disposals and 
events not foreseen at the time the targets were set) to ensure they remain 
a fair reflection of performance over the relevant period.
Preventing rewards for failure
The Remuneration Committee may operate a recovery provision on Future 
Builder awards. This feature strengthens the Company’s formal governance in 
line with our existing philosophy, and reduces the risk of payments for failure. 
The circumstances in which the provision may be invoked have been defined 
as follows: 
Financial accounts Material mis-statement of our financial results
Actions/conduct of 
colleague
Serious reputational damage
Serious misconduct
Fraud
Should the Committee consider such events to have occurred, it will have 
discretion to: 
• 
Reduce the number of shares under an unvested award; 
• 
Cancel an unvested award in full; or 
• 
Impose further conditions on an unvested award. 
Treatment of outstanding awards
The Committee may approve payments to satisfy commitments agreed prior 
to the approval and implementation of this Policy. This includes previous 
incentive awards that are currently outstanding and unvested (e.g. prior year 
Deferred Share Award, Value Builder and Future Builder arrangements granted 
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan). The structure of these legacy awards is 
consistent with the Policy T able but the performance conditions applying 
may be different. Further details of outstanding awards are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee may also approve payments outside of this Policy, in order to 
satisfy any legacy arrangements made to a colleague prior to (and not in 
contemplation of) promotion to the Board of Directors. 
Consideration of colleague pay and conditions
When considering remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors, the 
Committee takes into account, as a matter of course, the pay and conditions 
of colleagues throughout the Company.
In particular, the Committee receives regular updates of any major changes  
to the pay and benefits of colleagues generally and the Committee takes  
into account wider pay issues when determining Executive Directors’ 
remuneration. When setting Executive Director salary increases the 
Committee considers the overall salary increase budget for management  
and the increase in rate of pay for hourly-paid colleagues. 
The Committee does not formally consult with colleagues on the setting 
of the Policy but as a result of the Company’s all-employee share plans, 
colleagues are able to become shareholders in the Company and can 
comment on the Policy in the same way as other shareholders. 
Differences in remuneration policy for all colleagues
Many aspects of the remuneration policy for Executive Directors are 
consistent with the reward strategy for other colleagues across the Company. 
Below executive level, pay and benefits are scaled to reflect the nature of the 
role and based on the levels of pay in comparable roles in the market. 
All colleagues, including colleagues at Sainsbury’s Bank, are entitled to base 
salary, benefits including pension and annual bonus, subject to eligibility and 
relevant performance criteria. Annual bonus plans are operated across the 
Company and are aligned under a common set of principles with 
performance metrics tailored to different populations. 
Senior executives expected to have the greatest influence on Company 
performance over time are eligible for participation in long-term incentive 
plans. All colleagues have the opportunity to become shareholders in the 
Company through our all-employee share plans and, as outlined in our 20x20 
Sustainability Plan, our aim by 2020 is to increase the number of colleagues 
with shares in our business by 25 per cent.
Participation in a pension plan is offered to all colleagues on a contributory 
basis, with the Company contribution varying by grade. Following auto-
enrolment, we now have over 100,000 colleagues in one of our pension plans. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 61
Potential total remuneration opportunity under our  
pay policy
The Committee believes it is important that a significant portion of the 
package for Executive Directors is performance-related and delivered in 
shares to align their interests with shareholders. The balance between fixed 
pay (base salary, pension and benefits) and variable pay (annual bonus, 
Deferred Share Award and Future Builder) changes with performance.  
The variable proportion of total remuneration increases significantly for 
increased levels of performance. At least 60 per cent of the package is 
delivered through variable pay at on-target performance and this proportion

Our approach to recruitment
The Committee believes it is vital to be able to attract and recruit leaders of the calibre required to deliver our strategic objectives, while remaining mindful of 
the cost to the Company. When determining remuneration arrangements for new appointments, the Committee intends to pay no more than it believes is 
necessary to secure the required talent. The Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with the approved remuneration policy. 
Fixed pay Salary and benefits (including retirement benefits) would be determined in accordance with the Policy T able above. An alternative 
package may also be necessary where an individual fulfils an executive role on an interim basis.
In certain cases, the initial salary for a new appointment may be set at a lower level, with the intention of increasing the salary over 
time as the executive gains experience in the role. 
Benefits may need to be tailored based on the individual circumstances (e.g. relocation, housing or travel allowances may be required).
Variable pay The maximum variable remuneration which may be offered to an executive will be no more than 500 per cent of salary (excluding any 
buy-out arrangements). This limit is consistent with the overall maximum set out in the Policy T able.
Within these limits and where appropriate the Committee may tailor the award (e.g. timeframe, form, performance criteria) based on 
the commercial circumstances. 
Shareholders will be informed of the terms for any such arrangements.
Buy-outs The Committee may need to buy-out remuneration terms forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In such circumstances, the 
Committee will seek to ensure any buy-out is of comparable commercial value and capped as appropriate. 
The quantum, form and structure of any buy-out arrangement will be determined by the Committee taking into account the terms of 
the previous arrangement being forfeited (e.g. form and structure of award, timeframe, performance criteria, likelihood of vesting, etc.). 
The buy-out may be structured as an award of cash or shares. However, the Committee will normally have a preference for replacement 
awards to be made in the form of shares and to be within the Company’s existing incentive plans.
Where an executive is appointed from either within the Company or following corporate activity/reorganisation (e.g. acquisition of 
another company), the normal policy would be to honour any legacy arrangements in line with the original terms and conditions. 
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the terms and fees will normally be consistent with the fee policy outlined later in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

Service contracts and policy for departing Executive Directors
The Company’s policy is for Executive Directors’ service contracts to be terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party. 
Contracts contain non-compete and non-solicit clauses with key suppliers and colleagues. The Company’s normal practice is that Executive Directors may take 
up one non-executive role outside the Company, with approval from the Board, subject to the role being in a business that does not compete with the Company 
and with consideration of the time commitment. Directors are entitled to retain the fees earned from such appointments. 
In the event of early termination without notice, any severance payment would be limited to one-year’s salary and benefits (including pension), payable on a 
phased basis and subject to mitigation. Benefits payable may include certain one-off benefits in connection with termination such as legal costs and the costs 
of meeting any settlement agreement. There are no specific terms relating to a change of control.
The service contract under which Mike Coupe will be appointed Chief Executive and John Rogers was appointed as Chief Financial Officer follow these 
provisions in full, as will contracts for new appointments. The Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for shareholders to view at the Company’s 
registered office. 
The Committee retains discretion to determine the exact termination terms of any Executive Director, having regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances 
available to them at the time. The table below sets out the general position and range of approaches in respect of incentive arrangements. In accordance with 
the terms of the relevant incentive plan rules, based on the circumstances of any departure the Committee has discretion to determine how an Executive 
Director should be categorised for each element and determine vesting levels accordingly based on the range shown below. 
‘Bad leaver’  
(e.g. termination for cause, etc.)
‘Good leaver’  
(e.g. cessation due to ill-health, injury, etc.)
Annual bonus No entitlement following  
date notice served.
Bonus may be payable subject to performance. Awards normally pro-rated based 
on the period worked during the financial year, with payments usually occurring 
following the year-end.
Deferred Share Award No entitlement to current year’s 
award following date notice served.
Unvested awards will lapse on 
notice.
Normally must be employed and not under notice to receive current year’s 
award.
Outstanding unvested awards normally do not lapse. Awards may be pro-
rated for the proportion of the deferral period elapsed on cessation, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise. Awards may vest following cessation or at 
another date.
On death, unvested awards will be released and vest in full.
Long-Term Incentive  
Plan (i.e. Future Builder  
and legacy Value Builder awards)
Unvested awards will lapse on 
notice.
Unvested awards vest at the normal time subject to performance. Awards 
will normally be pro-rated by reference to the proportion of the performance 
period that has elapsed since cessation, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise.
On death, awards vest early on cessation with performance measured at this 
time. Awards are pro-rated by reference to the proportion of the performance 
period that has elapsed since cessation.
If the Director leaves in the first six months after the start of the performance 
period, the award lapses in full.
All-employee share plans In line with HMRC rules.
Legacy terms for Justin King and Mike Coupe
Justin King will step down from the Board at the AGM on 9 July 2014. Further details regarding his departure terms are set out on page 70. 
Mike Coupe’s legacy service contract continues until 9 July 2014. If Mike Coupe’s current contract is terminated without cause, the maximum payment he would receive 
would be equal to one times basic salary for the 12-month notice period plus 50 per cent of basic salary in lieu of all other elements of remuneration, except share plans 
(treatment as outlined above). The Company can make phased payments in which case Mike Coupe would be required to mitigate his loss and payments would cease 
on him finding alternative employment. Mike Coupe’s contract does not contain any specific provisions relating to change of control.
Detailed share plan provisions
Deferred Share Award, Value Builder and Future Builder awards are subject to the terms of the relevant plan rules under which the award has been granted. The 
Committee may adjust or amend awards only in accordance with the provisions of the plan rules. This includes making adjustments to awards to reflect one-off 
corporate events, such as a change in the Company’s capital structure. In accordance with the plan rules, awards may be settled in cash rather than shares, where the 
Committee considers this appropriate.
On a change of control, Deferred Share Awards would be released or vest in full. Under the LTIP rules approved by shareholders, Value/Future Builder awards may vest 
taking account of relevant factors including progress against the relevant performance conditions. Awards will be pro-rated as set out below or, alternatively, Value/
Future Builder awards may be rolled-over into awards in the new entity.
Timing of event Pro-rating
12 months or less from the annual date of grant Reduced to 33.3%
More than 12 months but 24 months or less from the annual date of grant Reduced to 66.6%
Over 24 months from the annual date of grant No reduction J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 63
In the event of a demerger or other significant distribution, Deferred Share 
Awards or Value/Future Builder awards may be allowed to vest wholly or in part if 
it is considered that a demerger or significant distribution event would affect the 
value of the award.
Winding up, administration or a voluntary arrangement event would result in 
Deferred Share Awards being released or vesting in full and Value/Future Builder 
awards would vest subject to achievement of the relevant performance 
conditions on the same time pro-rated basis as above.
In similar corporate events, awards under HMRC approved all-employee plans 
would vest in accordance with the standard approved terms.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the remuneration policy to aid 
its operation or implementation without seeking shareholder approvals (e.g. for 
regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account 
of a change in legislation) provided that any such change is not to the material 
advantage of colleagues.
Remuneration policy for the Chairman and  
Non-Executive Directors 
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee and the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors by the 
Chairman and Executive Directors. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
receive fees and are eligible for certain benefits. They are not entitled to any 
performance-related pay or pension. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts.  
The Company’s policy is to appoint the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors for an initial three-year period, which may be extended for further 
terms by mutual consent. The initial appointments and any subsequent 
reappointments are subject to annual election or re-election by shareholders. 
Non-Executive Directors’ appointments may be terminated at any time by 
serving three months’ written notice by either party; six months’ in the case 
of the Chairman. The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are 
available for shareholders to view at the Company’s registered office.
Non-Executive Director remuneration policy
Approach 
to setting 
remuneration
The fees for Non-Executive Directors are set at a level 
which is considered appropriate to attract individuals 
with the necessary experience and ability to oversee the 
business. Fees may be paid in cash or shares.
Typically reviewed annually in September.
Judgement is used but consideration is given to a number 
of internal and external factors including responsibilities, 
market positioning, inflation and colleague pay increases.
Where appropriate benefits may be provided such as 
private medical cover, annual medical assessment and 
colleague discount. 
Travel and other reasonable expenses (including any 
associated taxes) incurred in the course of performing 
their duties are reimbursed to Non-Executive Directors.
Opportunity Fee opportunity reflects responsibility and time 
commitment.
Additional fees are paid for further responsibilities such  
as chairmanship of committees.
The value of benefits provided will be reasonable in 
the market context and take account of the individual 
circumstances and benefits provided in comparable roles.
Fees as at 16 March 2014:
• 
Chairman £490,000 per annum
• 
Base fee £62,500 per annum
• 
Senior Independent Director, Chairman of 
Remuneration and Audit Committees additional  
fees of £17,500 per annum 
• 
Chairman of Corporate Responsibility and 
Sustainability Committee additional fees of £12,500  
per annum
Consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee values the views of the Company’s 
shareholders and guidance from shareholder representative bodies. 
Shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year, as well as 
any additional feedback received during the year, is considered as part of the 
Company’s annual remuneration review.
As part of the Committee’s commitment to positive and transparent 
shareholder relations, during the year the Committee consulted with its 
major shareholders in relation to the Future Builder targets for the 2014 
awards. Further details of the 2014 awards are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 64

1 Paid in relation to the year.
2 Benefits include a combination of cash and non-cash benefits, valued at the taxable value. Justin King received non-cash benefits which include company car benefits and private medical cover. Benefits for John Rogers and 
Mike Coupe include cash car allowance and private medical cover. The largest contributor to the benefits value is the company car provision: £27,856 for Justin King and £15,250 for Mike Coupe and John Rogers. Also 
included is a value for Sharesave options based on a 20 per cent discount on the savings in the year.
3 Paid in relation to the year; relates to cash supplements and for John Rogers also includes the Company contribution to a defined contribution plan. The figures in the case of John Rogers do not include deductions made 
from base salary for Saving Money and Reducing T ax (‘SMART’) pensions. 
4 Annual bonus relates to performance during the financial year, paid in May following the relevant year-end.
5 The Deferred Share Award relates to performance during the financial year, shares are granted in May following the relevant year-end and vest after a two-year deferral period.
6 The Long-Term Incentive Plan value relates to the Value Builder award vesting in May following the end of the relevant financial year, which is the third year of the performance period. 50 per cent of the shares are released in 
May after the end of the relevant performance period and the balance one year later. The figures include accrued dividends over the performance period. The 2012/13 awards are based on the share price on initial vesting of 
£3.7450. The 2013/14 awards are based on the average share price over the fourth quarter for 2013/14 of £3.4948. 
7 The Executive Directors are entitled to retain the fees earned from non-executive appointments outside the Company. Justin King was appointed a Non-Executive Director of Staples, Inc. on 17 September 2007. He received 
US$75,000 for his services during 2013/14 (2012/13: $75,000). During the year 13,715 (2012/13: 11,372) of restricted Staples stock was released to Justin King and a further award over 15,412 shares was granted (2012/13: 
13,715 restricted shares awarded). Justin King was also a Director of The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited and a member of the London Organising Committee of the 
Olympic and Paralympic Games until 30 May 2013. Justin King received £2,000 (2012/13: £8,000) during the year for his services which, after deductions for National Insurance, was donated directly to charity. Mike Coupe 
was appointed a Non-Executive Director of Greene King plc on 26 July 2011 and received £43,762 (2012/13: £43,000) for his services. 
The following section provides details for each element of the package during 
2013/14 as well as details of the Committee’s intended approach in respect  
of 2014/15.
Appointment of Mike Coupe as Chief Executive 
Mike Coupe will be appointed as Chief Executive following the AGM on  
9 July 2014. As detailed at the time of the announcement, his package  
will consist of:
• 
Salary of £900,000 per annum;
• 
Maximum annual bonus opportunity of 110 per cent of salary;
• 
Maximum Deferred Share Award of 110 per cent of salary;
• 
Future Builder core award of 62.5 per cent of salary (maximum potential 
250 per cent of salary);
• 
Payment in lieu of pension of 30 per cent of salary; and 
• 
Benefits in line with the Company’s policy.
The Committee considered Mike’s package in light of the role, the individual 
and market positioning. The salary set reflects Mike’s significant retail 
experience, knowledge of Sainsbury’s and his proven track record, including 
seven years as an Executive Director. The Committee also determined that, 
while the overall level of variable incentive opportunity for the Chief Executive 
role should remain unchanged, it should be rebalanced towards the 
long-term award (Future Builder). For 2014/15, Mike’s incentive awards will 
be pro-rated reflecting the time in each role.
As detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, Mike Coupe’s contractual 
terms have also been aligned with current best practice.

John Rogers £520,000 £600,000
*On 9 July 2014, salary will be set at £900,000.
In line with the policy, the Committee takes account of a number of factors 
when considering salaries, with particular focus on the general level of salary 
increases awarded throughout the Company. The salary review for 
management and non-management central colleagues in March 2014  
was 2.0 per cent and for hourly-paid retail colleagues in September 2013  
was 2.6 per cent. External pay data is provided to the Committee for 
reference, relating to the UK retail market and similar-sized companies in 
terms of sales revenue and market capitalisation, but the Committee applies 
judgement when considering market data. 
No adjustment was made to Justin King’s salary at the start of the 2014/15 
financial year. Mike Coupe’s salary will also remain the same until 9 July 
when he is appointed Chief Executive. At the start of the financial year, the 
Committee reviewed John Roger’s salary in light of his performance and 
expanded role, and increased his salary to £600,000. Following the full 
purchase of Sainsbury’s Bank, John is now responsible for a larger 
consolidated Group and he has a particularly important role with the Bank, 
being the only Group Director to sit on the Bank Board. John is a high 
performing and well-respected CFO in the marketplace and this adjustment 
recognises his growth in the role and most importantly his increased 
responsibilities. 
A similar approach was taken to setting pay for 2013/14, details of which 
were set out in last year’s report. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 65
Pension 
In lieu of pension plan participation, Justin King receives a pension 
supplement of 30 per cent of salary and Mike Coupe receives a pension 
supplement of 25 per cent of salary (increasing to 30 per cent on 
appointment as Chief Executive).
In 2013/14, John Rogers participated in the JS Self Invested Pension Plan 
(‘SIPP’), a defined contribution arrangement which is open to all senior 
management. In return for contributing 5 per cent of his salary, the Company 
contributed 12.5 per cent of his salary up to an internal earnings cap 
(£141,000 for 2013/14). He received a cash pension supplement of 25 per 
cent of the pensionable salary he was paid in excess of the earnings cap. For 
2014/15, he will no longer participate in the SIPP and will receive 25 per cent 
of salary as a cash pension supplement.
Benefits 
For 2013/14 and 2014/15, benefits for Executive Directors include the 
provision of company car benefits, private medical cover, long-term disability 
insurance, life assurance and colleague discount. 
Performance-related pay
The Committee believes it is important that for Executive Directors 
a significant portion of the package is performance-related and the 
performance conditions applying to incentive arrangements support the 
delivery of the Company’s strategy and the long-term sustainable success  
of the Company. The Committee considers performance against a range of 
metrics to ensure that the assessment is rounded, taking into account both 
qualitative and quantitative factors. 
The table below outlines each of the performance measures used in our 
performance-related pay arrangements and how they support our business 
strategy as outlined in the Strategic Review, being the five areas of focus, 
operational excellence, our values and our customers.

The Board is of the opinion that the performance targets for the annual bonus 
and Deferred Share Award are commercially sensitive as we operate in a 
highly competitive, consumer-facing sector. The disclosure of targets would 
provide competitors, even after the end of the performance period, with 
insights into the Company’s strategic aims, budgeting and growth 
projections. Therefore, a full breakdown of the targets for the 2013/14 and 
2014/15 awards has not been provided. However, in the following sections, 
the Committee has looked to provide expanded disclosure where possible so 
that shareholders can understand the basis for payments.
Annual bonus
2014/15 policy
All bonus plans across the Company are aligned under a set of common 
principles. The Board and management plans are based on profit, sales 
growth, customer-focused measures and an element for individual 
performance. Bonus awards are weighted to the achievement of profit, at 
least 50 per cent under the current structure, and profit also acts as the 
overall ‘gateway’ measure for the plan, reflecting the emphasis on profit.  
The annual bonus is paid in cash after the year-end.
The profit and sales targets are set against the Company’s expected 
performance and are subject to a rigorous process of challenge before the 
proposals are considered by the Board. For 2014/15, the targets have been set 
such that stretching performance in excess of internal and external forecasts 
is required for maximum payout. The customer-focused measures are based 
on product availability and a customer service measure. 
Individual performance objectives are set annually for each Executive Director 
and are reviewed by the Committee. These objectives cover a variety of 
financial and operational targets that contribute to the achievement of 
longer-term strategic goals; some of these objectives relate, either directly or 
indirectly, to the Company’s values. 
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for the new Chief Executive will 
be 110 per cent of base salary which will take effect from the date of his 
appointment to the role. The maximum opportunity for the Chief Financial 
Officer remains unchanged at 90 per cent of base salary. Justin King will not 
participate in this plan in 2014/15.
2013/14 annual bonus payment (audited information)
The performance measures for 2013/14 were the same as outlined above  
for 2014/15. The Committee assessed performance against the targets 
following the end of the financial year. The Committee considers that  
the detail of targets applying to the annual bonus for 2013/14 continue  
to be commercially sensitive. However, an explanation of the outcome, 
including the positioning against the performance scale for each element  
is shown below:
Profit Sales
Customer- 
focused
Individual 
performance
Above target
• • Target
• Threshold
Below threshold
• During the year, the Company achieved good year-on-year profit growth 
resulting in an underlying profit before tax of £798 million. However, this 
performance was not sufficient to trigger vesting at the upper-end of the scale 
due to the highly demanding targets which were set at the start of the year. 
The profit element represents around 50 per cent of the total award and 
therefore this has a noticeable impact on the overall level of vesting.  
In addition, despite growing retail sales (including VAT , excluding fuel) by  
2.7 per cent and maintaining market share, we were unable to meet our 
threshold sales target. The customer element is made up of a product 
availability measure (which is measured across all stores on a regular basis  
by an independent third party, conducting random and unannounced store 
visits) and a customer service measure (based on how well the store support 
centres support customers and stores), both of which were achieved in full, 
reflecting our strong performance in this area. 
The Committee also carefully reviewed the performance of the Executive 
Directors against the objectives that were set at the start of the year. These 
objectives include the Executive Directors’ contribution to the Company’s 
strategy as members of the Board and specific goals related to their core 
areas of responsibility.  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 66

Based on the above performance outcomes, the table below sets out the 
Executive Directors’ bonus payments for 2013/14, which are payable in cash 
in May 2014. These are the figures included in the annual bonus row in the 
single total figure table.

The 2013/14 annual bonus for store colleagues was based on corporate sales, 
product availability and customer service targets measured in their individual 
stores. This has resulted in a bonus pool of over £80 million which will be 
shared by colleagues. 
Deferred Share Award
2014/15 policy
The Deferred Share Award (‘DSA’) is used to drive performance against a 
diverse range of business-critical financial and strategic scorecard measures 
and rewards Executive Directors for achieving the short-term objectives that 
will directly lead to building the sustainable, long-term growth of the 
Company. These awards are made in shares to ensure further alignment of 
Executive Directors’ interests with shareholders. 
The DSA covers broadly the top 45 managers in the Company, including 
Executive Directors. Performance is assessed in the round based on the 
Committee’s judgement of performance achieved against a number of 
measures within four broad categories. The categories and examples of the 
measures that will be reviewed for 2014/15 are set out below.
Financial performance Profit, earnings per share
Returns to shareholders Total shareholder return, dividend yield
Relative performance against peers Market share
Strategic goals Five areas of focus, corporate 
responsibility
As outlined in the Policy T able, at least 50 per cent of the award will be  
based on the delivery of financial performance and returns to shareholders.  
In addition, no shares will be awarded unless the profit gateway target  
(as applied to the annual bonus) is achieved.
Performance is assessed over one financial year, but any shares awarded are 
deferred for a further two financial years. The shares are subject to forfeiture 
if the participant resigns or is dismissed for cause prior to their release date. 
Dividends accrue during the deferral period on the shares that vest in the form 
of additional shares.
The maximum DSA award opportunity for the new Chief Executive will be  
110 per cent of base salary, which will take effect from the date of his 
appointment to the role. The maximum opportunity for the Chief Financial 
Officer remains unchanged at 90 per cent of base salary. Justin King will not 
participate in this plan in 2014/15.
2013/14 Deferred Share Award (audited information) 
Following the year-end, the Committee conducted a rigorous assessment 
of performance. Consistent with the underlying principles of the DSA, the 
Committee assessed achievements in the round and also considered the 
manner in which these performance goals had been delivered, in particular 
how the overall performance of the Company had contributed to its future, 
sustainable growth and success. 
The Company performed well in challenging market circumstances in 
2013/14 and this flowed through to the measures that determine awards 
under the DSA. The Committee agreed that for 2013/14 awards would be 
made at 80 per cent of the maximum level (see table below). These are the 
figures set out in the DSA row of the single total figure table. The share award 
is made in May 2014 and the shares vest in March 2016 subject to continued 
employment.

Although some of the specific measures and targets are commercially 
sensitive, the table opposite presents a selection of performance highlights 
which the Committee took into account within each of the four categories. 
Long-term incentives
2014/15 policy
The long-term incentive vehicle in use at Sainsbury’s is known as Future 
Builder. This arrangement was introduced in 2012 following the amendment 
to the performance conditions. Awards are made under the shareholder 
approved 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the overall maximum award 
permitted by the rules of the plan is 250 per cent of salary including the 
performance multiplier.
Around 230 senior managers participate in this arrangement. A core award of 
shares is granted, calculated as a percentage of salary and scaled according 
to level of seniority. Vesting of the core award is dependent upon 
performance against specific measures (common for all participants) tested 
at the end of a three-year performance period. The core award can grow by 
up to four times at stretch levels of performance. Half of any vested shares are 
released at the end of the performance period, while the remaining half are 
released after a further year. Dividends accrue between grant and vesting on 
the shares that vest, in the form of additional shares.
As outlined in the Policy T able, Future Builder measures performance against 
ROCE, Cash Flow and relative sales. 
 
The targets and weightings for the 2014 awards are set out below:
Measure Weighting
Threshold 
target

award)
Maximum

30% £5,750m £6,750m
Relative sales v IGD Index 20% Match 
Index

+1.0% p.a.
In addition, a performance gateway must be achieved before any element 
under the ROCE, Cash Flow or relative sales elements can vest. The 
Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the Company’s underlying 
performance over the period justifies the level of vesting. Vesting will be 
reduced if the vesting outcome is not considered to be justified. At vesting, 
when making this judgement the Committee has scope to consider such 
factors as it deems relevant. The Committee believes that having a gateway 
is an important feature of the plan and mitigates the risk of unwarranted 
vesting outcomes.  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 67

Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
During the year, the Committee reviewed the performance targets to ensure 
they remained aligned with the business plan. For 2014/15, the Committee, 
after consulting with shareholders, has increased the threshold and 
maximum Cash Flow targets by £250 million from £5,500 million –  
£6,500 million to £5,750 million – £6,750 million. The ROCE and relative  
sales targets remain unchanged.
As Chief Executive, in 2014 Mike Coupe will receive a total core award of 62.5 
per cent of salary (maximum 250 per cent of salary). This will comprise a core 
award of 50 per cent of salary in May 2014 in relation to his role as Group 
Commercial Director and, as previously announced, after he is appointed 
Chief Executive, he will receive an additional award, bringing the overall award 
to 62.5 per cent of his average salary for 2014/15. John Rogers will receive a 
core award of 50 per cent of salary in May 2014. 
Future Builder performance measures
ROCE
ROCE is based on the underlying operating profit for the whole business, with 
Sainsbury’s Bank fully consolidated, including the underlying share of post-tax 
profit from joint ventures. The capital employed figure excludes the impact of 
movements in the IAS 19 pension deficit.
Cumulative underlying cash flow from retail operations
The cumulative underlying cash flow is based on the reported cash flow 
generated from core retail operations over the performance period after 
adding back net rent and cash pension costs. Only core retail operations are 
included in recognition of the differences in cash generation between the 
retail business and Sainsbury’s Bank.
Relative sales
Relative sales performance is measured using the IGD Index (IGD Market 
Track). The Index measures growth in like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) across 
the market based on the performance of all of the Company’s key competitors. 
This is an independently audited index of sales efficiency, which is viewed as 
a robust reference point for performance across the food retail sector. 
2014 vesting (audited information)
Until 2012, long-term incentive awards were known as Value Builder awards. 
The structure of the plan is the same as Future Builder but different 
performance conditions applied. The Long-Term Incentive Plan figures in the 
single total figure table relates to the sixth cycle of Value Builder which was 
made in 2011 and vests in May 2014, based on performance over 2011/12 to 
2013/14. The performance conditions applying to the award vesting in May 
2014 are set out in the ‘Performance conditions attached to outstanding 
long-term incentives awards’ table.
When assessing ROCE and cash flow per share (‘CFPS’) performance for the 
purposes of the plan, adjustments were made to take into account additional 
investment, returns and one-off events not envisaged at the time the targets 
were set. The Committee determined an adjusted ROCE of 13.0 per cent and 
CFPS of 8.2 per cent, resulting in a vesting multiplier of 1.6 times, which the 
Committee believes is a true and fair reflection of performance. This 
represents 40 per cent of the maximum award opportunity. 
One half of the award becomes exercisable in May 2014, with the remaining 
portion exercisable in May 2015.

times the core award. The award was made on 16 May 2013 and the number of shares has been calculated using the five-day average share price prior to grant (9 to 15 May 2013) of £3.8368. 50 per cent of the award vests 
on 12 May 2016 and 50 per cent 12 months later. The award is structured as a nil-cost option with a two-year exercise period.
2 The DSA was made on 16 May 2013 based on performance over the 2012/13 financial year. The award was made at 83 per cent of the maximum level (maximum of 125 per cent of salary for Justin King and 90 per cent of 
salary for Mike Coupe and John Rogers). The number of shares has been calculated using the five-day average share price prior to grant (9 to 15 May 2013) of £3.8368. No further performance conditions apply. Awards 
become exercisable on 20 March 2015. The award is structured as a nil-cost option with an eight-year exercise period. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 69
All-employee share plans 
In line with our 20x20 target of increasing the number of colleagues with 
shares in the Company by 25 per cent, the Company provides two all-
employee share plans for colleagues, namely the Savings-Related Share 
Option Plan (‘SAYE’) and the All-Employee Share Ownership Plan, of which the 
Sainsbury’s Share Purchase Plan (‘SSPP’) is a part. Executive Directors may 
participate in these plans in the same way as all other colleagues. Justin King 
and John Rogers currently participate in both plans. Mike Coupe participates 
in the SAYE. As these are all-employee plans there are no performance 
conditions. The Committee approves the adoption or amendment of these 
plans and awards to Executive Directors. 
The 2008 (five-year) SAYE reached maturity on 1 March 2014. Around 3,200 
colleagues could use their savings and a tax-free bonus to buy Sainsbury’s 
shares at a £2.24 option price. The 2010 (three-year) SAYE matured at the 
same time covering around 7,200 colleagues who could use their savings 
and a tax-free bonus to buy Sainsbury’s shares at a £2.97 option price. Using 
the market price on the date of the first exercise, the value of all the shares 
subject to the maturity was nearly £28 million. The Company currently has 
over 33,000 colleagues participating in the SAYE with around 64,000 
individual savings contracts. 
Shareholding guidelines (audited information)
As detailed in the Policy T able, the Executive Directors are required to build up 
a specified level of shareholding in the Company. This is to create greater 
alignment of the Directors’ interests with those of shareholders, in line with 
the objectives of the remuneration policy. The guidelines require the Chief 
Executive to have a holding of 2.5 times salary and Executive Directors 1.5 
times salary. Directors are required to build this shareholding within five years 
of appointment to the relevant role. In addition to shares held, share awards 
under the DSA and Value/Future Builder awards where the performance 
period has ended count towards the guideline (on a net of tax basis).
Notes
Shareholding calculated using (i) salaries as at 15 March 2014, (ii) share total based on total of shareholding 
plus net of tax value (tax assumed to be 47 per cent) of share awards not subject to performance as at 
15 March 2014 and (iii) the closing mid-market share price on 14 March 2014 of £3.1360.
All Executive Directors have shareholdings that meet and significantly exceed 
the current shareholding guideline. On appointment as Chief Executive, Mike 
Coupe’s shareholding guideline will increase to 2.5 times salary. However, his 
current holding exceeds the new guideline. 
Executive Directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited information)
The table below sets out details of all the Executive Directors’ shareholdings and their share awards. Further details of the movements of the Executive 
Directors’ shareholdings during the year are set out on page 73.

6 Relates to Value and Future Builder awards (maximum) where the performance period has not ended, including those awards granted in 2012/13 as set out in the ‘Share awards made during the financial year’ section and 
those vesting in May 2014. 
 
Note: The Executive Directors are potential beneficiaries of the Company’s employee benefit trust, which is used to satisfy awards under the Company’s employee share plans, and they are therefore treated as interested in the 
2.1 million shares (2013: 5.3 million) held by the Trustees. 
Dilution 
The Company ensures that the level of shares granted under the Company’s 
share plans and the means of satisfying such awards remains within best 
practice guidelines so that dilution from employee share awards does not 
exceed 10 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital for all-employee share 
plans and 5 per cent in respect of executive share plans in any ten-year rolling 
period. The Company monitors dilution levels on a regular basis and the 
Committee reviews these at least once a year. Up to 15 March 2014, an 
estimated 8.0 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital has been allocated 
for the purposes of its all-employee share plans over a ten-year period, 
including an estimated 4.0 per cent over ten years in respect of its executive 
share plans. This is on the basis that all outstanding awards vest in full.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Departure terms of Justin King
Justin King will step down at the AGM on 9 July 2014. Justin King’s contract 
provides for a cash severance payment potentially worth up to 175 per cent 
of his base salary at departure. However, he has offered to waive this cash 
entitlement. As detailed on announcement of his departure, the 
Remuneration Committee have determined the following treatment:
• 
There will be no payment in lieu of notice;
• 
He will remain eligible for an annual bonus and Deferred Share Award 
for 2013/14;
• 
He will receive no annual bonus, Deferred Share Award or Future Builder  
for 2014/15;
• 
There will be no acceleration of vesting for any share awards;
• 
The 2012/13 and 2013/14 Deferred Share Awards will subsist in full and  
will be released at the end of the deferral period; and
• 
The 2011 Value Builder and 2012 and 2013 Future Builder awards will subsist 
in full and will vest at the normal date, subject to the normal performance 
conditions i.e. at a vesting level consistent with other colleagues.
The above arrangements ensure that any remaining payments to Justin King 
are aligned with the performance of the Company following his departure 
and are a sign of his confidence in the new management and the business’s 
continuing prospects.

The Remuneration Committee comprises Mary Harris, John McAdam  
and Jean Tomlin. All members of the Committee are independent

policy. The specific responsibilities of the Committee include: 
• 
Determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration policy for the 
Chairman, Executive Directors and the Operating Board Directors; 
• 
Setting individual remuneration arrangements for the Chairman and 
Executive Directors;
• 
Recommending and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for 
those members of senior management within the scope of the Committee, 
namely the Operating Board Directors and any other executive whose 
salary exceeds that of any Operating Board Director;
• 
Reviewing and noting the remuneration trends across the Company; 
• 
Approving the service agreements of each Executive Director, including 
termination arrangements; and
• 
Considering the achievement of the performance conditions under annual 
and long-term incentive/bonus arrangements.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s website 
(www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investor-centre/corporate-governance).  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 72
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Tim Fallowfield, Company Secretary, acts as secretary to the Committee. 
David Tyler, Justin King, Angie Risley (Group HR Director), Lorna Godman 
(Head of Reward) and Ed Barker (Director of Group Finance), are invited to 
attend Committee meetings. Mike Coupe and John Rogers have also attended 
selected meetings. The Committee considers their views when reviewing the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors and Operating Board Directors. 
Individuals who attend Remuneration Committee meetings do not 
participate in discussions concerning their own remuneration. 
Principal activities and matters addressed during 2013/14 
The Committee has a calendar of standard items within its remit and in 
addition it held in-depth discussions on specific topics during the year. The 
Committee typically meets four times each year, or more as required. The 
table below shows the standard items considered at each meeting, leading 
up to the meeting in April where the key decisions regarding performance, 
outcomes and grants for the coming year are determined. The key issues the 
Committee discussed during the year were the exit arrangements for Justin 
King, the remuneration arrangements for Mike Coupe, the Future Builder 
arrangement, the targets applying to 2014 awards and the new reporting 
regulations. The Committee also undertook a competitive tender exercise  
of its adviser.

Directors’ Remuneration Report 
 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee is authorised by the Board to appoint external advisers 
if it considers this beneficial. Over the course of the year, the Committee  
was supported by its appointed advisers, Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’), whose 
consultants attended all of the Committee meetings. Deloitte provided  
advice to the Committee on a range of topics including remuneration trends, 
corporate governance, incentive plan design and consulting with 
shareholders. In relation to this advice, Deloitte received fees of c. £165,000 
(fees are based on hours spent). Deloitte provided the Company with 
unrelated advice and consultancy regarding information technology,  
taxation and non-audit accounting matters.
Towers Watson provided comparative data, which was considered by the 
Committee in setting remuneration levels, for which they received fees of 
c. £35,000. Towers Watson also provided other services to the Company 
relating to pensions.
Both Deloitte and Towers Watson are members of the Remuneration 
Consulting Group and, as such, operate under the Code of Conduct in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. During the year, the 
Committee has reviewed the advice provided by Deloitte and Towers Watson 
and has confirmed that it has been objective and independent. The 
Committee has also determined that the Deloitte partner who provides 
remuneration advice to the Committee does not have any connections with 
the Company that may impact their independence. The Committee has 
reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were 
appropriate safeguards against such conflicts. 
Following the appointment of a new Remuneration Committee Chairman 
in 2012 and in line with good governance, during the year the Committee 
undertook a competitive tender of its advisers. During the extensive tender 
process, the Committee met with a number of firms which concluded with 
the reappointment of Deloitte.
Statement of voting at general meeting
The table below sets out the votes on the Directors’ Remuneration Report

shareholders and continually reviews the remuneration policy and 
implementation.

Directors’ Report
Dividends
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 12.3 pence per 
share (2013: 11.9 pence), making a total dividend for the year of 17.3 pence 
per share (2013: 16.7 pence), an increase of 3.6 per cent over the previous 
year. Subject to shareholders approving this recommendation at the Annual 
General Meeting (‘ AGM’), the dividend will be paid on 11 July 2014 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 16 May 2014.
Changes to the Board
As reported in our Annual Report last year, Susan Rice joined the Board on  
1 June 2013 and her appointment was approved by shareholders at the  
AGM on 10 July 2013. 
In January, we announced that Justin King will stand down in July after ten  
very successful years as Chief Executive and that Mike Coupe will succeed 
him. Mike joined Sainsbury’s in 2004 and was appointed to the Board in 
August 2007. Since July 2010 he has been Group Commercial Director. 
Re-election of Directors
The UK Corporate Governance Code provides for all directors of FTSE 
companies to stand for election or re-election by shareholders every year. 
Accordingly, all members of the Board, with the exception of Justin King,  
will retire and seek re-election at this year’s AGM. Full biographical details  
of all of the current Directors are set out on page 37. 
 
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held on Wednesday 9 July 2014 at The Queen Elizabeth II 
Conference Centre, Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, London SW1P 3EE at 
11.00am. The Chairman’s letter and the Notice of Meeting accompany  
this report, together with notes explaining the business to be transacted  
at the meeting.
At the meeting, resolutions will be proposed to declare a final dividend, to 
receive the Annual Report and Financial Statements, approve the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, to re-elect  
the Directors, and to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors.  
In addition, shareholders will be asked to renew both the general authority  
of the Directors to issue shares and to authorise the Directors to issue  
shares without applying the statutory pre-emption rights. In this regard,  
the Company will continue to adhere to the provisions in the Pre-emption 
Group’s Statement of Principles.
Shareholders will be asked to authorise the Company to make market 
purchases of its own shares. Shareholders will also be asked to authorise the 
Directors to hold general meetings at 14 clear days’ notice (where this 
flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in 
the interests of shareholders as a whole). A resolution to renew the authority 
to make ‘political donations’ as defined by Part 14 of the 2006 Companies Act 
will also be proposed.
Share capital and control
The following information is given pursuant to Section 992 of the 2006 
Companies Act.
Except as described below in relation to the Company’s employee share 
schemes, there are no restrictions on the voting rights attaching to the 
Company’s ordinary shares or the transfer of securities in the Company; no 
person holds securities in the Company carrying special rights with regard to 
control of the Company; and the Company is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of securities that may result in restrictions in the transfer of 
securities or voting rights. Further details of the rights, restrictions and 
obligations attaching to the share capital of the Company, including voting 
rights, are contained in the Company’s Articles of Association. The Articles of 
Association may only be changed with the agreement of shareholders. 
Shares acquired through the Company’s employee share plans rank pari 
passu with shares in issue and have no special rights. Where, under the 
Company’s All-Employee Share Ownership Plan, participants are beneficial 
owners of the shares but the Trustee is the registered owner, the voting rights 
are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the 
participants. The J Sainsbury Employee Benefit Trusts waive their right to 
vote and to dividends on the shares they hold which are unallocated. Some 
of the Company’s employee share plans include restrictions on transfer of 
shares while the shares are held within the plan.
At the AGM held in July 2013, the Company was authorised by shareholders 
to purchase its own shares, within certain limits and as permitted by the 
Articles of Association. The Company made no purchases of its own shares 
during the year and no shares were acquired by forfeiture or surrender or 
made subject to a lien or charge.
All of the Company’s employee share plans contain provisions relating to a 
change of control. On a change of control, options and awards granted to 
employees under the Company’s share plans may vest and become 
exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of any applicable performance 
conditions at that time. 
Certain of the Company’s credit facilities and banking arrangements 
contain change of control clauses under which lenders may cancel their 
commitments and declare all outstanding amounts immediately due and 
payable. There are no other significant agreements that would take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid.
 
Ordinary shares
Details of the changes to the ordinary issued share capital during the year are 
shown on page 109. At the date of this report, 1,908,436,219 ordinary shares 
of 28
4

Employment policies
The Company is committed to equal opportunities for recruitment and 
selection, through training and development, performance reviews and 
promotion through our ‘ A great place to work’ strategy. The Company has  
well developed policies for the fair and equal treatment of all colleagues  
and the employment of disadvantaged persons. During the year, a number

responsibility/factsheets).
The Company is committed to colleague involvement throughout the 
business. Colleagues are kept informed of the performance and strategy of 
the Company and quarterly trading statements, interim and annual results 
are presented to all senior management and are communicated to all 
colleagues. 
Colleagues have always been encouraged to hold shares in the Company.  
One of our 20x20 commitments is to increase the number of colleagues with 
shares in our business by 25 per cent by 2020.
Human rights
The Company does not have a specific human rights policy but fairness 
and integrity are an important part of the way we run the business as  
shown by the values and policies described above and throughout this  
report. In addition, our customers want to be confident that the people who 
make and sell our products are not being exploited, or exposed to unsafe 
working conditions. Our Code of Conduct for Ethical Trade covers the 
employment practices we expect from our suppliers, both in the UK and 
abroad. As founder members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (‘ETI’), our 
Code of Conduct is consistent with the ETI Base Code and national and

Donations
The Company made no political donations in 2014 (2013: £nil).
See page 23 for details of the Company’s charitable donations.
Essential contracts
Sainsbury’s has contractual and other arrangements with numerous third 
parties in support of its business activities. None of the arrangements is 
individually considered to be essential to Sainsbury’s business. 
Taxation
The Company complies with relevant tax laws, regulations and obligations 
regarding the filing of tax returns, payment and collection of tax. Sainsbury’s 
does not undertake any tax planning schemes that seek to use so-called ‘tax 
havens’ for aggressive tax planning and for the purpose of tax avoidance. 
Sainsbury’s aims to develop an open, honest relationship with the tax 
authorities and involve them at an early stage should any complex tax issues 
arise. The taxation policy is reviewed annually by the Board. T ax is a key item 
on the Audit Committee agenda and is discussed quarterly where large or 
complex tax items will feature, together with compliance and key risk 
management updates.
All of Sainsbury’s stores are based in the UK, and all our sales are generated 
here. As such substantially all (more than 99 per cent) of our taxes are paid 
here. The Group also includes companies based in the following jurisdictions: 
Hong Kong and China – our offices in Hong Kong and China source many 
of our non-food products. Local taxes of £1 million were paid in the year 
(2012/13 £1 million), Isle of Man – our insurance company is based here for 
regulatory reasons, as are many other insurance companies. Ireland, Jersey, 
Guernsey, USA – these companies are all dormant and accordingly do not pay 
any tax. There are also other Group companies that were incorporated in 
Ireland, USA, Jersey and the Cayman Islands that are UK tax resident, 
meaning that all relevant taxes are payable to the UK Government.
Post balance sheet events
There are no post balance sheet events.
Financial risk management
The financial risk management and policies of the Group are disclosed in note 
28 on pages 114 to 120 to the financial statements.
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 1 to 35, 46, 49, 75 and inside front cover. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity are highlighted in the 
Financial Review on pages 28 to 35. The Group manages its financing by 
diversifying funding sources, structuring core borrowings with long-term 
maturities and maintaining sufficient levels of standby liquidity. Full details 
of the Group’s financing arrangements can be found in note 20 on pages 106 
and 107 to the financial statements. In addition, notes 28 and 29 on pages 
114 to 126 to the financial statements include the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities;  
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
Management are satisfied that stress tests on the future liquidity of the Group 
do not indicate a going concern risk.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully despite the current challenging 
economic outlook. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements which are shown on pages 80 to 138.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the Directors has confirmed that, so far as he/she is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware. Each Director 
has taken all steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director in order to 
make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the auditors are aware of that information. 
Independent auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have expressed their willingness to be 
reappointed as auditors of the Company. Upon the recommendation of the 
Audit Committee, resolutions to reappoint them as auditors and to authorise 
the Directors to determine their remuneration will be proposed at the AGM.

Financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for  
each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group  
and Company financial statements in accordance with International  
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group  
for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• 
state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue in 
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Having taken all the matters considered by the Board and brought to the 
attention of the Board during the year into account, we are satisfied that the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable.
The Board believes that the disclosures set out on pages 1 to 35, 46, 49, 75 
and the inside front cover of this Annual Report provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 37, 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• 
the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
• 
the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report contained in the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
• 
 the financial statements, defined below, give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 15 March 2014 and 
of the Group’s profit and of the Group’s and Company’s cash flows for the 
52 weeks then ended;
• 
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union;
• 
 the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied  
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of 
this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the 
‘financial statements’), which are prepared by J Sainsbury plc, comprise:
• 
the Group and Company balance sheets at 15 March 2014;
• 
the Group income statement and statement of comprehensive income for 
the 52 weeks then ended;
• 
the Group and Company statements of changes in equity and cash flow 
statements for the 52 weeks then ended; and
• 
the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, 
as regards the Company, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have been 
presented elsewhere in the Annual Report and Financial statements 2014 
(the ‘ Annual Report’), rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified 
as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). An audit involves obtaining 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of:
• 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed;
• 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and 
• 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Group 
financial statements as a whole to be £40 million. This represents approximately 
5 per cent of the Group’s profit before tax adjusted for one-off items, as defined 
in note 3 on page 93. We believe basing materiality on this adjusted profit 
measure is appropriate as it is a measure of recurring performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £3 million as well as 
misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons. 
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group’s businesses are organised into three operating segments, being 
retailing, financial services and property investments, as defined in note 4 to 
the financial statements. The financial statements are a consolidation of six 
reporting units, which cover the Group’s retailing and financial services 
businesses (Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Limited and Sainsbury’s Bank plc, 
the ‘Bank’), centralised functions (including J Sainsbury plc), property 
companies and joint ventures. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the 
type of work that needed to be performed at the reporting units by us, as the 
Group engagement team, or component auditors within PwC UK and by other 
firms operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to 
have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
Of the Group’s six reporting units, we identified two (J Sainsbury plc and 
Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Ltd) which, in our view, required an audit of their 
complete financial information, either due to their size or their risk 
characteristics. In addition, we performed an audit of the complete financial 
information of the Bank as at 28 February 2014 and for the one month period 
then ended, being the period from the date of acquisition. Specified audit 
procedures on material balances and transactions were performed at the 
remaining three reporting units. This, together with additional procedures 
performed at the Group level, such as on tax, the acquisition accounting for 
the Bank and the consolidation process, gave us the evidence we needed for 
our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors made a number of 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events 
that are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas by 
assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of J Sainsbury plc  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 78
Financial statements
Independent auditors’ report to the members of J Sainsbury plc continued
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence 
through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in 
the current year. This is not a complete list of all risks or areas of audit focus 
identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit 
Committee. Their report on those matters that they considered to be 
significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on page 52.
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts
We focused on this area as supplier incentives, rebates and discounts 
represent a material reduction in cost of sales expenses. The calculation of 
these amounts is in part dependent on an estimation of whether amounts 
due under supplier agreements have been earned at the balance sheet date 
based on either inventory purchased or goods sold. Furthermore the process 
for calculating and recording supplier incentives, rebates and discounts 
involves significant manual processes which are more susceptible to error.
We understood and tested the interface between the three systems in place 
over supplier incentives, rebates and discounts to satisfy ourselves as to the 
accuracy and integrity of the data.
We tested the accuracy of a sample of key inputs to individual supplier 
agreements. We then re-performed management’s calculations, using  
the tested inputs, to determine the accuracy of the amounts recognised.
We performed procedures to identify any significant transactions recorded as 
manual adjustments and obtained evidence to support the recognition and 
timing of those amounts based on the individual supplier agreements. 
We performed year-end cut-off procedures to determine whether amounts 
were recorded in the correct period.
Acquisition accounting for Sainsbury’s Bank
Following the acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent of Sainsbury’s Bank 
on 31 January 2014, the Bank is now consolidated into the Group financial 
statements, with the assets and liabilities purchased being accounted for  
at fair values at the date of the acquisition.
We focused on this area given the significant judgements involved in 
assessing the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, as this directly 
impacts the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition. The fair values are 
based on valuation techniques built, in part, on assumptions about the Bank’s 
future performance, which are inherently judgemental.
Furthermore, there was complexity involved in acquisition accounting for the 
Bank given it was previously held as a joint venture (refer to note 37 of the 
financial statements).
Our audit procedures to test the accounting for the transaction, included 
verifying the purchase price, contract clauses and terms connected with 
completion adjustments to the signed sale and purchase agreement. 
We evaluated the fair values allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired 
by Sainsbury’s Group as part of the transaction with reference to appropriate 
supporting calculations and third party expert reports. This included 
assessing whether the fair values allocated aligned to market expectations 
based on our experience of other banking transactions. 
We tested all material consolidation entries recorded in connection with the 
acquisition to determine whether the accounting was appropriate.
Revenue recognition 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue recognition 
because of the pressure management may feel to achieve the planned results. 
As the vast majority of revenue is settled in cash or by credit card we 
focused on manual adjustments to revenue as they are more susceptible to 
manipulation.
We tested the reconciliations between the revenue system, management 
accounts and the financial statements.
We used data analytics to agree revenue from transactions recorded through 
the tills to cash or credit card receipts, which represents the vast majority of 
revenue recorded during the financial year.
In addition we tested significant manual journal entries posted to revenue 
which included non-cash adjustments for items such as staff discounts, 
coupon redemptions and gift vouchers/cards, to identify and understand 
unusual or irregular items and obtained evidence to support their recognition.
Accounting for property transactions
A number of significant property transactions took place during the year.
We focused on these transactions as they were material in value and complex 
in nature, requiring consideration of the point at which the risks and rewards 
of ownership were transferred to or from the Group, which affects the 
recognition of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The Directors also 
had to exercise judgement in determining whether properties held under 
lease agreements were classified as either finance or operating leases (refer 
to note 11 and note 33 of the financial statements).
 
We obtained an understanding of the underlying commercial rationale for 
each material property transaction.
We evaluated the control environment surrounding the accounting for 
property transactions including testing of controls around disposal control 
forms and the approval of major capital expenditure projects.
Our audit procedures included obtaining and reviewing the legal documents 
to fully understand the terms and conditions of each transaction and 
therefore the associated accounting implications. We evaluated the 
appropriateness of the accounting treatments adopted and obtained 
independent valuation assessments for a sample of properties to test that the 
properties had been valued appropriately.
Impairment of land and stores under construction
We focused on the carrying value of property held for development given 
the impairment recognised during the year and the judgements involved in 
determining the recoverable amount.
We obtained management’s impairment assessment for land and stores 
under construction to assess whether or not the recoverable amount of the 
assets were below their carrying values.
We evaluated the assumptions and valuation methodology used by 
management and the validity of data for a sample of assets. For those 
assets where recoverable amount was determined on a value in use basis 
we compared forecast sales with existing comparable stores. For those stores 
where recoverable amount was determined based on fair value less costs 
to dispose, we compared investment yields with industry standards and 
appropriate independent benchmarks. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 79
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Risk of management override of internal controls 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this. 
We performed a fraud risk assessment in order to identify specific areas of 
risk relating to management override of controls. 
We performed testing of journals, with particular focus on manual 
adjustments to the income statement, to mitigate the risk of manipulation of 
revenue and profit figures.
We independently assessed and challenged accounting estimates relevant 
to the financial statements for evidence of bias by the Directors that 
may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, for example 
provisions, asset impairments, income taxes, post-employment benefits and 
assets’ useful economic lives.
We also assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including the 
arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” and held meetings with members of 
the Board and Operating Board as well as the Group’s Internal Audit function.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, on 
page 75, in relation to going concern. We have no exceptions to report arising 
from our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going concern 
basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and 
Company has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the 
financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded 
that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these 
statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion:
• 
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements; and
• 
the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Other matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations 
received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
• 
the Company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to 
be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law have not 
been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’). We have  
nothing to report having performed our review.
On page 76 of the Annual Report, as required by the Code Provision C.1.1, the 
Directors state that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
members to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. 
On page 52, as required by C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit Committee has set out 
the significant issues that it considered in relation to the financial statements, 
and how they were addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
• 
the statement given by the Directors is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• 
the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us 
to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
• 
materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
our knowledge of the Group and Company acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• 
is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors

Company statement of changes in equity
for the 52 weeks to 15 March 2014 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 86
Financial statements
1 General information
J Sainsbury plc is a public limited company (the ‘Company’) incorporated in 
the United Kingdom, whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock 
Exchange. The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its 
registered address is 33 Holborn, London EC1N 2HT , United Kingdom.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 15 March 2014 (prior financial 
year 52 weeks to 16 March 2013). The consolidated financial statements for 
the 52 weeks to 15 March 2014 comprise the financial statements of the 
Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) and the Group’s share of the 
post-tax results of its joint ventures and associates.
The Group’s principal activities are grocery related retailing and retail banking.
 
2 Accounting policies
(a) Statement of compliance
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (‘IFRICs’) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs. The Company’s financial 
statements have been prepared on the same basis and, as permitted by 
Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement or 
statement of comprehensive income is presented for the Company.
(b) Basis of preparation
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest 
million (‘£m’) unless otherwise stated. They have been prepared on a going 
concern basis under the historical cost convention, except for derivative 
financial instruments, investment properties and available-for-sale financial 
assets that have been measured at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires 
the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience 
and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements 
about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are 
disclosed in note 2c.
Amendments to published standards
Effective for the Group and Company in these financial 
statements:
The Group and Company has considered the following new standards, 
interpretations and amendments to published standards that are effective for 
the Group and Company for the financial year beginning 17 March 2013: 
• 
IAS 19 (revised 2011) ‘Employee benefits’
• 
IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’
• 
Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments asset and liability offsetting’
• 
Amendment to IAS 1‘Presentation of financial statements’ on Other 
Comprehensive Income
• 
Amendment to IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ on deferred tax
• 
Annual improvements 2011
An amended version of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ was issued in June 2011 
(‘IAS 19 Revised’) and became effective for the Group’s financial year ended 
15 March 2014. Changes under the amended standard have been applied 
retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 ‘ Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors’, resulting in an adjustment of prior year 
financial information. The changes to the Group’s accounting policies have 
been to immediately recognise all past service costs and to replace interest 
cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is 
calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability. 
The defined benefit obligation no longer includes a reserve for scheme 
expenses; defined benefit pension scheme expenses are presented separately 
within the income statement and included within the Group’s definition of 
adjusted items to arrive at underlying profit before tax as detailed in Note 3. 
The change in accounting policy impacted the results for the 52 weeks to  
15 March 2014 and 52 weeks to 16 March 2013 as follows: 
52 weeks to
15 March
2014

Impact on the income statement:
Increase in administrative expenses (5) (5)
Increase in finance costs (17) (11)

Increase in underlying profit before tax 1 2
Impact on other comprehensive expense:

pension schemes

Decrease in tax credit on other comprehensive 
expense

Impact on the balance sheet:
Decrease in retirement benefit obligations 194 134
Decrease in deferred income tax asset (15) (30)
Increase in net assets 179 104
As a result of the retrospective application of IAS 19 Revised, an opening 
balance sheet at 18 March 2012 has been presented. The retirement benefit 
obligation at this date has reduced by £123 million, with a £31 million 
increase in the associated deferred tax asset, resulting in an overall increase 
of £92 million in net assets from the previously published amounts in the 
2013 Annual Report.
IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ has impacted the measurement criteria 
of the fair value for certain assets and liabilities and also introduced new 
disclosures as set out in note 29. No retrospective changes were required as 
a result of the adoption of the Standard.
The amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments’ for the offsetting of 
financial assets and financial liabilities have increased the disclosure 
requirements where netting arrangements are in place, which are provided in 
note 28.
The amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ require items 
of other comprehensive income and expense to be grouped into those items 
that will not be reclassified subsequently to the income statement and those 
items which may be reclassified in accordance with the respective IFRS to 
which they relate, including their associated income tax. This presentational 
amendment has been applied retrospectively to the Group statement of other 
comprehensive income and does not affect the Group’s financial position. 
Notes to the financial statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 87
2 Accounting policies continued
The Group and Company has concluded that the remaining above new 
standards, interpretations and amendments are either not relevant to the 
Group and Company or that they do not have a significant impact on the 
Group and Company’s financial statements, apart from additional disclosure. 
Effective for the Group and Company for the financial year 
beginning 16 March 2014:
• 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’*
• 
IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’*
• 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’*
• 
IAS 27 (revised 2011) ‘Separate financial statements’*
• 
IAS 28 (revised 2011) ‘ Associates and joint ventures’*
• 
Amendments to IFRS 10,11 and 12 on transition guidance*
• 
Amendment to IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ on recoverable amount 
disclosures*
• 
Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’ on Financial 
instruments asset and liability offsetting*
• 
Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and 
measurement’, on novation of derivatives and hedge accounting*
• 
IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’*
* These standards and interpretations have been endorsed by the EU.
The Group and Company has considered the impact of the above 
amendments to published standards and new standards that are not yet 
effective and concluded that they are either not relevant to the Group and 
Company or that they would not have a significant impact on the Group and 
Company’s financial statements, apart from additional disclosures. 
The following standards and revisions will be effective for  
future periods:
• 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’
• 
Amendment to IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’, on defined benefit plans*
• 
Amendment to IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’, on general hedge  
accounting 
• 
Annual improvements 2012*
• 
Annual improvements 2013*
* These standards are effective for accounting periods starting on or after 1 July 2014.
The Group and Company has considered the impact of the above standards 
and revisions and has concluded that they will not have a significant impact 
on the Group and Company’s financial statements, apart from additional 
disclosures. The accounting policies set out below and in note 3 have been 
applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements by 
the Group and the Company, except where noted above.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of 
more than one half of the voting rights. The results of subsidiaries are 
included in the income statement from the date of acquisition or, in the case 
of disposals, up to the effective date of disposal. Intercompany transactions 
and balances between Group companies are eliminated upon consolidation. 
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to 
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss in the 
financial statements of the Company. 
Business combinations
The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business 
combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a 
subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred  
and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred 
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition 
basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate 
share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree identifiable net assets. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. If the business 
combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the 
acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair 
value at the acquisition date through the income statement. The acquisition 
of Sainsbury’s Bank has been detailed in note 37. 
Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are jointly controlled entities in which the Group has an 
interest. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant 
influence but not control. The Group’s share of the post-tax results of its joint 
ventures and associates are included in the income statement using the 
equity method of accounting. Where the Group transacts with a joint venture 
or associate, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the joint venture or associate. 
Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group balance 
sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets 
of the entity, less any provision for impairment. 
Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Company 
balance sheet at cost less any provision for impairment. 
Investment properties held by the Group are those contained within its joint 
ventures with Land Securities Group PLC and The British Land Company PLC. 
These are properties held for capital appreciation and/or to earn rental 
income. They are initially measured at cost, including related transaction 
costs. After initial recognition at cost, they are carried at their fair values 
based on market value determined by professional valuers at each reporting 
date. The difference between the fair value of an investment property at the 
reporting date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included 
within the income statement but is excluded from underlying profit in order 
to provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance 
of the Group’s ongoing business for shareholders. 
Sainsbury’s Bank has been accounted as a 50 per cent owned joint venture for 
the 46 weeks to 31 January 2014 and consolidated as a 100 per cent owned 
subsidiary for the four weeks to 28 February 2014, as detailed in note 13.
Revenue
Revenue consists of sales through retail outlets and, in the case of Sainsbury’s 
Bank, interest receivable, fees and commissions and excludes Value Added T ax. 
Sale of goods – retail
Sales through retail outlets are shown net of returns, the cost of Nectar reward 
points issued and redeemed, colleague discounts, vouchers and sales made 
on an agency basis. Commission income is recognised in revenue based on 
the terms of the contract.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of goods and 
services have been passed to the buyer and it can be measured reliably.
The cost of Nectar points is treated as a deduction from sales and part  
of the fair value of the consideration received is deferred and subsequently 
recognised over the period that the awards are redeemed. The fair value  
of the points awarded is determined with reference to the fair value to  
the customer. Financial statements

Interest receivable
Interest income is recognised in the income statement for all instruments 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. This 
calculation takes into account interest receivable or payable and fees and 
commissions receivable or payable that are integral to the yield, as well as 
incremental transaction costs. The effective interest rate is the rate that 
discounts the expected future cash flows over the expected life of the 
financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or 
liability at initial recognition. 
Fees and commissions
Fees and commissions, that are not integral to the effective interest rate 
calculation, are recognised in the income statement as services are provided. 
In the case of insurance commissions the income comprises an initial 
commission and profit share both of which are recognised on completion of 
the service to the extent reliably measurable. Where there is a risk of potential 
claw back, an appropriate element of the commission receivable is deferred 
and amortised over the life of the underlying loan or period of claw back.  
Car insurance initial commission is recognised on completion of the service 
provided, with an element deferred to reflect cancellation expectation and 
services yet to be performed in future periods.
Finance income and costs
Finance income and costs are recognised in the income statement for 
financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. This calculation takes into account interest receivable or 
payable and fees and commissions receivable or payable that are integral 
to the yield, as well as incremental transaction costs. For Sainsbury’s Bank, 
finance cost on financial liabilities is determined using the effective interest 
rate method and is recognised in cost of sales. 
Interest paid and interest received for the purpose of the cash flow statement 
is retail only.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of all costs to the point of sale including warehouse and 
transportation costs and all the costs of operating retail outlets and, in the 
case of Sainsbury’s Bank, interest expense on operating activities, calculated 
using the effective interest method.
Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts are recognised within cost of sales 
as they are earned. The accrued value at the reporting date is included in 
prepayments and accrued income.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
recognised provision for impairment. Capital work in progress is held at cost 
less any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase 
price of the asset and the costs incurred attributable to bringing the asset to its 
working condition for intended use. This includes capitalised borrowing costs.
Fixtures and equipment
Fixtures, equipment and vehicles are held at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the 
original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the 
asset to its working condition and its intended use. 
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual 
values, on a straight-line basis, on the following bases:
• 
Freehold buildings and leasehold properties – 50 years, or the lease term 
if shorter
• 
Fixtures, equipment and vehicles – three to 15 years 
• 
Freehold land is not depreciated
Capital work in progress is not depreciated.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with  
the asset’s carrying amount and are recognised within operating profit.  
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted  
if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Intangible assets
Computer software
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and  
any provision for impairment. Externally acquired computer software and 
software licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over 
their useful economic lives of five to seven years. Costs relating to 
development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once the 
recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ are met. Other development 
expenditures that do not meet these criteria are expensed as incurred. When 
the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of five to seven years 
within administrative expenses. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration of an 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable 
assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is 
recognised as an asset on the Group’s balance sheet in the year in which it 
arises, and is considered to have an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is tested for 
impairment annually and again whenever indicators of impairment are 
detected and is carried at cost less any provision for impairment.
Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair 
value at the acquisition date. Intangible assets with finite useful economic 
lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for 
impairment and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful economic lives, ranging from three to six years within administrative 
expenses. 
Other intangible assets
Pharmacy licences are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any 
recognised provision for impairment and amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the licence period of up to 15 years within cost of sales.
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
any provision for impairment. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over 
their contractual useful economic lives within cost of sales.
Impairment of non-financial assets 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.  
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, which is 
the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) to 
which the asset belongs. For retail property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets excluding goodwill, the CGU is deemed to be each trading 
store. For retail goodwill, the CGU is deemed to be each retail chain of stores 
acquired. Sainsbury’s Bank is deemed to be a separate CGU. 
Any impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in the year in 
which it occurs. Where an impairment loss, other than an impairment loss on 
goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, or its original carrying value less accumulated 
depreciation if lower.  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 89
2 Accounting policies continued
Capitalisation of interest
Interest costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction 
of qualifying assets are capitalised to the cost of the asset, gross of tax relief.
Non-current assets held for sale 
Non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the 
lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to dispose. Non-current 
assets held for sale are not depreciated.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is  
to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset is available for sale in its present condition. A sale 
should be expected to complete within one year from the date of classification. 
Leased assets
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. All other 
leases are classified as operating leases. For property leases, the land and 
building elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease 
classification.
Finance leases
Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and 
equipment and depreciated over their estimated useful lives or the lease 
term, whichever is shorter. The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair 
value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments 
during the lease term at the inception of the lease. The resulting lease 
obligations are included in liabilities net of finance charges. Finance costs  
on finance leases are charged directly to the income statement.
Operating leases
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. 
Rental payments are charged directly to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Sale and leaseback
A sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and 
immediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering into a lease with the 
buyer. The accounting treatment of the sale and leaseback depends upon the 
substance of the transaction and whether or not the sale was made at the 
asset’s fair value. 
For sale and finance leasebacks, any apparent profit or loss from the sale is 
deferred and amortised over the lease term. For sale and operating leasebacks, 
generally the assets are sold at fair value, and accordingly the profit or loss 
from the sale is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Following initial recognition, the lease treatment is consistent with those 
principles described above.
Lease incentives
Lease incentives primarily include up-front cash payments or rent-free 
periods. Lease incentives are capitalised and spread over the period of the 
lease term.
Leases with predetermined fixed rental increases
The Group has a number of leases with predetermined fixed rental increases. 
These rental increases are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease.
Operating lease income
Operating lease income consists of rentals from sub-tenant agreements and is 
recognised as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories comprise goods held for resale and properties held for, or in the 
course of, development and are valued on a weighted average cost basis and 
carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion 
and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Cost includes 
all direct expenditure and other appropriate attributable costs incurred in 
bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and bank balances in the Group balance sheet comprise cash in hand 
and at bank, deposits at central banks, investments in money market funds 
and deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of 
the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement. 
Current taxation
Current tax is accounted for on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. Current tax is charged or credited to the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged to equity or other 
comprehensive income, in which case the current tax is also dealt with in 
equity or other comprehensive income respectively. 
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences arising 
from differences between the tax base and accounting base of assets and 
liabilities.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to the extent 
where it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, 
affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. It is determined using tax 
rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred 
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can 
be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it 
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive 
income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity or other 
comprehensive income respectively.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures except where the 
Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that an outflow 
of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation, and where the 
amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured 
at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the 
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase 
in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.  Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 90
2 Accounting policies continued
Onerous leases
Provisions for onerous leases, measured net of expected rental income, are 
recognised when the property leased becomes vacant and is no longer used 
in the operations of the business. Provisions for dilapidation costs are 
recognised on a lease-by-lease basis.
Employee benefits
Pensions
The Group operates various defined benefit and defined contribution pension 
schemes for its employees. A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that 
defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on 
retirement. A defined contribution scheme is a pension plan under which the 
Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
In respect of the defined benefit pension scheme, the pension scheme 
surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the difference 
between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is 
actuarially calculated on an annual basis using the projected unit credit 
method. Plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The income statement charge consist of a financing charge, which is the net 
of interest cost on pension scheme liabilities and interest income on plan 
assets and defined benefit pension scheme expenses. The financing charge  
is determined by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined 
benefit obligation to the pension scheme liabilities and plan assets at the 
beginning of the financial year.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an 
expense as they fall due. Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date 
are included as an accrual as at that date. The Group has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
Long service awards
The costs of long service awards are accrued over the period the service is 
provided by the employee when it is probable that settlement will be required 
and they are capable of being measured reliably. Liabilities recognised in 
respect of long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value of 
the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Group in respect of 
services provided by employees up to the reporting date.
Share-based payments 
The Group provides benefits to employees (including Directors) of the Group 
in the form of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares, 
rights over shares or the value of those shares in cash terms.
For equity-settled share-based payments the fair value of the employee 
services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares 
awarded or options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions. All share options are valued using an option-pricing model 
(Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo). This fair value is charged to the income 
statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme. 
For cash-settled share-based payments the fair value of the employee 
services rendered is determined at each balance sheet date and the charge 
recognised through the income statement over the vesting period of the 
share-based payment scheme, with the corresponding increase in accruals. 
The value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement over the 
remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels of options 
vesting, with the corresponding adjustments made in equity and accruals.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the 
employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by 
reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as 
an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding 
credit to equity. 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Foreign currencies
Foreign operations
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated 
into sterling at year-end exchange rates. The results of foreign operations  
are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.  
The functional currency of the Company is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at 
the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation are recognised in the income statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair 
value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL ’), loans and receivables, and available-for-
sale (‘ AFS’). AFS investments are initially measured at fair value including 
transaction costs. Financial assets held at fair value through profit and loss  
are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed.
‘Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ include financial assets 
held for trading and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at 
inception. Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless they are 
accounted for as an effective hedging instrument. ‘Financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss’ are recorded at fair value, with any fair value 
gains or losses recognised in the income statement in the period in which 
they arise.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The Group 
has no intention of trading these loans and receivables. They include 
amounts due from Sainsbury’s Bank customers and amounts due from other 
banks. Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, 
these assets are carried at amortised cost less impairment using the effective 
interest method. Income from these financial assets is calculated on an 
effective yield basis and is recognised in the income statement.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either 
designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. 
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to 
dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these 
assets are recorded at fair value with the movements in fair value recognised 
in other comprehensive income until the financial asset is derecognised or 
impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 
other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement. 
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in the income statement 
when the entity’s right to receive payment is established. Interest on AFS 
debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest method. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from 
the financial assets have expired or where the Group has transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for 
impairment. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 91
2 Accounting policies continued
Loans and advances including impairment 
Loans and advances are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment and recognised on the balance sheet 
when cash is advanced.
For Sainsbury’s Bank’s portfolios of loans, such as credit card lending and 
personal loans, impairment provisions are calculated for groups of assets, 
otherwise impairment is identified at a counterparty specific level following 
objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. Such evidence may 
include a missed interest or principal payment or the breach of a banking 
covenant. The present value of estimated cash flows recoverable is determined 
after taking into account any security held. The amount of impairment is 
calculated by comparing the present value of the cash flows discounted at 
the loans’ original effective interest rate with the balance sheet carrying value. 
If impaired, the carrying value is adjusted and the difference charged to the 
income statement and a provision recognised in the balance sheet.
The written down value of the impaired loan is compounded back to its net 
realisable balance over time using an effective interest rate. This is reported 
through interest receivable within the income statement and represents the 
unwinding of the discount. 
A write-off is made when all or part of a claim is deemed uncollectible or 
forgiven. Write-offs are charged against previously established provisions 
for impairment or directly to the income statement. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts written off decrease the charge for loan impairment in the 
income statement.
An allowance for impairment losses is also maintained in respect of assets 
which are impaired at the balance sheet date but which have not been 
identified as such, based on historical loss experience and other relevant 
factors. The methodology and assumptions used are regularly reviewed to 
reduce any differences between estimates and actual results.
Financial liabilities
Interest-bearing bank loans, overdrafts and amounts due to Sainsbury’s Bank 
customers are recorded initially at fair value, which is generally the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are held at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption 
and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the income 
statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period 
in which they arise.
The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined 
using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond. This 
amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished 
on conversion or maturity of the bonds. The remainder of the proceeds are 
allocated to the conversion option. This is recognised and included in 
shareholders’ equity, net of income tax effects and is not subsequently 
re-measured.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and the equity components 
of the convertible bonds based on their carrying amounts at the date of issue. 
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Impairment of financial assets
An assessment of whether there is objective evidence of impairment is 
carried out for all financial assets or groups of financial assets at the balance 
sheet date. This assessment may be of individual assets (‘individual 
impairment’) or of a portfolio of assets (‘collective impairment’). A financial 
asset or a group of financial assets is considered to be impaired if, and only if, 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events 
that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that 
loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the 
financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 
For individual impairment the principal loss event is one or more missed 
payments, although other loss events can also be taken into account, 
including arrangements in place to pay less than the contractual payments, 
fraud and bankruptcy or other financial difficulty indicators. An assessment 
of collective impairment will be made of financial assets with similar risk 
characteristics. For these assets, portfolio loss experience is used to provide 
objective evidence of impairment.
Where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss exists on loans and 
receivables, impairment provisions are made to reduce the carrying value of 
financial assets to the present value of estimated future cash flows 
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the charge to the income 
statement reflects the movement in the level of provisions made, together 
with amounts written off net of recoveries in the year.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant 
or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost is considered 
in determining whether the asset is impaired. If any such evidence exists for 
available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss is removed from equity 
and recognised in the income statement. The cumulative loss is measured as 
the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less 
any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the 
income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity 
instruments are not reversed. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a 
debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can 
be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was 
recognised in the income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through 
the income statement.
Interest will continue to accrue on all financial assets, based on the written 
down balance. Interest is calculated using the rate of interest used to 
discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment 
loss. To the extent that a provision may be increased or decreased in 
subsequent periods, the recognition of interest will be based on the latest 
balance net of provision.
Fair value estimation
The methods and assumptions applied in determining the fair values of 
financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed in note 29. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
All derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the 
contract date and are also measured at fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Hedge relationships are classified as cash flow hedges where the derivative 
financial instruments hedge the exchange rate risk of future highly probable 
inventory purchases denominated in foreign currency. Changes in the fair 
value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as 
hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive 
income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast 
transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, 
at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses 
on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive 
income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 92
2 Accounting policies continued
Hedge relationships are classified as fair value hedges where the derivative 
financial instruments hedge the change in the fair value of a financial asset or 
liability due to movements in interest rates. The changes in fair value of the 
hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement.
The hedged item is also adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the 
hedged risk, with the corresponding adjustment made in the income 
statement.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents at the inception of the 
hedge, the hedging risk management strategy, the relationship between the 
hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction and the nature of the 
risks being hedged. The Group also documents the assessment of the 
effectiveness of the hedging relationship, to show that the hedge has been 
and will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as 
finance income or costs as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At 
that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised 
in other comprehensive income is retained in equity until the forecasted 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur,  
the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income  
is transferred to the income statement for the period.
 
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in  
the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or 
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
(c) Judgements and estimates
The Group makes judgements and assumptions concerning the future that 
impact the application of policies and reported amounts. The resulting 
accounting estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions 
will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results but are based on 
historical experience and expectations of future events. 
The judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are 
discussed below. 
Goodwill impairment
The Group is required to assess whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment loss, based on the recoverable amount of the CGU or group of 
CGUs to which it is allocated. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been 
determined based on value in use calculations and these calculations require 
the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows and suitable discount 
rates as disclosed in note 12. Actual outcomes could vary from these 
estimates. 
Impairment of assets other than goodwill
Financial and non-financial assets are subject to impairment reviews based 
on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that their 
recoverable amount may be less than their carrying value. Recoverable 
amount is based on the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs  
to dispose. Value in use is calculated from expected future cash flows using 
suitable discount rates and includes management assumptions and 
estimates of future performance as disclosed in note 11. 
Impairment loss calculations on loans and advances within Sainsbury’s Bank 
(note 17(b)) involve the estimation of future cash flows of financial assets, 
based on observable data at the balance sheet date and historical loss 
experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. This will typically 
take into account the level of arrears, security, past loss experience and 
default levels. These calculations are undertaken on a portfolio basis using 
various statistical modelling techniques. Impairment models are continually 
reviewed to ensure data and assumptions are appropriate with the most 
material assumption being around expected loss rates. The accuracy of any 
such impairment calculation will be affected by unexpected changes to the 
economic situation, and assumptions which differ from actual outcomes. 
As such, judgement is applied when determining the levels of provisioning.
Acquisition accounting
The amount of goodwill initially recognised as a result of a business 
combination is dependent on the allocation of the purchase price to the  
fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.  
The acquisition of Sainsbury’s Bank in January 2014 was accounted for  
in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require the 
recognition of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their 
acquisition-date fair values. As part of this process, it is also necessary to 
identify and recognise certain assets and liabilities which are not included on 
the acquiree’s balance sheet, for example the value of customer relationships 
and other intangible assets. The exercise to fair value the Sainsbury’s Bank 
balance sheet was inherently subjective and required management to make 
a number of assumptions and estimates.
The assumptions used in the modelling are sensitive to the market conditions 
at the time, in particular the current interest rates available and customer 
attrition patterns. Management uses its best knowledge to estimate the fair 
value of acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The 
acquisition of Sainsbury’s Bank has been detailed in note 37.
Post-employment benefits
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme for its employees. The present 
value of the scheme’s liabilities recognised at the balance sheet date and the 
net financing charge recognised in the income statement are dependent on 
interest rates of high quality corporate bonds. Other key assumptions within 
this calculation are based on market conditions or estimates of future events, 
including mortality rates, as set out in note 30. Any changes to assumptions 
used will impact the carrying value of the retirement benefit obligation. As 
detailed in note 30, the retirement benefit obligations are most sensitive to 
changes in the discount rate.
Provisions
Provisions have been made for onerous leases, dilapidations and long service 
awards. These provisions are estimates and the actual costs and timing of 
future cash flows are dependent on future events. Any difference between 
expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period 
when such determination is made. The carrying amount of provisions will be 
impacted by changes in the discount rate. Details of provisions are set out in 
note 22.
Income taxes
The Group recognises expected liabilities for tax based on an estimation of 
the likely taxes due, which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate 
tax determination of certain items. Where the actual liability arising from 
these issues differs from these estimates, such differences will have an 
impact on income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period when such

3 Non-GAAP performance measures
Certain items recognised in reported profit before tax can vary significantly from year to year and therefore create volatility in reported earnings which does 
not reflect the Group’s underlying performance. Similarly, whilst defined benefit pension scheme expenses may not vary significantly, they no longer relate to 
the Group’s ongoing activities given the closure of the defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual. The Directors believe that the ‘underlying revenue’, 
‘underlying profit before tax’ (‘UPBT’) and ‘underlying diluted and basic earnings per share’ measures presented provide a clear and consistent presentation of 
the underlying performance of Sainsbury’s ongoing business for shareholders. Underlying profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly 
comparable with the ‘adjusted’ profit measures of other companies. The adjusted items are:
• 
Profit/loss on disposal of properties; 
• 
Investment property fair value movements – these reflect the difference between the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its 
carrying amount at the previous reporting date;
• 
Retailing financing fair value movements – these are fair value gains and losses on non-derivative financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost, 
on derivatives relating to financing activities and on hedged items in fair value hedges;
• 
Impairment of goodwill;
• 
The financing element of IAS 19 Revised;
• 
Defined benefit pension scheme expenses;
• 
Acquisition adjustments – these reflect the adjustments arising from the Sainsbury’s Bank acquisition including the fair value unwind, the remeasurement 
of the previously held equity interest in Sainsbury’s Bank and the amortisation of acquired intangibles; and
• 
One-off items – these are items which are material and infrequent in nature and do not relate to the Group’s underlying performance.
The adjustments made to reported profit before tax to arrive at underlying profit before tax are:

2  Financing fair value movements for the financial year comprised a £5 million loss for the Group (2013: £7 million loss) and a £3 million loss for the joint ventures (2013: £3 million loss).
The tax impact of adjusted items is included within note 8.
One-off items
The credit to one-off items of £68 million includes: the impact of a past service credit net of compensation payments of £148 million as a result of the closure 
of the Sainsbury’s defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual; an impairment of £92 million; costs of £45 million in relation to the Sainsbury’s Bank 
acquisition; a Nectar VAT upside of £76 million and other one-off costs of £19 million mainly in relation to internal restructuring and a provision for a 
commercial item, for which we intend to defend our position.
The past service credit net of compensation payments of £148 million includes £10 million of compensation payments to employees on transition to the 
Group’s defined contribution schemes.
An impairment of £92 million has been recognised within administrative expenses to write down the value of certain sites where the Group no longer intends 
to build a supermarket following a review of the Group’s property pipeline. The recoverable amount of these sites has been determined on a fair value less costs 
to dispose basis. 
Costs of £45 million have been incurred in finalising the transaction to purchase the remaining 50 per cent of Sainsbury’s Bank and transitioning the Bank to a 
new, more flexible banking platform.
Accounting for VAT on the redemption of Nectar points has been the subject of a legal case over a number of years between HMRC and Aimia, the company 
who administer the Nectar scheme. A Supreme Court ruling in June 2013 ruled in favour of Aimia, thereby enabling Sainsbury’s to recognise an upside of £76 
million relating to historic VAT overpayments. 
The prior year one-off item of £9 million included £20 million of transaction and transition costs incurred relating to the ongoing purchase of the remaining 
50 per cent of Sainsbury’s Bank; other one-off costs of £5 million incurred for internal restructuring; and the release of a disposal provision for indemnities of 
£16 million which was no longer required.  Financial statements

4 Segment reporting 
The Group’s businesses are organised into three operating segments: 
• 
Retailing (Supermarkets and Convenience);
• 
Financial services (Sainsbury’s Bank); and
• 
Property investments (The British Land Company PLC joint venture and Land Securities Group PLC joint venture).
Management have determined the operating segments based on the information provided to the Operating Board (the Chief Operating Decision Maker for the 
Group) to make operational decisions on the management of the Group. All material operations and assets are in the UK. The business of the Group is not 
subject to highly seasonal fluctuations, although within retailing there is an increase in trading in the period leading up to Christmas. 
The Group has continued to include additional disclosure analysing the Group’s Financial services and Property investment joint ventures into separate 
reportable segments. As disclosed in note 14, Sainsbury’s Bank has been accounted for as a 50 per cent owned joint venture for the 46 weeks to 31 January 
2014 and consolidated as a 100 per cent owned subsidiary for the four weeks to 28 February 2014. Results for the periods pre and post the acquisition of the 
additional 50 per cent of shares in Sainsbury’s Bank are included in the Financial services segment. 
Revenue from operating segments is measured on a basis consistent with the revenue number disclosure in the income statement. Revenue is generated by 
the sale of goods and services, as set out in note 2. 
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Segment 
capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period. 
The Operating Board assesses the performance of all segments on the basis of underlying profit before tax. The reconciliation provided below reconciles 
underlying operating profit from each of the segments disclosed to profit before tax.

9 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in 
issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan trusts (note 25), which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the earnings attributable to the ordinary shareholders are adjusted by the interest on the convertible bonds (net of tax). The 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. These represent share options 
granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and the number of 
shares that would be issued if all convertible bonds are assumed to be converted.
Underlying earnings per share is provided by excluding the effect of any profit or loss on disposal of properties, investment property fair value movements, 
retailing financing fair value movements, impairment of goodwill, IAS 19 Revised pension financing element, defined benefit pension scheme expenses, 
acquisition adjustments and one-off items that are material and infrequent in nature. This alternative measure of earnings per share is presented to reflect the 
Group’s underlying trading performance.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment
In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, property, plant and equipment is only tested for impairment in the event that a triggering event is 
identified. The Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, following a triggering event, each store is a cash-generating unit (‘CGU’). 
The recoverable amounts for the CGUs are based on value in use which is calculated on the cash flows expected to be generated by the units using the latest 
budget and forecast data, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. The key assumptions in the value in use calculation are the discount rate, growth 
rates and expected changes in margin. Changes in income and expenditure are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market. 
The forecasts are extrapolated over 25 years assuming a nil growth rate. The discount rate is based on the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 
nine per cent (2013: ten per cent).
Non-store assets and the property, plant and equipment of Sainsbury’s Bank are reviewed separately for impairment in the event that a triggering event is 
identified. When an impairment review is required, the carrying value of the asset is compared with its value in use using a methodology consistent with that 
described above and with its fair value less costs to dispose to determine the recoverable amount.
During the year, an impairment of £92 million (2013: £nil) was recognised to write down the value of certain sites to fair value less costs to dispose.  Financial statements

Interest capitalised
Interest capitalised included in additions amounted to £26 million (2013: £32 million) for the Group and £nil (2013: £nil) for the Company. Accumulated 
interest capitalised included in the cost of property, plant and equipment net of disposals amounted to £344 million (2013: £330 million) for the Group and 
£nil (2013: £nil) for the Company. The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is 5.3 per cent 
(2013: 5.3 per cent).
Security
Property, plant and equipment of 125 (2013: 128) supermarket properties, with a net book value of £2,133 million (2013: £2,213 million) has been pledged as 
security for the long-term financing (note 20).
In addition, property, plant and equipment of a further six supermarket properties, with a net book value of £66 million (2013: £67 million) has been pledged 
as security to underpin the residual value guarantee given by the Group with regards to 16 supermarket properties sold in March 2000 and ten supermarket 
properties sold in July 2000.
On 17 June 2010 property, plant and equipment comprising eight supermarket properties, with a net book value of £167 million were transferred to the 
Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership (‘the partnership’). On 25 March 2011 a further 13 properties with a net book value of £345 million were transferred 
to the partnership (see note 30).

12 Intangible assets continued
Acquired intangibles relating to customer relationships, purchased credit card relationships and the value of core deposits were recognised as part of the fair 
value accounting on the acquisition of Sainsbury’s Bank. Other intangibles primarily comprise of pharmacy licences. 
The goodwill balance above relates primarily to the Group’s acquisitions of Sainsbury’s Bank plc (£45 million), Bells Stores Ltd, Jacksons Stores Ltd (£55 million), 
J.B. Beaumont Limited, S.L. Shaw Limited, Culcheth Provision Stores Ltd, Town Centre Retail (Bicester) Ltd, SW Dewsbury Ltd, Anobii Ltd and Portfolio 
Investments Ltd and is allocated to the respective cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) or group of CGUs within the retailing or financial services segment. The CGUs 
to which goodwill has been allocated and the level at which it is monitored in the retailing segment are deemed to be the respective acquired retail chains of 
stores whilst within financial services, Sainsbury’s Bank is deemed a separate CGU. 
The value of the goodwill was tested for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with the 
carrying value of its goodwill. 
To calculate the retail CGUs value in use, Board approved cash flows for the following financial year are assumed to remain flat and are discounted at a pre-tax 
rate of nine per cent (2013: ten per cent) over a 25 year period, being the estimated average remaining useful life of a store. To calculate Sainsbury’s Bank value 
in use, Board approved cash flows are discounted at a pre-tax rate of nine per cent over a five year period with a terminal value. Changes in income and 
expenditure are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market. Based on the operating performance of the respective CGUs, an 
impairment loss of £1 million was identified in the current financial year (2013: £nil). The valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably 
possible change to key assumptions would not result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

All principal operating subsidiaries operate in the countries of their registration or incorporation. Sainsbury’s Bank plc has been consolidated for four weeks to 
28 February 2014, the Bank’s nearest month-end to the Group’s year-end. Adjustments have been made for the effects of significant transactions or events 
that occurred between this date and the Group’s balance sheet date.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in s410 of the Companies Act 2006 to disclose a list comprising solely the principal subsidiaries. A full list 
of subsidiaries will be sent to Companies House with the next annual return.
During the year, a provision of £135 million (2013: £2 million) was made against investments in subsidiaries where the carrying value exceeded the 
recoverable amount.
The Group has an interest in two partnerships, Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership and Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Limited Partnership, which are  
fully consolidated into these Group accounts. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships (Accounts) 
Regulations 2008 and has therefore not appended the accounts of these qualifying partnerships to these accounts. Separate accounts for these partnerships 
are not required to be, and have not been, filed at Companies House. Financial statements

floating rate subordinated dated loan capital due from Sainsbury’s Bank (2013: £30 million). 
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are on commercial terms. Current other receivables of £247 million (2013: £130 million), which include 
£117 million (2013: £nil) of bank funds in the course of settlement, are generally non-interest bearing, other than £nil (2013: £20 million) of floating rate 
subordinated undated loan capital due from Sainsbury’s Bank. The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables are denominated in sterling.
Following the acquisition of Sainsbury’s Bank, an additional £25 million floating rate subordinated undated loan capital and £30 million floating rate 
subordinated dated loan capital was acquired from Lloyds Banking Group. In February 2014, both the existing and acquired floating rate subordinated undated 
loan capital, totalling £50 million, were repaid. Current amounts owed by Group entities to the Company include £60 million floating rate subordinated dated 
loan capital as detailed in note 32. 
 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk arising from its retail operations is minimal given that the customer base is large and unrelated and that the overwhelming 
majority of customer transactions are settled through cash or secure electronic means. New parties wishing to obtain credit terms with the Group are credit 
checked prior to invoices being raised and credit limits are determined on an individual basis.  Financial statements

Secured loans
Secured loans are secured on 125 (2013: 128) supermarket properties (note 11) and comprise loans from two finance companies:
• 
a fixed rate amortising loan with an outstanding principal value of £929 million (2013: £1,002 million) at a weighted average rate of 5.37 per cent stepping 
up to 5.41 per cent and carrying amount of £956 million (2013: £1,039 million) with a final repayment date of April 2018; and
• 
an inflation linked amortising loan with an outstanding principal value of £829 million (2013: £841 million) at a fixed real rate of 2.36 per cent where 
principal and interest are uplifted annually by RPI subject to a cap at five per cent and floor at nil per cent with a carrying amount of £855 million 
(2013: £868 million) with a final repayment date of April 2031. 
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to convert £211 million (2013: £211 million) of the £929 million (2013: £1,002 million) loan due 2018 from fixed 
to floating rates of interest. These transactions have been accounted for as fair value hedges (note 29). In previous years, £572 million of swaps accounted for 
as fair value hedges were de-designated from their fair value hedging relationship. The fair value adjustment of the debt previously hedged by these swaps will 
be amortised over the remaining life of the loans, resulting in an amortisation charge to the income statement in the current financial year of £1 million 
(2013: £1 million). 
The Group has entered into inflation swaps to convert £400 million (2013: £300 million) of the £829 million (2013: £841 million) loan due 2031 from RPI linked 
interest to fixed rate interest for periods maturing April 2017 to April 2019. These transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges (note 29).
Bank overdrafts
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and bear interest at a spread above the bank base rates.
Revolving credit facility
In February 2014 the Group entered into a new syndicated committed revolving credit facility for £1,150 million replacing the £690 million facility maturing 
in October 2015. The new £1,150 million facility is split into two tranches, a £500 million Facility (A) maturing in March 2017 and a £650 million Facility (B) 
maturing in March 2019. At 15 March 2014, £200 million had been drawn under Facility (A) (2013: £nil).
The revolving credit facility incurs commitment fees at market rates and drawdowns bear interest at a spread above LIBOR.
Bank loan due 2014
In February 2014 the Group issued prepayment notices for the early repayment in April 2014 of a £25 million loan due July 2014 and for the early repayment 
in May 2014 of a £40 million loan due May 2015.  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 107
20 Borrowings continued
Bank loans due 2015
Bank loans due 2015 comprise a £20 million loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest; a €50 million loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest 
swapped into a £45 million floating rate loan; a US$69 million loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest swapped into a £44 million floating rate loan 
and a €40 million loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest swapped into a £34 million floating rate loan. A £50 million loan due June 2015 at floating 
rates of interest was swapped into a fixed rate loan. The £50 million loan and associated interest rate swap have been designated as a cash flow hedge.
In February 2014, the Group prepaid a £54 million amortising loan due May 2015 without penalty. 
Bank loans due 2016
Bank loans due 2016 comprise a €50 million loan due September 2016 at floating rates of interest swapped into a £44 million floating rate loan. 
Bank loans due 2017
Bank loans due 2017 comprise a US$100 million loan due March 2017 at floating rates of interest swapped into a £63 million fixed rate loan. The US$100  
million loan and associated cross currency swap have been designated as a cash flow hedge. 
In February 2014, the Group prepaid a £45 million loan due February 2017 without penalty.
Bank loans due 2018
In February 2014, the Group prepaid a £23 million amortising bank loan due June 2018 without penalty.
Convertible bond due 2014
In July 2009, the Group issued £190 million of unsecured convertible bonds due July 2014. The bonds pay a coupon of 4.25 per cent payable semi-annually. 
Each bond is convertible into ordinary shares of J Sainsbury plc at any time up to 9 July 2014 at a current conversion price of 405 pence. 
The net proceeds of the convertible bond have been split into a liability component of £166 million and an equity component of £24 million. The equity 
component represents the fair value of the embedded option to convert the bond into ordinary shares of the Company.

these assets will be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and the deferred 
income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 109

The onerous lease provision covers residual lease commitments of up to an average of 29 years (2013: 26 years), after allowance for existing or anticipated 
sublet rental income.
The disposal provision was released during the prior year as any potential liability arising is no longer considered probable. See note 36.
Long service awards are accrued over the period the service is provided by the employee.
The other provisions of £32 million (2013: £4 million) include £14 million of provisions acquired with Sainsbury’s Bank, of which £6 million relate to potential 
customer redress in respect of Card Protection Plan insurance and similar products and £4 million to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme levy.
Additional provisions of £16 million included within other provisions mainly include a commercial item for which we intend to defend our position.

As part of the IAS 19 Revised restatement, remeasurements on defined benefit pension schemes have been reclassified from other reserves to retained earnings. 
The currency translation reserve represents the cumulative foreign exchange differences on the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations 
from their functional currency to the presentation currency of the parent.
The available-for-sale assets reserve represents the fair value gains and losses on the available-for-sale financial assets held by the Group. The cash flow hedge 
reserve represents the cumulative effective fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges in the Group.
The convertible bond reserve represents the equity component of the £190 million convertible bond issued in July 2009.
The capital redemption reserve arose on the redemption of B shares. Shareholders approved a £680 million return of share capital, by way of a B share scheme, 
at the Company’s Extraordinary General Meeting on 12 July 2004. The final redemption date for B Shares was 18 July 2007 and all transactions relating to the 
B shares have now been completed. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 111

28 Financial risk management
The principal financial risks faced by the Group relate to liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, commodity risk and 
capital risk.
Financial risk management is managed by a central treasury department in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.  
The risk management policies are designed to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance by identifying financial exposures  
and setting appropriate risk limits and controls. 
Financial risk management with respect to Sainsbury’s Bank is separately managed by the Bank’s Asset and Liability Management Committee (‘ ALCO’) 
reporting to the Sainsbury’s Bank’s Board Risk Committee. The risks are more fully described in the Sainsbury’s Bank section below. 
The Group uses forward contracts and options to hedge foreign exchange and commodity exposures and interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate 
exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s treasury policy which prohibits the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due at a reasonable price.
The principal operational cash flow of the Group is largely stable and predictable reflecting the low business risk profile of the food retail sector. Cash flow 
forecasts are produced regularly to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements. The Group’s liquidity policy sets a minimum funding 
headroom of £300 million in excess of forecast net debt over a rolling 12 month time horizon. The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining a core of 
long-dated borrowings, pre-funding future cash flow commitments and holding adequate standby credit facilities.
Short term and seasonal funding is sourced from the Group’s revolving credit facility and the wholesale inter-bank money market where interest is charged at 
various spreads above LIBOR. In February 2014 the Group entered into a new syndicated committed revolving credit facility for £1,150 million replacing the 
£690 million facility maturing in October 2015. The new £1,150 million facility is split into two tranches, a £500 million Facility (A) maturing in March 2017 
and a £650 million Facility (B) maturing in March 2019. At 15 March 2014, £200 million had been drawn under Facility (A) (2013: £nil). 
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date. 
The amounts disclosed in the tables are the contractual undiscounted cash flows or an estimate of cash flows in respect of floating interest rate liabilities.

Assumptions:
1  Cash flows relating to debt and swaps linked to inflation rates have been calculated using an RPI of 2.8 per cent for the year ended 15 March 2014 and 3.1 per cent for future years (2013: RPI of 3.9 per cent 
for the year ended 16 March 2013 and 3.3 per cent for future years).
2  Cash flows relating to debt bearing a floating interest rate have been calculated using prevailing interest rates at 15 March 2014 and 16 March 2013.
3  Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated using spot rates at 15 March 2014 and 16 March 2013.
4  The swap rate which matches the remaining term of the interest rate swap at 15 March 2014 has been used to calculate the floating rate cash flows over the life of the interest rate swaps shown above 
(2013: 16 March 2013).
5  Cash flows relating to amounts due to Sainsbury’s Bank customers are calculated using contractual terms and interest rates for fixed rate products. Where balances are contractually repayable on demand, 
behavioural assumptions are applied to estimate the interest payable on those balances. These are shown as due within one year. Financial statements

Further information relating to liquidity risk in Sainsbury’s Bank is more fully described in the section on Sainsbury’s Bank financial risk factors below.
Counterparty credit risk
Counterparty credit risk is the risk of a financial loss arising from counterparty default or non-performance in respect of the Group’s holdings of cash and cash 
equivalents, derivative financial assets, deposits with banks, investments in marketable securities, trade and other receivables, loans and advances to 
customers. The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be £4,897 million (2013: £1,188 million), equivalent to the Group’s total financial assets and of  
this amount £3,965 million relates to Sainsbury’s Bank.
The Group sets counterparty limits for each of its banking and investment counterparties based on relative credit ratings but with minimum long-term credit 
ratings of BBB+ from Standard & Poor’s and Fitch or Baa1 from Moody’s or, in the case of sterling liquidity funds, AAAm from Standard & Poor’s and Fitch or 
Aaa/MR1+ from Moody’s.
The table below analyses the Group’s cash and cash equivalents by credit exposure excluding bank balances, store cash, cash in transit, cash at central bank 
and cash at ATMs:

The Group holds certain financial derivatives which are subject to credit support agreements. Under these agreements cash collateral is posted by one party to 
the other party should the fair value of the financial derivative exceed a pre-agreed level. At 15 March 2014, the Group held £17 million of collateral against 
financial derivatives (2013: £47 million). 
Sainsbury’s Bank had a £45 million reverse repo transaction, which was fully collateralised by UK Gilts.  
The Group also operates a cash pooling arrangement and collective net overdraft facility with its main clearing bank. At 15 March 2014, the Group had a 
£7 million overdraft (2013: £nil) under this facility. 
Market risk
(a) Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk of increased costs arising from unexpected movements in exchange rates impacting the Group’s supply contracts denominated in 
currencies other than pound sterling. 
The Group’s currency risk policy seeks to limit the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on the Group’s income statement by requiring anticipated foreign 
currency cash flows to be hedged. The future cash flows, which may be either contracted or un-contracted, are hedged on a layered basis from 20 per cent to 
80 per cent using forward contracts and options.
The Group also has exposure to currency risk on balances held on foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to short-term timing 
differences on maturing hedges and underlying supplier payments. 
The Group considers that a ten per cent movement in exchange rates against sterling is a reasonable measure of volatility. The impact of a ten per cent 
movement in the exchange rate of US dollar and euro versus sterling at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant, is summarised in the 
table below:

(b) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk of increased costs or lower income arising from unexpected movements in interest rates and inflation rates impacting on the 
Group’s borrowing and investment portfolios. The Group’s interest rate policy seeks to limit the impact of fluctuating interest and inflation rates by maintaining 
a diversified mix of fixed rate, floating rate and variable capped rate liabilities. 
Interest on financial instruments is classified as fixed rate where interest re-set on the borrowings is greater than 12 months; floating rate where interest is 
re-set at intervals of one year or less and variable capped rate if interest is re-set at intervals of one year or less and the nominal interest rate is subject to a cap. Financial statements

Further information relating to interest rate risk in Sainsbury’s Bank is more fully described in the section on Sainsbury’s Bank financial risk factors below.
(i) Cash flow sensitivity for floating rate instruments
The Group considers that a 100 basis point movement in interest rates is a reasonable measure of volatility. The sensitivity of floating rate balances to a change 
of 100 basis points in the interest rate (or such lesser amount as would result in a zero rate of interest) at the balance sheet date is shown below.

million) of which £300 million (2013: £250 million) have been swapped into fixed rate borrowings using inflation rate swaps maturing April 2017 to April 2018. 
The Group has also entered into £100 million (2013: £50 million) of forward starting inflation rate swaps maturing April 2018 to April 2019.
The Group considers that a 100 basis point movement in the relevant floating rate is a reasonable measure of volatility. The sensitivity of variable capped

Commodity risk
Commodity risk is the risk of increased costs arising from unexpected movements in commodity prices impacting the Group’s own use consumption of 
electricity, gas and fuel. The Group’s Energy Price Risk Committee seeks to limit the impact by requiring forecast purchases of power and fuel to be hedged.
The Group hedges own use consumption electricity and gas exposures with forward purchases under flexible purchasing arrangements with its suppliers.  
The Group uses financial derivatives to hedge fuel exposures on a layered basis using contracts for difference. 
The Group considers a ten per cent movement in commodity prices a reasonable measure of volatility. A ten per cent (2013: ten per cent) change in the fair 
value of the power, diesel and gasoil price at the balance sheet date would have increased or decreased the cash flow equity reserve by £3 million (2013:  
£4 million).
Capital risk management
The Group defines capital as total equity plus net debt.
The Board’s capital objective is to maintain a strong and efficient capital base to support the Group’s strategic objectives, provide optimal returns for 
shareholders and safeguard the Group’s status as a going concern. There has been no change to capital risk management policies during the year. 
The Board monitors a broad range of financial metrics including return on capital employed, balance sheet gearing and fixed charge cover. 
The Board can manage the Group’s capital structure by diversifying the debt portfolio, adjusting the size and timing of dividends paid to shareholders, 
recycling capital through sale and leaseback transactions, issuing new shares or repurchasing shares in the open market and flexing capital expenditure.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Group’s share option programmes; however 
the Group does not operate a defined share buy-back plan.
The Board has a policy to maintain the underlying earnings cover for the ordinary dividend at a minimum of 1.5 times and to increase dividend cover to two 
times over the medium term.
Part of the Group’s capital risk management is to ensure compliance with the general covenants and financial covenants included in the Group’s various 
borrowing facilities. There have been no breaches of covenant in the financial year ended 15 March 2014. 
For information relating to Sainsbury’s Bank capital risk management see note 38. 
Sainsbury’s Bank
The principal financial risks faced by Sainsbury’s Bank relate to liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk, market risk and interest rate risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank is unable to meet its financial commitments as they fall due without an adverse impact on funding costs or profitability. 
The Bank’s liquidity risk management framework complies with the standards set out by the Prudential Regulation Authority (‘PRA’) and sets a liquidity buffer 
above the minimum PRA requirements. The Bank seeks to maintain a funding and liquidity profile sufficient to enable it to meet its financial obligations under 
stressed market conditions. In meeting these limits the Bank maintains a stock of high quality liquid assets that can be readily sold to meet the Bank’s 
obligations to depositors and other creditors. The portfolio of assets is managed on a daily basis.
 
In addition, the Bank prepares both long-term and short-term forecasts to assess liquidity requirements. Short-term forecasting covers a rolling 12 month 
period and takes into account factors such as ATM cash management, investment maturities and customer deposit patterns and balances.
Counterparty credit risk
Counterparty credit risk is the risk of a financial loss arising from a retail customer or wholesale counterparty default or non-performance in respect of the 
Bank’s holdings of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets, deposits with banks, investments in marketable securities, trade and other receivables 
and loans and advances to customers.
Credit risk in respect of retail lending customers is managed through automated credit decision techniques using both scorecards and policy rules for new 
applications. In addition, behavioural scoring is used to assess the conduct of customers’ accounts on an ongoing basis. Underwriting is undertaken by 
specialist teams in operational areas to complement these processes. The Retail Credit Risk Committee ensures that appropriate policies are established and 
adhered to and this is subject to further oversight from the Board Risk Committee. Internal Audit teams carry out regular reviews of credit risk processes and 
policies are reviewed and re-approved on an annual basis.
The credit exposure relating to off balance sheet items mainly undrawn loan commitments to customers, was £58 million.  Financial statements

Mortgages held over residential properties represent the only collateral held by the Bank for retail lending exposures. The fair value of collateral held for 
impaired secured loans and secured loans past due but not impaired was £10 million. The fair value of collateral held against possession cases was £nil.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market factors such as interest rates or 
foreign exchange rates. The Bank hedges all such risks within limits set by the Board Risk Committee. Exposures are managed and monitored using a variety  
of sensitivity measures to minimise volatility of earnings and economic value, taking into account expected future business flows. 
Interest rate risk
The Bank offers lending and saving products with varying interest rate features and maturities which create potential interest rate risk exposures. Short-term 
exposures under 12 months are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income sensitivity to a variety of movement in interest rates. Potential 
exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long-term are controlled through position and sensitivity limits, predominantly using Economic Value 
Equity (‘EVE’) measures for risk management purposes. Where residual balance sheet exposures exist, interest rate swaps are the primary hedging instrument 
used to mitigate that risk. The Bank does not operate a trading book. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 121

Fair value hedges
Interest rate and cross currency swaps
The Group holds a £234 million (2013: £234 million) portfolio of interest rate and cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of fixed rate borrowings. Under the 
terms of the swaps, the Group receives fixed rate interest and pays floating rate interest. The notional principal amount of one of the interest rate swaps 
amortises from £211 million to £111 million from April 2016 to April 2018. 
Sainsbury’s Bank holds a £1,232 million portfolio of interest rate swaps to hedge the fixed-rate interest income on amounts due from Sainsbury’s Bank 
customers. Under the terms of the swaps, the Bank receives floating rate interest and pays fixed rate interest.
For the year to 15 March 2014, the fair value movement in the Group’s interest rate swaps resulted in a charge to the income statement of £13 million  
(2013: £3 million charge). The fair value movement in the underlying fixed rate borrowings and amounts due from Sainsbury’s bank customers resulted in  
a credit to the income statement of £13 million (2013: £3 million credit). 
Cash flow hedges
Interest rate and cross currency swaps
The Group holds a £400 million (2013: £300 million) portfolio of inflation rate swaps to hedge a portion of the inflation linked secured loan due 2031. Under the 
terms of the swaps, the Group receives annual RPI inflation (subject to a cap at five per cent and floor at nil per cent) and pays fixed rate interest.
The Group holds a £113 million (2013: £113 million) portfolio of interest rate and cross currency swaps to hedge a £50 million fixed rate bank loan 2015 and a 
US$100 million fixed rate bank loan 2017. Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives floating rate interest and pays fixed rate interest.  Financial statements

Sainsbury’s Bank holds a £27 million portfolio of cross currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risks from cash flows arising on its euro denominated 
available for sale investment securities. 
At 15 March 2014, an unrealised loss of £12 million (2013: £1 million gain) is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the swaps in cash flow 
hedges. This loss will be transferred to the income statement over the next four years. 
Foreign exchange forward contracts
The Group holds a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its future foreign currency trading liabilities. At 15 March 2014 the Group had 
forward purchased €129 million (2013: €167 million) and sold sterling at exchange rates ranging from 1.14 to 1.23 (2013:1.15 to 1.27) with maturities from 
March 2014 to December 2015 (2013: March 2013 to December 2015) and forward purchased US$533 million (2013: US$469 million) and sold sterling at 
exchange rates ranging from 1.48 to 1.67 (2013: 1.48 to 1.62) with maturities from March 2014 to June 2015 (2013: March 2013 to April 2015).
At 15 March 2014, an unrealised loss of £13 million (2013: gain of £17 million) is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the forward contracts. 
This loss will be transferred to the income statement over the next 21 months. During the year a charge to the income statement of £3 million was transferred 
from the cash flow hedge equity reserve and included in cost of sales (2013: £3 million credit).
Commodity forward contracts
The Group holds a portfolio of commodity forward contracts to hedge its own use fuel consumption over the next 12 months.
At 15 March 2014, an unrealised loss of £1 million (2013: gain of £1 million) is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the commodity contracts. 
This gain will be transferred to the income statement over the next 12 months.
Derivatives not in a hedge relationship
Some of the Group’s derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or, where the gains or losses on the derivative contract economically offset the 
underling hedged item, are not designated in a hedging relationship. 
Interest rate and cross currency swaps
The Group holds a £331 million (2013: £331 million) portfolio of interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss to convert floating rate obligations into 
fixed rates. Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives floating rate interest and pays fixed rate interest. Offsetting these swaps the Group holds a 
£391 million (2013: £391 million) portfolio of interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss, to convert fixed rate obligations into floating rate interest.

Sainsbury’s Bank holds a £68 million portfolio of interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss. Under the terms of the swaps, the Bank receives fixed 
rate interest and pays floating rate interest.
The Group holds a £167 million (2013: £167 million) portfolio of cross currency swaps at fair value through profit or loss to convert floating rate borrowings 
denominated in euro and US dollars into floating rate sterling borrowings. 
Commodity forward contracts
Commodity forward contracts at fair value through profit and loss relates to the Group’s long-term fixed price power purchase agreements with independent 
producers. 
Fair value 
Set out on the next page is a comparison of the carrying amount and the fair value of financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements at a 
value other than fair value. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded. 
Where market values are not available, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at 
prevailing interest rates. The fair values of short-term deposits, trade receivables, overdrafts and payables are assumed to approximate to their book values.  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 123

Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are recognised at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which  
the fair value is observable:
• 
Level 1 fair value measurements are derived from quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the balance sheet

The available-for-sale financial assets relate to the Group’s beneficial interest in a property investment pool. The net present value of the Group’s interest in the 
various freehold reversions owned by the property investment pool has been derived by assuming a property growth rate of three per cent per annum (2013: 
three per cent) and a discount rate of nine per cent (2013: ten per cent) (see note 15). The sensitivity of this balance to changes of 0.5 per cent in the assumed 
rate of property rental growth and one per cent in the discount rate holding other assumptions constant is shown below:

The Group has entered into several long-term fixed price Power Purchase agreements with independent producers. Included within derivative financial assets is 
£3 million (2013: £4 million) relating to these agreements. The Group values its Power Purchase agreements at the net present value of the estimated future 
usage at the contracted fixed price less the market implied forward energy price discounted back at the prevailing swap rate. The Group also makes an 
assumption regarding expected energy output based on the historical performance and the producer’s estimate of expected electricity output. The sensitivity

Retirement benefit obligations
Retirement benefit obligations relate to a defined benefit scheme, the Sainsbury’s Pension Scheme, (the ‘Scheme’) and an unfunded pension liability relating 
to senior employees. The Scheme is governed by a Trustee board, and the assets of the Scheme are held separately from the Group’s assets. The Scheme is a 
Registered pension plan with HMRC, subject to UK legislation; and with oversight from the Pensions Regulator. The governance of the Scheme is the 
responsibility of the Trustee; the Trustee comprises 11 Directors – five selected from members, five appointed by the Company and one Independent 
Chairman. In accordance with legislation, the Trustee consults with the Company regarding the Scheme’s investment strategy and agrees an appropriate 
funding plan with the Company.
The Scheme has three different benefit categories; Final Salary, Career Average and Cash Balance. For Final Salary and Career Average members, benefits at 
retirement are determined by length of service and salary. For Cash Balance members, benefits are determined by the accrued retirement account credits. 
The Scheme was closed to new employees on 31 January 2002 and closed to future accrual on 28 September 2013. A one-off past service credit has been 
recognised as a result as disclosed in note 3. The assets of the Scheme are valued at bid price and are held separately from the Group’s assets.
The Scheme was subject to a triennial actuarial valuation, carried out by Towers Watson, at 17 March 2012 on the projected unit basis. The results of this 
valuation were finalised in August 2013 and a recovery plan agreed. Under the Scheme’s recovery plan, the Company will pay annual deficit contributions of 
£49 million per annum for eight consecutive financial years to 2020. This plan is reviewed once every three years, with the next valuation effective date in 
March 2015.
The retirement benefit obligations at the year-end have been calculated by KPMG, as actuarial advisers to the Group, using the projected unit credit method 
and based on adjusting the position at 17 March 2012 for known events and changes in market conditions as allowed under IAS 19 Revised. 
The unfunded pension liability is unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised in the 
event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.
Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Limited Partnership
Further to the funding plan agreed with the Scheme’s Trustees, on 17 June 2010 Sainsbury’s established the Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership (the 
‘Partnership’) with the Scheme. Under this arrangement, properties to a fair value of £256 million were transferred to the Partnership. On 25 March 2011, 
further properties to a fair value of £501 million were transferred to the Partnership. Both transfers were effected via a 30 year sale and leaseback arrangement.
The Scheme’s interest in the Partnership entitles it to an annual distribution for 20 years to 2030. The amount of this distribution is linked to the triennial 
actuarial valuation and will therefore vary once every three years. The annual distribution in previous years has been approximately £35 million and for 
2014/15 it is expected to be in the region of £32 million. These contributions will be in addition to the Group’s normal cash contributions paid to the Scheme 
annually. The properties transferred to the Partnership will revert to Sainsbury’s ownership in 2030 in return for a cash payment equal to the amount of any 
remaining funding deficit on the Scheme at that time, up to a maximum of £600 million. 
The Partnership is controlled by Sainsbury’s and its results are consolidated by the Group. The Group’s balance sheet, IAS 19 Revised deficit and income 
statement are unchanged by the establishment of the Partnership. The investment held by the Scheme in the Partnership does not qualify as a plan asset for 
the purposes of the Group’s consolidated financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets. The value of the properties 
transferred to the Partnership remains included within the Group’s property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet. In addition, the Group retains full 
operational flexibility to extend, develop and substitute the properties within the Partnership. J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 127

(d) Assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date are as follows:
2014
%
2013
%
Discount rate 4.25 4.60
Inflation rate – RPI 3.40 3.45
Inflation rate – CPI 2.40 2.55
Future salary increases n/a 2.55
Future pension increases 2.15 – 3.20 2.15 – 3.25
The discount rate is based on the yield on AA-rated sterling corporate bonds appropriate to the term of the Scheme’s liabilities.
The life expectancy for the Scheme operated at the balance sheet date for a pensioner at normal retirement age (now 65 years for men and women), is as 
follows: 
2014
years
2013
years
Male pensioner 22.6 22.6
Female pensioner 25.3 25.2
The life expectancy for the Scheme operated at the balance sheet date for a future pensioner at normal retirement age is as follows:
2014
years
2013
years
Male pensioner 24.4 24.3
Female pensioner 27.2 27.2
The base mortality assumptions are based on the SAPS tables, with adjustments to reflect the Scheme’s population, with future improvements based on the 
CMI 2011 projection with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25 per cent per annum. 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 21 years (2013: 21 years).
(e) Sensitivities
An increase of 0.5 per cent in the discount rate would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by £706 million. A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the discount 
rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £787 million. 
An increase of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £474 million. A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate 
would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by £444 million.
An increase of one year to the life expectancy would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £165 million.
The sensitivities are based on management’s best estimate of a reasonably anticipated change. The sensitivities are calculated using the same methodology 
used to calculate the retirement benefit obligation, by considering the change in the retirement benefit obligation for a given change in assumption. The net 
retirement benefit obligation is the difference between the retirement benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. Changes in the assumptions may 
occur at the same time as changes in the fair value of plan assets. There has been no change in the calculation methodology since the prior period. 
(f) Other disclosures
The Scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, currency risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and market (investment) risk. The Group is 
not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or Scheme specific risks. 
The Trustee’s investment strategy mitigates some of these risks. Market (investment) risk is addressed by diversification across asset classes and managers 
within those assets classes. With regards to currency risk, the Trustee’s hedge around 75 per cent of the Scheme’s non-sterling exposures. In addition, the 
Trustee has a framework in place to hedge a proportion of the Scheme’s interest rate and inflation exposures. This framework is managed by investing in both 
physical and, for efficiency, derivative investments; and currently has a target to hedge 50 per cent of the interest rate and inflation linked liabilities. The target 
hedge level is kept under review and any change would be in consultation with the Company. The Trustee does not currently hedge the longevity risk, although 
prudent assumptions are made regarding anticipated longevity for the purposes of the actuarial valuation and Recovery Plan. Financial statements

31 Share-based payments
The Group recognised £33 million (2013: £33 million) of employee costs (note 7) related to share-based payment transactions made during the financial year. 
Of these, £nil (2013: £nil) were cash-settled.
National insurance contributions are payable in respect of certain share-based payments transactions and are treated as cash-settled transactions. At 15 March 
2014, the carrying amount of national insurance contributions payable was £7 million (2013: £9 million) of which £1 million (2013: £2 million) was in respect 
of vested grants.
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as set out below:
(a) Savings Related Share Option Scheme (‘SAYE’)
The Group operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months’ continuous service. This is an 
approved HMRC Scheme and was established in 1980. Under the SAYE scheme, participants remaining in the Group’s employment at the end of the three-year 
or five-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price. Employees leaving for certain reasons 
are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.
At 15 March 2014, UK employees held 21,445 five-year savings contracts (2013: 21,773) in respect of options over 20.4 million shares (2013: 22.3 million) and 
24,950 three-year savings contracts (2013: 37,154) in respect of options over 27.8 million shares (2013: 24.8 million). A reconciliation of option movements is

Options granted during the year were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value 
calculations. The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
2014 2013
Share price at grant date (pence) 415 333
Exercise price (pence) 332 267
Expected volatility – 3 year period (%) 18.8 19.2
  – 5 year period (%) 20.8 29.5
Option life – 3 year period (years) 3.2 3.2
 – 5 year period (years) 5.2 5.2
Expected dividends (expressed as dividend yield %) 4.5 5.1
Risk-free interest rate – 3 year period (%) 2.2 1.1
 – 5 year period (%) 3.5 2.0
Fair value per option – 3 year period (pence) 74 50
 – 5 year period (pence) 87 73
The expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the Group’s share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, over the 
period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for management’s view of future volatility of the share price.
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three or five years, as appropriate, on the assumption that 25 per cent of options will be cancelled 
over the service period as employees leave the SAYE Scheme.
(b) Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006, shares are conditionally awarded to the senior managers in the Company. The core awards are calculated as a 
percentage of the participants’ salaries and scaled according to grades.
The awards granted between 2006 and 2011 will vest if the threshold levels of two co-dependent performance conditions – Return on Capital Employed 
(‘ROCE’) and growth in cash flow per share, are achieved over the three-year performance period. The award granted in 2012 and 2013 is assessed against 
ROCE, cumulative underlying cash flow from operations and relative sales measured against the IGD Index, with an Earnings Per Share gateway. The core 
award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance. Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points. Awards 
are structured as nil cost options.
Performance will be measured at the end of the three-year performance period. If the required level of performance has been reached, the awards vest and 
50 per cent of the award will be released. Subject to participants remaining in employment for a further year, the balance will then be released one year after 
the vesting date. Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire two years from the vesting date. Dividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the 
form of additional shares. 
To achieve the maximum multiplier of four, the following criteria are required to be met:

Options to acquire the award of shares were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value 
calculations. The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
  2014 2013
Share price at grant date (pence) 384 310
Expected volatility (%) 15.3 23.1
Option life (years) 4.2 4.2
Risk-free interest rate (%) 1.6 1.4
Fair value per option (pence) 384 310
The expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the Group’s share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, over the 
period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for management’s view of future volatility of the share price.
In March 2013, the three-year performance targets were met achieving a multiplier of 1.75 (2012: 1.70). During the year, a total number of 2.9 million shares 
were released to employees as a result of achieving the performance target and 7.4 million options were exercised. The weighted average share price during 
the year for options exercised was 378 pence (2013: 310 pence).
(c) Deferred Annual Bonus Plan
The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, applied to the top levels of management including Executive Directors and comprised around 40 participants in total. The 
first deferral took place in June 2007, in respect of the bonus awards for the financial year ended 24 March 2007. The second deferral took place in June 2008, 
in respect of the bonus awards for the financial year ended 22 March 2008. The third and final deferral took place in June 2009, in respect to bonus awards for 
the financial year ended 21 March 2009.
The Plan measured the Company’s TSR performance over a three-year period against a bespoke UK and European retail comparator group comprising: Ahold, 
Carrefour, Casino, Delhaize, DSG International, Home Retail Group, Kingfisher, Marks & Spencer, Metro, Morrisons, Next and Tesco. Alliance Boots was removed 
from the comparator group following its de-listing.
Up to two matched shares could be awarded for each share deferred depending on the extent to which the TSR measure is achieved. No shares were awarded 
for below median performance, and the full match only applied where the Company achieved first place within the comparator group. At median position the 
match was 0.5 shares for each deferred bonus share and the share match was pro-rated at every position between median and first place.
To the extent that the performance condition was met at the end of the three-year performance period, the matched shares would be added to the deferred 
bonus shares. The deferred bonus shares and half of the matched shares could be accessed immediately following the performance test, while the remainder 
were held over for a further year. Dividends or their equivalents accrued on shares that vested.

(d) Deferred Share Award
The Deferred Share Award targets a diverse range of business critical financial and strategic scorecard measures. These are intended to reward the top 45 
managers in the Company, including Executive Directors, for driving the short-term objectives that will directly lead to building the sustainable, long-term 
growth of the Company. Awards are structured as nil cost options.
Share-based awards will be made to participants subject to performance against a basket of measures. At least 50 per cent of the award will be based on the 
delivery of financial performance and returns to shareholders. The balance will be based on measures which will assess the Company’s performance relative to 
its competitors as well as key strategic goals.
Performance against the target is measured over one financial year, but any shares awarded are deferred for a further two years to ensure that management’s 
interests continue to be aligned with those of shareholders. The shares are subject to forfeiture if the participant resigns or is dismissed for cause prior to their 
release date. Dividends accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.

(e) Bonus Share Award
The Bonus arrangements for our senior managers and supermarket store managers include corporate and personal performance targets. A profit gateway  
is in place which means that a certain level of underlying profit before tax must be achieved before any bonus related to the corporate element of the bonus  
is released. 
60 per cent of the bonus is paid in cash and 40 per cent converted into shares, which are automatically released after three financial years. The share element 
of the bonus arrangement is called the Bonus Share Award. Bonus Shares are subject to forfeiture if the participant resigns or is dismissed for cause prior to 
their release date. Dividends accrue on these shares and are released at the end of the three year retention period. Our top 45 managers do not receive Bonus 
Share Awards as they receive Deferred Share Awards.

Group
During the year, the Group sold two properties with a fair value of £103 million to Manor Property Scottish Partnership, a Scottish partnership in which the 
Group has a 0.001 per cent interest and subsequently entered into a 25 year lease of these properties. The operations of the partnership are controlled by the 
J Sainsbury Pension Scheme and the Group has significant influence over the partnership by virtue of its contractual rights as General Partner to participate in 
the financial and operating policy decisions of the partnership. The partnership is therefore treated as an Investment in Associate in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements and accounted for using the equity method. The gain on the disposal of the properties recognised outside of underlying profit was 
£10 million and lease payments made to the partnership during the year were £3 million.

The commercial terms of the Group’s operating leases vary, however they commonly include either a market rent review or an index linked rent review (with a 
cap and collar). The timing of when rent reviews take place differs for each lease. The Group has pre-emption rights over a minor number of properties, which 
provides the Group with the right of first refusal to purchase the property in the event the landlord chooses to sell. The option price payable for the asset in each 
instance is normally referenced to current market value prevailing at the point of pre-emption. 
For the purposes of calculating adjusted net debt, the total value of the Group’s capitalised operating lease commitments is £5,095 million (2013: £4,839 million)

36 Contingent liabilities
The Group has a contingent liability for indemnities arising from the disposal of subsidiaries. No provision has been recognised on the basis that any potential

37 Business combinations
On 31 January 2014 the Group acquired 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Sainsbury’s Bank plc from Lloyds Banking Group for consideration of 
£193 million and at the same time purchased £25 million of floating rate subordinated undated loan capital and £30 million of floating rate subordinated 
dated loan capital. Sainsbury’s Bank provides banking services and related financial services wholly within the UK. 
Prior to the acquisition, the Group held 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Sainsbury’s Bank, which was recorded within investments in joint ventures. 
The acquisition will benefit customers and shareholders, allowing the full future potential of the Bank to be realised. Accounting is on a provisional basis with 
the final consideration payment under negotiation with Lloyds Banking Group. 
Details of the purchase consideration are as follows.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to the synergies expected to be achieved. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for 
income tax purposes. 
(a) Acquired receivables – loans and advances to customers
The fair value of loans and advances to customers is £2,551 million. The gross loans and advances to customers pre-fair value adjustments are £2,680 million 
against which an £83 million provision for impairment is held. The fair value adjustment to loans and advances in the table above represents movements in 
credit spreads on collectable assets. 
(b) Revenue and profit contribution
From the date of acquisition, the acquired business has contributed £28 million of revenue and £6 million of underlying operating profit to the Group. If the 
acquisition date had been on the first day of the financial year (assuming 50 weeks to 28 February), Group revenues for the year would have been £24,221 million 
and Group underlying profit would have been £926 million. These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s accounting policies. The information is 
provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the purchase 
actually been made at the beginning of the year, or indicative of future results of the combined Group.

Tier 1 capital:
 Ordinary share capital 240
 Allowable reserves 138
 Deduction for intangible assets (35)
Total Tier 1 capital 343
Lower Tier 2 capital:
 Dated loan stock 10
Total Tier 2 capital 10
Total capital 353
The Bank’s regulatory capital is analysed into two tiers. Tier 1 capital includes ordinary share capital and retained earnings after the deduction of intangible 
assets. Tier 2 capital includes dated loan stock. Various limits are applied to elements of the capital base. Tier 2 capital cannot exceed Tier 1, and lower Tier 2 
capital cannot exceed 50 per cent of Tier 1 capital. The Bank meets both requirements.
Capital management
The Bank manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its activities. 
Capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by senior management, the Asset and Liability Committee, the Board Risk Committee and the Bank’s Board.  
Our submissions to the PRA in the year have shown that the Bank has complied with all externally imposed capital requirements (until April 2013,  
submissions were made to the Financial Services Authority). J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 139

Share fraud
Over the past few years we have been aware, as have many listed companies, that our shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters. Share fraud includes scams where investors are called out of the blue and offered shares that 
often turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or an inflated price for shares they own. These calls come from fraudsters operating in ‘boiler 
rooms’ that are mostly based abroad. Further information on how to avoid share fraud or report a scam can be found on our website at 
www.j-sainsbury.co.uk

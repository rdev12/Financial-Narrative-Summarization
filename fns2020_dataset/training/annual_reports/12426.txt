04 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Our strategy Progress towards strategic objectives:
Porvair’s strategy for growth and the creation of sustainable
shareholder value is to develop filtration and environmental
technology positions in markets where typically:
• specialist design or engineering skills win business;
• regulation or quality accreditation requirements mandate 
product use;
• consumable products, which protect more costly downstream
components, are often replaced as part of a maintenance routine;
• products, once designed into a specification, have long lifecycles.
Our key objectives are to:
Focus on regulated markets with 
long term growth prospects
Focus on selected markets which have good long term 
growth prospects and are fundamentally cash generative: 
aviation, energy and industrial, environmental laboratory 
supplies and aluminium filtration.
Concerted new product development
Invest consistently in new product development.
Geographic expansion to support key markets
Expand geographically, where appropriate, in our 
chosen markets.
Cash generation to invest in organic growth,
acquisitions and dividends
Use surplus cash to acquire complementary businesses 
that meet Group financial and commercial criteria.
Generate sufficient cash to sustain a progressive dividend 
policy and maintain an appropriately funded balance sheet.
In 2012, Porvair made good progress
against its strategic objectives:
 Porvair has a clear and consistent strategy for delivering
proﬁtable growth and creating sustainable value.

information Chairman’s statement
“There is plenty of opportunity across 
Porvair for market share gains and the 
Board’s outlook is positive.”
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report that Porvair continues
to make progress against its financial and
strategic objectives.
Results
Revenues in the year to 30 November 2012
were £76.5 million (2011: £68.1 million) and
profit before tax rose by 40% to £6.3 million
(2011: £4.5 million). These are record results
for the Group. Basic earnings per share were
10.1 pence (2011: 7.3 pence), an increase
of 38%.
Cash generated from operations was £9.2
million (2011: £8.1 million). After interest and
tax, net cash generated from operating
activities was £7.4 million (2011: £6.4 million).
At 30 November 2012 net debt was £3.9
million (2011: £5.1 million) after spending £3.3
million in cash on acquisitions during the year.
Dividends
The Directors recommend an improved final
dividend of 1.6 pence per share (2011: 
1.4 pence), making the full year dividend 
2.6 pence per share (2011: 2.4 pence).
Board composition
Paul Dean joined the Board in August 2012 
as an Independent Non-Executive Director. 
He brings extensive commercial and financial
experience in markets closely related to those
served by Porvair and has quickly settled in 
to his new role. He will become Chairman of
the Audit Committee from April 2013. He will
replace Michael Gatenby, who will retire from
the Board at the 2013 AGM in April. Michael
has been a Director for ten years, and has
made a substantial contribution to the
Group’s evolution over that time. We thank
him and wish him well. Andrew Walker will
succeed Michael as Senior Independent
Non-Executive Director.
Governance
The Board sets high standards for its Corporate
Governance of the Group and has in place
monitoring systems to ensure that those
standards are upheld throughout the Group.
The Board has complied with all aspects 
of the UK Corporate Governance code
throughout the year ended 30 November 2012
with the exception that the Non-Executive
Directors are not appointed for a fixed term.
However from this year, in accordance with
best practice, each Director will be subject 
to re-election at the Annual General Meeting. 
As a result of the larger contracts that the
Group has won recently, the Board has 
placed a greater focus in the year on the
management of risks associated with these
large overseas projects.
Staff
Much has changed at Porvair over the last 
five years. Sales revenues have increased 
by almost 70%, whilst staff numbers have
increased by a fifth over the same period.
At the start of 2013 the Group is on a sound
financial footing and there are plenty of
opportunities for growth. This is all due to our
excellent staff who can see the benefits of their
work in the 2012 results. The Board is most
grateful for their hard work and application.
Current trading and outlook
Porvair’s strategic direction and operating
objectives remain consistent and are producing
good results. We focus on niche markets
which have structural growth drivers. 2013 
has started well and order books are healthy.
The Board remains cautious about the general
economic outlook, but the fundamentals of 
the markets in which the Group operates look
satisfactory. After a record year we expect
revenue to grow at a more moderate rate in
2013. There is plenty of opportunity across
Porvair for market share gains and the Board’s
outlook is positive.

Overview
Porvair continued to make progress towards
its financial and strategic objectives in 2012,
thereby enhancing its prospects for 2013.
Revenues grew to £76.5 million and profit

Porvair’s activities and strategy
Porvair specialises in filtration and related
environmental technology. The Group has two
divisions. The Microfiltration division principally
serves aviation, environmental laboratory and
energy markets. The Metals Filtration division

markets which have clear structural drivers 
of growth. Over 80% of sales are from
consumable products for which replacement
sales recur at regular intervals.
The Group manufactures in the UK, US,
Germany and China.
Porvair’s strategy for growth and the creation
of sustainable shareholder value is to:
Develop filtration and environmental technology
positions in markets where typically:
• specialist design or engineering skills win
business;
• regulation or quality accreditation
requirements mandate product use;
• consumable products, which protect more
costly downstream components, are often
replaced as part of a maintenance routine;

good long term growth prospects and are
fundamentally cash generative: aviation,
energy & industrial, environmental laboratory
supplies and aluminium filtration.
Invest consistently in new product
development. 
Expand geographically, where appropriate, 
in our chosen markets.
Use surplus cash to acquire complementary

Operating review
Divisional performance – Metals Filtration
Revenues increased by 8% and operating
profits grew 63%. Cash generated from
operations was £4.8 million (2011: £1.7 million).
These are record results for Metals Filtration.
The division’s improved performance is driven
by both margin and market share growth,
chiefly from three patented products
introduced in recent years: Selee CSX™ 
for aluminium filtration; Selee SA™ for NiCo
alloy filtration; and Selee IC™ for the filtration
of gray and ductile iron. All three are fully
accepted by our customer base to whom they
offer either a better environmental solution, or
better filtration efficiency, or both. These are
steadily being introduced to new customers
and are winning market share as a result.
These new products contribute better margins
to the business and enable manufacturing to
be streamlined in the USA. They also enable
the division to work on input costs and
operating efficiencies, where steady incremental
improvements have been made since 2010.
The division ran at high levels of production
efficiency and customer service during 2012.
After a highly cash generative year, with
operating profit conversion to cash of 200%,
we expect to make several investments in the
division in 2013. As noted at the half year, we
have started a new cycle of investment in
facilities, plant and people in China, part of a
settled strategy for the division that will pursue
opportunities in certain niche markets in Asia.
We will also be investing in the next generation
of new products to be made in the USA. 
Pell Industries was acquired during the year.
This was a small acquisition that has been 
fully integrated with no additional overhead.
The Pell process is novel and results in
products with longer lifecycles than
competitive materials. We have started to
incorporate this know-how into our wider
product range and are seeing sales
opportunities as a result.
The division had a strong first half of 2012 
with robust demand from most end markets,
notably aluminium production, super-alloys for
turbine blades and a strong US car and light
truck market. Sales rates settled marginally
lower in the third quarter and have been
steady at these levels since. The Board
expects demand to remain at these lower
levels throughout 2013, with the impact
mitigated by business development 
opportunities. These are in two areas: margin
improvement through work on the introduction
of innovative raw materials that offer product
improvements and range extensions; and
market share gains from an entirely new
design of filter for which initial trial orders 
have been received. We will continue to refine
and test these development opportunities
throughout 2013.
Divisional performance – Microfiltration
Revenue from Microfiltration grew by 15% 
and operating profits grew by 19%. These are
record results for the Microfiltration division.
There are two principal businesses in this
division: the Porvair Filtration Group (“PFG”)
and Seal Analytical (“Seal”).
PFG had another good year. Revenue growth
was 17%. Stripping out the first shipment of
the POSCO contract, underlying revenue
growth was 5%.
The POSCO contract, announced at the end
of 2011, is a US$10 million+ contract to
design and build a char filtration system for 
a coal to substitute natural gas installation
being built by POSCO at Gwangyang, South
Korea. The design and build phase has gone
according to plan and first deliveries were
made in November 2012. Further deliveries will
be made during 2013. The financial impact of
the contract will be spread over several years.

Demand from elsewhere in the energy sector
has been robust in 2012 and the pipeline of
projects is encouraging. Early in 2013 an
£11.3 million contract was signed with the 
UK government for the supply of nuclear
remediation filtration equipment. The financial
impact of this work will be spread over three
years from 2013.
Aerospace revenues grew 20% in the year.
Porvair’s aviation filters are specified on almost
all commercial airframes. Around one third of
our sales are to the commercial wide-bodied
sector (Boeing and Airbus), with the remainder
split between commercial narrow body,
regional, business and rotary airframes and
engines. Our filters are used roughly equally for
new build and after-market purposes. Long
term supply contracts for inerting and coolant
filters, both previously announced, continue to
drive growth. Porvair was specified onto the
Airbus NEO programme in 2012 and expects
to see sales growth from the Airbus A350 later
in 2013.
Sales of bioscience filters also grew steadily.  
A series of improvements have been made in
the Group’s bioscience filtration capabilities in
recent years, and these are showing positive
results. A patent has now been awarded for
the Chromatrap™ range, which remains
modest in scale but continues its promising
commercial development.
Underlying revenues at PFG Inc, based in the
USA, grew strongly. This operation is steadily
increasing its engineering and manufacturing
capabilities and the results are evident. We see
further opportunities in the US in 2013.
Growth in energy, aviation, bioscience and the
US was partially offset by loss of revenue from
the closure of a small UK plant in 2011, and in
flat or declining sales into certain EU and
general industrial end markets.
Revenues at Seal grew 13%, helped by two
acquisitions. As reported at the interim stage,
weakness in several western European
markets was offset by an improvement in 
US demand. The Board’s view is that water
quality testing is a well defined niche market
that will grow as water quality standards
improve across the world. Seal is a market
leading supplier of equipment and
consumables for the detection of inorganic
contamination in water.
The two acquisitions in the year have
improved Seal’s consumables and service
capabilities. A line of block digesters and
related consumables are now being
manufactured in Seal’s US operation, having
been moved from Australia following the
acquisition of the Block Digester business 
from AIM Lab Automation Technologies Pty
Limited.  Sales in the year were well ahead 
of expectation. The business of Pulse
Instrumentation (“Pulse”) was acquired and
relocated from Canada to Seal’s US operation.
Pulse supplies a broad range of consumables
for environmental laboratories and brings with
it some interesting production know-how and
access to a wider installed base.
Following previous product launches in 2010
and 2011, Seal introduced a third new
platform in 2012, the Quaatro 39. To follow
this, in December 2012, Seal acquired the
design and manufacturing rights to a range of
discrete water analysers which, combined with
Seal’s existing know-how, will greatly improve
the speed and scope of product development
in the discrete analyser segment. This is also
being transferred to Seal’s US base, as part of
our strategy to broaden Seal’s capabilities in
the water analysis market.
Earnings per share, financing 
and dividends
Basic earnings per share were 10.1 pence
(2011: 7.3 pence), an increase of 38%.
Cash generated from operations was 
£9.2 million (2011: £8.1 million). After interest
and tax, net cash generated from operating
activities was £7.4 million (2011: £6.4 million).
At 30 November 2012 net debt was £3.9
million (2011: £5.1 million) after spending 
£3.3 million in cash on acquisitions during 
the year.
The Directors recommend an improved final
dividend of 1.6 pence per share (2011: 1.4
pence), making the full year dividend 2.6
pence per share (2011: 2.4 pence).

Group operating performance
The operating profit margin improved to 
9.4% (2011: 7.8%). This improvement arises
from the benefit of higher revenue driving
operational gearing and improved product
margins, particularly in the Metals Filtration
Division. The operating performance and key
performance indicators of the Microfiltration
and Metals Filtration divisions are described 
in detail in the Chief Executive’s report and
below.  The operating loss associated with the 
Other Unallocated segment was £1.9 million 
(2011: £1.8 million), which mainly comprises 
Group corporate costs. These include 
new business development costs, some
research and development costs and 
general financial costs.
The operating profit includes amortisation
charges on intangible assets arising on
acquisition of £0.1 million (2011: £nil),
acquisition expenses written off of £0.1 million
(2011: £nil) and share based payment charges
of £0.4 million (2011: £0.3 million).
Key performance indicators
The Group considers its key performance
indicators to be: revenue growth and operating
margins of its principal operations; profit
before tax growth; earnings per share growth;
interest cover; net debt to EBITDA; gearing;
and return on capital employed. The table
below summarises these indicators:

The Board considers that the Group has
performed ahead of the expectations set at
the start of the financial year as measured 
by these Key Performance Indicators.
Impact of exchange rate movements 
on performance
The international nature of the Group’s
business means that relative movements in
exchange rates can have a significant impact
on the reported performance. The average
rate used for translating the results of US
operations into Sterling was US$1.58:£ (2011:
US$1.60:£) and the Group’ s Euro denominated
operations were translated at €1.22:£ (2011:
€1.15:£). The slightly stronger dollar offset the
weaker Euro such that currency differences 
on translation had only a marginal impact
compared with the prior year. The Group sold
forward the majority of its UK business’ 2012
US dollar revenue during the financial year 
and achieved rates between US$1.51:£ and
US$1.60:£ benefiting the reported performance
by £0.2 million compared with 2011.
Finance costs
Net interest payable increased to £0.9 million
(2011: £0.8 million). Included within interest
payable are finance costs in relation to the
defined benefit pension scheme, which
increased to £0.4 million (2011: £0.2 million) 
in the year. The increase arises from a lower
expected return on the plan assets in the year.
Other net interest payable reduced as a result
of lower borrowings throughout the year.
The Group has a policy of maintaining
between 40% and 60% of its borrowings on
fixed interest terms. It achieves this by taking
out interest rate swaps to fix the interest rates
on certain of its borrowings. These provide
some protection for the Group in the event 
of interest rate rises. The Group had
approximately 40% of its gross borrowings
held at a fixed rate at 30 November 2012.
The contracts in place during the year are
summarised below:

Value creation in action:
The Group’s Metals Filtration division specialises in the design and
manufacture of filters for the molten metal industry. The Group provides
patent protected filters for the aluminium cast house industry; the
filtration of gray and ductile iron, mainly for the US auto and light truck
market; and the filtration of super-alloys used in the manufacture 
of turbine blades.

Interest cover was 8 times (2011: 7 times),
excluding the impact of the pension finance
charge the interest cover is 14 times (2011: 
9 times).
Tax
The Group tax charge was £2.0 million 
(2011: £1.4 million). This is an effective rate of
32% (2011: 31%), higher than the UK standard
corporate tax rate of 24.7% (2011: 26.7%),
mainly as a result of higher tax rates on profits
made in Germany and the US. The tax charge
comprises current tax of £1.8 million (2011:
£0.8 million) and a deferred tax charge of 
£0.2 million (2011: £0.6 million). The Group 
has eliminated its carried forward tax losses 
on trade arising in the Metals Filtration division
in the US in the year and has consequently
released the deferred tax asset it was carrying
in relation to those losses. The deferred tax
asset relates to the deficit on the pension fund
and share-based payments totaling £3.1 million
(2011: £2.2 million) offset by a net £1.1 million
(2011: £0.8 million) deferred tax liability in
relation to accelerated capital allowances 
and other timing differences.
Total equity
Total equity at 30 November 2012 was 
£45.2 million (2011: £42.1 million), an increase
of 7% over the prior year. Increases in total
equity arose from profit after tax of £4.9 million 
(2011: £3.5 million), after adding back the
charge for employee share option schemes;
and £0.1 million (2011: £0.6 million) in relation
to share issues on option exercises and 
hedge accounting instruments. Dividends 
paid of £1.0 million (2011: £1.0 million); an
actuarial loss of £0.6 million net of tax (2011:
£1.6 million) and exchange differences of 
£0.3 million (2011: gain of £0.1 million) 
reduced total equity.

Net debt at 1 December (5.1) (9.7)
Net debt at 30 November (3.9) (5.1)
Net working capital was tightly controlled 
and only increased by £0.3 million, although
revenue rose by 12% in the year. Inventories
increased by £1.1 million mainly as a result of
the requirement to carry inventory in relation 
to an increasing aerospace order book. The
increase in trade receivables and payables 
are largely accounted for by the outstanding
balances in relation to the POSCO contract, 
all of which are in accordance with the terms 
of the contract.
Net interest paid represents the bank interest
charged in the year and fell in line with the
lower bank borrowing in the year compared
with 2011.
Tax payments in the US have increased,
following the utilisation of past tax losses in
Metals Filtration. However, this was offset by
lower tax payments in relation to Seal Germany
compared with an unusually high payment 
in 2011.
Capital expenditure was £2.0 million (2011:
£1.3 million). The principal investments in 2012
were for plant to increase capacity, improvements
to the working environment in some of the
plants and technical analysis equipment
acquired to improve the quality of products 
and technical feedback to customers.

Driving market growth: Environmental laboratory supplies
£3.2m
T wo acquisitions were made in the year in Environmental
laboratory supplies for a total of £3.2 million. These two
acquisitions broaden the range of products and consumables
and provide access to a wider installed base.
Value creation in action:
The Group designs and manufactures a range of equipment and
consumables for use in laboratories. Its Seal Analytical business is
a global leader in the manufacture of laboratory based equipment
for testing for inorganic contaminents in water. The Group also
produces a broad range of laboratory microplates for storage and
experimentation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets.

Other
information Acquisitions
The Group acquired three businesses in 
the year for a total outlay of £3.5 million, 
£3.3 million of which has been paid in cash 
and £0.2 million of which is deferred. The block
digester business of Aim Lab Automation was
acquired for £0.5 million; the powdered metal
handling business of Pell Industries was
acquired for £0.3 million and the trade and
assets of Pulse Instrumentation were acquired
for £2.7 million.
The acquisitions contributed £0.4 million to net
profit in the year after charging amortisation on
acquired intangibles of £0.1 million. Expenses in
relation to the acquisitions totaling £0.1 million
were written off. 
Borrowings and bank finance
At the year end, the Group had net 
borrowings of £3.9 million (2011: £5.1 million)
comprising gross borrowings of £11.1 million
(2011: £10.2 million) offset by cash balances 
of £7.2 million (2011: £5.1 million). Borrowings
of £6.4 million (US$10.25 million) (2011: £6.6
million (US$10.4 million)) are held in US dollars.
The Group signed new borrowing facilities on
25 January 2013 comprising a five year US$20
million revolving credit facility, a £2.5 million 
term loan and a £2.5 million overdraft facility.
The new facilities provide adequate operating
headroom out to January 2017. At 30 November
2012, the Group had £1.0 million of unused
facilities (2011: £3.0 million of unused facilities),
an unutilised overdraft facility of £2.5 million
(2011: £2.5 million) and cash balances of £7.2
million (2011: £5.1 million). £1.4 million (2011:
nil) of the cash balances are held as restricted
cash in relation to the POSCO contract. It is
expected that the restriction on this cash will 
be released in February 2013.
The Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio improved
to 0.4 times (2011: 0.6 times) reflecting the
improved profitability of the Group and a
lowering of the net debt. The Group’s gearing
ratio (net debt as a percentage of total equity)
reduced to 9% (2011: 12%).
Finance and treasury policy
The treasury function at Porvair is managed
centrally, under Board supervision. It is not 
a profit centre and does not undertake
speculative transactions. It seeks to limit the
Group’s exposure to trading in currencies other
than its operations’ local currency and to hedge
its investments in currencies other than Sterling.
The Group does not hedge against the impact
of exchange rate movements on the translation
of profits and losses of overseas operations.
At the year end, the Group had US$10.25
million (2011: US$10.4 million) of US dollar
borrowings exposure which partially hedged
underlying US net assets on the balance sheet
of US$35.8 million (2011: US$33.1 million).
The Group finances its operations and working
capital by a combination of share capital and
retained profits; and short and long term loans.
Pension schemes
The Group continues to support its defined
benefit pension scheme in the UK, which is
closed to new members, and to provide access
to defined contribution schemes for its US
employees and other UK employees. 
The Group recorded a retirement benefit
obligation of £8.5 million (2011: £7.2 million).
The increase in the deficit arose principally 
from an actuarial loss in the year of £1.2 million
(2011: £1.8 million). The impact of a reduction
in the discount rate from 4.8% to 4.2% was the
principal reason that the losses of £2.6 million
arose on the change in financial and
demographic assumptions. This was partially
offset by a return on the scheme’s assets in
excess of the expected return of £1.4 million 
as a result of the good performance of the
underlying investments. The other assumptions
adopted were in line with the previous year.
The scheme had 54 (2011: 57) active members,
295 (2011: 301) deferred members and 265
(2011: 259) pensioners at 30 November 2012.
The life expectancy of members of the scheme
at age 65 is assumed to be 19.7 years (2011:
19.6 years) for men and 22.3 years (2011: 
22.2 years) for women.
A full triennial actuarial valuation of the assets
and liabilities of the defined benefit scheme was
completed in 2010, based on data at 31 March
2009. As a result of this review, the Group and
the Trustees agreed to alter the employer’s
contributions from 8% of salary to 8.2% of
salary plus a £175,000 annual contribution
towards the running costs of the scheme
commencing in March 2011 and increasing by
3.25% per annum. The Group also committed
to make additional annual contributions, to
cover the past service deficit, of £300,000 
per annum increasing by 5% per annum
commencing in December 2010, with an
increase to £450,000 per annum in December
2013 increasing by 5% per annum thereafter.
The funding shortfall is expected to be
eliminated by December 2027. The next full
actuarial valuation of the scheme will be based
on the pension scheme’s position at 31 March
2012 and is expected to be completed before
June 2013.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk
Existing market risk
The Group serves the needs of a range of specialist filtration
markets, such that it is not dependent upon any one market.
However, its activities are spread across four key markets 
as follows:
• aviation filtration, where quality and accreditation of products 
are critical;
• energy and industrial process filtration, where projects tend to 
be large and demand would be affected by a sustained 
economic downturn;
• environmental laboratory supplies, where revenue can be affected
by access to capital in customers’ markets (municipal/utilities and
industrial labs); and
• aluminium filtration, which tends to be a cyclical market. 
The above each contribute more than 10% of the Group’s revenue
and the Group would be exposed to a significant decline in any 
of these markets.
Mitigation
No single market represents more than 25% of revenue. Many of 
the Group’s products are consumable and are essential to the safe
operation of their respective systems and processes, so whilst
volumes are impacted by changes in economic circumstances,
significant fluctuations for other reasons are rare. 
The Aerospace market has traditionally provided very steady
business as the product cycles are very long and the Group offers 
a broad range of products split evenly between after-market and
new build. The Group has a good pipeline of new long term supply
contracts coming on stream and there is unlikely to be such a rapid
decline in the aerospace market that the Group could not manage
the consequences over time.
The energy and industrial process products serve a range of
customers who use filters as an integral part of processes in their
plants.  Sales are both for new build and after market spares.  
Environmental laboratory supplies are chiefly sold to laboratories
engaged in meeting the regulatory requirements for clean water.  
It is expected that the regulated nature of this market will mitigate
cyclical changes. This market is expected to grow as water
regulations tighten throughout the world and demand for clean
water in the developing world increases. The Group is steadily
increasing its consumable revenue into this market and reducing 
its reliance on original equipment sales. 
The Group’s revenue is affected by the levels of aluminium
production. However, the Group now has a stronger market position
having successfully converted its customers to a new improved filter
formulation. The production of aluminium is gradually moving to
larger smelters in regions of low cost energy. The Group is
developing its sales presence accordingly. 
Risk
New products and markets risk
The Group invests significant amounts into the development of 
new products often driven either by environmental imperatives or
legislation. In the early stage of development there is a risk that these
products will either not be adopted as part of the potential solutions,
or that the legislation or regulation will not develop in the way that 
the Group anticipates.
Mitigation
The Group’s new product development is focused on solving 
specific challenges identified by the Group’s customers. This focus
on specific developments improves the adoption rate of the Group’s
designs. The Group has brought a number of these products to
market recently and is now much less exposed to the risks
associated with new products. The Group maintains a close review
of each of its major developments and is not significantly exposed 
if the market for any one product does not develop.
Risk
Contracts risk
The Group has a number of contracts for the installation of filtration
systems which are large by the normal standards of the Group and
significant delays or engineering challenges with these contracts
could impact the Group’s expected performance. 
Mitigation
These contracts have direct senior management involvement on 
a day to day basis. The Group makes every effort to ensure that 
its commitments are met on time and in full. However, the Group 
is generally supplying a sub-system into a larger process and there
may be delays or engineering challenges that are outside the
Group’s control.
There are a number of risks and uncertainties, described 
below, which could have a material impact on the Group’s 
long term performance and prospects.
Our business Governance Group

information 18 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Risk
Raw materials, resources and facilities risk
The Group uses raw materials in its production processes. Prices 
for these raw materials can be volatile and are affected by the cyclical
movement in commodity prices such as oil, alumina, gas and steel.
The Group’s ability to pass on these price fluctuations to its
customers is to some extent dependent on the contracts it has
entered into and the prevailing market conditions. There may be
times when the Group’s results are adversely affected by an inability
to recover increases in raw material prices. 
The Group operates a number of production facilities, the largest
facility generating approximately one third of the Group’s revenue. 
A disaster, such as a fire or flood, at any of the Group’s facilities 
could have a material impact on the Group’s performance.
Mitigation
Where practical the Group seeks to fix its raw materials prices in 
long term contracts with suppliers and in certain cases uses forward
contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuating prices.
The Group maintains insurance of its equipment and facilities and
carries business interruption insurance to cover loss of profits. In
addition, the Group has ISO 9001 and other industry specific quality
control systems which reduce the risk that a disaster will occur.
Risk
Competitive risk
Porvair operates in competitive global markets. The Group’s
achievement of its objectives is reliant on its ability to respond 
to many competitive factors including, but not limited to, pricing,
technological innovations, product quality, customer service,
manufacturing capabilities and the employment of qualified
personnel. If the Group does not continue to compete in its 
markets effectively by developing innovative solutions for its
customers and delivering high quality customer service, it could 
lose its customers and its results could be adversely affected.
Mitigation
The Group recognises that certain of its competitors are larger and
have greater financial resources. This may enable them to deliver
products on more attractive terms than the Group or to invest more
resources, including research and development, than the Group.  
Through the development of a strategy that focuses on micro
niches within the Group’s chosen markets, the Group seeks 
to identify specific opportunities where it has a commercial,
reputational or technological advantage that enables it to 
compete successfully.
Risk
Technological risk
Porvair has a broad portfolio of products delivered to a diverse range
of markets. The Group’s business could be affected if it does not
continue to win new mandates for filtration solutions with designs
that provide technical or cost advantages over its competitors.
Mitigation
The design and testing cycle of many of the Group’s products takes
several years before a product is accepted by the customer. Once
the product is accepted, and production commences, products
often have a very long lifecycle. The Group therefore has good
visibility of its pipeline of opportunities for revenue growth. However,
the ultimate commercial success of a project can often only be
judged when the development cycle is close to completion.
Risk
Financing risk
The Group maintains a level of borrowing to finance its operations.
Damage to, or loss of, its banking relationships could have a material
impact on the profitability of the Group. 
Mitigation
To mitigate this risk, the Group has sufficient long-term facilities in
place for its expected requirements and has progressively reduced
its gearing. It maintains a close relationship with its bankers and
carefully monitors the restrictions on its borrowings.
Risk
Liability risk
The Group manufactures products that are potentially vital to the safe
operation of its customers’ products or processes. A failure of the
Group’s products could expose the Group to loss as a result of
claims made by the Group’s customers or users of their products. 
Mitigation
The Group seeks to minimise liabilities through limitations of liability 
in its contracts and carries insurance cover in the event that claims
are made. Our business Governance Group

Risk
Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that
include the effects of:
• price risk; 
• foreign exchange risk; 
• credit risk; 
• liquidity risk; and
• interest rate cash flow risk.
Mitigation
The Group has in place financial risk management procedures 
that seek to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance 
of financial risks. The principal procedures are described below:
Price risk
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its
operations. The Group buys certain raw materials and energy 
on long term contracts to minimise its exposure to fluctuation in
commodity prices. In all cases these contracts result in the ultimate
delivery and use by the Group of the commodity. The Group has 
no exposure to equity securities price risk as it holds no listed or
other equity investments.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group seeks to manage its exposure to the impact of
exchange rate movements on its net investments by maintaining
some borrowings in US dollars. Previously it sought to maintain
borrowings in US dollars equivalent to around 60% of the carrying
value of its US dollar net tangible assets in its US operations.
However, as the Group’s overall borrowings have reduced, so 
the US dollar borrowings have reduced, to around 30% of its 
US dollar net assets.
The UK operations of the business generate significant revenues 
in US dollars and the Group seeks to minimise the impact of
movements in the US dollar exchange rate on the value of these 
US dollar flows by using financial instruments to fix the future value
of the US dollars. The Group does not apply hedge accounting 
to these transactions.
Credit risk
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate 
credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
Debtor finance is very rarely used and is reviewed on a case by
case basis by the Board of Directors. The Group monitors the level
of deposits held with overseas banks and financial institutions and
repatriates cash as part of its treasury management.
Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and short term
debt finance that is designed to ensure the Group has sufficient
available funds for operations and planned expansions.
Interest rate cash flow risk
The Group has only interest bearing liabilities. The Group seeks 
to maintain between 40% and 60% of its borrowings at a fixed
interest rate, typically through fixed rate swap agreements. 
The Directors will revisit the appropriateness of this policy should
the Group’s operations change in size or nature. The Group 
applies hedge accounting to these instruments. The Group had
approximately 40% of its gross borrowings held at fixed rates 
at 30 November 2012.

Directors’ report
The Directors are pleased to present their Annual Report 
and the audited accounts of the Group for the year ended 
30 November 2012.
Principal activities and results
The Group’s principal activities are in the areas of specialist
filtration and environmental technologies in the UK, US,
Germany and China. The profit for the financial year was 
£4.3 million (2011: £3.1 million).
Business review 
The business is reviewed in the Chairman’s statement 
on page 6, the Chief Executive’s report on pages 
7 to 10 and the Finance Director’s review on pages 
12 to 16. The Group’s strategy, objectives and likely future
developments of the business are discussed in detail in 
the Chief Executive’s report. The key performance indicators
are defined in the Finance Director’s review and discussed
throughout the Chief Executive’s report and Finance Director’s
review. The risks and uncertainties facing the business are
described on pages 17 to 19.
Acquisitions 
On 5 December 2011 a Group subsidiary, Seal Analytical
Limited, purchased the Block Digestion product range
(“Block Digesters”) from Aim Lab Automation Technologies
Pty Limited based in Australia. The total consideration paid
was £485,000.
On 10 February 2012 a Group subsidiary, Selee Corporation,
purchased the trade and assets of Pell Industries, a
manufacturer of powdered metal handling products. Total
consideration is a maximum of US$500,000 (£316,000) with
a US$300,000 (£191,000) initial payment and a maximum
further consideration of US$200,000 (£125,000) contingent
upon achievement of agreed average monthly revenues from
acquisition until the latter part of 2013. The contingent
consideration may be paid in cash or shares at the Group’s
option. The Group expects the contingent consideration 
to be paid in full in cash.
On 17 April 2012 a Group subsidiary, Seal Analytical Inc.,
purchased the trade and assets of Pulse Instrumentation
(1992) Limited, a laboratory consumables business based in
Canada. Total consideration is a maximum of Can$4,289,000
(£2,716,000). Can$3,789,000 (£2,400,000) was paid as an
initial payment and a further Can$400,000 (£253,000) was
paid on 15 November 2012. A final payment of Can$100,000
(£63,000) was due and paid in January 2013.
Further details of the acquisitions are given in note 25 
on pages 63 to 65.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 1.0 penny per share (2011: 1.0 penny
per share) was paid on 7 September 2012. The Directors
recommend the payment of a final dividend of 1.6 pence 
per share (2011: 1.4 pence per share) on 7 June 2013 to
shareholders on the register on 3 May 2013; the ex-dividend
date is 1 May 2013. This makes a total dividend for the year
of 2.6 pence per share (2011: 2.4 pence per share).
Directors and their interests
The names and biographical details of the Directors are set
out on page 20.  Michael Gatenby, Charles Matthews, Ben
Stocks, Chris Tyler and Andrew Walker all served throughout
the year. Paul Dean was appointed to the Board on 2 August
2012. Michael Gatenby will retire from the Board at the
Annual General Meeting on 16 April 2013.
The articles of association of the Company (“the Articles”)
require Paul Dean to seek election at the first Annual 
General Meeting following his appointment and Andrew
Walker to retire by rotation and offer himself for re-election.
Notwithstanding the above, and in accordance with best
practice, it is the Board’s intention that all Directors should
offer themselves for re-election each year.
The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed
by the Articles, the Companies Act 2006, the UK Corporate
Governance Code and related regulation and legislation
applying to UK listed companies. The Articles require there 
to be a minimum of three Directors (and permit a maximum
of 15) and provide that the business of the Company shall be
managed by the Board of Directors which may exercise all
powers of the Company. The Board of Directors may make
such arrangements as they see fit to delegate those powers
except that the Board retains specific authority over the
matters reserved for the Board, which are summarised in 
the Board of Directors section in the Corporate Governance
report on page 32.
During the year, the Group maintained insurance providing
liability cover for its Directors.
Details of all the beneficial and non-beneficial interests of 
the Directors in the shares of the Company, share options
and service contracts are set out in the Report of the
Remuneration Committee on pages 27 to 31. None of 
the Directors had a material interest in any contract of
significance in relation to the Company or its subsidiaries
during the year.
There are no agreements between the Company and its
Directors or employees that provide for compensation for
loss of office or employment in the event of a takeover of 
the Company.
The Company has in place procedures to deal with conflicts
of interest. The Company follows the guidance on conflicts 
of interest issued by the Association of General Counsel and
Company Secretaries of the FTSE.
Research and development
The Group continues to undertake a research and
development programme with the objective of identifying 
and developing new materials and products which have the
potential to transform the growth of the Group. The cost to
the Group in the year under review was £3.1 million (2011:
£2.6 million), which was written off to the income statement
and no development expenditure was capitalised in the year
or the preceding year. The expenditure is of a development
nature and is largely undertaken in-house rather than by 
third parties. In accordance with International Accounting
Standard (IAS) 38, ‘Intangible Assets’, development
expenditure is largely written off as incurred but where  Directors’ report continued
22 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
a product has, amongst other conditions, been shown to be
technically feasible and the Group can demonstrate, through
customer acceptance or otherwise, that there is a market 
for the product, subsequent development expenditure 
is capitalised and written off over the expected life of 
the product.
Share capital
The Company has one class of ordinary share capital which
carries no right to fixed income. All of the Company’s shares
in issue are fully paid and each share carries the right to vote
at general meetings of the Company. During the year, the
Company issued 51,700 shares to satisfy the exercise of
share options.
Further details of the share capital of the Company are given
in note 22 to the financial statements on pages 60 to 62.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding in
the Company nor on the transfer of shares, which are both
governed by the provisions of the Articles and prevailing
regulation and legislation governing UK listed companies. 
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between
holders of the Company’s shares that may result in
restrictions on voting rights. No person has special rights 
of control over the Company’s share capital.
Each year the Board seeks shareholder approval to renew
the Board’s authority to allot relevant securities and to
purchase its own shares.
Contracts
The Company is a party to a number of agreements that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
of the Company such as commercial contracts, banking
agreements, property lease arrangements and employee
share plans.
Substantial shareholders
As at 25 January 2013, the Company has been notified 
of the following substantial shareholdings comprising 3% 
or more of the issued share capital of the Company.
                                                                                                       Ordinary

Corporate governance
The disclosure requirements set out in the Disclosure and
Transparency rules, paragraph 7.2, are included within the
Corporate governance report on pages 32 to 34, which
forms part of this report.
Employment policies
The Group’s employment policies are described in the
Corporate and social responsibility report on pages 25 and 26.
Donations
The Group made a number of charitable donations totaling
£22,000 (2011: £15,000) during the year. Substantially all
charitable donations were made to local charities operating 
in Hendersonville, North Carolina. In accordance with Group
policy, no political donations were made in the year 
(2011: £nil).
Creditor payment policy
The individual operating companies are responsible for
agreeing the terms and conditions under which they conduct
transactions with their suppliers. It is Group policy that
payments to suppliers should be made in accordance with
these terms provided that the supplier is also complying with
all relevant terms and conditions. The trade creditor days 
of the Company at 30 November 2012 were 45 days (2011:
35 days).
Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks
that include the effects of price risk, foreign exchange risk,
credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate cash flow risk. The
Group has in place risk management procedures that seek 
to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of
the Group of these financial risks.
Given the size of the Group, the Directors have not delegated
the responsibility of monitoring financial risk management to
a sub-committee of the Board. The policies set by the Board
of Directors are implemented by the Company’s finance
department, which has a policy and procedures manual that
sets out specific guidelines to manage interest rate risk and
credit risk and circumstances where it would be appropriate
to use financial instruments to manage these.
Further details on the specific risks related to financial
management and their mitigation are given on page 19.
Post balance sheet events
On 11 January 2013, the Group announced that it had
signed an £11.3 million contract with the UK Government for
the design and manufacture of a nuclear remediation filtration
system. The financial impact of the contract will be spread
over three years commencing in 2013. Certain aspects of the
project require further engineering and the precise timing 
of deliveries is yet to be determined.
On 25 January 2013, the Group entered into new five 
year banking facilities sufficient for its foreseeable needs
comprising a US$20 million revolving credit facility, a 
£2.5 million amortising term loan and a £2.5 million 
multi-currency overdraft facility. 
Going concern
After having made appropriate enquiries, including a review
of the Group’s budget for 2013, its medium term plans and
taking into account the new banking facilities described
above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Group and Company has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
these accounts. Our business Governance Group

Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company is to be held on
Tuesday 16 April 2013. The notice for this meeting and proxy
forms have been sent to shareholders separately.
Resolutions 4 to 8
Michael Gatenby will stand down from the Board at the
Annual General Meeting on Tuesday 16 April 2013. Paul
Dean, who has been appointed to the Board since the last
Annual General Meeting of the Company, offers himself 
for election and in accordance with best practice all other
Directors offer themselves for re-election. Brief biographies 
of the Directors are set out on page 20 of the Annual Report.
Resolutions 10 and 11 – Directors’ authority to allot shares
(ordinary resolution) and disapply pre-emption rights 
(special resolution)
Resolution 10 authorises the Directors to allot shares under
section 551 of the Companies Act 2006. Paragraph 10.1
gives the Directors customary authority to allot ordinary
shares or grant such subscription or conversion rights as 
are contemplated by sections 551(1)(a) and (b) respectively 
of the Companies Act 2006 up to an aggregate nominal
amount of £284,083, being an amount equal to one third of
the Company's issued share capital as at 25 January 2013.
As at 25 January 2013, the Company did not hold any
treasury shares. Paragraph 10.2 gives the Directors authority
to issue an additional aggregate nominal amount of up to
£284,083, being an amount equal to one third of the
Company's issued share capital as at 25 January 2013. 
This additional authority is to be applied to rights issues 
only and is in accordance with the recommendations of the
Rights Issue Review Group and the Association of British
Insurers (the "ABI").
The authorities granted under Resolution 10 shall expire at
the next Annual General Meeting of the Company. Resolution
10 replaces a similar resolution passed at the Annual General
Meeting of the Company held on 11 April 2012.
If the Directors wish to allot shares or other equity securities
for cash or sell any shares which the Company holds in
treasury, following a purchase of its own shares pursuant 
to the authority in Resolution 12, the Companies Act 2006
requires that such shares or other equity securities are
offered first to existing shareholders in proportion to their
existing holding. Resolution 11 asks shareholders to grant
the Directors authority to allot equity securities or sell treasury
shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £42,612
(being 5% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital 
as at 25 January 2013), without first offering the securities 
to existing shareholders. The resolution also disapplies the
statutory pre-emption provisions in connection with a rights
issue and allows the Directors, in the case of a rights issue,
to make appropriate arrangements in relation to fractional
entitlements or other legal or practical problems which might
arise. The Directors confirm that they do not intend to issue
in excess of 7.5% of the Company's issued ordinary share
capital within any rolling three year period without prior
consultation with shareholders. The authority will expire 
at the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Resolution 12 – Purchases of own shares by the Company
(special resolution)
Resolution 12 to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
seeks authority from shareholders for the Company to make
market purchases of its own ordinary shares, such authority
being limited to the purchase of 10% of the ordinary shares in
issue as at 25 January 2013. The maximum price payable for
the purchase by the Company of its own ordinary shares will
be limited to the higher of (i) 5% above the average of the
middle market quotations of the Company's ordinary shares,
as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock
Exchange, for the five business days prior to the purchase
and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade 
of an ordinary share and the highest current independent 
bid for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock
Exchange Trading System SETS. The minimum price payable
by the Company for the purchase of its own ordinary shares
will be 2 pence per share (being the nominal value of an
ordinary share). The authority to purchase the Company's
own ordinary shares will only be exercised if the Directors
consider that there is likely to be a beneficial impact on
earnings per ordinary share and that it is in the best interests
of the Company at the time. The resolution renews a similar
resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting of the
Company held on 11 April 2012. Any ordinary shares so
purchased by the Company will be held in treasury by the
Company and will remain in issue and be capable of being
re-sold by the Company or used in connection with certain 
of its share schemes.
To understand the impact of dilution, options to subscribe 
for up to 2,444,418 ordinary shares have been granted and
are outstanding as at 25 January 2013 (being the latest
practicable date prior to publication of this document) which
if issued would represent 5.4% of the issued ordinary share
capital at that date. If the Directors were to exercise in full the
power for which they are seeking authority under Resolution
12 the options outstanding as at 25 January 2013 would
represent 6.4% of the ordinary share capital (excluding
shares held in treasury) in issue following such exercise.
Resolution 13 – Calling of general meetings 
(special resolution)
Resolution 13 to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
seeks authority from shareholders to hold general meetings
(other than Annual General Meetings) on 14 days' clear
notice. This is permissible under the Articles and the
Companies Act 2006. However, pursuant to the EU
Shareholders' Rights Directive, the Company must offer the
facility, accessible to all shareholders, to vote by electronic
means and must obtain specific shareholder approval on an
annual basis to retain this ability. The Directors believe that
there may be circumstances in which it will be in the interests
of the Company to be able to convene meetings at such
short notice. The shorter notice period would not be used 
as a matter of course, but only where it is merited by the
business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage
of the shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors
believe that it is important for the Company to retain this
flexibility. Resolution 13 renews a similar resolution passed 
at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 
11 April 2012.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the
Directors have prepared the Group financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the parent
company financial statements in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under
company law the Directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the Group and parent company financial statements
respectively; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed
on page 20 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and
profit of the Group; and 
• the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s report, 
the Finance Director’s review, the Principal risks and
uncertainties and the Directors’ report, when taken together,
include a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties
that it faces.
Directors’ responsibility for provision of information 
to the Auditors
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s Auditors are unaware;
and each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to
have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the
Company’s Auditors are aware of that information.
Independent auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their 
willingness to continue in office and a resolution concerning
their re-appointment will be put to the Annual General Meeting.

Corporate and social responsibility report 
Policy
The Board’s policy is to enhance shareholder value in an
ethical and socially responsible manner. The Board believes
that operating efficiently with high quality standards includes
promoting high standards of health and safety and helping 
to protect the environment. As a minimum, the Group
operations are required to meet the legal and regulatory
requirements of operating in their local jurisdiction.
Employment policies
Porvair prides itself on its people and their ability to provide
innovative solutions for its customers. Porvair is committed 
to employing talented people and enabling them to reach
their full potential. Porvair provides employment in a wide
range of disciplines associated with the design and
manufacture of filtration and separation equipment.
The Group involves employees through both formal and
informal systems of communication and consultation.
Managers have a responsibility to communicate effectively
and to promote a better understanding by employees of 
the activities and performance of the Group. Employee
consultative committees regularly meet to ensure that
management obtains representative views of employees
concerning any decisions that affect them. Information
relating to trading, company strategy and any other matters
of significance are communicated to all employees through
local briefings.
It is the Group’s policy to recruit, train, promote and treat all
personnel on grounds solely based on individual ability and
performance. These principles are applied regardless of sex,
sexual orientation, religion, age, nationality or ethnic origin.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always
considered in full, bearing in mind the respective aptitudes
and abilities of the applicant concerned. In the event of
members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to
ensure that their employment with the Group continues and
the appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the
Group that the training, career development and promotion
of a disabled person should, so far as possible, be identical
to that of all other employees.
Health and safety
The Group recognises its clear responsibilities for the health
and safety of its employees and to the communities in
which the Group operates. Health and safety responsibility 
is delegated to senior managers within each business. These
officers perform regular reviews and inspect the conditions in
which the Group’s employees work. Discretionary health and
safety benefits for employees include the availability of gyms
and onsite nursing and counseling staff at certain operations.
The Group’s regular reporting procedures include a review of
accidents in the workplace.
The Group’s insurers carry out periodic reviews of the
Group’s operations as part of their risk assessments and 
the recommendations of the consultants are generally
implemented in full.
Health and safety achievements in the year have included:
• A comprehensive review of the health and safety standards
within the Porvair Filtration Group including an update 
to the health and safety policy and associated training.
Particular improvements have been made to the Company’s
procedures in relation to control of substances hazardous
to health, fire safety risk assessments and safety
improvements and additional safety measures on 
certain machinery.
• The award of a Gold Safety Award from the North Carolina
Commissioner of Labor for maintaining a very low accident
rate in comparison with other similar businesses.
• Improved lighting and reduced noise levels in the Group’s
principal Metals Filtration plant.
The environment
Many of the products developed by Porvair are used to the
benefit of the environment. Examples include:
• Seal water analysis equipment, which is used, inter alia, to
ensure drinking water is fit for consumption; and to analyse
sea and river water for signs of pollution or changes to
normal mineral composition; 
• The patented Selee CSX™ aluminium filter, which is
manufactured without phosphates or ceramic fibres and
has other improved filtration and manual handling benefits
over competitor products; and 
• The Group’s nuclear filters, which have been fitted to a
range of demonstration plants being assessed as part of
the decontamination and decommissioning work being
carried out at the major US and UK nuclear waste sites. 
This year the Group has introduced a modification to the
gasket on its aluminium cast house filters which significantly
reduces the amount of smoke and vapours that emit from
the filters as it is heated up to operating temperature.
The Group consistently considers methods of improving its
environmental profile. Environmental impacts are managed in
conformity with local regulatory requirements. The Group’s
manufacturing processes have only a limited potential
emissions impact. The Group uses solvents in certain of its
processes, and has procedures in place for their control, and
its Metals Filtration division manages the emissions from its
kiln firing operations.

Relationships with customers
The Group’s products are bespoke for specific customers
and generally have a very long product lifecycle. This naturally
requires the Group to build close relationships with its
customers. Over 80% of the Group’s annual revenue comes
from repeat business from existing customers.
Most new product introductions are developed with 
existing customers and when new customers are gained 
it is often after a long development period over which 
a close relationship has developed and a long term
relationship is expected.
Particularly in aerospace and energy, the Group builds
relationships with the immediate customer for the product
and also with the ultimate end user or manufacturer, who is
often the party that certifies the product. For example the
airframe manufacturer will be an important stakeholder but
the customer will usually be a sub assembly manufacturer. 
Relationships with suppliers
The Group has an extensive network of suppliers and sub
contractors, many of whom are critical to the manufacture of
specific parts. The Group has a stable supplier base. It seeks
to increase its supplier base by extending the number of
suppliers only where there are perceived to be risks of under
capacity or resilience in its existing supply chain. Suppliers
are generally only removed from the approved list for
persistent quality or delivery failures.
Wherever possible, the Group seeks local suppliers to fulfil 
its requirements. The Group carefully selects its suppliers. 
As part of building a long term relationship with its critical
suppliers, the Group works closely with them to ensure that
the quality and delivery standards required by the Group 
are achieved.
Anti-bribery and corruption policy
The Group prohibits all forms of bribery and corruption 
within its business and complies with the requirements of all
applicable laws designed to combat bribery and corruption.
The Group requires all employees, agents, intermediaries and
consultants to conduct themselves in accordance with 
its anti-bribery and corruption policy.
Porvair and the local community
The management of each operation is aware of its role within
its local communities. They seek to recruit locally and retain 
a skilled local workforce and are encouraged to build
relationships with local community organisations. 27 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Report of the Remuneration Committee 
This part of the Report of the Remuneration Committee
is unaudited
This report complies with the UK Corporate Governance
Code published in June 2010 (the “UK Corporate
Governance Code”) and sets out the Group’s remuneration
policy and details of Directors’ remuneration. A resolution to
approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting in April 2013.
The Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are drawn
solely from the Independent Non-Executive Directors. The
Committee is required to comprise at least two members.
During the year, the Committee comprised Michael Gatenby,
Charles Matthews and Andrew Walker (Chairman). Paul Dean
joined the committee from 2 August 2012. A quorum is two
members of the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for determining:
• the framework for the remuneration of the Chief Executive
and other Executive Directors;
• the total individual remuneration package of each
executive director including, where appropriate, bonuses,
incentive payments and share options;
• the targets for the performance-related pay schemes
operated by the Group;
• the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for
each Executive Director; and
• that contractual terms on termination, and any payments
made, are fair to the individual and the Group, that failure is
not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully
recognised.
The Committee uses external published benchmark data as
part of its assessment of the pay and benefits awarded to the
Executive Directors.
The Committee also has an advisory role in relation to major
changes in employee benefit structures throughout the
Company and the Group.
Remuneration policy
In formulating its policy for rewarding the Executive Directors
the Committee has given full consideration to the requirements
of Section D of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee aims to provide remuneration packages that:
• are competitive, but not excessive, and are designed to
attract, retain and motivate managers of high quality to
deliver growth for the business;
• are aligned with shareholders’ interests and have a
significant proportion of the potential remuneration linked
to the short and medium term performance of the
business;
• include an element of the potential reward linked to
personal performance; and
• encourage the Executive Directors to accumulate shares in
the Company.
The Executive Directors’ remuneration packages consist of: 
a base salary; a discretionary annual cash bonus earned for
the achievement of financial and non-financial objectives; the
grant of share options and long term incentives with three
year financial performance targets; and the provision of other
benefits including pension arrangements, life insurance,
permanent health and medical insurance and a company 
car or allowance.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors have rolling contracts with the
Company which can be terminated on giving twelve months’
notice. This is considered to be an appropriate balance
between flexibility and commitment on both parties.
The Non-Executive Directors receive letters of appointment
with six month notice terms and are subject to annual
re-election, in common with the Executive Directors, in
accordance with the best practice set out in the UK
Corporate Governance Code published in September 2012.
They receive a fixed annual fee, which reflects their time
commitment to the business and they do not participate in
any share option scheme, bonus or pension arrangements. 28 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Annual bonus
Bonus payments to Executive Directors are made at the discretion of the Committee with reference to the achievement of Group
financial performance targets and achievement of personal and strategic objectives. In 2012, awards were capped at 75% of
base salary with up to 60% paid on achievement of financial performance targets and 15% paid based on achievement of
strategic and personal objectives. Bonuses up to 50% of salary are paid in cash. As part of a programme to encourage the
Executive Directors to maintain a larger holding of shares in the Company, the net amount of a bonus award in excess of 50% 
of salary is paid in shares in the Company. Bonuses to be paid in 2013 relating to the Group’s performance targets in 2012 are
shown in the table of Directors’ remuneration above. Bonuses are not pensionable but may be paid directly into the Executive
Directors’ pension schemes if requested.
In respect of 2012, the business exceeded the financial performance targets required for a maximum payout of the annual bonus
but not all of the strategic and personal objectives were met in full. Accordingly, a bonus of 70% of salary has been awarded to
the Executive Directors. 
Pension entitlements
The Porvair plc Pension and Death Benefit Plan (“the Plan”) is a contributory defined benefit scheme, which is now closed to new
employees. Pension benefits from the Plan were subject to the HMRC earnings cap and the Group has continued to maintain an
earnings cap since the HMRC limits were removed in April 2006. Pension benefits up to the capped limit were provided in the
period for Ben Stocks by the Plan. Ben Stocks is entitled to the same pension benefits from the Plan as all other members. 
Only basic salary is pensionable.
Ben Stocks also receives a 15% contribution to a Self Invested Pension Plan (“SIPP”) on the difference between his full salary and
the capped limit covered by the Plan. Pension benefits are provided for Chris Tyler by a contribution of 15% of full salary to a SIPP .
Life assurance benefits covering a lump sum of four times salary on death in service and a 20% spouse’s pension are provided
for Ben Stocks and Chris Tyler by the Plan. Ben Stocks and Chris Tyler are covered by the Group’s permanent health 
insurance scheme. 29 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

The Company paid £20,648 (2011: £19,898) to a SIPP for Ben Stocks and £33,952 (2011: £27,853) to a SIPP for Chris Tyler in
respect of the financial year 2012.
Share options and long term incentive plan shares
Awards of share options and long term incentive plan shares are at the discretion of the Committee. 
The Company operates two discretionary share option plans:
• market priced options under The Porvair 2005 Unapproved Share Options Scheme (the ‘2005 scheme’). 
• nominal priced options under The Porvair Long Term Share Plan 2008 (the ‘2008 scheme’). 
Both schemes provide options with a ten year life and are subject to vesting conditions after three years based on performance
conditions set by the Committee. 
The Company also periodically offers invitations to all UK full time employees to join Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) schemes.
Currently there is a three year and a five year scheme running following an invitation in October 2011. 
Options granted between 2005 and 2008 under the 2005 scheme only vest in full if the Committee is satisfied that, over a period
of either three or four years from the date of grant, there has been an increase in the Group’s earnings per share of at least 10%
per annum above the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the same period. 25% of the options awarded can be exercised if
the Committee is satisfied that, over a period of either three or four years from the date of grant, there has been an increase in
the Group’s earnings per share of at least 5% per annum above the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the same period. 
A sliding scale operates between the two limits. If the vesting conditions are not met after four years then the options lapse. For
options granted in 2009 and later, similar performance conditions apply, except that the conditions will have to be met after three
years otherwise the options will lapse. Under the 2005 scheme, except under exceptional circumstances, no Director may be
granted options to the value of more than one year’s salary per annum. Options granted in 2006, up to £100,000 per employee,
under the 2005 scheme were awarded under the HMRC’s Employee Management Incentive (‘EMI’) rules. No options were
granted under this scheme in 2011 or 2012.
In January 2011 the Committee, having consulted with a number of shareholders, decided to vary the performance conditions
on the 69.5 pence options issued on 30 January 2009 under the 2005 scheme. Under the revised performance conditions these
options would vest in full if the Group’s earnings per share was above 7.0 pence for the financial year ended 30 November 2011.
Earnings per share must be at least 6.5 pence before any options vest. A sliding scale operates between earnings per share of
6.5 pence and 7.0 pence. None of the options vest at earnings per share of 6.5 pence and 50% of the options vest at earnings
per share of 7.0 pence. If the vesting conditions are not met the share options lapse. The Committee believes that varying the
performance conditions provided a better incentive for management than the previously set conditions. These options vested in
full in January 2012.
Options granted in 2010 under the 2008 scheme can only be exercised in full if the Committee is satisfied that in the financial
year ended 30 November 2012, the Group has achieved earnings per share of at least 11.0 pence per share. 30% of the award
will vest if the Group has achieved earnings per share of 7.4 pence per share in the year ended 30 November 2012. 50% of the
award will vest if the Group has achieved earnings per share of 8.0 pence per share in the year ended 30 November 2012. 
A sliding scale operates if the earnings are between 8.0 pence and 11.0 pence. 92% of these options will vest as a result of the
performance in the year ended 30 November 2012, the remaining options have lapsed.
Options granted in 2011 under the 2008 scheme can only be exercised in full if the Committee is satisfied that in the financial
year ending 30 November 2013, the Group has achieved earnings per share of at least 12.5 pence per share. 30% of the award
will vest if the Group has achieved earnings per share of 8.0 pence per share in the year ending 30 November 2013. 50% of the
award will vest if the Group has achieved earnings per share of 9.5 pence per share in the year ending 30 November 2013. 
A sliding scale operates if the earnings are between 8.0 pence and 9.5 pence and between 9.5 pence and 12.5 pence. 30 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Report of the Remuneration Committee continued
Options granted in 2012 under the 2008 scheme can only be exercised in full if the Committee is satisfied that in the financial
year ending 30 November 2014, the Group has achieved earnings per share of at least 14.0 pence per share. 30% of the award
will vest if the Group has achieved earnings per share of 9.0 pence per share in the year ending 30 November 2014. 50% of the
award will vest if the Group has achieved earnings per share of 11.0 pence per share in the year ending 30 November 2014.
A sliding scale operates if the earnings are between 9.0 pence and 11.0 pence and between 11.0 pence and 14.0 pence.
The Committee intends to grant options in 2013, after publication of these results, under the 2008 scheme, which can only 
be exercised in full if the Committee is satisfied that in the financial year ending 30 November 2015, the Group has achieved
earnings per share of at least 15.5 pence per share. 30% of the award will vest if the Group has achieved earnings per share of
11.0 pence per share in the year ending 30 November 2015. 50% of the award will vest if the Group has achieved earnings per
share of 12.5 pence per share in the year ending 30 November 2015. A sliding scale operates if the earnings are between
11.0 pence and 12.5 pence and between 12.5 pence and 15.5 pence.
The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Company’s option schemes may not exceed 10% of the
Company’s issued share capital in any 10 year period. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2005
scheme may not exceed 5% of the Company’s issued share capital in any 10 year period. 
The Committee retains the discretion to vary the performance conditions on any future awards under the 2005 scheme and the
2008 scheme. The options granted under the SAYE scheme in 2011 were issued at a 20% discount to the market price at the
date of grant. These options have no performance conditions.
The market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at 30 November 2012 was 152 pence (2011: 101.5 pence).
The range of market prices during the year was 87 pence to 152 pence.

Total shareholder return
The following graphs chart total shareholder return against the FTSE SmallCap Index for the last five years and the last three
years to 25 January 2013, with both rebased to 100 at the start of each period. Given the nature of the Group, the FTSE
SmallCap Index is the logical comparator index.

Corporate governance
Compliance
The following sets out the main principles of good
governance in the UK Corporate Governance Code that
have been followed by the Board and how those principles
have been applied. The Directors are of the opinion that
the Company has complied with the provisions of the UK
Corporate Governance Code (which is publicly available at
www.frc.org) throughout the year except where explicitly
set out below.
Role of the Board
The Group is directed and controlled by the Board.
It provides strategic leadership and support with the aim of
developing the business profitably, whilst at the same time
assessing and managing the associated risks. The Board
ensures that the financial management, controls and
resources are in place to enable the business to meet 
its objectives. The Directors take collective responsibility 
for the Group’s performance.
The Board has a fixed schedule for reviewing the Group’s
operating performance and has other specific responsibilities
reserved to it, which include:
• Approval of the published financial results and dividends; 
• Appointments to the Board and other Board committees; 
• Approval of the strategic direction of the business; 
• Approval of expenditure over certain limits; 
• Approval for acquisitions and disposals; 
• Approval of treasury policy and significant new financing;
and 
• Approval of the funding policies of the defined benefit
pension scheme. 
The Executive Directors manage the day to day operations
of the business within the framework set out by the Board.
Outside the formal schedule of Board meetings the Chairman
and Non-Executive Directors make themselves available for
consultation with the Executive team as necessary.
The Board has a schedule of seven pre-arranged meetings
during the year. In addition, such other meetings as are
required are arranged to deal with specific issues or
transactions. During the year there was full attendance at 
all pre-arranged Board meetings except for Andrew Walker,
who missed one Board meeting.
The Board undertook a rigorous self assessment review
during the year to consider its own performance. The
procedures included individual interviews by the Chairman
with each Director, completion of an assessment form and
discussion of the findings at a Board meeting. The Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director maintains regular
contact with the other Independent Non-Executive Directors
and the Executive Directors, sufficient to monitor the
performance of the Chairman. The Chairman, in consultation
with the Executive Directors, monitors the performance of the
Non-Executive Directors.
Board of Directors
The Board consists of six Directors; two Executive
Directors and four Non-Executive Directors. The Board
is chaired by Charles Matthews. Ben Stocks is the Group
Chief Executive and Chris Tyler is the Group Finance
Director. Michael Gatenby, Paul Dean, Charles Matthews
and Andrew Walker are Independent Non-Executive
Directors. Michael Gatenby is the Senior Independent
Non-Executive Director. On Michael Gatenby’s retirement
at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be
held in April 2013, Andrew Walker will be the Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director. The Board considers
that Charles Matthews continues to be an Independent
Non-Executive Director after his appointment as Chairman.
The Directors’ appointment and removal is a matter for
the Board as a whole. The Senior Independent Non-Executive
Director is available for consultation with shareholders
through the Company Secretary, by written submission.
The Executive Directors and the Chairman have met with
the Company’s major shareholders and other potential
investors on a regular basis and have reported to the
Board on those meetings.
The Non-Executive Directors’ terms of appointment do not
specify a specific period for their appointment and therefore
the terms are not in compliance with provision B.2.3 of the
UK Corporate Governance Code. However, in accordance
with best practice all of the Directors offer themselves for
re-election at each Annual General Meeting. All newly
appointed Directors offer themselves for election at the first
Annual General Meeting following their appointment.
The Chairman considers that, following the application of the
Board’s formal performance evaluation programme, each
Director’s performance continues to be effective and each
Director has demonstrated commitment to his role. Paul
Dean was appointed on 2 August 2012 and will stand for
election at the Annual General Meeting to be held in April
2013. The Board considers that his extensive commercial
and financial experience within businesses in closely related
sectors to the Group’s will be of considerable benefit to
the Board and the future of the Group.
On joining the Board a new Director receives appropriate
induction including meeting with other Directors, visiting the
Group’s principal operations and meeting with senior
management and the Group’s principal advisers.
The Board has put in place a procedure by which any
Director may take independent professional advice, at the
expense of the Company, in furtherance of his duties as a
Director of the Company.
The Company maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability
insurance. 33 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Board Committees
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee currently comprises all of the
Independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company. The
Chairman of the Audit Committee is Michael Gatenby, who
will be replaced by Paul Dean following the Annual General
Meeting to be held in April 2013. The Committee includes
Charles Matthews, the Chairman of the Company.
The Audit Committee has a formal timetable of meetings.
Representatives of the Company’s auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , attend meetings by invitation.
Other employees of the Company may be invited to attend
meetings as and when required.
The Board considers that all members of the Audit Committee
have recent and relevant financial experience to enable it to
discharge its function. The Committee has a formal agenda,
timetable and terms of reference. During the course of the
period under review it has:
• reviewed the financial statements of the Company and any
formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial
performance prior to announcement; 
• monitored the Company’s internal financial controls
and the Company’s internal control and risk management
systems and ensured that these are properly reviewed
by the Group’s management; 
• reviewed the scope of the internal audit work done in
reviewing the operating companies’ internal controls and
procedures; 
• made recommendations to the Board in relation to the
appointment of the external auditor and approved the
remuneration and terms of engagement of the external
auditor; 
• monitored the external auditor’s independence and
objectivity; and 
• reviewed arrangements by which staff of the Company
may raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters
of financial reporting or other matters. 
The Audit Committee’s full terms of reference are available on
the Group’s website, www.porvair.com.
The Audit Committee has set a policy which is intended to
maintain the independence and objectivity of the Company’s
auditors when acting as auditor of the Group accounts. The
policy governs the provision of audit and non-audit services
provided by the auditor and, in summary, requires significant
non-audit services other than routine tax compliance services
to be subjected to a competitive tendering process. The fees
paid to the auditor for audit services, audit related services
and other non-audit services are set out in note 3 of the
consolidated financial statements.
The Audit Committee is authorised to engage the services
of external advisers, as it deems necessary, at the Company’ s
expense in order to carry out its function.
The Audit Committee met three times during the year.
There was full attendance by the members with the exception
of Andrew Walker, who missed one meeting. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee determines and
recommends to the Board the framework and broad policy
for the remuneration and long term incentive arrangements
of the Company’s Executive Directors. The Remuneration
Committee comprises all of the Independent Non-Executive
Directors of the Company. Andrew Walker is the Chairman
of the Committee.The Group Chief Executive may be invited
to attend and speak at meetings of the Remuneration
Committee, but does not participate in any matter which
impacts upon his own remuneration arrangements. The
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, including
the Chairman, is set by the Executive Directors.
The Report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 27 to 31
includes details on remuneration policy, practices and the
remuneration of the Directors.
The Remuneration Committee met twice during the year and
was fully attended by all of its members.
The Remuneration Committee’s full terms of reference are
available on the Group’s website, www.porvair.com.
Nomination Committee
The Company’s Nomination Committee provides a
transparent process and procedure for the appointment
of new Directors to the Board. The Nomination Committee
comprises all of the Non-Executive Directors and is chaired
by the Chairman of the Company. The Nomination
Committee’s responsibilities include:
• identifying and nominating candidates to fill Board
vacancies; 
• evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience
on the Board and the leadership needs of the organisation;
and 
• succession planning. 
The Company recognises the importance of diversity on
the Board and throughout the executive functions within
the business.
During the year the Company appointed a new Independent
Non-Executive Director, Paul Dean. The Company compiled
a long list of potential candidates from the knowledge of its
Directors and by consulting with its advisers. Consequently,
it did not require the services of a recruitment consultant. A
short list of interviewees was selected from the list. Interviews
were conducted, in the first instance, by the Chairman and
Group Chief Executive and second interviews were conducted
by the Group Finance Director and other Non-Executive
Directors. The final selection was made by the Board
as a whole.
The Nomination Committee met once during the year as
part of a full Board meeting to discuss the nominations for
the new Non-Executive Director. The Group’s leadership
and succession planning was considered in a meeting of
the full Board.
The Nomination Committee’s full terms of reference are
available on the Group’s website, www.porvair.com. 34 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Takeover Directive
Disclosures relating to the Takeover Directive are included
in the Directors’ Report (under “Share capital”) on page 22.
Internal control
The Turnbull Report issued in 2005 gives guidance for
directors on reviewing internal controls and reporting.
The Company has complied in full throughout the year,
and up to the date the financial statements were approved,
with the recommendations of the Turnbull Report.
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that
the Group maintains a system of internal controls and
for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is not designed
to eliminate the risk that the Group’s objectives will not be
achieved but to ensure that there is an ongoing process for
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks.
As with any such system, it can only provide reasonable,
but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement
or loss. The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the
process regularly throughout the year. The Group’s key
procedures are as follows:
Control environment – each operating business has its
own management group which meets regularly to monitor
operational matters. Each operating business is responsible
for establishing its own systems of internal controls and
for ensuring compliance with those controls. The Managing
Director of each operating business reports to the Group
Chief Executive, and clearly defined lines of responsibility
have been established within this organisational structure.
The senior finance executive in each operation has a dual
responsibility to report within his operation to the Managing
Director and to the Group Finance Director. The Executive
Directors visit all operations regularly to perform
detailed reviews.
Risk management – operating business management have
a clear responsibility for the identification of risks facing each
operation, and for establishing procedures to investigate and
monitor such risks. The Board reviews a group register of
risks and mitigation on a regular basis as part of its normal
Board reporting. The Board also commissions independent
reviews of the key risks facing the Group as appropriate.
Information and control systems – each operating business
maintains its own internal systems and controls designed to
provide management with regular and reliable management
information. The Group has a comprehensive process of
annual budgets and detailed monthly reporting. The annual
budget of each operating business and the consolidated
Group budget are approved by the Board as part of its normal
responsibilities. The Board receives copies of the monthly
management accounts for each month and the performance
of the Group is reviewed in detail at each Board meeting.
Monitoring system – the Board has established a framework
of controls encompassing procedures applicable to all
businesses that are subject to executive review. The Group
operates a self-assessment process so that the operating
businesses can quantify the extent of their compliance with
control objectives. This process is monitored by an internal
audit cycle conducted by peer review by the Group’s financial
controllers directed by the Group Finance Director. The
Board considers that the peer review process provides an
appropriate level of review. The Group has a formal whistle
blowing procedure which gives employees the opportunity
to escalate their concerns, ultimately to the Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director.
Consolidation process – full management accounts for
each entity in the Group are consolidated each month and
review and analysis is carried out on those results. These
consolidated accounts form the basis of reports that are
provided to each Director every month.
The Audit Committee and the Board have reviewed the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls for the period
1 December 2011 up to the date of approval of the Annual
Report and Accounts and have addressed issues as they
have been identified.

of comprehensive income, the Consolidated balance sheet,
the Consolidated cash flow statement, the Reconciliation
of net cash flow to movement in net debt, the Consolidated
statement of changes in equity and the related notes.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied
in their preparation is applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by
the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities set out on page 24, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the group financial statements
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the group
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices
Board’ s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent
in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the annual report to identify material
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs
as at 30 November 2012 and of its profit and cash flows
for the year then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS
Regulation. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for
the financial year for which the group financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to
you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 22, in relation to
going concern; 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating
to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of
the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our
review; and 
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board
on directors’ remuneration. 
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of Porvair plc for the year ended 30 November
2012 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies 
Porvair plc is a public limited company registered and domiciled in the UK and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as endorsed by the European Union, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (formerly the International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable
to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company has elected to prepare its entity accounts in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice ("UK GAAP") and these are presented on pages 70 to 76.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention as modified
by the recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value through
profit or loss. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 30 November each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are
made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance
with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified
as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenditures are eliminated on consolidation.
Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances including management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions. The results
form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.
Material estimates and assumptions are made in particular with regard to: establishing uniform depreciation and amortisation
periods for the Group, goodwill and intangible assets valuation (cash flows and discount rate), impairment testing,
assumptions used in the calculation of share-based payments, parameters for measuring pension and other provisions and
the likelihood that tax assets can be realised.
The Group applies the percentage of completion method in accounting for its construction contracts. Use of the percentage
of completion method requires the Group to estimate the construction performed to date as a proportion of the total
construction to be performed. Estimating the costs to complete is considered to be a material estimate.
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units
have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates (note 10).
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of
the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of
deferred consideration.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately
in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on
disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
subject to being tested for impairment since that date. 41 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

1 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of goods and services supplied net of value added tax and other sales taxes. Revenue
is recognised when goods are despatched to the customer at which point the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Revenue from service contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
Interest income is accrued on a straight-line basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial
asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to
the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by the proportion that
contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be
representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the
extent that the amount can be measured reliably and its receipt is considered probable. Contract costs include costs directly
related to the specific contract and indirect costs attributable to the contract.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of
contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period
in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense
immediately.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Finance lease payments are allocated between the
liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding. The rental obligations, net of
finance charges, are included in current and non-current liabilities. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the
income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability for each period.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the
relevant lease.
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational
currency. The Group determines the functional currency of each entity based on the primary economic environment in which
the entity operates and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of
the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations, borrowings and other currency instruments are
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified
as other comprehensive income and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are typically recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs
incurred in arrangement of new facilities are capitalised and subsequently recognised in the income statement over the period
of the borrowings.
Government grants
Government grants for the development of new products are recognised over the periods necessary to match them with the
related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method,
with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the
period in which they occur. They are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a
straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. 42 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
1 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
The retirement benefit obligation in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than a business combination) of other assets
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates,
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all, or part, of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and
are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is recognised in the
income statement, except when it relates to items recognised directly to other comprehensive income or directly to equity. 
In this case, the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in
the balance sheet at their cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment
losses.
Properties, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production or administrative purposes, are carried at cost,
less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation for these assets, on the same basis as other assets,
commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than assets under construction, over their estimated useful
lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases:
Buildings                                                2.5 – 3%
Plant, machinery and equipment            10 – 33%
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or,
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds
and the carrying amount of the assets and is recognised in the income statement. 43 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Internally generated intangible assets – research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s product development expenditure is recognised only if all of
the following criteria are demonstrable:
• The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
• The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• The ability to use the intangible asset or to sell it; 
• The way in which the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
• The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
intangible asset; and 
• The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 
Internally generated intangible assets are held at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives. Useful life is
determined with reference to estimated product life in the industry in which the expenditure has been incurred. Useful life of
the Group’s development expenditure is currently between 3 and 10 years. Amortisation of development expenditure
commences when development has been completed to management satisfaction and the related project is ready for its
intended use. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as
an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Patents, trademarks and know-how
Patents, trademarks and know-how purchased as part of an acquisition, where there are expected future economic benefits,
are initially measured at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful lives. 
Software
Software costs are classified as intangible fixed assets and measured initially at purchase cost. Amortisation is charged on a
straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of 3-5 years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
The Group reviews annually the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). For the purposes of assessing impairment,
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units).
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been
adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised
as an expense immediately.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) (other than
goodwill) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash
generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable,
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and
condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Where necessary,
provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective inventories.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet
date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans are classified as “other receivables” in the balance sheet.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost. A provision for impairment of
trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due
according to the original terms of receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or delinquency in
payments when credit control procedures have been applied are indicators an impairment may be required. The amount of
the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows,
discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement within
administrative expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off to the provision for impairment. Subsequent
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against administrative expenses in the income statement. 44 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
1 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with
banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the
consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown with borrowings in current liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to
the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument, to the
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received,
net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements to hedge these exposures. The
Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written
principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the
income statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value,
with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
The gain or loss on the effective portion of the interest rate swap agreements, that are designated and qualify as cash flow
hedges is recognised in equity under hedge accounting. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income
statement within interest payable and similar charges. 
Provisions
Provisions have been made for future dilapidations costs on leased property. These provisions are the Directors’ best
estimates as the actual costs and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. Any difference between
expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made.
Where the impact of discounting is material, the Group discounts at its weighted average cost of capital, unless some other
rate is more appropriate in the circumstances.
Share based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2, “Share based payment”. In accordance with the transitional provisions,
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity settled, share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled, share based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled, share based
payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest. The charge is then credited back to reserves.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises
the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Exceptional items
The Group presents certain items as “exceptional”. These are material items which derive from events or transactions that fall
within the Group’s ordinary activities and which by virtue of their size, nature or incidence need to be separately disclosed to
enable an understanding of the Group’s underlying financial performance. Examples of items include, but are not limited to,
acquisition costs, disposals or restructuring of a significant part of an operating segment, impairment events and litigation claims
by or against the Group.  45 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and
incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity). An
operating segment’s operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is
available. Operating segments are aggregated into reporting segments where they share similar economic characteristics 
as a result of the nature of the products sold or the services provided, the production processes used to manufacture the
products, the type of customer for the products and services and the methods used to distribute the products or provide 
the services.
New standards, amendments and interpretations
(a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective for the first time in the year ended 30 November 2012:
• Amendment to IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’;
• Amendment to IFRIC 14, ‘Prepayments of minimum funding requirement’;
• Annual improvements 2010;
• Amendments to IFRS 7 on derecognition.
None of these have had any impact on the reported results of the Group.
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted:
• IAS 19 (revised 2011), ‘Employee benefits’;
• Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’ on other comprehensive income (OCI);
• Amendment to IAS 12, ‘Income taxes’ on deferred tax;
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ on ‘Classification and measurement’ of financial assets;
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ on ‘Classification and measurement’ of financial liabilities;
• IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’;
• IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’;
• IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’;
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’;
• IAS 27 (revised), ‘Separate financial statements’;
• IAS 28 (revised), ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’;
• Amendments to IAS 32 and IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments on asset and liability offsetting’;
• Annual improvements 2011;
• IFRC 20, ‘Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine’.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards, amendments and interpretations, where relevant, in
future periods will have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements, other than the adoption of IAS 19 (revised
2011), ‘Employee benefits’.
IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was amended in June 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2013. The impact will be as follows: to immediately recognise all past service costs; and to replace interest cost and expected
return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit
liability. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of the amendments. 46 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

2 Segment information
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors reviews the Group's
internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management have determined the operating
segments based on this reporting.
At 30 November 2012, the Group is organised on a worldwide basis into two operating segments:
(1) Metals Filtration
(2) Microfiltration
Other Group operations are included in "Other unallocated". These mainly comprise Group corporate costs and include new
business development costs, some research and develepment costs and general financial costs.

The standard rate of Corporation Tax in the UK changed from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012. Accordingly, the
Group's profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 24.67%.
During the year, as a result of the change in UK Corporation Tax rates which will be effective from 1 April 2013, deferred tax
balances have been remeasured. Deferred tax relating to temporary differences which are expected to reverse prior to 1 April
2013 is measured at 24% and deferred tax relating to temporary differences expected to reverse after 1 April 2013 is
measured at the tax rate of 23% as these are the rates that will apply on reversal. A further reduction has been proposed to
reduce the rate to 21% from 1 April 2014, although this has not yet been substantively enacted. 51 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the Group's cash generating units (CGUs) identified according to its business segment.
A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below.

The recoverable amount of the goodwill is based on value-in-use calculations. The calculations use cash flow projections
based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period. Pre-tax cash flows beyond the three-year
period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.
Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations:                                                                                                            Metals Filtration                           Microfiltration

Budgeted gross margin 33% 33% 33% 33%
Growth rate used to extrapolate cash ﬂows beyond the budget period 3% 3% 3% 3%
Weighted average cost of capital 8% 8% 8% 8%
These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each operation within the business segment. Management determined
budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for the development in its markets. The average
growth rates used are consistent with past experience and market expectations. The discount rates used are pre-tax and
reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.
Based on the results of the current period impairment review, no impairment charges have been recognised by the Group in
the year ended 30 November 2012. Having assessed the anticipated future cash flows, the Directors do not currently foresee
any reasonable changes in assumptions that would lead to such an impairment charge in the year ended 30 November 2012.

Under IFRS the fair value of all forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are recognised on the balance sheet
with the corresponding entry included within administrative expenses. The Group recognises all forward foreign exchange
contracts and currency options on the balance sheet at fair value using external market data.
Derivatives relating to trading activities are classified as a current asset or liability. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is
classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and, as a
current asset or liability, if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding US dollar forward foreign exchange contracts at 30 November 2012 is
£6.8 million (2011: £1.0 million) which mature in December 2012, January 2013, February 2013, March 2013, April 2013,
May 2013, November 2013 and June 2014. The notional principal amount of the outstanding Euro forward exchange
contract at 30 November 2012 is £nil (2011: £0.3 million).
The Group has contracted interest rate swap agreements for US$7.5 million (2011: US$10 million) of its US$ borrowings until
December 2013. The Group also has contracted interest rate swap agreements for £nil (2011: £1 million) of its UK
borrowings. The Group has accounted for these swap agreements using hedge accounting with gains or losses being
credited/charged directly to equity. 54 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Credit risk in relation to trade receivables
The Group has a diverse customer base both geographically and in the number of industries in which it operates.
There is credit risk associated with a decline in a particular industry or geographic region. To offset this risk, the Group has
implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks to be performed on significant potential customers before sales
are made. Customer orders are checked against pre-set criteria before acceptance and credit control procedures are applied.
Letters of credit and payments in advance are obtained from customers as appropriate.
The Group does not hold security over its receivables, so was exposed to credit risk in respect of the net trade receivables
balance of £10,884,000 (2011: £10,595,000). Management believe the credit quality of trade receivables which are within
the Group's typical payment terms of between 30 and 90 days (and which are less than 3 months overdue) are good, with
£1,388,000 (2011: £1,891,000) being past due but not impaired at the year end, of which £1,070,000 (2011: £1,190,000)

Deﬁned beneﬁt scheme deﬁcit 8,351 7,020 
Additional pension commitments 143 151
8,494 7,171 
The additional pension commitments arise out of contractual commitments to certain employees outside the scope of the
defined benefit plan. These liabilities will crystallise between two and eleven years. 
a) Defined contribution schemes
For its US employees, the Group operates a defined contribution pension plan ("the Pension Plan") covering all eligible full-
time employees. The Group contributes 3% of each participant's base salary each year to the Pension Plan. In 2012, this
amounted to £153,000 (2011: £177,000). In 2012, the Group also made payments of £155,000 (2011: £159,000) to
designated US 401k schemes on behalf of its employees.
In the UK, after the closure of the defined benefit plan to new members, the Group introduced a stakeholder plan to be
offered to all new employees. Total employer contributions in the UK paid to defined contribution schemes were £266,000
(2011: £246,000). 58 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
20  Retirement beneﬁt obligations continued
b) Defined benefit plan
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, The Porvair plc Pension & Death Benefit Plan (the ‘Plan’), covering a
number of employees in the UK. The pension scheme is financed through a separate trust fund administered by Trustees with
an independent Chairman. The Plan was closed to new entrants in October 2001.
Formal valuations of the Plan by a professionally qualified actuary are carried out at least every three years using the projected
unit method. Under this method the current service cost will increase in relation to the salaries of the members in future years
as those members approach retirement. The latest available full actuarial valuation was at 1 April 2009. 
2009 2006
valuation valuation
assumptions assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2009 valuation were: %%
Past service investment return:
Pre-retirement 6.75 6.75
Post-retirement 5.00 4.75
Salary increases 3.25 4.00
The actuarial value of the assets on the funding basis was sufficient to cover 57% of the benefits that had accrued to
members after allowing for expected increases in pensionable remuneration, and the current funding deficiency amounted to
£10.4 million. The Group and the Trustees agreed in 2010 to alter the employer’s contributions from 8% of salary to 8.2% of
salary plus a £175,000 contribution towards the running costs of the scheme, increasing by 3.25% per annum. The Group
has also committed to make additional annual contributions of £300,000 per annum increasing by 5% per annum from
December 2010, with an increase to £450,000 per annum increasing by 5% per annum from December 2013 to cover the
past service deficit. The funding shortfall is expected to be eliminated by December 2027. The next full actuarial valuation of
the scheme will be based on the pension scheme's position at 31 March 2012 and is expected to be completed by June
2013.
The UK pension charge for the year was £200,000 (2011: £200,000); the funding via employer contributions was £469,000
(2011: £628,000). 
The valuation of the deficit in the balance sheet is based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the Plan as updated by a
qualified actuary to take account of the market value of the assets and the present value of the liabilities of the Plan at
30 November 2012.

Pre and post retirement mortality:
The SAPS base mortality tables have been used, with a 110% multiplier allowing for future improvements of 1.0% per annum
(2011: 1.0% per annum). The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is
19.7 (2011: 19.6) for men and 22.3 (2011: 22.2) for women.

Share options 
Share options are granted to Executive Directors and to selected employees. Details of share options awarded, including
exercise price and performance conditions, are disclosed in the Report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 27 to 31.
These equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the
grant date of the equity-settled, share-based payments is expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The charge is then credited back to reserves.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

26  Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate cash
flow risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management programme is disclosed on pages 17 to 19 and
page 22 of the Directors' report. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily
in respect of the US dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets
and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
(i) US dollar
The Group has investments in its US based subsidiaries denominated in US dollars. Currency exposure arising from the net
assets of the Group’s US operations is managed through borrowings denominated in US dollars.
The UK operations generate significant US dollar revenues and forward contracts are used to reduce the impact of
movements in the US dollar exchange rate.
The Group has the following outstanding US dollar forward contracts:
2012 2011
$’000 $’000
Outstanding forward contracts 10,960 1,500
The Group has the following current assets and liabilities denominated in US dollars:
2012 2011
$’000 $’000
Trade receivables denominated in US dollars 9,278 8,965
Other receivables denominated in US dollars 8,185 5,087
Cash balances denominated in US dollars 7,852 2,960
Trade payables denominated in US dollars (4,103) (3,978)
Other payables denominated in US dollars (7,823) (2,014)
13,389 11,020
If the US dollar exchange rate were to move by 10% against Sterling, the Group would make the following gains/(losses):
2012 2011
£’000 £’000
US dollar strengthens 928 779 
US dollar weakens (758) (636) 66 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
26  Financial risk management continued
(ii) Euro
The Group has investments in its European based subsidiaries denominated in Euros. Currency exposure arising from the net
assets of the Group’s European operations is managed through net purchases from suppliers as a partial natural hedge.
The UK operations generate Euro revenues and forward contracts are used to reduce the impact of Euro exchange rate
movements.
The Group has the following outstanding Euro forward contracts:
2012 2011
€’000 €’000 
Outstanding forward contracts – 375 
The Group has the following current assets and liabilities denominated in Euros:
2012 2011

Trade receivables denominated in Euros 1,937 1,882 
Other receivables denominated in Euros 1,113 828 
Cash balances denominated in Euros 2,205 1,295 
Trade payables denominated in Euros (1,340) (1,055)
Other payables denominated in Euros (535) (469)

If the Euro exchange rate were to move by 10% against Sterling, the Group would make the following gains/(losses):
2012 2011
£’000 £’000
Euro strengthens 306 236 
Euro weakens (250) (194)
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings. Borrowings in the years ended 30 November 2012 and 2011 carry
interest at variable rates and are denominated in US dollars and Sterling. The Group has entered into interest rate swap
agreements on 73% (2011: 97%) of the US denominated borrowings to reduce the impact of future changes in US interest
rates. On 12 December 2011, an interest rate swap agreement expired reducing the fixed proportion of US denominated
borrowings to 73%. The Group has entered into an interest rate swap agreement on nil% (2011: 27%) of the Sterling
denominated borrowings to reduce the impact of future changes in UK interest rates.
The Group is exposed to cash flow risk in respect of loans not covered by the interest rate swap agreements.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower on borrowings throughout the year with all other variables held constant, the post
tax profit for the year would have been £31,000 (2011: £36,000) lower/higher respectively.
Credit risk
Credit risk is disclosed in note 13.
Liquidity risk
Banking facilities, including a maturity profile, are disclosed in note 17. The amortising debt commits the Group to quarterly
repayments of principal of £250,000 (2011: £250,000). Interest is payable based on the length of the revolving facilities,
typically between 1 and 3 months and on a quarterly basis for the term loan. The Group is required to meet banking
covenants on a quarterly basis. Whilst the Group has sufficient cash reserves and expects future trading to enable it to meet
its cash flow obligations, should trading performance prevent it from doing so then the lender has recourse over the Group’s
assets.
The table on page 67 analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities into
relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
Derivative financial liabilities are included in the analysis to the extent their contractual maturities are essential for an
understanding of the timing of cash flows. The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been
defined below:
• Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as 
prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is
determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is
available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are
observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to operate as a going concern in order to
provide returns to shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost
of capital. In order to adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return
capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net
debt is calculated as total borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents. Total
capital is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the consolidated balance sheet. The gearing ratio at 30 November 2012 was 9%
(2011: 12%) which is in line with the Group’s repayments of its borrowings. 
The Group’s borrowings are subject to certain covenant restrictions imposed by the bank. These covenants have been fully
complied with during the year ended 30 November 2012. 68 | Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
27  Contingent liabilities
On 21 November 2011 and 21 December 2011, the Group entered into advanced payment bonds totalling US$4,526,000
relating to monies received on a contract in advance. The bonds require the amount to be repaid in the event delivery is not
made within certain parameters. The advanced payment bonds are released 30 days after despatch and in any event no later
than August 2015. Also on 21 November 2011, the Group entered into a performance bond totalling US$981,000. The bond
is released after a warranty period and in any event no later than August 2016.

information
We have audited the parent company financial statements
of Porvair plc for the year ended 30 November 2012 which
comprise the parent company balance sheet (under UK
GAAP), the Company loss for the financial year, the parent
company reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds
and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities set out on page 24, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the parent company
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express
an opinion on the parent company financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical
Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared
for and only for the company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is
shown or into whose hands it may come save where
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read
all the financial and non-financial information in the annual
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider
the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s
affairs as at 30 November 2012;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the
financial year for which the parent company financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the parent
company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you
if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the group financial
statements of Porvair plc for the year ended
30 November 2012.

1 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention and in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards. A summary of the more important
accounting policies is set out below, which have been applied on a consistent basis with the previous year, except
where noted.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are capitalised at cost and are depreciated by equal annual amounts over their estimated useful lives.
Annual depreciation rates are 10% to 33.33% straight line for plant, machinery and equipment.
Fixed asset investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for permanent diminution in value.
Impairment of assets
Assets are regularly reviewed to confirm their carrying values. Where the expected realisable value is lower than the book
value, the excess of book value is charged to the profit and loss account during the period. 
Patents and trademarks
All expenditure on the registration, renewal and maintenance of patents and trademarks is expensed as incurred.
Foreign exchange
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at
the end of the financial year.
Exchange differences arising on retranslation of non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised directly to the exchange
reserve. All other foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
Deferred taxation
The charge for tax is based on the profit for the year and takes into account tax deferred or accelerated because of timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and tax purposes. Full provision is made for deferred tax
resulting from timing differences between profits computed for tax purposes and profits stated in the financial statements to
the extent that there is an obligation to pay more tax in the future as a result of the reversal of those timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable, and are measured on a non-
discounted basis based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
Pensions
Pension costs for defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
The Company participates in the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme (which is closed to new members), The Porvair plc
Pension and Death Benefit Plan. The Company includes only the cost of its contributions to the scheme in its profit and loss
account for the year because the structure of the scheme is such that it does not enable any individual group company to
identify its shares of the assets and liabilities of the scheme.
Share based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20, "Share based payments". In accordance with the transitional
provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of
1 January 2005.
Where the parent company has granted rights over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary companies, there is
a corresponding increase recognised in the investment in subsidiary undertakings in those years.
The Company issues equity settled, share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled, share based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled, share based
payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest. The charge is then credited back to reserves.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revisions to original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account or, if relating to a subsidiary
undertaking in investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the
relevant lease.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are typically recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs incurred
in the arrangement of new facilities are capitalised and subsequently recognised in the profit and loss account over the period
of the borrowings.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available to parent companies under FRS 8, 'Related Party Disclosures',
not to disclose transactions and balances with wholly owned subsidiaries.

10  Provisions for liabilities and charges
Under FRS 19 the Company provides for deferred tax on a full provision basis. Deferred tax assets in the accounts have been
recognised as follows:
2012 2011
Assets £’000 £’000
Accelerated capital allowances 4 1 
Short term timing differences 254 172 
258 173 
There were no unrecognised deferred tax amounts at 30 November 2012 (2011: £nil).
During the year, as a result of the change in UK Corporation Tax rates which will be effective from 1 April 2013, deferred tax
balances have been remeasured. Deferred tax relating to timing differences which are expected to reverse prior to 1 April
2013 is measured at 24% and deferred tax relating to timing differences expected to reverse after 1 April 2013 is measured at
the tax rate of 23% as these are the rates that will apply on reversal. A further reduction has been proposed to reduce the rate
to 21% from 1 April 2014, although this has not yet been substantively enacted.
The deferred tax asset in the table above has been included in debtors: amounts falling due after more than one year (note 6).

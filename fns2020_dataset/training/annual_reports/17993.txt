Camellia Plc is an international Group – a global family of diverse companies with a 128-year heritage employing
approximately 76,000 people worldwide. Our operating divisions include Agriculture, Banking and Financial
Services, Engineering, Food Service and Investments. From the start, Camellia’s ethos has been based on the
highest moral and professional integrity, and a commitment to doing the right thing – ethically and commercially,
globally and locally. Profits are our lifeblood but not our soul.
Our business is built on two fundamental principles:
� Long-termism. We see ourselves as custodians, holding our businesses in trust for future generations. We
believe we have a responsibility to ensure the stability, security and continuity of all our businesses, so they can
be passed on to the next generation as enduring operations. We recognise that people and businesses take time
to establish and grow to their full potential and we are happy to wait for that to happen. We are deeply
committed to improving the long-term stability and well-being of our businesses, the communities and the
environments in which we are involved.
� Sustainability. We are committed not only to the ultimate welfare of our employees but also to the
communities in which they live. We believe our businesses can and should grow with respect and care for the
environment rather than at the cost of it. We proactively invest in ensuring that the environments where we do
business are continually protected and improved, and seek to minimise any damage our activities may cause.
Our business is made up of five divisions:

Our results for the year reflect once again the diversity of our operations and the unpredictability of global
markets. Excluding the adjustment for the revaluation of biological assets, which I am pleased to report will have a
much reduced impact on our accounts going forward, and the significant provision for post-employment benefits
that we have been required to make in Bangladesh, headline profits were £23.9 million compared to £17.2 million
in 2014. This result reflects the difficulties that our subsidiaries in the oil services sector have been facing; but also
reflects the improved tea prices in Kenya and the improved profitability of our agricultural operations more
generally.
2015 was a transitional year for your Group, with the appointment of Tom Franks as the Chief Executive, Graham
Mclean as Managing Director of Agriculture and Susan Walker as the Chief Financial Officer and the retirement
of a number of longstanding executive directors. As a result there have been consequential changes to both roles
and responsibilities and also the organisation of the Group which are set out in the Chief Executive’s and corporate
governance reports. A detailed statement which shareholders will hopefully find interesting and informative is
included as the Chief Executive’s report and we have also included substantially more information in the annual
accounts to assist shareholders with getting a better understanding of our Group.
Notwithstanding these changes, I am pleased to report that the overriding principles of the Group remain
constant. We are committed to the development of the business over the long term and to the sustainability of our
businesses, the environments and communities in which we operate.
As announced previously we took the step during the year of closing one of our subsidiaries, AKD Engineering,
following many years of substantial losses. This was not a decision that your Board took lightly, being well aware of
the social and other implications of this move, but was unfortunately unavoidable given the trading conditions.
We sold the Loddon Engineering business towards the end of the year to the De Swart Group, an owner in a
better position to ensure the long term future of that business. Despite these changes, the Group has continued its
policy of organic growth and development, further details of which are contained in the Chief Executive’s report. 
Dividend
Your Board is recommending a final dividend of 95p per share which, together with the interim dividend already paid
of 34p per share, brings the total distribution for the year to 129p per share compared with 126p per share in 2014.
Directors
During the year Anil Mathur, Chris Ames and Peter Field resigned as directors of the company. I would like to
thank them all again for their contribution to the Group, and I am pleased that Peter Field will continue to
contribute as Chairman of our operations in India and Bangladesh.
Outlook
The outlook for 2016 is challenging. Climate change, and in particular erratic rainfall patterns, makes predicting
crop volumes difficult. The start of 2016 has seen record tea production in Kenya which has resulted in a
significant fall in the market price. The continuing low oil price provides a challenge to our engineering businesses
and low interest rates restrict returns in banking. However, the strength and diversity of our operations, the success
we have had in bringing in new management where appropriate, and the ongoing turnaround, sale or closure of
our loss making companies, all point to a more successful future.
Staff
As always, my thanks go out to all our staff for their efforts in 2015.
Malcolm Perkins
Chairman
27 April 2016
Chairman’s statement
240068 Camellia R&A pp01-pp14  27/04/2016  10:51  Page 5 Chief Executive’s Report
I am delighted to present to you my first report as Chief Executive. This year we are making significant additional
disclosures, which I hope will enhance shareholders understanding of the Group and its strategy. As is inevitable in
a Group of this size and diversity, there have been many performance highlights this year but also some areas of the
business which have found markets more challenging. 
Of particular note was the success of our operations in Kenya where a combination of good yields and improved
prices delivered significant additional profit. However, the introduction of new post-employment benefits
legislation in Bangladesh has meant that we have made a significant provision of £6.4 million this year against this
liability and the fall in the oil price hit our subsidiaries (AKD Engineering and AJT Engineering) in that sector
very hard. Unfortunately, the continuing weakness in the oil price and the resulting lack of orders for major capital
equipment from AKD Engineering meant that we had to close the company in July 2015. We also sold our
interest in Loddon Engineering, a Norfolk based stable manufacturer, to a subsidiary of the De Swart Group.
MANAGEMENT 
During the year we reviewed the management of the business. Camellia is diverse and complex in both its markets
and geographies and therefore having the right management in place is fundamental to driving performance. We
have made a number of changes to management and to reporting lines in order to increase skills, create clarity and
ensure proper accountability in the trading businesses. As a result the Group is now managed on a divisional rather
than geographic basis. A summary of the new structure together with the revised remit and membership of the
executive committees is set out in the corporate governance report.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Whilst the overall Group strategy, which is set out on page 15, remains unchanged, each division is now expected to
perform against an agreed divisional strategy which sets out the goals and targets for the short and medium term.
The divisional strategies may be summarised as follows:
Agriculture. The Agriculture division has an exceptional collection of high quality assets spread across a variety of
geographies and crops.  There are however certain crops where we have scale and geographic spread and therefore
the opportunity to build a significant market presence. These are tea, macadamia and avocados. Here we will
continue to expand the planted area, enlarge our geographic spread and where appropriate move up the value
chain to protect future margins. For the remaining crops, where developing a significant market presence is not
practicable but where there are opportunities for profitable investment, we will continue to acquire assets in line
with the broader Group strategy.
Banking and Financial Services. During the year, the Group performed a strategic review of Duncan Lawrie to
establish the best future path for the business. As a result of that review, the Group has approved a new growth
strategy to invest in, and expand, Duncan Lawrie. Key components of the new strategy include building the
banking operations by increasing both lending and deposits; growing the wealth management business by
substantially increasing the assets under management and investing in people and infrastructure to ensure a market
leading suite of products and services for our clients. This strategy will require, inter alia, further investment in the
business and we have relaxed certain lending restrictions previously imposed by the Group. 
I anticipate that the strategy will take a number of years to execute and I am pleased to report the appointment of Sally
T ennant as the new Chair of Duncan Lawrie, subject to the appropriate regulatory approval, to assist the management
team in implementing that strategy.
The Group also has three associated companies in the financial services sector, one of which, BF&M, is included
as an associate from 1 July 2015 following a purchase of additional shares by the Group and a reassessment of our
relationship with BF&M. The Group will continue to monitor its investments in these companies and may
increase or decrease its holdings as appropriate.
Engineering 
Engineering North. AJT Engineering has been a strongly profitable business for the Group in the past but is
currently impacted by the low oil price and its effect on investment in the North Sea oil industry. As a result, AJT
Engineering has had to amend its strategy so as to react to the new environment. This has included taking steps to
reduce costs and diversify its customer base. AJT Engineering remains committed to providing a full service to its
customers and anticipates emerging from the current hiatus strongly positioned for the future.

Chief Executive’s Report
Engineering South. The principal driver of growth in Engineering South will be Abbey Metal Finishing (Amfin)
and its joint venture in Germany, Atfin. Under its new management team, Amfin has taken significant steps in the
last 12 months to focus its customer base, improve its delivery performance and return to profitability. The plan is
to complete these steps during 2016 and for Amfin to provide the Group with a return on the significant
investments made since the fire in 2010. Atfin is taking steps to diversify its customer base and is now moving
towards profitability. 
The remaining businesses in Engineering South are expected to grow organically over the coming years.
Food Service 
UK. ACS&T will continue to operate as a niche high quality operator in the storage and distribution of frozen
foods together with some ambient food service provision as demand and space allows. The business will expand
and invest where appropriate to continue to serve the needs of its customers.
Netherlands. Affish and Wylax, our fish trading and distribution businesses in the Netherlands, have struggled to
grow in tough economic conditions. However, following the recent appointment of a new managing director and
sales director, these businesses are now looking to expand both their product offering and customer base.
Investments 
Investment Portfolio. The Group has a portfolio, principally of listed investments, under the management of a full
time investment manager. The strategy remains to invest for the long term in high quality companies where we
believe that there is hidden value.
Investment Property. The Group is disclosing for the first time this year the current market value of the investment
property portfolio (page 59). The strategy is to continue to invest in quality assets where an appropriate yield may
be realised.
Collections. The Group has collections of art, philately and manuscripts under the management of a curating team.
These assets are regularly reviewed and are added to or sold as appropriate in order to enhance the collections.

T ea pricing and operations
India
Average tea prices in 2015 were up 3.8% in Rupees against 2014 levels, reflecting particularly good performances
from our Assam teas, but costs of production were also up, reflecting labour rate increases which impacted
margins. A new blending and packing facility for export teas was commissioned in Kolkata during the year with an
annual capacity of approximately 4 million kgs per annum.
Packet tea sale volumes were up 13.6% on 2014 in this competitive but growing sector of the Indian local tea
market. Instant Tea production was down 25% on 2014 with prices also slightly down. During the year, a solar
water heating unit was installed at the plant in order to reduce energy costs.
Rainforest Alliance Certification was achieved on all Assam and Darjeeling estates along with FSSC 22000
certification in the factories; ISO 22000 certification was achieved for the Dooars’ factories.

Bangladesh
Pricing was up 11% on the previous year due to improved demand at auction and a resumption of high duty
tariffs on imported tea. 
A project to create capacity for irrigation on two gardens commenced during the second quarter having been
delayed as a result of political disturbances. Total replanting achieved in the year was 115 Ha leaving a total of 385
Ha under rehabilitation at the end of the year in preparation for future replanting.
Kenya
As a result of lower production volumes across Kenya as a whole, tea prices were up 35.7% from the previous
year’s levels. The market for Kenya teas is largely an export one and prices are subject to significant volatility linked
to production volumes. Fluctuations in the tea price have a major impact on Group profitability.
We continue to produce good quality hand plucked tea, and mechanical harvesting continues on a trial basis.
During 2015, we established our first large-scale solar project. Significant reductions in carbon emissions have
been achieved as well as a reduction in power costs. 
All the estates and smallholders remain Rainforest Alliance certified and all factories are ISO 22000 compliant. 
Malawi
In Malawi we experienced highly erratic weather conditions which had a significant adverse effect on crop
volumes. The operations experienced serious flooding following drought conditions at the start of the year and
then drought conditions re-emerged for most of the year thereafter.
Pricing in 2015 was up 3% on 2014 levels but costs per kg increased significantly due to the lower crop,
inflationary pressure through substantial currency devaluation and significant wage increases. These circumstances
contributed to a substantial decline in the profitability of the tea operations in 2015. 
The Tea Association of Malawi, of which we are a leading member, in conjunction with the Ethical Tea
Partnership, signed up to an extensive five-year revitalisation programme for the industry aimed at addressing
workers’ wages, smallholder sustainability, product quality and replanting. 
All estates and smallholders are Rainforest Alliance certified. All factories are Fairtrade certified and two factories
continued with UTZ certification.

Chief Executive’s Report
Macadamia Pricing
Pricing for macadamia in 2015 was up 15.3% on 2014 levels and set a record level for the global macadamia
kernel market due to continuing demand from China. 
Macadamia Operations
Malawi
Production of macadamia nuts was down 9.0% on the previous year due to the impact of dry weather conditions.
The processing facility once again achieved ISO 22000 certification.
South Africa
Volumes in 2015 were significantly ahead of last year. The development of Mambedi Estate to macadamia
orchards continues with 98 Ha planted in 2015. A further 80 Ha has been prepared for planting. The processing
factory successfully completed the first phase of upgrading to a modern state-of-the-art cracking facility. The plant
was also recertified under ISO 22000 for the 2015 season.
Kenya
New plantings continued with 158 Ha being planted in the year. Construction of a new cracking facility began in
April and good progress has been made to date. The facility is expected to open in June 2016.

Avocado Pricing and Operations
A record volume of 1.9 million cartons were exported: 17% up on 2014. The smallholder fruit volumes were
slightly lower than last year as a result of tight quality controls and lower availability of acceptably sized fruit.
Despite this, excellent returns were generated for growers from the fruit exported. The smallholder initiative
continues to gain momentum with the number of registered growers increasing each year. Pricing in 2015 was at
record levels (up 64% on 2014) as a result of demand from the European market.

Speciality Crops Pricing and Operations
Pricing for rubber in 2015 was 24.4% below 2014 due to the drop in oil prices making synthetic rubber more
price competitive than natural latex. There are also significant inventories of natural rubber building in South East
Asia which are contributing to the downward pressure on price.
Prices for California citrus were slightly up in the year. Reduced volumes in the year reflect the effect of the
decision to replace an area of mandarins with a different variety of citrus.
Both the maize and soya crops in Brazil sold at higher levels than anticipated.
Prices for fresh pineapple production in Kenya were marginally up.
Wine grape production in the Western Cape, South Africa was down 13% on last year but bottled wine
production and sale volumes were up. Results were in line with expectation although slightly down on the
previous year.
Pricing for pistachios in 2015 was 28% up on 2014 levels due to demand in the global market. 
Almond prices were also high but no contribution was attributed to Group profit in 2015 given the immature
nature of the trees. Revenues from almonds will be attributed to Group profit for 2016.
Forestry operations continued to produce satisfactory volumes for fuel wood and value addition products.
We continue to raise cattle on those areas of the Kakuzi Estate in Kenya unsuitable for crop development.
In total, the Agriculture division made a trading profit of £26.3 million (2014: £27.2 million) on turnover of
£186.5 million (2014: £164.2 million).
Banking and Financial Services
The low interest rate environment together with restrictions on lending imposed by the Group and costs
associated with adjusting to new regulatory requirements, have led to several years of losses at Duncan Lawrie. As a
result, the Group undertook a strategic review of the bank during the year, the result of which is the
implementation of the growth strategy described above. In 2015 the bank made losses which were significantly
above those incurred in 2014, reinforcing the need to execute the new strategy. These losses are likely to continue
into 2016 as the bank invests in clients, staff and systems.
Our two associated companies in Bangladesh, United Insurance and United Finance, both had a reasonable year
with profits marginally ahead of 2014.  
From 1 July 2015 we are accounting for BF&M, a Bermuda based insurance company, as an associate. BF&M had
a strong year in 2015 reporting a profit before tax of Bermudian Dollar 30.1 million (2014: Bermudian Dollar
26.7 million).
In total, the Banking and Financial Services division’s subsidiaries made a trading loss of £3.6m (2014: trading loss
£2.5m) on turnover of £13.1 million (2014: £12.4 million). In addition, our share of the results of associates
amounted to £4.2 million (2014: £1.1 million).
Engineering
Engineering North 
Engineering North had a difficult year with the fall in the oil price resulting in AJT Engineering in Aberdeen
struggling to fill its order book. T urnover at AJT Engineering fell from £12.0 million in 2014 to £9.6 million in
2015. In the current climate it is hard to predict the oil price and the impact that it may have on the industry in
Aberdeen and therefore the company is braced for another difficult year. 
Engineering South 
Engineering South had a transitional year with the sale and closure of Loddon Engineering and AKD Engineering
respectively, and new management teams appointed at Abbey Metal Finishing, Atfin and GU Cutting and
Grinding. The continuing turnaround at Abbey Metal Finishing and the disposal of the other loss making
businesses means that we anticipate a significantly improved performance in the coming year.
240068 Camellia R&A pp01-pp14  27/04/2016  10:51  Page 10 11
Chief Executive’s Report
In total, the Engineering division made a trading loss of £5.5 million (2014: trading loss £8.4 million) on turnover
of £24.1 million (£28.9 million). £4.3 million of the trading loss in 2015 related to AKD Engineering and
Loddon Engineering.
In addition, during the year we sold three properties and certain assets which were surplus to the requirements of
the Engineering division generating a net profit on sale of £3.7million (2014: nil).
Food Service
ACS&T had a better year than 2014 with turnover increasing by 7.5%, although the market remains competitive
in both the storage and distribution areas and as a result profits were marginally down. During the year we also
took possession of a new office building in Wolverhampton and implemented a new IT system at all our facilities
to manage logistics. In the Netherlands, both Affish and Wylax experienced challenging trading conditions. 
In total the Food Service division made a trading profit of £0.7 million (2014: £0.9 million) on turnover of
£31.9 million (2014: £30.9 million).
Investments
Investment Portfolio. Despite the significant fluctuations in both global equity and currency markets there was little
change in the value of the portfolio. The total value of the portfolio is £30.6 million (2014: £63.5 million)
reflecting the reclassification of our holding in BF&M as an associate.
Investment Property. The Group is disclosing for the first time this year the current market value of the investment
property portfolio (page 59). The Group took the opportunity during the year to acquire further land and
buildings at Linton Park. 
Collections.  The value of the collections is held at cost. A number of minor additions and disposals were made
during the year. 
LEGISLATIVE CHANGES
The Group is present in many jurisdictions, and is subject to local legislation. The following two issues either have
had, or are likely to have, a material impact on the Group.
� During 2015, a post-employment benefits law was introduced in Bangladesh entitling workers to a lump sum
payment on retirement or termination of employment based upon earnings and length of service. As a result
we have made a provision of £6.4 million to cover the potential liability of which £6.1 million relates to past
service costs.
� At the start of 2016, the Government of Malawi put forward new legislation which proposes, inter alia, the
conversion of all freehold property into 50 year leaseholds. The proposed legislation is under discussion and
has yet to be passed into law and many of the key provisions such as the costs of the leaseholds and the right
to renew leases are as yet unclear. The impact on the Group is therefore hard to assess at this time. 
DEVELOPMENT
During 2015 we continued to invest in the development of our assets and £19.4 million was spent on property,
plant and equipment and investment property (2014: £19.0 million) including the following key projects:
� Extension of the macadamia dehusking facility and the commencement of the building of the new macadamia
cracking plant in Kenya
� Phase 1 of the upgrading of the macadamia cracking facility in South Africa
� Improvements at four of our tea factories and to the packet tea and instant tea facilities
� Solar energy facilities in Kenya and India
� Significant irrigation projects across all of the agricultural operations 
� Construction of a new office building for ACS&T and an IT upgrade
240068 Camellia R&A pp01-pp14  27/04/2016  10:51  Page 11 Chief Executive’s Report
Camellia Plc
12
� Continuing improvement of our labour housing and facilities for our staff
� The acquisition of investment properties in the UK adjacent to our head office at Linton Park.
In addition to our continuous programme of replanting our tea areas, a programme to extend our planted areas
has been underway for a number of years and in 2015:
� 36 Ha of new avocado plantings were carried out in Kenya
� 158 Ha of new macadamia plantings were carried out in Kenya and 81 Ha in South Africa.
SUSTAINABILITY AND CSR
The Group has always had a strong focus on social and environmental responsibility and this is something we
intend to maintain and grow. The key aspects of that policy are set out on page 17.
The Group strives to develop the workforce through training and to improve housing, healthcare, and education
across the Group and in the communities that we work in.
This year we have been involved in the tea revitalisation project in Malawi, solar projects in India and Kenya, and have
embarked on major housing renewal projects in Malawi, Kenya and India. In addition, I am pleased to report that
every operating company in the UK has now been accredited by the Living Wage Foundation as a Living Wage
Employer.

Chief Financial Officer’s report
Overview of results
After taking account of the provision for past service costs relating to changes in Bangladesh to post-employment
benefit entitlements of £6.1 million, gains arising from changes in the fair value of biological assets of
£20.6 million (2014: £8.8 million), exceptional and other one off items, the profit before tax for the year to
31 December 2015 amounted to £40.5 million compared with £22.0 million in the previous year. 
The Group has net assets of £372.8 million (2014: £364.4 million) and net cash and cash equivalents of
£65.6 million (2014: £54.1 million), excluding balances relating to our banking operations.
Headline profit
The headline profit before tax for the year to 31 December 2015 was 39.0% higher than previous year at
£23.9 million (2014: £17.2 million). Headline profit is a measure of underlying performance which is not
impacted by exceptional and other items considered non-operational in nature and is designed to make clear the
underlying trading performance of the Group.
Accounting policies and practices
We increased our holding in BF&M to 36.1% during the year and, having reassessed our relationship, consider
that it is now appropriate to account for it as an associate company rather than as an available for sale financial
asset. This has resulted in our proportionate share of BF&M’s profit after tax for the period from 1 July 2015 of
£2.9 million being included in our results for the year instead of the dividends we received. 
Following further acquisition of property in the UK during 2015, our investment property holdings are now
shown as a separate asset class which continues to be carried at cost. In the interests of providing further clarity for
shareholders, the estimated market value is disclosed in note 18 to the financial statements.
Impact of changes to the accounting treatment of biological assets (IAS 41 amendments) 
This is the last year in which IAS 41 will be relevant to the majority of our agricultural operations and from
1 January 2016 our permanent plantings will be classified under IAS 16 as property, plant and equipment to be
depreciated over their expected useful life. If the new standard had applied to our 2015 results it would have had
the following estimated effect on our reported profits:
2015
£’m
Reported profit before tax 40.5
Exclude gain arising from changes in fair value of biological assets reclassified as bearer crops (18.7)
Depreciation of bearer plants (4.4)
Fair value adjustments for growing crop 2.6
––––––––
Restated 2015 profit before tax 20.0
––––––––
Currencies
The Group’s operations in Africa and Brazil have seen significant devaluation of their functional currencies during
the year. This together with the high rates of inflation in these countries places substantial pressure on our cost
base, particularly in Malawi. However, our operations in Africa benefit from the fact that the majority of their sales
are in hard currencies, typically US dollars or Euros, which provides some protection. Over the course of the year
to 31 December 2015, the Malawi Kwacha weakened by 35.7%, the Kenya Shilling by 6.5%, the South African
Rand by 26.5% and the Brazilian Real by 41.3% against Sterling.
Cashflow
The Group’s net cash position increased to £65.6 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: £54.1 million) (excluding
net cash balances held within our banking subsidiaries) reflecting strong net cash inflows from operations of £33.7
million (2014: inflow £7.9 million).

Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate of 45.9% (2014: 62.2%) reflects the continuing losses incurred in the UK which we
are currently unable to relieve against profits elsewhere in the Group. It also reflects a provision for taxation in
Malawi arising from assessments raised by the Malawi Revenue Authority for unpaid taxes from prior years. We
continue to be of the view that the claim is without technical merit. 
Pensions and post-employment benefits
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes, the largest of which is in the UK. The overseas
schemes are located in Bangladesh, India and the Netherlands. The UK scheme has been closed to new entrants
for a number of years and of our UK based work force, approximately 15% are members of this scheme. Our
businesses in Kenya, India and Bangladesh also have obligations to pay terminal gratuities, based on years of
service and, in some cases based on salaries.
Our employee benefit schemes currently show net deficits of £38.6 million (2014: £41.6 million net deficit).
Accounting for defined benefit schemes is prescribed by IAS 19 and the quantum of the deficit continues to be
volatile and sensitive to small changes in assumptions as regards inflation and gilt yields in the relevant
jurisdictions. This year a net actuarial gain of £9.1 million (net actuarial loss in 2014 of £20.3 million) is reflected
in the Statement of comprehensive income.
In addition, £8.4 million (2014: £1.0 million) has been charged to our income statement in respect of employee
benefit obligations. £6.4 million of the increase in cost relates to obligations for post-employment benefits arising
from recently enacted legislation in Bangladesh, of which £6.1 million relates to relevant employees service with
the Group in years prior to the current financial year. The cash flow impact of this legislation will arise over a
number of years as staff retire or otherwise leave the business. 
Contributions to the externally funded defined benefit schemes are determined after consultation with the
respective trustees and actuaries. In the UK, additional annual contributions of £0.9 million are being made to
reduce the scheme’s funding deficit.
Shareholders’ funds
Equity attributable to Camellia’s shareholders at the 2015 year end was £330.4 million (2014: £321.7 million).
A reconciliation is set out in the Group statement of changes in equity.

Business review
The company is required to set out in this report a fair review of the business of the Group during the year ended
31 December 2015 and a description of principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. A fair review of the
business of the Group is incorporated within the Chairman’s statement and the Chief Executive’s report on pages 5
to 12. The Chairman’s statement and the Chief Executive’s report, together with information contained within the
report of the directors, highlight the key factors affecting the Group’s development and performance. Other
matters are dealt with below:
Group strategy
The Board has adopted the following strategy for the Group:
� to develop a worldwide group of businesses requiring management to take a long term view
� the achievement of long-term shareholder returns through sustained and targeted investment
� investing in the environment and sustainability of the communities in which we do business
� ensuring that the quality and safety of our products and services meet the highest international standards
� the continuous refinement and improvement of the Group’s existing businesses using our internal expertise
and financial strength. 
The progress against this strategy during the year is set out in further detail in the Chief Executive’s report shown
on pages 6 to 12 and within the report of the directors.
Business model
The Group consists of businesses engaged in Agriculture, Banking and Financial Services, Engineering, Food
Service and Investment. Businesses are managed on a divisional basis with regular reports made to the Board on
performance against the annual budget.
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of possible risks and uncertainties that could impact the Group’s businesses. As the Group’s
businesses are widely spread both in terms of activity and location, it is unlikely that any one single factor could
have a material impact on the Group’s long-term performance. The following risks relating to the Group’s
principal operations have been identified:
Agriculture
The Group’s agricultural based businesses are located in Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Bangladesh, India, Brazil
and the USA. The success of these activities is greatly dependent on climatic conditions, controlling plant disease,
the cost of labour and the market price. We export a considerable amount of produce through the port of
Mombasa in Kenya. Such exports can be seriously delayed by inefficiencies in the operation of the port. In
addition, exports from these businesses are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations as products, particularly those
from Africa, are normally priced in US dollars or Euros.
In Kenya, Malawi and South Africa there are long-term political issues concerning land ownership over which the
Group has little control or influence. The Board continues to work with local management and with the assistance
of lawyers to monitor land ownership issues that may impact the Group’s operations. In Kenya, the length of the
leases owned by non-Kenyan citizens and corporations has been reduced from 999 years to 99 years in accordance
with the new constitution. In South Africa, on land where ownership claims have been made, any substantiated
claim is required to be resolved on a willing buyer willing seller basis and crops are generally only planted
following notification to the Land Claims Commission. In Malawi, a bill is currently being debated in the
parliament on the foreign ownership of land which could see the freehold land interest being converted to 50 year
leasehold.
In India, violence from separatist Groups which has been a problem for some years has reduced in Assam, Darjeeling
and the Dooars. In Bangladesh, there have been instances of civil unrest and political instability. The situation
continues to be monitored and the Group’s operations in these regions have generally been able to trade normally.

A fourth consecutive year of drought in California brought about a state imposed 25% reduction in water usage
by urban consumers. Ground and surface water resources remain scarce and continue to decline, imposing a
challenge to management to ensure sufficient water resources are made available for the crops. This was achieved
in 2015 because of our investment in irrigation infrastructure over several years, but remains a concern for the
future.
Engineering
A number of the engineering companies are dependent for a significant part of their revenue on the aerospace and
the oil and gas industries. As we saw in 2015, a downturn in either of these sectors would have and has had an
impact on the level of activity in these businesses.
Some of the processes used by the companies involved in metal treatment require high standards of health and
safety and environmental management. Failure to maintain these standards could give rise to accidents or
environmental damage.
Food Service
Food Service is a highly competitive industry with low operating margins and is largely dependent on the food
industry for the utilisation of cold stores.
Cold stores are heavy users of electricity and any significant movement in energy costs can affect the operation’s
profitability.
ACS&T is dependent upon a sophisticated computer system. The failure of this system could have significant
consequences for the business although a disaster recovery plan is in place. 
Banking and Financial Services
Duncan Lawrie Limited is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation
Authority (PRA) and has a well-developed compliance process. The following risks have been identified:
� compliance risk – the FCA and the PRA have the power to stop trading activity should there be a serious
breach of their regulations. Following the global banking crisis, there have been continual moves by the
authorities to tighten regulatory standards and this may lead to a requirement for further capital to be invested
in Duncan Lawrie
� credit risk – the lending of money gives rise to a credit risk. Duncan Lawrie lends money to customers and
places money with other banks and holds interest bearing securities. This credit risk is managed by strict
internal procedures
� liquidity, interest and foreign exchange rate risk – these risks are monitored closely and reported upon daily
against conservative exposure limits. 
Bank failures in the jurisdictions within which Duncan Lawrie operates can also impact its results as a consequence
of industry wide compensation schemes to which it is required to contribute.
Further information on the Group’s financial risks are disclosed in note 39 of the accounts.
Investments
The Group owns a number of investments including listed investments. The value of these investments is therefore
likely to fluctuate in line with global stock market movements.
Pension schemes
There is one final salary scheme in the UK which is closed to new entrants and permits an element of future
accrual for existing members in the defined benefit section. A material proportion of the assets of the scheme are
invested in equities and the value of these assets will fluctuate in line with global equity markets. Continuing
improvements in mortality rates may also increase the liabilities of the scheme.
The Group’s overseas subsidiaries make pension provision for certain employees in accordance with relevant local
legislation. Some risk remains if there are changes to the governing legislation, requiring the companies to make
larger contributions to these schemes. Some of these pension plans are final salary based and not fully funded. 
Strategic report
240068 Camellia R&A pp15-pp32  27/04/2016  11:05  Page 16 17
Credit Risk
Credit control procedures are in place throughout the Group but the risk remains that some customers may have
difficulty making payments.
Social and environmental responsibility
Background
The Group has a wide range of businesses operating around the world in diverse commercial, cultural and
regulatory environments. These businesses encompass a correspondingly wide spectrum of employment and
environmental issues and our main challenge is to ensure that these are appropriately managed across the Group.
The Group’s businesses have a duty to meet local regulatory requirements and will always strive to do so. In this
respect, there is a distinction between our UK businesses and our agricultural businesses based mostly in
developing countries. Whilst the UK businesses are subject to well-developed regulatory regimes in the areas of
employment and environmental protection, this is not necessarily the case elsewhere. Our agricultural businesses
meet the standards expected by the Group, local legislation and by our customers.
Particular challenges and opportunities for the Group lie in the following areas:
Child labour: the use of child labour is prohibited by all of our businesses. The minimum legal working age varies
around the world and in some countries it is both the cultural norm and permissible for parents to involve their
children in the productive process. We do not subscribe to this approach and therefore translating our policy into
unambiguous local rules and enforcing these rules requires vigilance.
Health and safety: Our European and North-American businesses operate in a strong regulatory climate, and have a
good health and safety culture and record. Achieving equivalent standards of health and safety management in our
operations in some developing countries is a continuing challenge however improvements have been achieved
during the year.
Medical care and education: In some countries, our workers and their children do not have access to good state
provision of medical or educational services. However, the majority of our tea estates in India and Bangladesh have
a hospital and a qualified doctor and our operations in both these countries have central Group hospitals to which
more serious illnesses are referred. A number of our African businesses report a high incidence of HIV/AIDS
related illnesses. We provide, as a minimum, basic medical services including where appropriate antiretroviral
drugs. We also give support to schools that are either run locally or by our companies.
Casual labour: Some of our agricultural businesses rely on seasonal labour, notably at harvest time. Our
agricultural companies give casual and contract workers employment rights in accordance with the requirements of
local legislation.
Environmental management: Our UK-based engineering businesses have the greatest potential to create pollution
and hazardous waste and need to meet tight legislative standards. Where appropriate, our UK businesses have
formal environmental management systems in place and most are independently certified to the international
standard ISO 14001. The enforcement of environmental legislation in many countries where we operate is poor and
our businesses in these locations have to act on their own initiative to meet international standards of environmental
protection. Our agricultural businesses carry out activities that could impact the environment. These businesses
have adopted rigorous procedures to reduce the environmental impact of the operations.

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
Our emissions have been calculated based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. Emissions reported
correspond with our financial year.
Our approach
We believe that good management of employment and environmental issues is essential in ensuring the long-term
success of our businesses. We are therefore committed to devoting the necessary resources to improve continually
our performance in these areas.
The Group has a corporate social responsibility policy which is available on the company’s website.
The Board has adopted an anti-bribery policy which complies with the requirements of the Bribery Act 2010. The
policy has been introduced across the Group and its implementation is being monitored. The Board does not
permit bribery as part of its business practices.
The Board is currently devising a policy to comply with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 which
will be in place by the end of 2016.
Performance
There are no current employment or environmental issues that prejudice the continuing development of the
Group. None of the Group’s businesses were prosecuted for any significant breach of employment legislation
during the year. The Board has established a process for ensuring that the corporate social responsibility policy is
enforced across the Group.

Key financial performance indicators
Return on segmental assets
The nature of the Group’s principal activities is such that the Board takes a long-term view on its operations,
particularly in Agriculture. It is also concerned to improve the quality of the Group’s assets over the long-term and
monitors that by reference to return on net assets achieved in the main segments of the business which are then
compared against budget. The returns achieved in the current and prior year were as follows:
Banking and
Agriculture Financial Services Engineering Food Service
2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014
Return on segmental net assets (%) 9.9 10.4 n/a n/a n/a n/a 4.0 5.5
Group borrowings ratio
The Board’s objective is to ensure that gross borrowings as a percentage of tangible net assets do not exceed 50 per
cent. The ratio at 31 December 2015 was 3.3% (2014: 0.9%).
Gross borrowings and tangible net assets (share capital and reserves less goodwill and intangible assets) are derived
from the consolidated accounts.

Statement of compliance
This statement describes how the company applies the main principles of UK Corporate Governance Code 2014
(“the Code”). In implementing the Code, the directors have taken account of the company’s size and structure and
the fact that there is a controlling shareholder. At the time of the company’s delisting from the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange and admission to trading on AIM in September 2014, it was stated that the Board did
not envisage that there would be any significant alteration to the standards of reporting and governance which the
company maintained at that time. AIM companies are not required to comply with the requirements of the Code.
However, the Board has chosen to follow the Code for the year to 31 December 2015.
The Group consists of a portfolio of businesses which are grouped into independently managed divisions. These
divisions report into the Board by function against a variety of metrics including budgets and business plans.
The Board
The Board currently comprises seven directors, three of whom are independent non-executive directors. The
remaining directors are executive directors, including the executive Chairman. Chris Relleen, the Deputy
Chairman, has been designated as the senior independent director. The names and brief biographical details of
each director appear on pages 22 and 23.
There is on-going dialogue between the Chairman and the majority shareholder whose views are reported to the
Board. The company is also in contact with other significant shareholders.
The Board has established a remuneration committee, audit committee and nomination committee. Terms of
reference of each of the committees can be viewed on the company’s website.
The Board undertook a performance evaluation during the year by way of an internal review.
The Board is responsible for managing the Group’s business and has adopted a schedule of matters reserved for its
approval. The schedule is reviewed annually and covers, inter alia, the following areas:
� Strategy 
� Acquisitions and disposals 
� Financial reporting and control 
� Internal controls

Principal responsibilities
The principal responsibilities of the audit committee are set out below and were undertaken during the year:
� to review and monitor the financial statements of the company and the audit of those statements – to monitor
compliance with relevant financial reporting requirements and legislation 
� to monitor the effectiveness and independence of the external auditor 
� to review effectiveness of the Group’s internal control system. The committee regularly reviews the
effectiveness of internal audit activities carried out by the company’s Group accounting function and senior
management 
� to review non-audit services provided by the external auditors.
Significant issues in relation to financial statements
The audit committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether management
has made appropriate estimates and judgements. In the year under review, the audit committee considered the
following significant matters in relation to the financial statements:
Biological assets – One of the key areas of judgment that the committee considered in reviewing the financial
statements was the valuation of biological assets in accordance with IAS 41. Valuations are carried out by external
professional valuers or are based on discounted cash flows. These were agreed for consistency of approach and
assumptions agreed as reasonable. For more details see note 19 to the accounts.
Pensions – A key area of judgment is in relation to the value of the pension scheme obligation. Whilst this is
conducted by independent expert actuaries, the size of the obligation means that a relatively minor difference in
the assumptions could result in a material change in the obligation. The committee considered the competence of
the actuaries and the assumptions adopted and concluded that the work performed is sufficient to support the
value.
Goodwill and intangibles – The value of goodwill and intangibles is inherently complex and relies on judgment
and estimation. The committee consider the performance of the underlying assets and their ability to continue to
support the carrying value. As a result, the committee is satisfied that the carrying value is supported.
External auditors
To assess the effectiveness of the external audit process, the external auditor is required to report to the audit
committee and confirm their independence in accordance with ethical standards and that they had maintained
appropriate internal safeguards to ensure their independence and objectivity. In addition to the steps taken by the
Board to safeguard auditor objectivity, PricewaterhouseCoopers operates a five year rotation policy for audit
partners for a listed entity.
The company’s external audit was last tendered in 2009, which resulted in a change to PricewaterhouseCoopers at
that point. The audit committee is currently undertaking a review of the Group’s external audit requirements
following a change in the rules on audit rotation in India. The outcome of the review will be announced in due
course.
The committee reviewed those non-audit services provided by the external auditor and satisfied itself that the scale
and nature of those services were such that the external auditors objectivity and independence were safeguarded.
The committee confirms that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s performance,
business model and strategy.

Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is chaired by William Gibson and the other member is Chris Relleen.
The responsibilities of the committee include:
� the review of the Group’s policy relating to remuneration of the chairman, executive directors and the
company secretary
� to determine the terms of employment and remuneration of the chairman, executive directors and company
secretary with a view to ensuring that those individuals are fairly but responsibly rewarded 
� to approve compensation packages or arrangements following the severance of any executive director’s
service contract.
The remuneration report appears on pages 30 to 32.
Insurance
The company purchases insurance to cover its directors in respect of legal actions against them in their capacity as
directors of the company. The level of cover is currently £20 million. All directors have access to independent
professional advice at the company’s expense.
Share capital structure
The share capital of the Group is set out in note 34.
Internal control and risk management systems
The directors acknowledge that they are responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control. During
the year, the audit committee, on behalf of the Board, reviewed the effectiveness of the framework of the Group’s
system of internal control, the principal features of which are described below.
Decentralisation is a key management philosophy with responsibility for efficient day to day operations delegated
to local management. Accountability and delegation of authority are clearly defined with regular communication
between Group head office and local management. The performance of each company is continually monitored
centrally including a critical review of annual budgets, forecasts and monthly sales, profits and cash reports.
Financial results and key business statistics and variances from approved plans are carefully monitored. Senior
management regularly visit and review the Group’s operating units. However, any system of internal control can
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material mis-statement or loss.

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial
year. Under that law the directors have prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of both the Group and the parent company and of the profit or loss of
the Group and company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently 
� make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent 
� state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements 
� prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company
and the Group  and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors’ remuneration report
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the Group and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In addition, each of the directors considers that the annual report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s performance,
business model and strategy.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information
included on the company’s website.

This report is drawn up in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the AIM Rules for Companies.
Remuneration committee
Details of the remuneration committee (“the committee”) are set out on page 28.
Policy on directors’ remuneration
In determining remuneration policy and the remuneration of directors, full consideration has been given to the
relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014. The committee seeks to provide remuneration
packages that will attract, retain and motivate the best possible person for each position. The committee also
wishes to align the interests of executives with shareholders. The Group’s activities are based largely on agriculture,
which is highly dependent on factors outside management control (e.g. weather and market prices for our
produce), and this is a significant consideration as to why the company does not operate profit related bonus,
share option or share incentive schemes for directors.
The remuneration policy for executives reflects the overriding remuneration philosophy and principles of the
wider Group. When determining the remuneration policy and arrangements for directors, the committee
considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group to ensure that pay structures are appropriately
aligned and that levels of remuneration remain appropriate in this context. The remuneration policy, approved by
shareholders at the AGM held on 5 June 2014, took effect from the date of that AGM and will be applied for a
period of three years until the AGM in 2017. This policy takes into account any views of the shareholders
expressed to the committee on directors’ remuneration.
At the AGM on 4 June 2015, the remuneration report for the year to 31 December 2014 was approved by
shareholders with 99.97% of the votes cast in favour, 0.02% of the votes cast against and 0.01% of the votes withheld.
Service contracts
Malcolm Perkins, Tom Franks, Graham Mclean and Susan Walker are each employed on rolling service contracts. 
Director Date of Service Contract
Malcolm Perkins 25 April 2002
Tom Franks 8 April 2015
Graham Mclean 10 April 2015
Susan Walker 14 April 2015
The service contracts are terminable at any time by a one year period of notice from the company or the director.
Following their initial appointment non-executive directors may seek re-election by shareholders at each
subsequent annual general meeting. Non-executive directors do not have service agreements. There are no specific
contractual provisions for compensation upon early termination of a non-executive director’s employment. The
remuneration committee reviews salaries annually and will seek independent professional advice when appropriate.

Statement of changes in equity

Accounting policies
40
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have
been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
as adopted by the EU, IFRS IC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis as modified by the revaluation of
biological assets, available-for-sale investments, financial assets and financial liabilities.
Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with changes in presentation in the current year.
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the group
have adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future. They therefore continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the
company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the
cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of
acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income
statement in the period of acquisition. The group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis, at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree's identifiable net assets. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the
effective date of acquisition or disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line
with those used by the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control,
through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of that entity.
Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Under this method the group's share of the
post-acquisition profits or losses of associates is recognised in the income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements
in reserves is recognised in reserves. 
Foreign currency translation
T ransactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. T ranslation differences on non-monetary items carried at fair value
are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement,
except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary items where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is the company's functional and presentation currency.
On consolidation, income statements and cash flows of foreign entities are translated into pounds sterling at average exchange
rates for the year and their balance sheets are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange
differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings designated as hedges of such
investments, are taken to equity. When a foreign entity is sold such exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
240068 Camellia R&A pp40-pp48  27/04/2016  10:53  Page 40 Accounting policies
41
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate ruling on the date of acquisition. The group has elected to treat goodwill and
fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the date of the group's transition from UK GAAP to
IFRS, as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, value added tax and other sales related taxes and after
eliminating intra-group sales. 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisfied: 
(i) the group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods:
(ii) the group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective
control over the goods sold;
(iii) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
(iv) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and
(v) the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Invoices are raised when goods are despatched or when the risks and rewards of ownership otherwise irrevocably pass to
the customer.
In respect of food storage and distribution services, revenue for handling is recognised at the point that the goods are
actually handled.
In respect of engineering services, revenue is recognised based upon the stage of completion and includes costs incurred to date,
plus accrued profits.
In respect of banking and financial services, fees and commissions are generally recognised on an accrual basis when the service
has been provided.
Investment income
Investment income is recognised when the right to receive payment of a dividend is established.
Segmental reporting
The adoption of IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports used to assess performance
and allocate resources by the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the
Strategy Group led by the CEO. Inter segment sales are not significant.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full
understanding of the group's financial performance. Full disclosure of exceptional items are set out in notes 6, 7 and 8.
Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the group's interest in the fair value of
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not
subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or
loss on disposal.

Accounting policies
42
(ii) Identifiable intangible assets 
Identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships and other intangible assets acquired on the acquisition of
subsidiaries. Acquired intangible assets with finite lives are initially recognised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over
their estimated useful lives, not exceeding 20 years. Intangible assets' estimated lives are re-evaluated annually and an
impairment test is carried out if certain indicators of impairment exist.
(iii) Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific
software. Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over 3 to 7 years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group and which are
expected to generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as an intangible asset and amortised
over their estimated useful lives.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings comprises mainly factories and offices. All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent
depreciation and impairment, except for land, which is shown at cost less impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to the acquisition of these assets.
On transition to IFRS, the group followed the transitional provisions and elected that previous UK GAAP revaluations be
treated as deemed cost. 
Subsequent costs are included in the assets' carrying amount, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated
with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to
the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Depreciation of other property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off
their cost less residual value over their expected useful lives.
The rates of depreciation used for the other assets are as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings nil to 10 per cent. per annum
Other short leasehold land and buildings unexpired term of the lease
Plant, machinery, fixtures, fittings and equipment 4 to 33 per cent. per annum
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or, where
shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset and is included in the income statement.
Investment properties
Properties held to earn rental income rather than for the purpose of the group’s principal activities are classified as Investment
properties. Investment properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. The
depreciation policy is consistent with those described for other group properties.
Income from investment properties is disclosed in ‘Revenue’. The related operating costs are immaterial and are included
within administrative expenses. 
240068 Camellia R&A pp40-pp48  27/04/2016  10:53  Page 42 Accounting policies
43
Biological assets
Biological assets are measured at each balance sheet date at fair value. Any changes in fair value are recognised in the income
statement in the year in which they arise. The basis under which fair value is determined for the group’s biological assets are
described below:
Tea and rubber are generally valued at each year end by independent professional valuers. The valuations take into account
assumptions about the expected life span of plantings, yields, selling prices and sales of similar assets. 
Costs of new areas planted are included as “new planting additions” in the biological assets note. Growing costs for tea and
rubber are accounted for as a cost of inventory in the year in which they are incurred. The group does not recognise the fair
value of harvested green leaf within cost of sales in the income statement. The increase in value is in effect offset against the fair
value movement in biological assets. 
Annually harvested agricultural assets such as edible nuts, citrus and avocados are generally valued on the basis of net present
values of expected future cash flows from those assets, discounted at appropriate pre-tax rates and including certain assumptions
about expected life span of the plantings, yields, selling prices, costs and discount rates. Growing costs incurred during the year
are treated as “capitalised cultivation costs” in biological assets. As the crop is harvested and sold these accumulated costs are
shown as “decrease due to harvesting” in biological assets and charged to cost of sales in the income statement.
Timber is valued on the basis of expected future cash flows from scheduled harvesting dates, discounted at appropriate pre-tax
rates and including certain assumptions about expected life span, yields, selling prices, costs and discount rates. Growing costs
incurred during the year are treated as “new planting additions” in biological assets. As the trees are harvested the value
accumulated to date of harvest is treated as “decrease due to harvesting” and charged to cost of sales in the income statement.
Agricultural crops such as soya and maize are valued at estimated selling price less future anticipated costs. Growing costs
incurred during the year are treated as “capitalised cultivation costs” in biological assets. As the crops are harvested the value
accumulated to date of harvest is treated as “decrease due to harvesting” and charged to cost of sales in the income statement.
Financial assets
The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: loans and receivables, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
These are classified as non-current assets. The group’s loans and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and
cash equivalents’ in the balance sheet. 
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the
other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it
within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that
the group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Were the group to sell other than an
insignificant amount of held-to-maturity assets, the entire category would be tainted and reclassified as available-for-sale.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date, the date on which the group commits to
purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets. Financial
assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the
group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value. Available-for-sale financial assets include shares of listed
and unlisted companies. The fair values of listed shares are based on current bid values. Shares in unlisted companies are
measured at cost as fair value cannot be reliably measured. 
Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in other
comprehensive income. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments
recognised in equity are included in the income statement as ‘Profit/(loss) on disposal of available-for-sale investments’.
240068 Camellia R&A pp40-pp48  27/04/2016  10:53  Page 43 Camellia Plc
Accounting policies
44
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement as part of investment income when
the group’s right to receive payments is established.
Loans and receivables and held to maturity investments are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously.
Other investments – heritage assets
Other investments comprise fine art, documents, manuscripts and philately which are measured at cost as fair value cannot be
reliably measured.
Investments in subsidiary companies
Investments in subsidiary companies are included at cost plus incidental expenses less any provision for impairment.
Impairment reviews are performed by the directors when there has been an indication of potential impairment.
Impairment of financial assets
(i) Assets carried at amortised cost
The group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of
financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset
(a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of
financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
For the loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount
and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at
the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event
occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the
previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
(ii) Assets classified as available-for-sale
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the
security below its cost is also evidence that the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial
assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any
impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss is removed from equity and recognised in profit or
loss. Impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the
consolidated income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale
increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or
loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever
events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to
amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets' carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets' fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows
(cash-generating units).

45
Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified
as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of fair value and the estimated present
value of the underlying lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to
achieve a constant rate of interest on the finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance
charges, are included in liabilities. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease
period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and
the lease term.
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories
Agricultural produce included within inventory largely comprises stock of 'black' tea. This is valued at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. Cost includes the growing costs of ‘green leaf’ up to the date of harvest and factory costs incurred to bring the
tea to its manufactured state. 
In accordance with IAS 41, on initial recognition, agricultural produce is required to be measured at fair value less estimated
point of sale costs. Given that there is no open market for green leaf, this is recognised in inventory at the lower of cost or net
realisable value. 
Other inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable,
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and
condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less
all estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Trade and other receivables
T rade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. A provision for
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all
amounts due according to the original terms. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts due from customers of banking subsidiaries consist of loans and receivables which are non-derivative financial assets
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the bank provides money, goods
or services directly to a customer with no intention of trading the receivable and are carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current
liabilities on the balance sheet. In respect of the group's banking operation, cash and cash equivalents include cash and
non-restricted balances with central banks, treasury bills and other eligible bills, loans and advances to banks, amounts due
from other banks and short-term government securities.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for
immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Trade payables
T rade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are
presented as non-current liabilities.

Accounting policies
46
T rade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis
to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The group liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for
using the liability method. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction, other than in a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable
profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related tax asset is realised or the tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the
temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is
an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing
of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Employee benefits
(i) Pension obligations
Group companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes are funded through payments to insurance companies or
trustee-administered funds. The group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund. The group
has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions to the fund. Contributions are recognised as an expense in
the income statement when they are due.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement,
usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The pension cost for defined benefit
schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified independent actuaries using the “projected unit” funding method.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined
benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. Independent actuaries calculate the obligation
annually using the "projected unit" funding method. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and
changes in actuarial adjustments are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, they are not recognised in the income
statement and are presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service costs are recognised directly in the income statement.
240068 Camellia R&A pp40-pp48  27/04/2016  10:53  Page 46 Accounting policies
47
(ii) Other post-employment benefit obligations
Some group companies have unfunded obligations to pay terminal gratuities to employees. Provisions are made for the
estimated liability for gratuities as a result of services rendered by employees up to the balance sheet date and any movement in
the provision is recognised in the income statement.
The estimated monetary liability for employees' accrued annual leave entitlement at the balance sheet date is recognised as
an accrual.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
The provision for onerous lease commitments is based on the expected vacancy period.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any group company purchases the company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including
any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the company’s equity
holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net
of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to
the company’s equity holders. 
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the group’s financial statements in the period
in which the dividends are approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting will, by definition, seldom equal
the actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are set out below.
(i) Impairment of assets
The group has significant investments in intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, biological assets, associated
companies and other investments. These assets are tested for impairment when circumstances indicate there may be a potential
impairment. Factors considered which could trigger an impairment review include the significant fall in market values,
significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a major change in market conditions or
negative cash flows.
(ii) Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation is based on management estimates of the future useful life of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets. Estimates may change due to technological developments, competition, changes in market conditions and
other factors and may result in changes in the estimated useful life and in the depreciation and amortisation charges.
(iii) Biological assets
Biological assets are carried at fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs.  Where meaningful market-determined prices do not
exist to assess the fair value of biological assets, the fair value has been determined based on the net present value of expected
future cash flows from those assets, discounted at appropriate pre-tax rates. In determining the fair value of biological assets
where the discounting of expected future cash flows has been used, the directors have made certain assumptions about expected
life-span of the plantings, yields, selling prices, costs and discount rates. 
240068 Camellia R&A pp40-pp48  27/04/2016  10:53  Page 47 Camellia Plc
Accounting policies
48
(iv) Retirement benefit obligations
Pension accounting requires certain assumptions to be made in order to value obligations and to determine the impact on the
income statement. These figures are particularly sensitive to assumptions for discount rates, mortality, inflation rates and
expected long-term rates of return on assets. Details of assumptions made are given in note 33.
(v) Taxation
The group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining worldwide provisions
for taxes. There are many transactions and calculations during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain.
(vi) Identifiable intangible assets – customer relationships
As described in note 16, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets relating to customer relationships acquired are valued using
industry average multiples of assets under management, with the assumption being made that the nature of the group's assets
under management are not dissimilar from industry averages and therefore will be valued in a similar manner. The valuation
technique used is therefore sensitive to this assumption.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(i) New and amended standards adopted by the group
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations with a material impact on the group for the year ended
31 December 2015.
(ii) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted
early by the group
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the group’s
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 or later periods, but the group has not adopted them early:
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statement. None of these is expected
to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group, except the following set out below:
IAS 16 and IAS 41 (amendments) Reporting for bearer plants- effective from 1 January 2016
These amendments change the reporting for bearer plants, such as tea bushes, avocados,
macadamia and rubber trees. Bearer plants should be accounted for under IAS 16 in the
same way as property, plant and equipment because their operation is similar to that of
manufacturing. The produce on bearer plants will remain in the scope of IAS 41. This
standard has been  endorsed by the EU with an effective date of 1 January 2016. This will
have a material impact on the results of the group, the impact of which is illustrated on
page 13.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers – effective from 1 January 2018
This standard will replace IAS 18 which covers contracts for good and services and IAS 11
which covers construction contracts. The new standard is based on the principle that
revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer – so the
notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards. The standard permits a
modified retrospective approach for the adoption. Under this approach entities will
recognise transitional adjustments in retained earnings on the date of initial application
(eg 1 January 2018), ie without restating the comparative period. They will only need to
apply the new rules to contracts that are not completed as of the date of initial application.
At this stage, the group is not able to estimate the impact of the new rules on the financial
statements. This standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.

4 Headline profit
The group seeks to present an indication of the underlying performance which is not impacted by exceptional items or
items considered non-operational in nature. This measure of profit is described as ‘headline’ and is used by management to
measure and monitor performance.
The following items have been excluded from the headline measure and have been separately disclosed:
– Provision for past service costs in Bangladesh.
– Exceptional items, including profit and losses from disposal of non-current assets and available-for-sale investments and
impairments of non-current assets.
– Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of biological assets, which are a non-cash item, and the directors
believe should be excluded to give a better understanding of the group’s underlying performance.
– Financing income and expense relating to retirement benefits.
5 Share of associates’ results
The group’s share of the results of associates is analysed below:

–––––––––– ––––––––––
Following a re-evaluation of the group’s relationship with BF&M Limited (note 22), six months of the group’s share of
BF&M’s result for the period ending 31 December 2015 have been included in the above results. In addition,
£22,677,000 has been credited to the income statement which reflected the negative goodwill arising from the recognition
of BF&M Limited as an associate, this has been offset by an impairment provision of £22,677,000 which has been
provided against the group’s equity carrying value of this investment to reflect its fair value. The net effect of these two
items on the income statement is £nil.
6 Impairment of available-for sale financial assets
Impairment provisions of £279,000 (2014: £2,334,000) and £237,000 (2014: £nil) have been made against the group’s
investments in Ascendant Group, a Bermudian power company and Bermuda Press Holdings, a Bermudian newspaper
publishing and commercial printing company respectively, following significant long-term declines in the value of
these investments.
7 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and provisions
Following the closure of AKD Engineering Limited in June 2015 and the subsequent sale of the property, plant and
equipment, the provisions made in 2014 have now been utilised resulting in a £230,000 credit of excess amounts. In
2014, a total provision of £1,134,000 was made, which included a £824,000 impairment provision against property, plant
and equipment and £310,000 of provisions including £267,000 in relation to an onerous lease.
8 Profit on disposal of non-current assets 
A profit of £1,613,000 was realised in relation to the property, plant and equipment previously owned by AKD
Engineering Limited which was sold following the closure of the business  at the end of June 2015.
Profit of £2,074,000 was realised during the year in relation to the disposal of former sites owned by Abbey Metal
Finishing Company Limited and GU Cutting and Grinding Services Limited.

Impairment testing
Timing of impairment testing
The group’s impairment test in respect of goodwill and customer relationships allocated to each component of the cash-
generating unit (‘CGU’) is performed as at 31 December each year. In line with the accounting policy, impairment testing
is also performed whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. There was no indication of impairment
in the year to 31 December 2015. For the purpose of this impairment testing, the group’s CGU components represent the
wealth management element of the holistic private banking service provided by Duncan Lawrie.
Basis of the recoverable amount – value in use or fair value less costs to sell
The recoverable amount of the CGU to which customer relationships and goodwill have been allocated was assessed at
each respective testing date in 2015 and 2014. The wealth management component of the CGU is assessed on the basis of
the fair value less costs to sell by applying industry average multiples to the value of assets under management.
Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date, a change in any of the key assumptions described above would not cause
an impairment to be recognised in respect of goodwill and customer relationships. The industry multiple applied would
have to reduce to 1 per cent. before any impairment of goodwill or customer relationships would arise.

Biological assets are carried at fair value. Where meaningful market-determined prices do not exist to assess the fair value
of biological assets, the fair value has been determined based on the net present value of expected future cash flows from
those assets, discounted at appropriate pre-tax rates. At 31 December 2015 professional valuations were obtained on a
significant proportion of assets. In determining the fair value of biological assets where the discounting of expected future
cash flows has been used, the directors have made certain assumptions about the expected life-span of the plantings, yields,
selling prices and costs. The fair value of livestock is based on market prices of livestock of similar age and sex.
New planting additions represents new areas planted to the particular crop at cost.
For crops other than tea and rubber capitalised cultivation costs represent annual growing costs incurred. Growing costs
for tea and rubber are charged directly to inventory which are included in cost of sales and do not include any uplift on
initial recognition as no appropriate market value can be determined  for green leaf and rubber produced at harvest prior
to manufacturing.
Decreases due to harvesting represent values transferred to cost of sales at the point of harvest for agricultural produce
other than tea and rubber.

During the year the Malawian kwacha depreciated in value from 725.05 (2014: 712.19) to the pound sterling at
1 January 2015 to 984.22 (2014: 725.05) to the pound sterling at 31 December 2015. The functional currency of our
Malawian subsidiaries is the kwacha. The principal assets in Malawi are agricultural assets. As they generate revenues in
currencies other than the kwacha their value in hard currency has not fallen in the year. Accordingly, the revaluation of the
agricultural assets in kwacha under IAS 41 at 31 December 2015 has generated a credit of £17,917,000
(2014: £6,546,000) including a gain of £16,220,000 (2014: £978,000) due to the currency devaluation which is included
in the overall gain of £20,639,000 (2014: £8,820,000) credited to the income statement. This has been largely offset by a
foreign exchange translation loss charged to reserves. 
Fair value measurement
All of the biological assets fall under level 3 of the hierarchy defined in IFRS 13.
The basis upon which the valuations are determined is set out in accounting policies on page 43.
Valuations by external professional valuers and those derived from discounted cash flows both make assumptions based on
unobservable inputs of: yields, an increase in which will raise the value; costs, an increase in which will decrease the value;
market prices, an increase in which will raise the value; life span of the plantings, an increase in which will raise the value;
discount rates, an increase in which will decrease the value. These assumptions vary significantly across different countries,
crops and varieties. In preparing these valuations a long term view is taken on the yields and prices achieved.
Financial risk management strategies
The group is exposed to financial risks arising from changes in the prices of the agricultural products it produces. The
group does not anticipate that these prices will decline significantly in the foreseeable future. There are no futures markets
available for the majority of crops grown by the group. The group’s exposure to this risk is mitigated by the geographical
spread of its operations, selective forward selling in certain instances when considered appropriate, and regular review of
available market data on sales and production. The group monitors closely the returns it achieves from its crops and
considers replacing its biological assets when yields decline with age or markets change. 
Further financial risk arises from changes in market prices of key cost components, such costs are closely monitored.
The estimated fair value of agricultural output from our tea operations after deducting estimated points of sales costs is
£79,438,000 (2014: £73,457,000) which includes a gain on initial recognition at the point of harvest of £14,128,000
(2014: £13,093,000).

From 1 July 2015, following a re-evaluation of the group's relationship with BF&M Limited, the directors concluded that
the group is in a position to exercise significant influence over BF&M Limited. As a result the investment in this company
has been reclassified from available-for-sale financial assets to an investment in associate. The result of this reclassification
is that investments in associates increase by £57,112,000 reflecting the group’s equity interest in BF&M Limited and
available-for-sale financial assets  decline by £34,435,000, being the market value of the group’s shareholding. The
difference of £22,677,000 has been transferred to the income statement, this is offset by an impairment provision of
£22,677,000 which has been made against the group’s equity carrying value of this investment, due to the significant
difference between the equity value of the investment and the market value at 1 July 2015.
Details of the group's associates are shown in note 40.

Made tea is included in inventory at cost as no reliable fair value is available to reflect the uplift in value upon initial
recognition of harvested green leaf. 
Included within the inventory value of made tea of £23,557,000 (2014: £24,417,000) are costs associated with the
growing and cultivation of green leaf from our own estates of £12,311,000 (2014: £12,095,000). This would increase by
£2,580,000 (2014: £2,516,000) if estimated green leaf fair values at harvest were applied. The impact on the income
statement would be a decrease in profit for the year to 31 December 2015 of £64,000 (2014: £2,587,000) and a decrease
in taxation of £22,000 (2014: £900,000).
The year end inventories balance is stated after a write-down provision of £181,000 (2014: £104,000).

Included within deferred tax liabilities are £40,768,000 (2014: £39,495,000) of accelerated tax depreciation relating to
biological assets.
Deferred tax liabilities of £20,718,000 (2014: £21,415,000) have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other
taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries. Such amounts are permanently reinvested.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that the realisation of the related tax
benefit through future taxable profits is probable. The group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £7,045,000
(2014: £8,054,000) in respect of losses that can be carried forward against future taxable income.

33 Employee benefit obligations
(i) Pensions
Certain group subsidiaries operate defined contribution and funded defined benefit pension schemes. The most significant
is the UK funded, final salary defined benefit scheme. The assets of this scheme are administered by trustees and are kept
separate from those of the group. A full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 1 July 2014 and updated to
31 December 2015 by a qualified independent actuary. The UK final salary defined benefit pension scheme is closed to
new entrants and new employees are eligible to join a group personal pension plan. Active members earn accruals at a rate
of 1/80th per year of service.
The overseas schemes are operated in group subsidiaries located in Bangladesh, India and the Netherlands. Actuarial
valuations have been updated to 31 December 2015 by qualified actuaries for these schemes.
Assumptions
The major assumptions used in the valuation to determine the present value of the schemes' defined benefit obligations
were as follows:
2015 2014
% per annum % per annum
UK schemes
Rate of increase in salaries 2.00 2.00
Rate of increase to LPI (Limited Price Indexation) pensions in payment 2.00 – 5.00 2.00 – 5.00
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 3.50 3.50
Inflation assumption (CPI/RPI) 2.00/3.00 2.00/3.00
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are based on advice received from independent actuaries. The current
mortality tables used are S2PA, on a year of birth basis, with CMI_2013 future improvement factors and subject to a long
term annual rate of future improvement of 1.25% per annum. This results in males and females aged 65 having life
expectancies of 22 years (2014: 22 years) and 24 years respectively (2014: 24 years).
Overseas schemes
Rate of increase in salaries 1.50 – 7.00 2.00 – 7.00
Rate of increase to LPI (Limited Price Indexation) pensions in payment 0.00 – 5.00 0.00 – 5.00
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 2.30 – 9.0 2.10 – 11.50
Inflation assumption 0.00 – 7.00 0.00 – 7.00
(ii) Post-employment benefits
Certain group subsidiaries located in Kenya, India and Bangladesh have an obligation to pay terminal gratuities, based on
years of service. These obligations are estimated annually using the projected unit method by qualified independent actuaries.
Schemes operated in India are funded but the schemes operated in Kenya and Bangladesh are unfunded. Operations in India
and Bangladesh also have an obligation to pay medical benefits upon retirement. These schemes are unfunded.
Assumptions
The major assumptions used in the valuation to determine the present value of the post-employment benefit obligations
were as follows:
2015 2014
% per annum % per annum
Rate of increase in salaries 6.00 – 10.00 6.00 – 10.00
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 8.00 – 14.00 8.00 – 13.50
Inflation assumptions 0.00 – 10.00 0.00 – 10.00

33 Employee benefit obligations (continued)
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity of the UK defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
Impact
on defined
Change benefit 
in assumption obligation
Pre-retirement discount rate 0.5% lower 1.8% increase
Post-retirement discount rate 0.5% lower 5.7% increase
Salary increase rate 0.25% lower 0.2% decrease
Inflation rate 0.25% lower 1.5% decrease
Long-term rate of improvement of mortality 0.25% higher 1.4% increase
The above sensitivity analysis assumes that each assumption is changed independently of the others. Therefore, the
disclosures are only a guide because the effect of changing more than one assumption is not cumulative. The sensitivity
analysis was calculated by re-running the figures as at the last formal actuarial valuation at 1 July 2014. Therefore the
analysis is only approximate for the purpose of these IAS19 disclosures as they are on a different set of assumptions and do
not reflect subsequent scheme experience.
Duration of the scheme liabilities
The weighted average duration of the UK defined benefit obligation is 15 years.
Analysis of scheme liabilities
As at 1 July 2014 the allocation of the present value of the UK scheme liabilities was as follows:
%
Active members 11
Deferred pensioners 28
Current pensioners 61

Capital risk management
The group manages its capital to ensure that the group will be able to continue as a going concern, while maximising the
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of its debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the group consists
of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 30, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity
holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The board reviews the capital structure, with an objective to ensure that gross borrowings as a percentage of tangible net
assets does not exceed 50 per cent..
The ratio at the year end is as follows:
2015 2014
£’000 £’000
Borrowings 10,497 2,897

Borrowings are defined as current and non-current borrowings, as detailed in note 30.
Tangible net assets includes all capital and reserves of the group attributable to equity holders of the parent less
intangible assets.

Fair value estimation
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been
defined as follows:
– Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).
– Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).
– Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
The following table presents the group's financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. See note 19 for
disclosures of biological assets that are measured at fair value.

Financial risk management objectives
The group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, long-term loans and leases. The objective
is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a range of
maturities. T o achieve this, the maturity profile of borrowings and facilities are regularly reviewed. The group also seeks to
maintain sufficient undrawn committed borrowing facilities to provide flexibility in the management of the group's liquidity.
Given the nature and diversity of the group's operations, the board does not believe a highly complex use of financial
instruments would be of significant benefit to the group. However, where appropriate, the board does authorise the use of
certain financial instruments to mitigate financial risks that face the group, where it is effective to do so.
Various financial instruments arise directly from the group's operations, for example cash and cash equivalents, trade
receivables and trade payables. In addition, the group uses financial instruments for two main reasons, namely:
– To finance its operations (to mitigate liquidity risk);
– To manage currency risks arising from its operations and arising from its sources of finance (to mitigate foreign
exchange risk).

39 Financial instruments (continued)
The group, including Duncan Lawrie, the group's banking subsidiary, did not, in accordance with group policy, trade in
financial instruments throughout the period under review.
(A) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The group has no material exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on currencies other than the functional currencies
of the operating entities, with the exception of significant Japanese available-for-sale financial assets. A movement by
5 per cent. in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen with Sterling, would increase/decrease the group’s equity balance by
£608,000 (2014: £563,000).
Currency risks are primarily managed through the use of natural hedging and regularly reviewing when cash should be
exchanged into either sterling or another functional currency.
(ii) Price risk
The group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the group and classified on the
consolidated balance sheet as available-for-sale. To manage its price risk arising from investments in equity securities, the
group diversifies its portfolio.
The majority of the group's equity investments are publicly traded and are quoted on stock exchanges located in Bermuda,
Japan, Switzerland, UK and US. Should these equity indexes increase or decrease by 5 per cent. with all other variables
held constant and all the group's equity instruments move accordingly, the group's equity balance would increase/decrease
by £1,440,000 (2014: £3,127,000).
The group's exposure to commodity price risk is not significant.
(iii) Cash flow and interest rate risk
The group's interest rate risk arises from interest-bearing assets and short and long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at
variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk. The group has no fixed rate exposure.
At 31 December 2015, if interest rates on non-sterling denominated interest-bearing assets and borrowings had been 50
basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £266,000
(2014: £215,000) higher/lower.
At 31 December 2015, if interest rates on sterling denominated interest-bearing assets and borrowings had been 50 basis
points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £7,000
(2014: £176,000) higher/lower.

(B) Credit risk
The group has policies in place to limit its exposure to credit risk. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents,
deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables
and committed transactions. If customers are independently rated, these ratings are used. Otherwise if there is no
independent rating, management assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account its financial position, past
experience and other factors and if appropriate holding liens over stock and receiving payments in advance of services or
goods as required. Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits regularly.
The group's approach to customer lending through the group's banking subsidiaries is risk averse with only 1.5 per cent.
of the customer loan book being unsecured.  Collateralised loans are normally secured against cash or property, with
property loans being restricted to 70 per cent. of recent valuation although corporate or personal guarantees are also
acceptable in some instances.
The group has a large number of trade receivables, the largest five receivables at the year end comprise 30 per cent.
(2014: 21 per cent.) of total trade receivables.
(C) Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors. The group manages liquidity risk
by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and
managing the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The two subsidiary companies which are engaged in banking activities, Duncan Lawrie Limited and Duncan Lawrie
(IOM) Limited seek to match maturing customer deposits with market placements and to use liquid assets such as
certificates of deposit. This results in reduced liquidity risk for Duncan Lawrie and the group.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Camellia Plc
Report on the financial statements
Our opinion 
In our opinion:
� Camellia Plc’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair
view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of the group’s profit and the
group’s and the company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
� the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union;
� the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
� the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise:
� the Consolidated and Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2015;
� the Consolidated income statement and Statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
� the Consolidated and Company cash flow statement for the year then ended;
� the Group and Company Statements of changes in equity for the year then ended;
� the accounting policies; and
� the notes to the financial statements, which include other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial
statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union, and applicable law, as regards the company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions
of the Companies Act 2006.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in
respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.
Opinions on matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the directors for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
� we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
� adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or
� the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 29, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). Those standards require us to comply with the
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK and Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
– whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the company’s circumstances and have been consistently
applied and adequately disclosed; 
– the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
– the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Report and accounts to identify material
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

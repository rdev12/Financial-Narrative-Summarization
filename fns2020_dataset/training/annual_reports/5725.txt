Chairman’s Statement
Alexander Abramov
Dear Stakeholders,
2011 was a landmark year in the 
development of EVRAZ. We produced 
a robust operating performance 
in volatile markets, posted strong 
financial results, delivered against 
key management objectives, 
obtained a Premium Listing on 
the London Stock Exchange and 
entered the FTSE 100 Index. 
That the group was able to deliver such a 
resilient performance in a year characterised 
by global economic uncertainty is testament 
to the power of our integrated business model, 
the sustainability of our strategy and the 
efforts of our management team and 
employees. 
Health, Safety and Environment
As a global organisation, our undertaking 
is to make the world stronger, safer and 
cleaner and to this end we are increasing 
our emphasis on the health, safety and 
environmental management of the Group. 
The safety of our employees remains our top 
priority and the Board is absolutely focused 
on improving our safety record. Our disciplined 
approach is beginning to deliver results, 
and I am pleased to say that our overall HSE 
performance has improved again in 2011, 
with our key indicators all showing 
improvement on the previous year. 
The Listing
The Premium Listing of shares of EVRAZ plc 
on the London Stock Exchange in November 
2011 was clearly a major development and an 
important milestone on a journey which began 
six years earlier when EVRAZ Group S.A.’s 
Global Depository Receipts began trading 
on the London Stock Exchange. 
We received overwhelming support from 
Evraz Group S.A. shareholders who almost 
unanimously accepted the offer to exchange 
their GDRs for shares in EVRAZ plc. As the 
only steel stock in the UK FTSE All-Share 
index, EVRAZ enables investors to gain direct 
exposure to this important global sector.
Although the new company, EVRAZ plc, 
represents the same underlying assets as 
EVRAZ Group S.A., the Listing enabled us to 
broaden our shareholder base, improve the 
liquidity of the Company shares, and provide 
better access to the international capital 
markets. Importantly, the Listing also shows 
EVRAZ’s commitment to the highest standards 
of governance, transparency and information 
disclosure.

Business Overview Strategy Operating Review Sustainability Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
Strategy 
Our strategy as a global vertically integrated 
business is clear. We want EVRAZ to 
strengthen its position as a world class steel 
and mining company and as the partner of 
choice for our infrastructure customers. 
These priorities are supported by a set of 
strategic pillars that underpin our growth: 
health, safety and environment; people; 
customer focus and the EVRAZ Business 
System. We have made major investments 
in each of these areas in 2011, helping to 
support our platform for growth. 
The EVRAZ Business System encompasses 
a Group-wide philosophy which aims to 
transform the way the organisation conducts 
its business. A key feature of this approach 
to value creation through greater employee 
engagement is the incorporation of Lean
1
business principles to create a culture of 
continuous improvement. The outcomes of this 
approach are benefits for customers in terms 
of product quality and costs; an improved 
working environment for the workforce and 
greater flexibility for the Group to respond to 
market change as it occurs.
The CEO Statement and Strategy sections 
of this Report provide significant additional 
detail but, in essence, EVRAZ aims to attract, 
develop and retain the best people at every 
level throughout the Company. In 2011, 
we renewed our commitment to training 
and development including the EVRAZ New 
Leaders Programme designed to develop 
the next generation of senior management 
within the Company. 
Governance
EVRAZ is committed to ensuring our 
governance arrangements meet with the 
highest applicable governance standards. 
During 2011 we continued to review and 
strengthen our governance, at Board and 
at executive level, as part of the process for 
admission to the London Stock Exchange as 
a Premium listed company. The independent 
directors of EVRAZ plc are led by Sir Michael 
Peat, the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director. In addition, on 28 February 2012, 
Alexander Izosimov was appointed to the 
Board as an additional non-executive director. 
As a result, the independent directors now 
constitute half the Board of EVRAZ plc.
Dividend
In 2011, the Board approved a new dividend 
policy targeting a long-term average payout 
ratio of at least 25% of consolidated net 
profits (excluding one-off and non-cash items). 
We believe that this is a sensible level which 
rewards shareholders whilst retaining 
sufficient capital for the Group’s future 
investment needs.
On the back of our strong financial results, 
Evraz Group S.A. made the first dividend 
payment since 2008 during 2011 and paid 
an interim dividend of US$0.60 per share 
of Evraz Group S.A. (US$0.20 per GDR) 
and a special dividend of US$2.70 per share 
(US$0.90 per GDR). The Board has declared 
a cash final dividend for 2011 of US$0.17 per 
ordinary share of EVRAZ plc. This gives a total 
ordinary dividend for 2011 of US$317 million, 
which represents 50% of net profit adjusted 
for non-recurring items.
Conclusion
In 2012, EVRAZ will be 20 years old. As a 
founder of the company, I am very proud of 
what we have achieved over the intervening 
years from our beginnings as a small steel 
trader, to our current position as a world class 
vertically integrated steel and mining company. 
We are among the top 20 global steel 
producers, the world’s largest producer of 
rails, Russia’s leading steel manufacturer and 
an international leader in infrastructure and 
construction products.
In 2011 driven by our vertically integrated, 
global business model, we improved our 
competitiveness, maintained our share in key 
markets and further improved our cost base. 
Whilst the immediate outlook for our markets 
remains uncertain, EVRAZ has good overall 
momentum and we see opportunities to 
enhance our performance on many fronts. 
I am confident EVRAZ is well positioned to 
create value for shareholders in 2012 and 
to continue its record of growth.
Strong results, especially in an industry

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Statement
Alexander Frolov
Dear Stakeholders,
2011 was a pivotal year for EVRAZ, 
a period in which we reinforced  
our position as one of the world’s 
leading vertically integrated steel 
and mining companies. I am 
pleased to report that EVRAZ 
produced a strong set of results 
and a robust operational 
performance in 2011, laying a  
solid platform for future growth. 
In 2011, we also recorded a significant 
improvement in both our lost time injury 
frequency rate and fatal injury frequency 
rate, which fell by 23% and 50% respectively 
year-on-year. Our aim is now to make these 
improvements sustainable with the ultimate 
goal being to operate a zero harm business. 
We still have a long way to go and we will 
continue to focus on improving our safety 
management systems and promoting a 
strong safety culture.
The first half of 2011 witnessed a recovery 
in the emerging economies matched by 
improving demand from developed markets. 
However, in the second half of the year, 
the combination of a slowing US economy, 
fiscal tightening in China and the crisis in 
the Eurozone, caused a rapid collapse in 
confidence over the prospects for global 
growth. This led to significant uncertainty 
in steel markets and a noticeable softening 
of demand.
Against this challenging backdrop, EVRAZ 
reported a good set of results for the year. 
Our financial performance was robust, 
benefiting from resilient steel demand in our 
key markets, a favourable product mix and 
higher raw materials prices. As a result, our 
revenues increased by 22% to US$16.4 billion, 
EBITDA rose by 23% to US$2.9 billion and we 
delivered an impressive cash performance, 
generating operating cashflow of US$2.6 billion, 
up 59% on 2010. 
Our strategic priorities in 2011 were to grow 
our steelmaking raw material base and improve 
the performance and efficiency of our existing 
mining operations. During the year we launched 
a number of growth initiatives to improve 
productivity and secure our self-coverage in raw 
materials. We remain on track to reach our long-
term objective of achieving integration levels in 
excess of 100% self-coverage in iron ore and 
coking coal supply. 
At the same time, we focused on the need for 
operational excellence in our steel operations, 
firstly, in order to preserve our competitive 
advantage as one of the world’s leading 
low cost steel producers, and secondly, 
to reposition the business and increase our 
share of higher value-added finished products. 
We made considerable progress in pursuit of 
these goals: modernising existing facilities, 
investing in new projects and successfully 
shifting our production more toward value-
added steel products. 
Mining Segment
In 2011, we focused investment on the 
development of our iron ore resource base, 
primarily the expansion of the Kachkanar iron 
ore operations to ensure a steady supply of 
iron ore to our steelmaking operations in future 
years. As a result, our KGOK plant increased 
production of raw iron ore from 52 to 55 million 
tonnes. As a result of our continued focus on 
debottlenecking our mining segment produced 
7% more iron ore products in 2011 compared 
to 2010.
One of our challenges in 2011 was to stabilise 
our existing coking coal mining operations 
and lay the foundation for a future increase 
in production. The performance of our coal 
mines has been affected in recent years by 
a combination of negative factors including 
difficult geological conditions, mine shutdowns 
and temporary stoppages, divestments and 
the impact of more stringent health and safety 
requirements. As a result, the production 
of raw coking coal fell from 10 million tonnes 
in 2009 to 6.3 million tonnes in 2011. 
Operations were again disrupted in 2011, 
as we had to temporarily halt production at 
the Alardinskaya and Osinnikovskaya mines, 
for longwall repositionings and additional 
implementation of safety equipment. We 
completed these works in the fourth quarter, 
and restarted operations at all the mines 
involved. In October, we launched production 
at the Ulyanovskaya mine. As a result, 
production rose 19% in the fourth quarter 
compared to the third quarter.
In order to increase our coking coal self-
coverage and ensure adequate long-term 
supply as existing mines become depleted, we 
started construction of the Yerunakovskaya-VIII 
mine. We also looked at different options for 
developing the Mezhegey coal deposit earlier 
than the scheduled 2015 start date. 
We expect that implementing all these plans 
will result in production volumes of coking coal 
in 2012 surpassing the levels of 2011. As a 
result, our coking coal self-coverage should 
exceed 100% by the end of 2013, which will 
help improve the profitability of the business. 
Steel Segment
Buoyed by strong contributions from our core 
markets of Russia and North America, our 
steelmaking business made progress in 2011. 
With all our major facilities operating at full 
capacity, production volumes of crude steel 
rose 3% year on year to 16.8 million tonnes. 
Within the product mix, we saw a further shift 
away from semi-finished products towards 
higher margin, value-added finished products. 
As a consequence, the share of finished 
products as a proportion of total output 
increased to 77% from 75% in 2010, the 
highest contribution in our history. 
In 2011, we placed special emphasis on cost 
reduction and improving our product quality. 
We invested in the development of pulverised 
coal injection technology (“PCI”) at all our 
Russian blast furnaces, in order to significantly 
reduce consumption of coking coal and natural 
gas in blast furnace production. 
Our strategic priorities in 2011 were to grow 
our steelmaking raw material base and improve 
the performance and efﬁciency of our existing 
mining operations.

Business Overview Strategy Operating Review Sustainability Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
The modernisation of our Russian rail mills, 
when completed by the end of 2012, will 
ensure supply of better quality rails to satisfy 
the immediate demand of our major customer 
in Russia, Russian Railways. The next stage 
will be production of 100-metre heat-treated 
rails for high-speed railroads in line with the 
Russian long-term state programme to develop 
rail transportation in the country. We have also 
modernised the wheel production, significantly 
improving the quality of railway wheels made 
at our plant in Nizhny Tagil, supplied also to 
Russian Railways and commercial customers 
in Russia and other CIS countries.
Russia, our biggest market, put in a robust 
performance. The combination of supply 
constraints and higher raw material input 
prices led to higher steel prices. The key 
drivers of demand continued to be the 
construction and infrastructure sectors. 
Such was the requirement for construction 
steel that, for the first time since before 
the financial crisis, demand for construction 
steel in Russia outstripped supply. 
The domestic market accounted for 69% of 
EVRAZ’s Russian and CIS steel mills sales in 
2011, compared to 58% in 2010, reflecting 
improved demand and the shift to higher 
margin finished products. This increase was 
fully offset by a decrease in export sales 
volumes from EVRAZ’s Russian and Ukrainian 
operations, which reflects EVRAZ’s strategy to 
direct sales away from export markets where 
prices for its steel products were generally 
lower in 2011, to domestic CIS markets, 
where prices for steel products were higher.
EVRAZ North America produced encouraging 
results in 2011. Steel sales volumes remained 
at the level of 2010, but prices increased 
across all our product groups. We made 
investments in capacity expansion, adding 
capacity to produce API tubes at our structural 
tubing facility in Portland, Oregon and 
upgrading our rail facility in Pueblo, Colorado. 
The investment in Portland will double the 
mill’s total capacity, enabling it to meet the 
energy sector’s growing demand for specialist 
tubular products. The upgrades at Pueblo will 
increase the mill’s total capacity by 10%, to 
almost 525,000 metric tonnes of premium 
rail annually. 
Our results in Europe and South Africa were 
mixed. After a strong first half, European steel 
demand began to weaken in the second half of 
2011. EVRAZ’s European operations increased 
full year sales volumes by 8%. In South Africa, 
the performance of EVRAZ Highveld Steel was 
hit by poor domestic demand and a strong 
Rand, which created significant pressure on 
both prices and costs. 
Vanadium Segment
We are the only large-scale producer of 
vanadium in Russia and are well-positioned 
among the largest vanadium producers 
globally. EVRAZ continued to increase its share 
of the world vanadium market capitalising on 
its low cost competitive position and ability 
to accelerate production in response to 
customers’ requirements. As a result, EVRAZ’s 
vanadium division has managed to increase 
sales by 20% compared to 2010 and decrease 
inventories accumulated during crisis years.
Operational Improvements
In order to preserve our competitive advantage 
and compete effectively in the global market, 
we need to create more value for our 
customers and to do so more efficiently by 
using fewer resources, which is why we have 
introduced the EVRAZ Business System into 
the organisation. We are applying Lean 
business principles across our operations to 
create a culture of continuous improvement. 
Our goal is not just to identify cost reductions, 
but to change the way our entire organisation 
thinks and acts.
In 2011, we streamlined our business further. 
We moved into our new headquarters in 
Moscow, relocated our North American 
headquarters and started the consolidation of 
our European assets into a single unit. We also 
merged our two major integrated steel plants, 
NKMK, the leading rail producer in Russia, and 
ZSMK, Siberia’s largest steel mill, into a new 
unified business, EVRAZ United West-Siberian 
Iron and Steel Plant (“EVRAZ ZSMK”), creating 
one of the largest steel plants in Russia. 
As these two plants are located in one city – 
Novokuznetsk – we believe that such merger 
will make the business much more efficient.
Positioned for Growth
We are committed to enhancing our mining 
asset base, modernising our steelmaking 
facilities and improving product quality in order 
to maintain and strengthen our competitive 
position in our key markets. Since 2005, 
we have invested over US$5.5 billion in key 
investment projects aimed to achieve these 
goals. Our total capital expenditures in 2011 
amounted to US$1.28 billion. Some of the 
new investment projects will come on stream 
by the end of 2012, starting with the increase 
of production at our iron ore mine at Kachkanar, 
followed in 2013 by an additional 2 million 
tonnes of raw coking coal per annum to be 
mined at the Yerunakovskaya-VIII mine, and 
the start of mining at the Mezhegey coking 
coal deposit, with an estimated 700 million 
tonnes of reserves and resources. The 
development of new deposits will help to 
underpin our goal of reaching integration 
levels in excess of 100% self-coverage 
in iron ore and coking coal. 
By the beginning of 2013, we will also start 
using pulverised coal injection technology (PCI) 
at all our Russian steelmaking facilities, which 
will reduce coking coal consumption by 20% 
and eliminate the need for natural gas in 
blast furnace production, thus lowering our 
steelmaking costs.
We are continuing to modernise and expand 
existing steel facilities, commission new steel 
mills, and invest in new production technology. 
The reconstruction of our Russian rail mills at 
EVRAZ ZSMK and EVRAZ NTMK should be 
completed in 2012, enabling EVRAZ to increase 
its manufacturing capacity for high-speed rails 
and improve the quality of the products. 
In 2013 we expect two new rolling mills, 
in the south of Russia and in Kazakhstan, 
to start producing rebars and small sections 
from internally supplied billets. This will 
allow us to further increase the proportion 
of higher value-added products and raise 
the profitability of our steel operations.
Outlook
The long-term prospects for global infrastructure, 
a sector where EVRAZ has established a strong 
reputation and footprint, remain attractive. 
As a low cost, vertically integrated global steel 
manufacturer, EVRAZ is well placed to benefit 
from the increased emphasis on infrastructure 
development globally. 
In the near-term, the outlook for the global 
steel industry is likely to continue to be 
challenging in 2012. Our current expectation 
is for a modest overall rise in steel consumption, 
driven by demand from the emerging markets. 
The wider global economy and, in turn, the 
steel industry, continues to face challenges 
and will likely remain volatile. 
However, we have substantial experience 
of managing the business in the extremely 
challenging environment of late 2008-2009 
so we enter this period of uncertainty with 
confidence. Inventories at traders and at our 
mills and ports are very low and we do not 
ship without a pre-payment, which minimises 
our credit risk.
We continue to run our steelmaking capacities 
at full utilisation and expect the situation to 
remain the same in the foreseeable future. 
This is expected to result in a slight increase 
in volumes of finished steel products in 2012 
compared to 2011 due to the completion of 
certain maintenance and modernisation projects.
In Russia, steel prices remained largely 
unchanged in the first quarter 2012 compared 
to the last quarter of 2011, but our cost base 
is increasing due to the strengthening rouble. 
Prices of steel products have remained broadly 
flat since the start of 2012. Russian Railroads 
remains a very strong customer and we expect 
it to maintain purchase volumes over the next 
few years. In addition, we expect to improve 
our product mix and generate additional 
revenue through our rail mill and wheel 
shop modernisation. 
In North America, demand for our products 
remains strong and its relative performance 
so far in 2012 is ahead of the comparable 
period in 2011.
CAPEX plans for FY2012 are expected 
to remain at the level of 2011 but we 
continuously assess the market environment 
and have flexibility in our CAPEX plans.
We strongly believe that the quality of 
the Group’s asset base, the competitive 
advantages we derive from vertical integration, 
its low cost position, geographic breadth and 
highly experienced management team leave 
the Company well positioned to continue 
to implement its growth strategy and deliver 
value to shareholders.

Global Macroeconomic 
Environment
The global economy’s recovery of 2010 
continued with strong growth in the first half 
of 2011. However, this positive sentiment did 
not continue throughout the second half of the 
year due to a combination of factors including 
a slowdown in the global economy, fragility 
in European markets due to the debt crisis 
and budget-balancing measures in the USA. 
In China, stringent monetary policy controls were 
also a key driver of the economic slowdown.
The European debt crisis negatively affected 
consumer confidence, which in turn led to 
a slowdown in the steel market in the second 
half of the year. End-use demand for steel sheet 
has weakened, particularly in the automotive 
sector where threat of unemployment, fiscal 
austerity and personal indebtedness has 
diminished the demand for cars. Construction 
activity has also been constrained impacting 
demand for long products.
China and India continued to be the main 
drivers in demand for commodities in 2011 
due to ongoing infrastructure development 
and continuing urbanisation in Asia. This trend 
is expected to continue in 2012.
Strategic Context
EVRAZ is a global vertically integrated steel, 
mining and vanadium business.
EVRAZ’s ability to successfully deliver our 
strategy is influenced by both the conduct 
of our competitors and external macro-
economic factors which affect ourselves

World steel
There was a slowdown in consumption 
growth in the second half of the year, largely 
due to the European debt crisis. Crude steel 
production has consequently been scaled 
back globally with several mill shutdowns 
in Europe and Chinese output continuing 
to fall after reaching an all-time high in May.
China continued to dominate demand 
for finished steel products, accounting for 
45.4% of demand in 2011. The growth in 
consumption in China was predominantly 
driven by the affordable housing scheme 
initiated by the Chinese government, 
which helped increase consumption 
of long products. 
We expect a modest increase in steel 
consumption of 3.6% in 2012, predominantly 
as a result of continued demand in emerging 
markets. Additionally, the 2018 FIFA World 
Cup in Russia should result in growing demand 
for construction steel starting 2014 in the 
domestic market, which EVRAZ is well 
positioned to benefit from. 
In 2011, there was a significant increase in 
raw material prices compared to 2010, which 
resulted in price increases for end products. 
However, raw material prices began to soften 
during the latter part of the year as a result 
of the slowdown in steel production.
Steel Industry in 2011
Following increase of 17% in 2010, hot-rolled 
ﬁnished steel consumption also grew by 6% in 
2011, with the majority of additional demand 
occurring during the ﬁrst half of the year .  EVRAZ plc

The iron ore industry showed strong demand 
growth through the first half of 2011 on the 
back of improving market sentiment, resulting 
in production increases and a favourable 
pricing environment. However, prices 
weakened in the second half of the year due 
to a decrease in global steel production.
Global iron ore production rose 5% to 
1,804 mt in 2011. There was strong growth 
in production in the major iron ore producing 
countries on the back of the positive 
macroeconomic fundamentals in the first half 
of the year, with Australia producing 478 mt 
(+13% versus 2010), Brazil 381 mt (+6% 
versus 2010), China 254 mt (+4% versus 
2010) and India 236 mt (+5% versus 2010). 
These four countries accounted for 71% of 
total production worldwide. Additionally, Russia 
increased its iron ore output by 3% to 110 mt. 
China continued to dominate the seaborne 
iron ore market, importing 687 mt (63%) 
of the seaborne traded iron ore. 
Iron ore fines CIF China prices increased 
by an average of 15% in 2011. The sales 
structure for the industry has moved towards 
an increased use of spot contracts.

Global coking coal demand continued to grow 
strongly throughout the first half of 2011, 
resulting in prices increasing significantly due 
to a continued supply side deficit, before 
softening in the second half of the year.
Global coking coal seaborne exports were 
down 2% to 264 mt in 2011. The major coking 
coal exporting countries showed growth, 
with the exception of Australia whose exports 
declined 16% to 134 mt; USA increased 26% 
to 60 mt, Canada increased 4% to 29 mt and 
Mongolia increased 37% to 14 mt. The four 
countries together accounted for nearly 90% 
of total worldwide exports. 
Coking coal imports were flat at 283 mt 
in 2011 driven by the significant increase 
in imports in Japan (up 21% to 65 mt) and 
China (up 27% to 61 mt). Japan, China and 
India accounted for more than 50% of the 
global imports.
The Australian contract prices for coal 
increased 60% to US$330/t in April 2011, 
before decreasing 15% to US$285/t by the 
end of the year. The Australian spot price 
increased 56% to US$350/t in January 2011, 
before decreasing 35% to US$228/t by the 
end of the year.

Vanadium is predominantly used as an 
alloying agent to increase the strength of 
steel. Nearly 85% of the vanadium used in 
this process is ferrovanadium, which is used 
as an alloying agent for iron and steel, while 
vanadium pentoxide is used as a catalyst for 
the production of sulphuric acid. Vanadium 
consumption is heavily aligned with levels 
of steel production, particularly high-strength 
steel grades.
Whilst demand was robust for vanadium in 
the first half of 2011, due to strong growth 
in steel production, prices for ferrovanadium 
and vanadium pentoxide remained at the 
same level as 2010 in the first half of 2011, 
before decreasing towards the end of the year.
World resources of vanadium exceed 63 mt, 
most of which are in China, Russia and South 
Africa. However, as vanadium is mainly recovered 
as a byproduct or coproduct, these resource 
levels are not an indicator of available supplies.

Focused efforts are put into hiring and 
developing the best workforce as this is the 
backbone of EVRAZ’s operations. The health 
and safety of employees is at the forefront 
of decision making at EVRAZ.
Vertical integration in raw material is a key 
competitive advantage of EVRAZ’s business 
which supports attractive margins, throughout 
the iron ore and coking coal pricing cycle. 
The favourable location of EVRAZ’s production 
sites in terms of proximity to raw materials 
and key global growth markets (CIS, Asia 
and South Africa), combined with continuous 
modernisation of its operations, helps to 
reinforce its market leading position and 
increases the quality of higher-end products, 
such as rails, wheels and tubes.
At an operational level, EVRAZ continues to 
refine an improved management structure 
that is focused on enhancing accountability 
and decision-making processes. EVRAZ’s 
top management has significant relevant 
international experience and proven skills 
in consistently improving operations. EVRAZ 
plc’s Board of Directors combines executive 
experience from EVRAZ’s business, with 
experienced independent non-executive 
directors, to promote transparency and 
sound governance.
Competitive Advantage 
One of the most vertically integrated global 
steel producers:
 Low cost producer.
 Geographically diversified over four 
continents.
 Leading market position in long products 
in Russia.
 World leader in the rail and wheel markets.
 Largest producer of vanadium products 
globally.
 Dynamic and experienced management 
team.
Our Strategy 
EVRAZ intends to pursue its strategy by 
expanding its mining operations, strengthening 
its position in existing markets and reducing 
costs while maintaining its focus on safety.
Increase Vertical Integration and Enhance 
Raw Materials Base
EVRAZ is significantly self-covered in terms 
of raw material production and believes that, 
in 2011, it ranked by volume in the top three 
largest iron ore producers and top five largest 
coal producers in Russia. 
In 2011, approximately 102% of EVRAZ’s iron 
ore requirements and 56% of its steel segment 
coking coal requirements were produced by 
its own mining subsidiaries. EVRAZ sells a 
proportion of its iron ore and coal production 
to third parties and purchases a proportion 
of its iron ore and coal requirements from third 
parties due to grade, processing requirements 
and transportation considerations. 
EVRAZ seeks to enhance its profitability 
and the security of supply of raw materials 
by increasing vertical integration. Further 
expansion of the EVRAZ mining division will 
allow increased volumes of raw materials to be 
sold to EVRAZ’s subsidiaries and third parties.
EVRAZ is also in the process of developing the 
Yerunakovskaya-VIII mine in Kuzbass, which is 
anticipated to start producing high quality hard 
coking coal in 2013 and provide EVRAZ with 
2 million tonnes per annum. This additional 
production will allow EVRAZ to meet all of its 
own coking coal requirements (based upon 
current production levels) and would also allow 
EVRAZ to sell additional amounts to third 
parties, particularly in Asia.
As a first step towards delivering this 
expansion strategy, after acquisition of the 
Mezhegey and Vostochny licences EVRAZ has 
begun a feasibility study to develop coking coal 
deposits in the Republic of Tyva, Russia. The 
total reserves and resources of these deposits 
are estimated by the Russian State Mineral 
Resources Agency (“Rosnedra”) to be over 
700 million tonnes. EVRAZ anticipates that 
the Tyva mine could produce 7 million tonnes 
of coking coal per annum by 2019. 
EVRAZ also aims to further develop its own 
already substantial Russian iron ore division, 
to both provide feed for EVRAZ’s own steel mills 
and to take advantage of favourable iron ore prices. 
The KGOK asset in 2011 reached its highest 
output in five years, achieving a production rate 
of 9.5 million tonnes per annum of saleable iron 
ore product through efficiency initiatives and 
expansions of capacity. 
EVRAZ may explore opportunities to develop 
additional greenfield projects as they arise.
Business Model 
EVRAZ creates value by converting its own mineral 
resources into high-end steel products for its large scale 
global infrastructure clients. Efﬁcient operations, constant 
pursuit of economically attractive asset developments and 
search for value-adding M&A transactions are each 
fundamental features of EVRAZ’s approach.
EVRAZ is signiﬁcantly self-covered in terms 
of raw material production and believes 
that, in 2011, it ranked by volume in the 
top three largest iron ore producers and 
top ﬁve largest coal producers in Russia.  EVRAZ plc

Strengthen Competitive Position in Its 
Existing Markets
EVRAZ plans to strengthen its current market 
position by enhancing the quality of its 
products, broadening its product portfolio 
and developing its distribution network. 
EVRAZ believes that in 2011 it was among 
the 20 largest steel producers globally by 
crude steel volume and the largest producer 
of crude steel in Russia. EVRAZ believes that 
in 2011 it was the leading producer of railway 
steel products in Russia with an estimated 
market share of 87% in rails and second-
largest in the country’s rail wheel market. 
In the Russian construction sector, EVRAZ 
estimates that it had a market share, by 
volume, of 85% in H-beams and 61% in 
channels during 2011. EVRAZ holds a strong 
competitive position as a diversified producer 
of a full range of products in the domestic 
construction steel market. 
In order to maintain its leading position in 
the Russian and global rail market in 2012 
EVRAZ expects to complete the reconstruction 
projects at EVRAZ ZSMK and EVRAZ NTMK 
rail and beam mills. These reconstruction 
projects will allow both plants to produce higher 
grade products to match Russian Railways’ 
requirements for high speed rails, increase 
capacity to 1.6 million tonnes per annum 
and export high-end rails to more developed 
markets. EVRAZ has also undertaken a rail 
production expansion project in order to achieve 
production levels of up to 0.6 million tonnes per 
annum at its Rocky Mountain facility in the USA.
EVRAZ is looking to expand its position within 
potential CIS growth regions, where demand 
for steel products is anticipated to experience 
superior future growth. In order to achieve this 
goal, EVRAZ is investing in two new rolling 
mills, one in the Rostov Region of Southern 
Russia and another in Northern Kazakhstan. 
EVRAZ anticipates that these new facilities 
will permit EVRAZ to diversify its product mix, 
produce specific products that are in demand 
in these regions (e.g. new rebar grades) and 
offer its customers better quality products. In 
2011, EVRAZ has continued to develop EVRAZ 
Metall Inprom, its key distribution channel in 
Russia which sold almost 1.7 million tonnes 
of steel products during the year.
EVRAZ is a leading producer of OCTG pipes 
in Western Canada. Given the potential for 
increased shale gas drilling in North America, 
which requires high quality products, EVRAZ 
is looking to enhance its product mix to 
match these new requirements and take 
full advantage of this recent market trend. 
As a first step, in mid-2012, the structural 
tubing facility in Portland, Oregon, will add 
the production of API tubes to its portfolio. 
This will bring the mill’s total capacity from 
110,000 to 225,000 tonnes per annum. 
Other quality enhancing projects are in 
development to ensure EVRAZ, not only 
maintains, but also increases its market 
share in the North American tubular market.
Enhance Cost Leadership Position
Management believes that Russia is one of 
the lowest cost regions for steel production 
in the world, enabling EVRAZ to benefit from 
lower production costs compared to some of 
its competitors elsewhere in the world. EVRAZ 
benefits through both the export of low-cost 
Russian slab to global markets and the 
synergies created by being able to supply 
feedstock to certain of its non-Russian 
subsidiaries. At EVRAZ NTMK and EVRAZ 
ZSMK new pulverised coal injection technology 
is in the final stage of implementation and 
will be commissioned during 2012. This new 
technology will significantly lower production 
costs by allowing the two plants to reduce 
coking coal consumption by 20% and eliminate 
the need for natural gas. 
In 2011, EVRAZ KGOK bought an adjacent 
power plant and EVRAZ ZSMK is currently 
developing its own power plant, in order to 
increase self-sufficiency in electricity, and 
reduce the effect of the expected increases 
in electricity prices.
In 2011, EVRAZ bought a further 24% stake 
in Evraztrans, increasing its ownership to 
100%, with the aim of optimising logistics 
and better controlling all transportation costs, 
which are crucial factors in the success of 
EVRAZ’s operations.
The construction of a new coal terminal is 
currently underway at EVRAZ NTMP – the port 
in the far east of Russia. This new terminal 
will increase the handling capacities of the 
port to 5 million tonnes per annum of coal. 
In late 2011 EVRAZ completed the conversion 
of EVRAZ Highveld’s furnace into an open slag 
bath with the objective of decreasing energy 
and coking coal consumption.
Finally all EVRAZ’s assets are currently 
undergoing a transformation towards 
superior efficiency practices through the 
implementation of the EVRAZ Business 
System. This initiative is a global programme 
of Lean practices which aims to decrease 
cash costs (including maintenance CAPEX), 
inventory turnover and production losses at 
every single plant in the Group.
Enhance Global Leadership Position 
in Vanadium Business
EVRAZ is the only large-scale producer 
of vanadium-rich iron ore in Russia and it 
believes that, during 2011, it was among the 
largest producers of vanadium slag globally.
Based on World Steel’s global steel production 
forecasts and an expected increase in 
vanadium used per tonne of steel, EVRAZ’s 
management believes that global vanadium 
consumption will increase by up to 33% by 
2015 with strong demand growth expected 
in China, India and the Middle East. EVRAZ 
is a global leader in vanadium production 
and aims to increase its production volumes 
of final vanadium goods during 2012 by 
expanding its vanadium slag processing 
capacities to match its slag production levels.

and non-ﬁnancial KPIs to 
measure and manage 
its performance. 
These KPIs reﬂect the Company’s focus on product leadership, 
cost leadership and safety across all our operations and are used 
by management to monitor the Group’s progress. However, this 
list is not exhaustive and we also use additional measures 
internally to review progress.
Steel Sales Volumes (million tonnes) 
We measure our total steel sales in millions of tonnes, combining all types 
of steel which we produce around the world.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
Effective management of risk is essential to achieving EVRAZ’s objective 
of delivering long-term value to shareholders and to the protection of 
its assets, people and reputation. Identifying, evaluating and managing 
business risks are integral to the way EVRAZ runs its business.
Strategic Risks
Risk Type Risk Mitigation
Global Economy and 
Industry Cyclicality
The steel and mining industries are cyclical and strongly 
influenced by global economic conditions. As a result, 
EVRAZ’s business is highly dependent on, and sensitive to, 
the global macroeconomic environment. If macroeconomic 
conditions deteriorate or a significant economic contraction 
takes place in any of the Group’s key geographic markets, 
the Group’s business, financial condition and prospects 
could be materially affected. The industries in which the 
majority of our steel customers operate, are themselves 
cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic conditions.
Renewed weakness in these industries would adversely 
affect EVRAZ’s business. 
The prices of EVRAZ’s primary commodities and its steel 
products are influenced by many factors including demand, 
worldwide production capacity, capacity utilisation rates, 
raw material costs, exchange rates and trade barriers. 
Prices for these commodities may experience significant 
fluctuations as a result of these and other factors, any of 
which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, financial condition, the results of operations and 
future prospects.
Regular strategic planning, global operations diversifying 
risk across a number of key economic markets, increasing 
the number of medium and long-term customer contracts, 
maintaining a competitive low product cost structure, 
prudent financial management.
Dependency 
on Russian and 
North American 
Markets
In 2011, EVRAZ derived around 40% of its consolidated 
revenues from sales to customers in Russia and about 
22% from sales to customers in North America. The overall 
success of EVRAZ’s operations is therefore closely tied  
to the business and operating environments in these  
two regions. Any significant decrease in demand for steel 
products or decline in the price of these products in these 
territories could result in significantly reduced revenues, 
thereby materially adversely affecting EVRAZ’s business, 
financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Regular strategic planning, increasing the number of 
medium and long-term customer contracts, maintaining  
a competitive low cost product structure, matching 
contract product pricing to key input costs, increasing 
product portfolio and customer focus strategies to more 
robust infrastructure market categories.
Political Adverse consequences from specific or general political 
actions hindering the Group’s long-term planning ability and 
limiting its capacity to obtain financing in the international 
markets which could have a material adverse effect on 
Evraz’s business, financial condition, results of operations 
and future prospects.
Regular strategic planning, positive investment in social 
and community projects, effective sustainability activity 
in health, safety and environmental programmes, careful 
and diligent attention to local and international regulations, 
laws and taxation regimes.
Capital Expenditure Steel production and mining are capital intensive 
businesses. EVRAZ plans to continue to invest in its 
production facilities, maintaining and upgrading existing 
facilities, developing new mines and investing in new 
projects. In 2011, the Group had capital expenditure of 
US$1.28 billion. The Group expects to be able to fund its 
current planned capital expenditures from cash generated 
from operations and external funding. However, planned 
capital expenditures may be adversely affected by the 
following factors: changes in the terms of existing financing 
arrangements; changes in economic conditions; fluctuations 
in the Russian or global steel markets; regulatory 
developments; delays in project completion; cost overruns; 
and defects in design or construction. It is possible 
that EVRAZ may have difficulty in financing its capital 
expenditures and external sources of financing may not 
be available. The failure to fully finance its planned capital 
expenditures at a level intended to grow its business, or to 
finance such expenditures at an acceptable cost or at all, 
may have an adverse impact on EVRAZ’s business, financial 
condition, results of operations and future prospects.
In addition to the mitigation actions described above 
regarding global economic risks, the Group has 
established procedures and dedicated management for 
the planning, realisation and commissioning of capital 
projects. The Group aims to minimise short-term debt 
and secure liquidity to ensure funding of the necessary 
capital expenditure. EVRAZ plc

Operational Risks
Risk Type Risk Mitigation
Health, Safety and 
Environmental Risks
EVRAZ’s operations are subject to a wide range of health, 
safety and environmental (HSE) laws, regulations and 
standards. Any breach of existing laws and regulations 
resulting from health, safety or environmental incidents 
may result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or other 
actions, which could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations 
and future prospects.
The introduction of new laws and regulations may result  
in increased costs, or in the event of non-compliance,  
also lead to the imposition of substantial penalties or 
other actions that could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of 
operations and future prospects. 
The Group has introduced a management structure to 
appropriately escalate material HSE issues to Board level. 
The Group is actively assessing its environmental impacts 
and potential liabilities to improve management of those 
exposures.
Labour Relations EVRAZ’s business depends on good labour relations 
with employees. Labour disputes, restrictive labour 
and employment laws, as well as increasing costs of 
skilled labour, could have a material adverse impact on 
EVRAZ. Although EVRAZ believes its labour relations 
with its employees are good, a strike or a work stoppage 
could occur at any of the Group’s facilities or greenfield 
operations. At most of the Group’s business units, there 
are collective bargaining agreements in place with labour 
unions. However, existing agreements may not prevent 
future strikes, work stoppages or other labour-related 
disputes which could result in a decrease in EVRAZ’s 
production levels. They could also lead to adverse publicity 
or an increase in costs, which could have a material 
adverse effect on EVRAZ’s business, results of operations, 
financial condition and future prospects.
There are established Group and local HR procedures, 
channels for timely communications and negotiations with 
trade unions, other representative bodies and authorities.
Cost Competitiveness EVRAZ operates in markets that are highly competitive. 
Competitors include major international steel producers 
and mining companies, as well as other Russian steel 
and mining producers and producers in other emerging 
market countries. The Group’s competitive position as one 
of the world’s lowest cost steel producers is dependent 
on, among other factors, its ability to manage its cost 
base and increase the efficiency and productivity of its 
employees. Competition for skilled labour is intense in 
the steel and mining industries, and labour costs are 
increasing significantly, particularly in Russia. Continued 
high demand for skilled labour and labour cost inflation 
could make it difficult for the Group to attract qualified 
employees at a commercially reasonable cost and such 
a difficulty could thus have a material adverse effect 
on EVRAZ’s business, results of operations, financial 
condition and future prospects.
In addition, EVRAZ’s Russian subsidiaries are in many 
instances the largest employers in the cities in which they 
operate, which means its ability to reduce the numbers 
of its employees may be subject to political and social 
considerations. Any inability to make planned reductions in 
workforce numbers in order to increase efficiency could have 
a material adverse effect on EVRAZ’s business, financial 
condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Management reporting framework, Group and site 
operational KPI’s, regular Management Committee 
meetings, PRM (Product and Resource Management) 
meetings. Proactive HR skills and management gap 
analysis, site and group level in-house training and 
established Lean management processes. The above 
management mitigation action is supported by specific 
investment projects to deliver reduced cost per tonne; 
a key example being the investment in PCI facilities at 
EVRAZ NTMK and EVRAZ ZSMK. EVRAZ plc

Operational Risks
(continued)
Risk Type Risk Mitigation
Business Interruption The mining, smelting and refining operations of EVRAZ 
are subject to a number of operational risks which can 
cause prolonged shut downs or production delays. 
These include: the availability of raw materials, water 
and power, geological and technical challenges, climatic 
conditions such as flooding and earthquakes, equipment 
failure, interruptions to power supplies, or limitations or 
disruptions to transportation services such as railways. 
Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect 
on EVRAZ’s operating performance, production levels, 
financial condition and future prospects. In addition, 
long-term business interruption may result in a loss  
of customers and damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group has established protocols and procedures 
across the Group as a whole such that plans are in place 
to ensure business continuity in the Group’s operations in 
the event of a major disruption to the Group’s operations. 
The Group also carries business interruption insurance 
except for mining operations.
Financial Risks
Risk Type Risk Mitigation
Treasury Risks EVRAZ, like many large multinational companies, faces  
a variety of treasury risks including liquidity risk, credit 
risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. Adverse events  
or uncertainties affecting the global financial markets 
could adversely affect EVRAZ’s ability to raise new debt  
or refinance existing debt facilities in the capital markets. 
It could also in future lead to higher borrowing costs. 
EVRAZ needs ongoing access to liquidity funding in order 
to meet its trading requirements, support its existing 
operations and invest in new investment projects. There 
is a risk that the Group may be unable to obtain the 
necessary funds when required or that such funds will 
only be available on unfavorable terms. EVRAZ’s borrowing 
facilities include a requirement to comply with certain 
specified covenants in relation to the level of net debt 
and interest cover. A breach of these covenants could 
result in a significant proportion of the Group’s borrowings 
becoming repayable immediately. 
EVRAZ transacts with a variety of commercial and financial 
counterparties including customers, financial institutions 
and suppliers. Accordingly, the failure or default of a 
counter party could give rise to a material loss which may 
have an adverse impact on EVRAZ’s business, financial 
condition, results of operations and future prospects.
The mix of EVRAZ’s revenues and costs is such that it  
is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly 
between the Rouble and the US dollar. The appreciation 
of the Rouble against the US dollar tends to result in 
an increase in the EVRAZ Group’s costs relative to its 
revenues. Therefore, adverse currency movements may 
materially adversely affect EVRAZ’s financial condition  
and results of operations. 
EVRAZ borrows on both a fixed and variable rate basis  
and has other interest-bearing liabilities, such as finance 
lease liabilities and other obligations.
EVRAZ incurs interest rate risk on liabilities with variable 
interest rates.
EVRAZ manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate 
cash reserves and borrowing facilities, by continuously 
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching 
the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
EVRAZ reviews cash flow forecasts, debt profiles and 
funding options by the financial team, top management, 
the Audit Committee, in respect of Going Concern 
deliberations, and by the Board.
To manage credit risk related to cash, EVRAZ maintains 
its available cash, mainly in US dollars, in reputable 
international banks and major Russian banks. 
Management periodically reviews the creditworthiness 
of the banks in which it deposits cash.
EVRAZ’s trade receivables consist of a large number 
of customers, spread across diverse industries and 
geographical areas. There are no significant concentrations 
of credit risk within the EVRAZ customer base. 
Some of EVRAZ’s sales are made on terms of letter of 
credit. In addition, EVRAZ requires prepayments from 
certain customers. EVRAZ does not require collateral 
in respect of trade and other receivables, except when 
a customer asks for a payment period which is longer 
than normal terms. In this case, EVRAZ requires bank 
guarantees or other liquid collateral. The Group developed 
standard payment terms and constantly monitors 
the status of accounts receivable collection and the 
creditworthiness of the customers.
Natural hedging against foreign exchange risk. The majority 
of EVRAZ revenues are received in roubles (for sales in 
Russia) and US dollars (almost all sales in other countries). 
However, rouble prices in the Russian domestic market 
are linked to export parity, so viewed as effectively US 
dollar prices with a domestic premium in times of higher 
demand. Also, domestic sales in Russia are generally 
more profitable compared to exports due to the effect of 
transportation costs. When the Russian market performs 
well, the rouble appreciates, which leads to both increased 
costs and increased revenues in US dollar terms due to 
both the domestic premium and the higher proportion  
of domestic sales. On the other hand, when the Russian 
economy weakens, rouble production costs fall, while steel 
prices usually follow the RUB/USD exchange rate trend 
and more steel is exported. Finally, almost all of EVRAZ’s 
debt is US dollar denominated (including the Rouble bonds 
which are swapped into US dollars).
EVRAZ’s treasury function performs analysis of current 
interest rates. In the event of changes in market fixed 
or variable interest rates management may consider the 
refinancing of a particular debt on more favourable terms.

Taxation EVRAZ is exposed to tax compliance and tax management 
processes in multiple tax jurisdictions. The integrated 
nature of EVRAZ’s worldwide operations can give rise to 
uncertainty with regards to the Group’s tax liabilities and 
produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities in 
relation to the profits to be taxed in specific jurisdictions. 
Failure to manage tax risks could lead to additional tax 
charges. It could also lead to reputational damage or a 
financial penalty for failure to comply with required tax 
procedures or other aspects of tax law.
The procedures of tax risk identification and tax 
compliance are established. The Audit Committee  
reviews tax risk and compliance each half year.

Control Exercised by 
the Major Shareholder
EVRAZ is controlled by Lanebrook (the “Major 
Shareholder”), a limited liability company incorporated 
under the laws of Cyprus. As at 31 December 2011, 
the Major Shareholder held a 72.34% stake in EVRAZ. 
As a result of its controlling interest in EVRAZ, the 
Major Shareholder has the ability to exert control over 
certain actions requiring shareholder approval, including 
increasing or decreasing the authorised share capital of 
the Company (and disapplying pre-emptive rights), the 
election of directors, the declaration of dividends, the 
appointment of management and other policy decisions. 
While transactions with the Major Shareholder can benefit 
the Company, the interests of the Major Shareholder 
could at times conflict with the interests of the other 
shareholders. Any such conflict of interest could adversely 
affect EVRAZ’s business, financial condition and results  
of operations.
The board has a balance of 50% independent non-
executive directors who have a duty to protect the ‘minority 
shareholder’ regarding General Meeting resolutions, 
also to oversee and where appropriate seek independent 
valuations of any proposed ‘related party’ transactions. 
The Nomination Committee is charged with the selection 
of the Chief Executive, succession plans for key senior 
management and selection of independent non-executive 
directors.  EVRAZ plc

Business Overview Strategy Operating Review Sustainability Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
The practical expression of EVRAZ’s people 
and customer-oriented philosophy takes form 
as the Evraz Business System (“EBS”). This 
is not a rigid company-imposed procedure 
but a set of principles that have been proven 
in the day-to-day practice of excellent 
companies over many years. 
In order to preserve our competitive advantage 
and compete effectively in the global market, 
we need to create more value for our customers 
and to do so more efficiently through an 
engaged workforce. To achieve these goals will 
require a radical transformation in the way our 
organisation conducts its business, which is 
why we have introduced EBS. EBS incorporates 
Lean business principles and tools to create 
a culture of continuous improvement. Our 
goal is not just to identify possibilities of cost 
reductions, but to change the way our entire 
organisation thinks and acts.
EBS has three desired outcomes:
 To provide the customer with the highest 
quality product, at lowest possible cost, in 
a timely manner with the shortest possible 
lead times.
 To provide members with a safe work 
environment, work satisfaction and fair 
treatment.
 To give the Company flexibility to respond 
to the market, increase profit through cost 
reduction activities and achieve long-term 
prosperity.
EBS strives for the absolute elimination of 
waste in all areas to allow members to work 
smoothly and efficiently. The foundations of 
EBS are built on standardisation, to ensure 
a safe method of operation and a consistent 
approach to improving cost and quality. 
EVRAZ members are encouraged to 
continually improve their standard processes 
and procedures in order to ensure maximum 
quality, improve efficiency and eliminate 
waste. This is known as Continuous 
Improvement and with time it should be applied 
to every sphere of the Company’s activities.
With this in mind, in 2011 we introduced 
several Lean instruments into our operations, 
with the aim of improving the quality of our 
processes and I am pleased to report that 
it has resulted in tangible improvements.
EVRAZ Business 
System
The first step in setting up the new Business 
System was the introduction of the EVRAZ 
Way in 2010 – the Mission, Strategies and 
Values of our Company, focused on achieving 
results by inspiring our employees to perfect 
our processes and bring greater value to 
our customers.
Then, to help spread the new philosophy 
throughout the Group and involve our 
employees in the improvement process, 
we focused on implementing the following 
four simple tools which are established 
standards for most Lean-oriented companies:
6S
2011 was kicked off with the implementation 
of 6S, a six-step system (Sort, Set in Order, 
Scrub, Safety, Standardise, Sustain) used 
for improving the organisation of a workplace. 
A3
To analyse EVRAZ’s projects and initiatives, 
during 2011 many of our employees were 
trained in A3 Thinking – a simple and logical 
method of problem solving which helps identify 
the reasons behind any planned activity and 
link it to the company’s overall Strategy. 
A3 Thinking uses a systematic approach to 
facilitate the understanding of the current and 
target states of a problem, the gaps which need 
to be resolved and the exact steps which need 
to be taken to achieve success. Our goal for 
2012 is to have 100% of EVRAZ’s employees 
across the world trained in the use of A3s. 
VSA
In 2011 EVRAZ started using Value Stream 
Analyses to map out processes and identify 
sources of waste, unevenness and overburdens 
contained within the process mentioned before, 
as well as see opportunities for improvement. 
By understanding the Current State of a process 
and imagining an Ideal State (the simplest way 
with zero defects and no resource constraints), 
we are able to set up a plan to achieve a 
Future State.
 Resolve all safety issues 
 Change things likely to cause injury, stress 
or overburden
 Check existing safety equipment
 Improve and innovate to avoid ‘anti-work’ thinking
 A place for everything and everything in its place
 Re-paint and repair
 Make abnormal conditions obvious at-a-glance
 Label and mark out 
 Use standard health and safety (OSHA) colours
Step 4: 
Safety
Step 5:
Standardise
Step 6: 
Sustain
 Define the 6S standards
 Innovate to make it impossible to slip back
 Assign responsibilities
 Allocate time at the end of each day / shift for ‘reset’
 Audit regularly
 Manage by walking about
MCR
The introduction of Mission Control Rooms 
to manage the business was another step 
towards simplifying and optimising EVRAZ’s 
business processes. MCRs integrate and 
make visual all the business processes of 
an organisation, such as its goals, KPIs, 
activities and initiatives, financial tracking and 
countermeasure planning. Throughout 2011, 
most of EVRAZ’s facilities have put up their 
site-level MCRs and many have also begun 
using Division- and shop-level Mission Control 
Rooms and Production Control Boards. In 
November 2011, the Moscow-based senior 
management of the Company had also started 
building and utilising segment-level MCRs to 
manage the business.
Having started on its new path of long-term 
“health”, EVRAZ has begun instilling the 
elements of Lean philosophy in its processes 
and employees throughout the entire Group.
Key Targets 2012
The following sections of the report provide a 
detailed breakdown of our individual operations’ 
achievements in 2011 and objectives for 2012. 
In general for the year ahead, EVRAZ will 
continue incorporating Lean principles across 
the Group in order to reduce cost, increase 
quality and delivery, and further drive the 
philosophy of continuous improvement. The 
focus will be on continued implementation 
of EVRAZ Business System throughout 
the Group with a view to setting the 
foundations for:
 100% employee involvement in 
improvement efforts through training 
in the use of EBS tools and 6S.
 Setting up an efficient Maintenance 
System to increase machine longevity, 
lower maintenance time and costs.
 Building a Quality Management System 
to drive yield improvement and increase 
customer satisfaction.
 Building an Inventory Management System 
to decrease working capital. EVRAZ plc

Mining: Russia
EVRAZ iron ore assets include EVRAZ KGOK 
and EVRAZ VGOK in the Urals, and Evrazruda 
in Siberia. EVRAZ’s coal asset Yuzhkuzbassugol 
is located in Siberia. 
Overall 2011 performance of EVRAZ iron ore 
assets in Russia demonstrated robust positive 
dynamics: total production of saleable iron ore 
products amounted to 16.8 million tonnes 
(+9% over 2010), average labour productivity 
increased by 10.2%.
EVRAZ KGOK
EVRAZ KGOK is one of the top five largest 
ore mining enterprises in Russia. It is located 
approximately 140 kilometers from EVRAZ 
NTMK, in the Sverdlovsk region. At present 
EVRAZ KGOK conducts mining operations 
at the Gusevogorskoye deposit of titanium 
magnetite ores that contain a vanadium alloy 
component, allowing production of high-tensile 
alloyed steel products. In 2011, EVRAZ KGOK 
extracted 54.4 million tonnes of ore, its total 
output of saleable products was 9.4 million 
tonnes, including 5.9 million tonnes of pellets 
and 3.5 million tonnes of sinter.
EVRAZ KGOK continued with the programme 
to increase the production of raw iron ore in 
line with the Group’s core aim to secure raw 
materials for steelmaking. The programme will 
be finalised in 2012 providing for substantial 
upgrades in mining, transportation and 
processing equipment and practices. 
The following new equipment was put into 
operation: five electric locomotives, five 
large-capacity dump trucks, two heavy-duty 
electrical drilling rigs, 40 rail dump cars. 
This allowed it to reach production capacity 
of 55 million tonnes of mined ore per year 
(+10% compared to 2010). 
In 2011 EVRAZ KGOK finalised geological 
exploration at Sobstvenno-Kachkanarskoye 
ore deposit and submitted a recourse 
statement (Russian standard) for approval to 
the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources. 
As part of the project to explore the 
Sobstvenno-Kachkanarskoye ore deposit the 
design and engineering companies of Worley 
Parsons (Australia) and St. Petersburg Mining 
Project and Engineering Company (Russia) 
developed a 3D model of the deposit and 
basic engineering solutions to open up and 
start production in line with the highest 
international technological standards. The 
engineering solutions include a state of the 
art conveying system of ore transportation 
to the benefication plant. 
EVRAZ KGOK continued research and 
engineering works for construction of a new 
tailings facility, to be completed by 2017. 
Utilising the world’s best concentration 
technologies, the facility will provide for the 
improved storage and containment of waste 
material at a new area thus minimising the 
environmental impact. 
EVRAZ KGOK completed modernisation of 
its pellet-indurating kiln #3, decreasing gas 
consumption by 1.0 m
3
 per tonne of pellets. 
In 2011, KGOK successfully completed the 
project aimed at improving quality of pellets 
and sinter supplied to EVRAZ NTMK’s blast 
furnaces. The result was increased durability 
of pellets and sinter as well as enhanced 
EVRAZ NTMK’s efficiency.
Key Targets 2012
 Approval of the feasibility study and 
the resource statement on Sobstvenno-
Kachkanarskoye ore deposit by appropriate 
state authorities. 
 Completion of Sobstvenno-Kachkanarskoye 
ore deposit design and engineering project 
documentation to be certified by the State 
Expertise Agency, aiming to begin detailed 
design works and contracting key 
equipment suppliers to commence mine 
production in 2015.
 Finalisation of the project to increase 
the annual capacity of EVRAZ KGOK to 
55 million tonnes of raw ore in order to 
meet EVRAZ’s long-term requirements.
Evrazruda
Evrazruda comprises nine ore mining and ore 
beneficiating branches: in Kemerovo region 
(Tashtagol, Kaz, Sheregesh and Gurievsk 
mining branches, Abagur and Moundybash 
ore benefication plants), in the Khakassia 
region (Abakan and Tyoya mining branches) 
and in the south of Krasnoyarsk region (Irba 
mining branch). In 2011 Evrazruda mined 11.7 
million tonnes of ore resulting in a production 
of 4.9 million tonnes of ore concentrate 
delivered to its only corporate customer 
EVRAZ ZSMK (+15% compared to 2010).
In 2011 to meet EVRAZ ZSMK requirements 
Evrazruda upgraded ore-benefication 
technology and the lime-treatment line at the 
Abagur benefication plant, which resulted in a 
0.5% increase of metal content and reduction 
of humidity down to 4.0% in the final ore 
concentrate. This secured regular delay-free 
supplies to its EVRAZ customers especially 
in winter.
Over the year Evrazruda continued to develop 
the Sheregesh underground mine. The project, 
scheduled for completion in 2014-2015, 
is expected to double annual iron ore 
production capacity of the mine. Following the 
revisions to the project design, the timeframe 
will be reduced by two years with the 
run-of-mine production capacity now projected 
to reach 3.7 million tonnes per year by 2014. 
Significant progress was made in modernising 
the Abakan underground mine to increase its 
annual mining capacity from two million tonnes 
up to 4-6 million tonnes in the next five years. 
In 2011 design and engineering works at the 
project, which were previously assigned to 
Giprotsvetmet, were awarded to Australian 
D&E companies of Worley Parsons and 
Mining Plus. 
At the Tashtagol mine a major project of 
back-fill technology application was finished 
with works, and back-fill mining (BFM) starting 
in an operational testing mode. The essence 
of BFM technology is to fill up the mined-out 
space with hardening material, which will allow 
the mine to use up to 63 million tonnes of 
higher-grade ore previously preserved in 
surface supporting pillars. Implementation of 
this project will also increase the production 
capacity of the mine, improve the quality of 
the ore mined and will lead to a better 
operational efficiency of the Tashtagol branch. 
Commissioning of the BMT system was 
fully commissioned in March 2012. 
Evrazruda obtained a licence for the Izykhsky 
iron ore deposit. In 2011 geological exploration 
works began at the deposit aiming to complete 
a resource statement and prefeasibility study 
by the end of 2012. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011

 The ongoing Abakan mine modernisation 
project (design and engineering works, 
contracting mine construction companies 
and key equipment suppliers).
EVRAZ VGOK
EVRAZ Vysokogorsky Ore Mining and 
Processing Company (“EVRAZ VGOK”) 
operates three ore mines, sintering and 
benefication workshops. Its assets are located 
approximately 10 kilometres from EVRAZ 
NTMK in Nizhny Tagil. EVRAZ VGOK mines 
from Vysokogorskoye, Lebyazhinskoye, 
Yestyuninskoye and Goroblagodatskoye iron 
ore deposits. It also buys feedstock from 
the market. It is one of the major ore-mining 
enterprises in the Urals. EVRAZ VGOK 
produces iron ore concentrate, several types 
of sinter, limestone, natural stone and other 
products for the steelmaking and construction 
industries. It supplies finished products to 
EVRAZ steel mills NTMK and ZSMK, as well 
as to third parties mostly in the Ural region. 
In 2011 EVRAZ VGOK mined and purchased 
4.4 million tonnes of iron ore and produced 
2.4 million tonnes of saleable iron ore 
products and 1.6 million tonnes of lime-stone 
and crushed stone for construction. 
EVRAZ Business System
The introduction of Lean technology to 
improve efficiency and productivity began at 
the Company’s iron ore mining and enrichment 
facilities. More than 300 specialists and 
senior managers studied Lean and 
participated in workshop sessions focused 
on establishing a series of initiatives to be 
implemented as part of a 90-day action plan. 
Implementation of 6S principles began at all 
of the production sites in the Mining segment.
During 2011 the Company’s Mining segment 
implemented a range of programmes to 
reduce safety and environmental risk, 
including the use of third party consultants 
to conduct environmental and operational 
safety audits. In addition, the Company itself 
carried out extensive inspection and testing 
programmes relating to technical equipment 
for fire and radiation control. 
At the Abagurskaya plant of the Company’s 
Evrazruda operation a number of measures 
for the mitigation and prevention of accidents 
at the tailings dump have been completed. 
The plant has also completed modernisation 
of the gas treatment system which has led 
to a reduction of dust emissions into the 
environment by a factor of 30 times. 
Yuzhkuzbassugol
In 2011 Yuzhkuzbassugol, EVRAZ Siberian 
coal mining subsidiary, mined 6.3 million 
tonnes of coking coal and 3.0 million tonnes 
of steam coal. During the year the Company 
focused on building up reliability of its coal 
mining operations, as well as continued 
restructuring of its mining assets.
In 2011 the key investment project of VGOK 
was the development and construction of the 
Tsentralny open-pit mine. Its realisation will 
allow it to produce an additional 6.8 million 
tonnes of ore in the next eight years. In 2011 
design and engineering works were finalised 
and in 2012 the ore extraction works will 
commence. 
This project is in line with a project to increase 
the capacity of the Vysokogorsky benefication 
plant via modernisation of its ore-feeding 
facilities. 
As part of operational expense optimisation 
VGOK initiated an upgrade of the heating 
system of its Yuzhnaya mine. Being 
implemented in mid-2012 this initiative 
will result in a 60% decrease of energy 
consumption used to ventilate the mine.
In 2011, VGOK, supported by mining 
consultants from Ernst & Young, drew up a 
mid-term production optimisation programme 
that provides for 10-15% higher capacity 
utilisation in the next two years and a 
decrease in operational costs.
Key Targets 2012
EVRAZ VGOK will continue implementing the 
Tsentralny open-pit development project, 
as well as modernisation of its benefication 
plant’s feedstock and water supply systems. 
In 2012-2013, EVRAZ VGOK will carry out a 
project to build up its production of iron flux 
(a special product for EVRAZ NTMK) of up to 
1.0 million tonnes by 2014, in line with the 
EVRAZ programme to provide additional 
feedstock for EVRAZ NTMK’s BOF facilities.

In 2011, Tagaryshkaya and Yubileinaya-1 
mines were shut down, as having low strategic 
and economic value for the Company. At the 
same time the Company launched a full-scale 
project to construct the Yerunakovskaya-VIII 
mine. The required documentation (equivalent 
to a detailed feasibility study) was developed 
and approved by Russian state expertise 
agency “Glavgosexpertiza”. Currently detailed 
construction drawings have been issued, 
mining equipment is acquired, underground 
advancement and surface construction 
works are underway. The mine is expected 
to be commissioned in Q3 2013.
In respect of the Alardinskaya mine, in autumn 
2011 Yuzhkuzbassugol applied for a licence to 
develop the Alardinsky-Eastern-2 deposit (with 
reserves of 32 million tonnes of coking coal). 
The licence was awarded in March 2012. 
In November 2011, Yuzhkuzbassugol’s 
Gramoteinskaya mine applied for a licence 
to develop Mencherepsky-Northen deposit 
(215 million tonnes of steam coal reserves). 
The licence was issued in January 2012, 
securing the mine with a resource base 
that can last for decades. 
Pre-feasibility studies for the construction of 
the Tomskaya-Glubokaya mine were completed 
in 2011, and a decision on further/final 
approvals will be made during 2012.
Following the programme of upgrading 
reliability and safety of coal mining operations 
Yuzhkuzbassugol mines performed major 
modernisation, repair and replacement 
activities, including: new longwall mining 
set at the Ulyanovskaya mine; capital repair 
and replacement of the main conveyor line at 
the Abashevskaya mine; major modernisation 
of roof supports at the Abashevskaya and 
Osinnikovskaya mines; reconstruction 
of mainstream conveyor system at 
Kusheyakovskaya mine; and reconstruction 
of insulating dams at the Alardinskaya, 
Osinnikovskaya and the Gramoteinskaya 
mines. Two mobile units of nitrogen injections 
were purchased and put into operation (as a 
preventive measure against oxidation of coal 
in abandoned parts of mines). The Flexcom 
mine radio system was commissioned at 
all the Yuzhkuzbassugol mines, and all the 
mines were equipped with automatic access 
control systems. 
Significant modernisation was conducted at 
Yuzhkuzbassugol’s two coal washing plants 
helping to maintain productivity and quality of 
coal concentrate at levels set by customers. 
In Q4 2011, the implementation of EVRAZ 
Business System was initiated with extensive 
training for Yuzhkuzbassugol employees to 
familiarise them with the Lean tools and 
practices. Full-time Lean managers were 
selected and appointed, over 100 
improvements were initiated to enhance 
safety and efficiency of day-to-day operations. 
In 2012 the Yuzhkuzbassugol assets will be 
thoroughly assessed for their technical and 
economic potential and ranked in line with 
the EVRAZ strategic priorities. 
Key Targets 2012
 Further implementation of the programme 
to significantly improve production 
reliability and safety, with a focus on 
degassing and ventilation, technical 
availability of key equipment, longwall 
changeover procedures and personnel;
 Launch of a strategic programme to 
introduce at the mines the world’s most 
reliable and efficient technologies of 
directional drilling, highly effective 
degassing and ventilation, high-speed 
tunnelling, automated roof-bolting, quick 
changeovers and others
1
; and
 Development of detailed feasibility 
studies to other key mines (according 
to re-evaluated strategic priorities).
Steel: North America
EVRAZ North America 
EVRAZ North America organises its business 
into three primary product groups: Flat 
Products, Tubular Products and Long Products.
 Flat Products – The Flat Products Group 
manufactures steel plate, coil and 
structural tubing used in the construction 
of liquid storage tanks, vessels, bridges, 
rail cars, armour and in the manufacture 
of pipes. These products are manufactured 
at facilities in Portland, Oregon; Claymont, 
Delaware; Regina, Saskatchewan; and 
Surrey, British Columbia. The Flat Products 
Group also produces coil and plate used 
by the Tubular Products Group. 
 Tubular Products – The Tubular Products 
Group produces steel pipe used in energy 
applications: large-diameter American 
Petroleum Institute (‘‘API’’) grade pipe 
used for oil and gas pipelines and 
small-diameter API grade welded and 
seamless pipe for use in down-hole drilling 
and in the collection of oil and gas. These 
products are manufactured at facilities in 
Portland, Oregon; Calgary, Alberta, Red 
Deer and Camrose, Alberta; Regina, 
Saskatchewan; and Pueblo, Colorado. 
 Long Products – The Long Products Group 
produces railroad rail and rod and bar 
used to make wire products for use in 
infrastructure (e.g. bridges and power 
transmission towers) at the EVRAZ Rocky 
Mountain Steel facility in Pueblo, Colorado. 
In addition, the LPG produces round billets 
used in the production of both other long 
products and tubular products. 
In 2011, EVRAZ moved its North American 
Headquarters from Portland, Oregon to 
Chicago, Illinois to reposition its business 
closer to its customers and business partners 
and improve internal communication in the US 
and Canada.
1 The programme is to be developed, initiated and 
implemented in co-operation with international 
experts and technological companies who specialize 
in those particular areas of coal mining technologies. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011

A challenging year in our pipe operations 
driven by lack of activities in construction of 
transmission lines, was successfully mitigated 
by success in our Flat business. Our Flat 
business operations improved productivity 
and up-time performance on both east and 
west coasts.
We have successfully completed three of our 
four strategically important capital projects 
in our Tubular operations in Calgary and Red 
Deer, which began in 2011 and were focused 
on productivity increases and heat-treat 
capability expansions. A heat-treat project 
will be launched in 2012. We remain a leader 
in West Alberta in the small diameter pipe 
business and we aim to develop this 
relationship beyond our usual markets.
The major capital project underway at 
Claymont to ensure the mill’s compliance 
with environmental standards progressed 
well throughout 2011, and is expected to 
be completed in 2013.
2011 was a record year for our Long Division 
following a noteworthy achievement by our 
steelmaking operation in Pueblo, Colorado, 
coupled with a record year for our rail 
operations in terms of volume and product mix. 
Steel and Mining: 
Ukraine
In 2011 a new management company, EVRAZ 
Ukraine, was formed to unify management 
activities, to better co-ordinate EVRAZ’s 
different businesses in Ukraine and improve 
profitability. EVRAZ Ukraine manages EVRAZ 
DMZ named after Petrovsky (“EVRAZ DMZP”) 
(including Dneprokoks coking plant), coking 
plants EVRAZ Bagliykoks and EVRAZ 
Dneprodzerzhinsk Coke and Chemical Plant 
(“EVRAZ DKHZ”), EVRAZ Sukha Balka ore 
mining plant and trading facility.
EVRAZ DMZP, located in the city of 
Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, is an integrated 
steel mill specialising in the manufacture and 
sale of pig iron, steel and rolled products. 
In 2011 EVRAZ DMZ Petrovskogo produced 
860,000 tonnes of crude steel and 737,000 
tonnes of steel products.
EVRAZ’s Ukrainian operations also comprise 
three coking plants: EVRAZ Bagliykoks, 
Dneprokoks (from 1 April 2011 integrated with 
EVRAZ DMZP) and EVRAZ Dneprodzerzhinsky 
Coke and Chemical Plant (“EVRAZ DKHZ”), 
and EVRAZ Sukha Balka iron ore mine. 
The Ukrainian coking plants purchase coal and 
process it into metallurgical coke, for onward 
sale to steelmakers. The total annual capacity 
of the three plants is estimated at 3 million 
tonnes of metallurgical coke. In 2011, 
Dneprokoks, EVRAZ Bagliykoks and EVRAZ 
Dneprodzerzhinsk Coke and Chemical Plant 
produced 559,000 tonnes, 545,000 tonnes 
and 497,000 tonnes, respectively, of 
metallurgical coke.
We have increased our steelmaking 
capabilities at EVRAZ Pueblo without 
significant capital expenditure by embracing 
EVRAZ Business Systems, which is driven by 
the Lean manufacturing approach and culture.
In December 2011, we approved over 
US$32 million investments in our rail 
operations in EVRAZ Pueblo, focused on 
quality improvement, productivity and capacity 
increases. As a result, the EVRAZ Pueblo 
development will enhance our leading position 
in the rail business in North America.
Our Company-wide initiative in improving our 
working capital position, in both inventory level 
management and accounts receivable, further 
supported our competitive advantage and will 
continue in 2012.
Key Targets 2012
Through our EVRAZ Business System strategy, 
we will be focusing on improving our Tubular 
business. Our efforts will go into increasing 
productivity and first pass yield, which is very 
critical for operations profitability and working 
capital management.
Long Division will focus on delivering approved 
capital projects as it targets what is critical 
for our customers: rail quality (strengthening 
of surface etc) and volume as we plan to reach 
580,000 tonnes capacity in 2013.
As a Company our key strategic steps are 
to continue improving our health and safety 
performance, focus on our customers through 
order delivery and product quality, apply the 
EVRAZ Business Systems and implement 
growth initiatives at our East coast operations.

Business Overview Strategy Operating Review Sustainability Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
In December 2010, EVRAZ launched project at EVRAZ 
KGOK to increase iron ore extraction and production 
to 55 million tonnes per annum from the end of 2012 
(For information, please refer to page 16 of the report).
In 2011, due to further consolidation within the 
Ukrainian metallurgical market and reduced 
iron production in the region, we focused our 
efforts on securing sales and stabilising coking 
plant capacity usage to enhance efficiency and 
prolong coke battery life.
EVRAZ Sukha Balka ore mining plant is one of 
the leading Ukrainian enterprises specialising 
in iron ore underground mining. In 2011, 
EVRAZ Sukha Balka mined 2.86 million tonnes 
of iron ore and sold 2.91 million tonnes of 
sintering ore.
At EVRAZ Sukha Balka a key task has been 
to improve the work safety environment at the 
mines and reduce injury risks. We undertook 
an in-depth safety audit covering all aspects 
of risk management and safe working practice 
in order to identify and develop a priority action 
list. As a result of the findings, we partially 
removed the electricity network and changed 
the transportation system in order to exclude 
the risk of electric hazard; we also carried out 
maintenance on shafts, railway tracks and 
mining equipment to make for 
safer operations.
Key Targets 2012
In 2012, the focus for EVRAZ Ukraine will 
be on driving growth and improving its HSE 
performance. We will be progressively 
introducing new safety equipment for our staff 
and safer transportation in our mines during 
the year. We also plan new environmental 
initiatives including installing an environmental 
impact monitoring system at our coking plants 
and water recycling projects at EVRAZ DMZP 
and EVRAZ Sukha Balka.
Improving growth and productivity is the other 
priority in 2012. At EVRAZ Sukha Balka we will 
be investing in new equipment at both mines 
to improve iron ore extraction productivity 
whilst at the same time putting in place 
process improvements designed to reduce 
operational bottlenecks. 
The priority at EVRAZ DMZP will be the blast 
furnace operation enhancement to improve 
productivity and usage rates and to better 
manage the waste products. EVRAZ DMZP 
also aims to increase sales within the 
high margin Ukrainian operation through 
warehousing and logistics improvements.
Steel and Mining: 
South Africa
The continued strength of the Rand for the first 
three quarters of 2011, and relatively weak 
domestic demand created significant pressure 
on prices, while energy price increases, trade 
union actions and persistently high levels of 
inflation contributed to steeply rising costs. 
Despite government aspirations, the economy 
did not show robust growth in 2011.
EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium
EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium 
(“EVRAZ Highveld”) is a vertically integrated 
steel and vanadium slag (as a by-product 
of steelmaking) producer. Its operations 
comprise the steelworks at Emalahleni, 
Mpumalanga and Mapochs Mine at 
Roossenekal, Limpopo. It is South Africa’s 
second-largest steel maker and the country’s 
primary producer of medium and heavy 
structural sections and thick plate. In 2011, 
it produced 170,000 tonnes of plate, 117,000 
tonnes of coil, 225,000 tonnes of sections 
and 61,000 tonnes of vanadium slag.
EVRAZ Highveld worked intensively during the 
year to improve diversity at all levels across 
the Company. As a result, the Company 
secured a higher than expected Level 5 
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment 
(B-BBEE) contributor rating from the South 
African government, in recognition of the 
significant internal transformation that has 
taken place at the Company. 
In 2011, a ten-year strategic plan, that paves 
the way for greater profitability and increased 
efficiency, was signed off by the boards of 
EVRAZ and EVRAZ Highveld. 
Furnace No 7 at the iron plant was 
successfully upgraded from SAF to OSB 
technology leading to a safer and more 
efficient operation and also the ability to 
work with cheaper coal and reduced energy 
consumption whilst also producing higher 
vanadium output. During the upgrade 
period, with reduced iron production, all 
operations including the steel plant and  
all three rolling mills, were gradually shut 
down for intensive maintenance aimed  
at improving equipment availability and 
predictability. As a result both improved 
significantly and reached annual targets 
without any additional capital expenditure. 
EVRAZ Highveld demonstrated significant 
improvements in other areas of performance 
and established a solid foundation for future 
performance improvement in 2012.
Key Targets 2012
In 2012 EVRAZ Highveld plans to implement 
the first phase of developments designed to 
increase steel output by 15% and improve 
efficiency as well as to reduce costs in order 
to improve overall profitability.
Mapochs Mine
In order to increase the reliability of iron ore 
supplies to the steel plant we continued to 
mine the Uitvlugt deposit during 2011 and 
early 2012 which has enabled us to secure 
several million tonnes of material using our 
existing infrastructure. Significant geological 
work to update our iron ore reserves has 
continued at the Mapochs Mine with the 
drilling of 400 boreholes over a licenced strike 
distance of 25 kilometres. The identified 
reserves are currently under evaluation in 
order to assess their economic viability.
Key Targets 2012
A new washing and screening improvement 
project is underway with completion scheduled 
for June 2012. Once commissioned, the 
project will improve availability of the primary 
crushing plant, to over 90 per cent, and 
provide greater control of the product 
specification.
Steel: Europe
EVRAZ European steel assets, comprising 
EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel and EVRAZ Palini e 
Bertoli, delivered on all its key operational 
priorities during 2011, reorganising 
maintenance procedures, renegotiating 
energy procurement needs and optimising 
transportation needs.
The overall steel sales volumes of EVRAZ 
Europe for 2011 were 1.3 million tonnes. 
Towards the end of the year, EVRAZ 
announced its intention to consolidate all its 
European assets including EVRAZ Vitkovice 
Steel and EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli into a single 
company, EVRAZ Europe (that will manage 
both assets which will remain independent 
entities), as part of the Company’s strategy 
to develop a more profitable and efficient 
pan-European business. EVRAZ plc

EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli
EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli is a plate rolling mill 
located in San Giorgio di Nogaro, in the Udine 
province of Italy. EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli 
supplies its products to a wide range of 
customers located in Europe and North 
America. In 2011, EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli 
rolled about 425,000 tonnes of plate. 
In 2011 EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli benefited from 
various initiatives including optimisation of 
transportation and increases in slab weight. 
Despite very challenging markets, its 
performance was above internal forecasts. 
Antidumping procedure initiated in 2008 was 
finally dismissed as unsubstantiated in 2011 
reopening US markets, which had retained 
robust plate prices throughout the year.
EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel
EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel is a leading European 
manufacturer of rolled steel products located 
in Ostrava, the Czech Republic. It is one of 
Europe’s top producers of heavy plates and 
the only producer in the Czech Republic. 
In 2011, EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel produced 
about 762,000 tonnes of steel and 802,000 
tonnes of steel products. It was a record 
performance for the last three years, 
contributing an operating profit after two years 
of losses, albeit lower than budgeted for, 
because strong first half gains (mainly due to 
the ArcelorMittal pig iron contract) were offset 
during the second half of the year when plate 
prices in Europe fell on the back of lower 
European demand.
Key Targets 2012
In 2012 EVRAZ plans to consolidate its 
European business in order to further improve 
efficiency and achieve optimisation of the 
supply chain. 
A number of cost-cutting initiatives at EVRAZ 
Vitkovice Steel are aimed at achieving 
significant decreases in conversion costs 
and ensure profitability even in adverse 
market conditions.
In addition to our other targets, in 2012 we 
are focusing on improving yields, reducing 
transportation costs, headcount optimisation 
and maintenance efficiency.
Vanadium
EVRAZ’s Vanadium division achieved good 
results in 2011 due to strong demand for 
vanadium products supported by a growing 
steel market that allowed all facilities in the 
EVRAZ Vanadium division to operate at 100% 
capacities load. Strong competition led 
London Metal Bulletin (“LMB”) quotes to 
decrease from approximately US$30/kgV in 
FeV in the beginning of the year to US$24/kgV 
in FeV by the end of the year. Despite this 
EVRAZ continued to increase its share of the 
world vanadium market capitalising on its 
low-cost competitive position and ability to 
accelerate production (by debottlenecking 
initiatives at EVRAZ Vanady Tula and EVRAZ 
Vametco, inventories depletion) in response to 
customers’ requirements. As a result EVRAZ 
Vanadium division has managed to increase 
sales by approximately 35% compared to 2010 
and decrease inventories accumulated during 
crisis years. 
Implementation of debottlenecking and 
production optimisation initiatives allowed 
the division to increase productivity by 5%. 
Reflecting the continuous drive to reduce 
expenses and increase efficiency utilising 
intra-group synergies, EVRAZ remains one 
of the lowest-cost producers of vanadium 
in the world.
The key focus of the management in 2011 was 
to improve health, safety and environmental 
factors. In order to develop the culture of 
safe working conditions and philosophy of 
continuous improvements EVRAZ introduced 
EVRAZ Business Systems at all facilities. For 
more information on Lean and 6S activities 
please refer to page 33. 
EVRAZ Vanady Tula
Improvements in EVRAZ Vanady Tula’s 
management performance in 2010-2011 
led to the achievement of sustainable high 
production levels and an increase in V
2
O
5
production capacity of 7% compared to 2010. 
Another priority of EVRAZ Vanady Tula in 
2011 was the development of the tailings 
dump material utilisation process through 
EVRAZ sintering plants in order to maximise 
intercompany synergies. As a result, in 2011 
EVRAZ Vanady Tula utilised all tailings that 
were produced and did not increase its 
tailings deposits. 
During 2011, EVRAZ Vanady Tula’s HSE and 
social activities included the implementation 
of a “Clean-up” project, in addition to 6S 
activities. The project has resulted in improved 
working conditions and decrease of production 
safety risks.
Completion of the rotary kiln seal installation 
project and start up of the pulp filtration area 
reconstruction project initiated in 2011 will 
allow EVRAZ Vanady Tula to improve the 
working conditions at the plant and to raise 
pentoxide production volumes.
In 2012, EVRAZ Vanady Tula will continue 
expanding its Lean tools implementation 
and deploy the optimisation project aimed 
at improving the maintenance management 
system.

EVRAZ Nikom
One of EVRAZ Nikom’s main aims in 2011 
was to improve product quality and labour 
productivity in addition to successfully 
introducing the new improved technological 
methods which allowed an increase in 
ferrovanadium production by 36%.
EVRAZ Nikom successfully developed the 
technology of FeV50 production based on 
aluminothermy which appeared as a new 
project and proved the ability to produce 
FeV50 with high quality and yield that 
facilitated expansion of the product line 
and increased sales volumes to European 
and Asian markets. 
In 2012 EVRAZ Nikom will continue to focus 
on customers’ requests for high quality 
Ferrovanadium. A capacity increase in 2012 
by an additional 10% is targeted via the 
optimisation of the input raw materials mix, 
by using more V

 from Vametco, and 
maximising technological recovery rates.
EVRAZ Stratcor
The main goal of EVRAZ Stratcor in 2011 was 
to reduce costs and to find additional sources 
of feedstock to satisfy EVRAZ Stratcor’s 
requirements. Several alternative solutions 
for the feedstock shortage were defined by 
the end of 2011. Should the investment be 
approved construction of the facility will source 
outside oxides and non-traditional feeds to 
allow continued operations. 
One of EVRAZ Stratcor 2011’s achievements 
was development of a new specialty product, 
an electrolyte for vanadium redox batteries.
In 2012 EVRAZ Stratcor’s focus will be on 
finalisation and implementation of the solution 
to utilise EVRAZ NTMK slag to alleviate 
feedstock shortages while also acquiring 
all available feedstock from the market. 
EVRAZ Vametco
In 2011 EVRAZ Vametco’s primary efforts 
were directed at the improvement to operational 
culture, productivity increases and efforts 
to reduce detrimental ecological impacts.
Several projects designed at reducing 
atmospheric emissions and the treatment of 
ground water have already been implemented, 
or are currently in the planning stage.
Operational improvements carried out in 2011 
allowed EVRAZ Vametco to increase vanadium 
oxide (“V
2
O
5
”) production by 5%. A review of 
the Nitrovan® production process allowed the 
successful upgrading of finished goods quality 
to ensure customer satisfaction.
The implementation of Lean as part of EVRAZ 
Business System, 6S activities and training 
at the plant have resulted in a substantial 
improvement in production culture and 
operational safety.
Key Targets 2012
During 2012 the Company will seek to fully 
capitalise on its competitive advantages 
in order to further expand its presence in 
the world vanadium market. Key activities 
will include:
 Ongoing focus on health, safety and 
environmental issues at all facilities. 
HSE initiatives in 2012 will include the 
implementation of standard personal 
protective equipment at all assets and 
a pilot health improvement project at 
EVRAZ Vanady Tula. 
 The implementation of EVRAZ Business 
System tools throughout the division, 
i.e. the finalisation of the 6S roll out at all 
facilities, to create model Lean cells and 
start implementation of the total preventive 
maintenance at all sites.
 Maximisation of vanadium output at all 
of the Company’s plants. Plans for 2012 
provide for further increases in production 
of oxide at EVRAZ Vanady Tula by 3%, FeV 
and Nitrovan® production at EVRAZ Nikom 
and EVRAZ Vametco by 11% and 13% 
respectively. 
 Sales strategy will include contract 
portfolio optimization to improve margins 
by reallocating available Vanadium 
products across the markets. 
 Review of the Vanadium business growth 
strategy in order to link it to the EVRAZ 
NTMK slag production expansion plans.
 Enhance and extend marketing of EVRAZ 
value added Nitrovan® product directed 
at the global steel industry. 
 Ongoing cost optimisation and 
improvements in efficiency at all facilities.
EVRAZ is confident that the advantages of 
constant supplies of vanadium slag from 
EVRAZ Highveld and EVRAZ NTMK, a low cost 
and efficient operational base and focused 
marketing expertise will enable the Company 
to offer its enhanced range of vanadium 
products at highly competitive prices 
going forward.

Our Approach
Prior to our admission to the Main Market of 
the London Stock Exchange in November 2011 
we began a process of strengthening and 
consolidating at a Group level our processes 
for reporting our performance in the areas of 
health and safety, environmental performance, 
human capital management and community 
engagement.
This section of our report provides an overview 
of our policies and performance in these 
important areas in 2011 as well as an outline 
of how we intend to improve our performance 
in the years ahead.
Additional relevant disclosures are contained 
in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties on 
page 26 and the Corporate Governance 
Report on page 61. 
Strategy and Governance
During 2010 we established a Health Safety 
and Environment (“HSE”) Committee of the 
Board and the Committee’s membership and 
terms of reference were revised in October 
2011. The Committee is now chaired by Karl 
Gruber, Independent Director, and the other 
members are Alexander Frolov, CEO of EVRAZ 
plc, and Terry Robinson, Independent Director. 
Details of the terms of reference and activities 
of the committee are set out in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 61.
Led by the Board Committee, we are 
committed to improving our HSE performance 
through the implementation of improved 
production processes, as well as new 
management and control systems. In 2011 
we appointed our first vice president of HSE, 
Alexander Kruchinin. The role of the vice 
president is to co-ordinate the HSE function 
at Group and site level and report into the 
Board Committee on material HSE issues. 
In 2011 we adopted a new Group HSE Policy 
to standardise and improve HSE processes 
across EVRAZ.
The latest versions of the Codes of Ethics 
and Business Conduct can be found on the 
Company’s web-site.
At a site level each plant manager takes 
overall responsibility for HSE compliance, with 
the site level HSE function reporting both to 
the site management and group level HSE 
management. The HSE management system 
is subject to periodic Group level audit.
In addition to our own internal codes and 
principles, we utilise the OECD (Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development) 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to 
ensure, as far as possible, a uniform approach 
to business standards across our global 
operations. We fully endorse the provisions 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and strive, at all times, to uphold them.

Key Challenges 
As a global Company with operations spanning 
activities across the steel production chain 
we face a wide range of risks. The significant 
cultural and regulatory differences which 
exist in the countries where we operate 
also represent a challenge in ensuring the 
consistent application of policies across 
the Group. 
Based upon a review of our business, we 
believe our four most significant on-going 
challenges are:
 Health and safety – The health and safety 
of our employees is paramount. Our 
industry has inherent risk that needs to 
be managed effectively to ensure a safe 
working environment. We constantly strive 
to improve our performance by avoiding 
or by mitigating these risks. 
 The environment – Our operations have the 
potential to have significant impact on the 
environment through our production and 
use of the world’s natural resources. We 
are committed to meeting or exceeding 
legal requirements in order to reduce 
our impacts on the environment and to 
maintain our licence to operate.
 Human capital management – Retaining 
the best talent requires investment in 
the development of our employees and 
is important to securing our business 
for the long-term and drive technological 
development. 
 Community relations – We are long-term 
investors in the regions where we operate 
and are committed to ensuring that local 
communities benefit from our presence. 
Targets
As set out above, we are committed to 
improving our performance over the long-term, 
reflecting our development as a business.
During the year the HSE Committee reviewed 
EVRAZ’s performance indicators and activities 
against the challenges set out above and 
determined a number of strategic, long-term 
targets and initiatives:
 A consistent reduction in lost time injury 
frequency rate and the avoidance of any 
fatal accidents across the Group.
 Continued implementation of environmental 
health and safety management systems in 
accordance with ISO 14001 and OHSAS 
18001 across the Group to sites which 
are not currently certified.
 Improving our systems and processes 
for collecting and collating key corporate 
responsibility performance data from 
across the Group.
HSE Overview 
In March 2011 we established our first 
Group-wide Safety, Health and Environmental 
Policy. Pursuant to the policy, we aim to meet 
or exceed all applicable national legislation 
and to increase the level of industrial safety, 
labour protection and reduce our impact on 
the environment across our operations. 
During 2011 we also significantly improved 
our HSE Reporting System in order to improve 
the collection and sharing of appropriate 
data across the Group. HSE performance 
information is now submitted by subsidiaries 
to the corporate HSE Directorates on a 
monthly basis to ensure constant monitoring. 
Information on any significant incidents is 
immediately escalated to management to 
enable appropriate investigations to take place 
in order to develop preventative and corrective 
actions. We expect that the revised system will 
lead to an improvement in our ability to assess 
our HSE performance in the future.
Health & Safety Performance
We continued to deliver an improved safety 
performance in 2011 with a decline in both 
fatal accidents as well as in our LTIFR. Group 
LTIFR fell by 23% whilst our FIFR fell by 50%. 
We will continue to prioritise our performance 
in these areas in 2012.
Environmental Performance
EVRAZ’s environmental strategy aims to 
find optimal solutions for industrial waste 
management, reduce emissions and promote 
the efficient use of natural recourses.
In 2011 we spent US$85 million on measures 
to ensure environmental legal compliance 
and US$31.6 million on projects to improve 
our environmental performance. In the period 
from 2012 to 2017, the Group is committed 
to spending approximately US$303 million 
on environmental programmes across 
its operations. 
We continue to strengthen our management 
and reporting systems to enable us to collect 
comparable data on our energy consumption 
across the Group, with a view to reporting 
on our energy consumption in 2013. We are 
committed to increasing the number of sites 
that have implemented ISO 14001.
Air Emissions
Reduction of air emissions is one of the 
key environmental objectives. Our key 
emissions primarily comprise nitrogen oxides 
(NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), dust and volatile 
organic compounds (VOC), carbon monoxide 
(CO), carbon dioxide (CO
2
) and methane. We 
have made significant progress in reducing 
emissions to air at our operations through 
investments in modern technologies and 
by withdrawing obsolete equipment from 
production. As a result, we have reduced our 
key air emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
sulphur oxides (SOx), dust and volatile organic 
compounds (VOC) by 23% (37.8 thousand 
tonnes) in the period since 2009 and 14.9% 
(21.7 thousand tonnes) during 2011. 
For the graph on these key air emissions 
please refer to page 44. EVRAZ plc

The main emissions issue associated with 
our coal mining operations is the release of 
methane gas after mine degasification. The 
concentration of such methane in extracted 
air is low and therefore presents particular 
difficulties in terms of abatement. However, we 
continue to investigate solutions for minimising 
the quantity of methane emitted from our 
operations. 
Waste Management
Where possible we seek to re-use or recycle 
waste and by-products in order to minimise 
our environmental impacts whilst maximising 
operational and financial efficiencies. 
Until recently much of the waste we produced 
was simply disposed of to landfills, however 
we are developing a strategy to reduce waste 
storage volumes and to ensure proper waste 
disposal. 
In total, in 2011 we recycled or reused 
109.6%
1
 of waste and by-products from our 
non-mining assets compared to 96.6%in 
2010. We have achieved this positive result 
through a number of steps, including:
 The increase of recycling and use of our 
main metallurgical wastes: slag, scale and 
sludge. In 2011 we generated 8.6 million 
tonnes of metallurgical wastes and, in 
conjunction with the development of old 
waste deposits, were able to recycle and 
use 11.8 million tonnes of metallurgical 
wastes. As a result, in 2011 we recycled 
and used approximately 135% of the 
volume of waste metallurgical materials 
generated, 32% more than in 2010 when 
we recycled and used 9.1 million tonnes 
(103% of waste produced). 
Corporate Social Responsibility
(Continued)
 The development of new products 
containing by-products from a number of 
other operations. For example, in 2011 
EVRAZ VGOK developed a new iron flux 
consisting entirely of wastes generated 
by three different EVRAZ plants; and
 The recycling of ferrous scrap in steel 
production. For example, our North 
American assets use scrap as their main 
raw-material without impacting metal 
quality. In 2011 we recycled 3 million 
tonnes of scrap, 24.6% more than in 
2010 (2.4 million tonnes).
Our strategy for dealing with non-hazardous 
mining wastes, such as depleted rock, 
tailings and overburden is to use them for land 
rehabilitation and the construction of dams or 
roads. In 2011, we reused 46.7% (45.6 million 
tonnes) of such waste material. In 2010 this 
figure was 21.8% or 16.4 million tonnes. 
In 2012 we will be looking to increase the 
amount of waste and by-products we recycle 
even further. 
In 2011 there were no significant 
environmental incidents. We completed 
remediation and clean-up work at Evrazruda 
(Russia) in 2011 following a tailings spill 
which occurred at the end of 2010. 
Water Consumption and Wastewater 
Discharge Prevention
Our objective is to be efficient in our use 
of water. 
The total fresh water intake in 2011 
was 495.1 million cubic meters (including 
53 million cubic meters of mine waters). It is 
1% less than in 2010 (499.6 million cubic 
meters). Almost 80% of all the water was 
taken from surface sources, such as rivers, 
lakes and reservoirs. We continue to work on 
developing new strategies to minimise the 
impact of our water use. 
Human Capital
We are committed to providing equal rights 
to our employees regardless of their race, 
nationality, gender or sexual orientation. 
Differences exist in policies across our 
operations as a result of the varied traditions 
and cultures which exist in the communities 
where we operate. However, we recognise the 
importance of diversity in attracting talented 
employees and are committed to evaluating 
and standardising our performance going 
forward. 
As of 31 December 2011 we employed almost 
112,000 people across Europe, Africa and 
North America with the majority located in 
Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent 
States (“CIS”). 
Employment Practices: Attract and Retain
Competition for skilled labour in Russia and 
many of the markets in which we operate 
is intense. We strive to attract and retain 
employees by providing training and career 
development opportunities across our assets 
worldwide as we strongly believe that diversity 
and the sharing of best practice within the 
Group brings significant commercial benefits 
that will help improve our competitive position. 
We employ on the basis of job requirements 
and do not discriminate on grounds of 
age, ethnic or social origin, gender, sexual 
orientation, politics, religion or disability. We 
do not employ forced, bonded or child labour. 
We recognise the right of all employees to 
choose to belong to a union and seek to 
bargain collectively. We employ people with 
disabilities and make every effort to offer 
suitable alternative employment and retraining 
to employees who become disabled and can 
no longer perform their regular duties.

In 2011, we extended the number of 
programmes we have put in place to support 
our employees through the provision of 
benefits such as health and life insurance, 
subsidised meals, free transport to work, 
Company-supported mortgage schemes, 
retirement benefits and the provision of 
recreational activities. In 2011, we had an 
employee turnover rate across the Group 
of 8%, in line with prior years.
Employment Practices: Develop
In 2011, we increased our focus on the 
training and development of our workforce to 
ensure that employees at various levels are 
provided with the opportunity to fulfil their 
potential by developing technical, operational 
and managerial skills. 
Our educational programmes operate at three 
levels: standard training programmes for 
current managers and high potential employees 
(“HiPo”); professional training; and strategic 
tailor-made programmes based on specific 
business needs; and arranged for a certain 
group of employees worldwide regardless 
their location. 
We have also developed a structured 
approach to HiPo development and put a 
strong emphasis on identifying and developing 
the leaders of tomorrow. Talent management 
issues are supervised by a special Talent 
Committee comprising key EVRAZ executives, 
all of whom are actively involved in and 
personally responsible for, tutoring and 
overseeing a given pool of HiPos. 
A further underlying element to our employee 
development strategy is ensuring the 
preservation and wider dissemination of 
technical knowledge already held within 
EVRAZ. We have launched a special project 
designed to collate existing in-depth and up to 
date information through the identification of 
key expert individuals within the business and 
their successors. The main goal of the project 
is to ensure that critical information is passed 
on, whilst at the same time being included in 
educational materials and disseminated to 
employees throughout the Group as part of 
our in house educational system.
Employment Practices: Retain
Our programmes for our Russian employees 
included health and life insurance programmes, 
subsidised meals, free transport to work, 
company supported mortgage schemes and 
the provision of recreational activities.
EVRAZ North America also implemented a wide 
range of social programmes with a special 
focus on health care issues, retirement plans 
and various employee benefits. 
To foster better and stronger relations 
between employees, EVRAZ Highveld Steel 
and Vanadium held various employee events 
throughout the year. To address issues 
relating to health and safety, EVRAZ Highveld 
Steel and Vanadium re-launched its Wellness 
Campaign in 2011 headed up by a Wellness 
Committee whose membership comprises 
Company and trade union representatives.
The Wellness Committee identified health 
priorities which formed part of the year’s 
wellness programme including HIV/Aids, 
tuberculosis, diabetes, high blood pressure 
and others. The Wellness Programme 
delivered support through counselling for 
a variety of social, financial, emotional and 
mental health issues in 2011. EVRAZ Highveld 
also continued with its Primary Healthcare 
Policy which provided medical care to 
employees without medical insurance and free 
medical testing for HIV, tuberculosis, sugar 
and blood pressure. Anti-retroviral treatment 
for HIV was also available to employees and 
their families. 
Employee programmes in the Czech Republic 
included cultural and sports activities, health 
care programmes, life and pension insurances 
and various events.
EVRAZ New Leaders Programme
Brief overview: The EVRAZ New Leaders 
Programme began in 2009 with the goal 
of developing a new generation of senior 
management within the Company to 
ensure continuity of leadership. 
Description: The programme runs for one 
year and comprises six modules. Fifty-six 
EVRAZ employees from Russia, Ukraine, 
Czech Republic, Italy, South Africa, the US 
and Canada successfully completed the 
programme in 2011. This third year of 
tailor-made training was intended for those 
employees who have higher technical 
education and a proven track record in 
production. It focused on developing those 
managerial, engineering and technological 
skills which will enable participants to take 
senior positions within the Company in the 
future. The curriculum included lectures 
(taught by world-renowned professors), 
workshops, and group work on project 
development. The comprehensive 
programme covered many of the complex 
issues associated with business 
development, such as strategic planning, 
project management and negotiations. 
In addition, twenty-two of our current top 
managers shared their experience with the 
participants. The participants faced a real 
challenge: to develop a strategic project 
to drive the further growth of one of the 
world’s leading vertically-integrated steel, 
mining and vanadium businesses. The final 
exam consisted of presenting the project 
to EVRAZs’ top-management.
Results: 38% of those who graduated from 
the programme in 2011 have received a 
promotion. In the space of three years, 
114 employees have graduated from the 
programme 74% of whom have been since 
promoted to new positions. EVRAZ plc

Cooperation with Labour Unions 
We respect our employees’ rights and aim to 
build a constructive and positive relationship 
with the labour unions which represent them. 
All our sites operate through the collective 
bargaining agreement model. 
We generally have high levels of unionisation 
at our operations, although this can vary 
significantly across operations and countries. 
Very high levels of unionisation exist at our 
South African and Ukrainian operations. For 
example 92% of EVRAZ Highveld’s staff and 
100% of employees of Bagleykoks belong to 
trade unions. Whilst at EVRAZ Palini only 
21.9% of employees are union members and 
across EVRAZ North America unionisation is 
approximately 58%. In Russia approximately 
75% of workforce is unionised and we are 
an active member of the Russian Steel 
Manufacturers Association through which 
we work with the Russian Mining and 
Metallurgical Trade Union.
Internal Communications
We are committed to keeping our employees 
informed of major corporate developments as 
much as possible ensuring they understand 
and are aligned with our business strategy. 
EVRAZ has a well-developed internal 
communications system. We maintain an 
anonymous whistle blowing system, that 
allows employees to confidentially raise 
questions and concerns, including internal 
surveys, suggestion boxes and a special 
anonymous hotline. 
Community Investments
EVRAZ believes in supporting and engaging 
with the communities where it operates and 
where its employees and their families live and 
work. EVRAZ sees contribution to the social 
and economic development of these areas as 
its responsibility and a key determinant of its 
long-term success. 
Any charity or donation is conditional upon an 
approval request through the Group’s internal 
procedures and its approval from a designated 
compliance officer. Assistance to schemes 
which meet our criteria is provided through 
charitable foundations established by the 
Company and managed by local Supervisory 
Boards. Membership of these Boards 
comprises entirely of local community 
representatives and their activities are 
audited annually. 
EVRAZ Charity Funds operate in Russia 
(Siberia and the Urals), Czech Republic, South 
Africa and the United States. Many projects 
EVRAZ supported in Russia in 2011 included 
support for children with special needs, 
especially those afflicted by cerebral palsy. We 
have historically prioritised support for children 
with cerebral palsy as treatment for this 
condition has been neglected in Russia. We 
are currently broadening our focus to include 
children with other special needs as well. Our 
projects have focused on providing essential 
equipment for day care centres, career 
development and healthy lifestyle promotion 
programmes for youth, such as 
the construction of playgrounds. 
The EVRAZ Charity Fund in the Czech Republic 
was established in 2006 and supports the 
long-term development of the Moravian-Silesian 
region. In 2011 donations were directed 
towards medical, educational and psychological 
support for children suffering from various 
disabilities of the central nervous system.
Corporate Social Responsibility
(Continued)
Yuzhkuzbassugol Training Centre 
EVRAZ takes pride in its professional 
growth programmes, using innovative 
methods to advance its employees 
knowledge and skills. Having certain skills 
can be paramount to providing employee’s 
safety, especially in mining operations. 
A cutting edge Center for Professional 
Development has been functioning at the 
coal mining company Yuzhkuzbassugol 
since the 1970s. The Center serves as a 
training facility not only for Yuzhkuzbassugol 
but for other mining companies as well. 
A model of a belt type conveyor and a 
special class for radio communication were 
built for practice. In 2010-2011 the Center 
introduced a new and unique multimedia 
programme, which covers various aspects 
of training, including allowing miners to 
learn how to operate a tunnelling machine 
in a computer game-like environment.  EVRAZ plc

During 2011, EVRAZ’s social investments in 
South Africa were distributed by the EVRAZ 
Highveld eMalahleni Community Forum, which 
was established in July 2010 and officially 
launched in August 2011. The eMalahleni 
Community Forum targets the most vulnerable 
members of the communities within which 
EVRAZ Highveld operates and will primarily 
focus on social development, education and 
health issues. 
In particular, we are supporting a hydroponics 
and agricultural project, which combines 
realistic, alternative work opportunities for local 
people whilst also improving access to basic 
nutrition. This project, in the 60-household 
village of Makwana, was established in 2011 
to support emerging agricultural activities 
which are hampered by a water shortage. 
After providing training for villagers in 2011, 
a hydroponics and agricultural hub will be 
established in 2012 as a training centre and 
local market that can provide a reliable outlet 
of fresh produce from households in the area.
In Canada, EVRAZ is involved with 
several non-profit organisations, including 
The United Way, Junior Achievement and 
others, addressing a variety of issues, such 
as family violence, drug abuse and education. 
EVRAZ also supports the Canadian Cancer 
Society’s Relay for Life, an annual event that 
helps celebrate cancer survivors. In the United 
States EVRAZ supports several local NGOs 
including local scouts’ chapters, child abuse 
prevention programmes, an autism awareness 
campaign, education initiatives – including 
financial literacy training – and programmes 
that provide assistance to the needy. 
Transformation in South Africa 
EVRAZ Highveld has significantly increased 
diversity across all levels and has successfully 
improved its Broad-Based Black Economic 
Empowerment (“B-BBEE”) scorecard 
performance as a result. EVRAZ’s B-BBEE 
scorecard score is now at Level 5 compliance 
(55.48) compared to Level 8 (30.34) in 2010. 
This has been delivered through the 
establishment of a transformation division 
in 2010 which has implemented a range 
of activities such as improving the 
representation of historically disadvantaged 
people in senior management structures, 
the development of education programmes, 
preferential procurement agreements and 
support for the development of local black 
owned businesses as preferred suppliers.
The target for 2012 is a score of 58. Employee 
input in transformation initiatives was enhanced 
in 2011 with the establishment of a Diversity 
and Inclusion Forum. The Forum, whose 
membership comprises employees and union 
representatives, is involved in transformation, 
skills development, equal opportunities and 
remuneration and awards matters.
Helping Children with Special Needs
Description: EVRAZ Charity Funds in 
Russia and the Czech Republic pay special 
attention to providing support for children 
with special needs, especially those with 
cerebral palsy. Several innovative projects 
had been introduced in 2011. EVRAZ 
funded a centre for hippotherapy in Nizhniy 
Tagil – a special kind of physical therapy 
where a trained horse is used for 
children’s treatment – and a Lekoteka in 
Novokuznetsk (a centre for children with 
special needs that combines treatment 
with education through games). A new 
and promising approach was introduced 
in Nizhniy Tagil as a result of EVRAZ’s 
support: therapy through storytelling. 
Other types of activities included art 
therapy and aquatic therapy (swimming). 
In Novokuznetsk EVRAZ helped parents 
of children with cerebral palsy to establish 
a regional advocacy group that works to 
raise awareness about the disabled and 
the issues they are facing.  EVRAZ plc

In October 2009 EVRAZ began implementation of a PCI technology 
in the blast furnace at EVRAZ NTMK. The use of PCI technology at 
EVRAZ NTMK should lead to higher revenues from extra coke sales 
and lower hot metal production costs, because of the savings 
generated by using PCI fuel in place of natural gas and reducing 
the amount of coke used.
The project scope includes: coal storage, batching and 
transportation, PCI fuel production and injection.
Construction is underway and commissioning works will start in 
August 2012 and the project will be finished by the end of 2012.  Business Overview Strategy Operating Review Sustainability Financial Review Governance Financial Statements

Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group on pages 84 to 151 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”), as adopted by the European Union. The presentation currency is US dollars. 
Overview 
We delivered a solid financial performance in 2011, increasing revenues by 22% to US$16.4 billion and our EBITDA to US$2.9 billion, despite the 
volatile market environment. 
We also successfully reduced our net debt by 10% to US$6,442 million as of 31 December 2011. 
A further key achievement was the Company’s successful incorporation in the UK during 2011 with a Premium Listing on the Main Market of the 
LSE. As a result, on 7 December 2011 EVRAZ became a FTSE 100 company and the only steel stock in the UK FTSE All-Share Index. 
The listing is enabling us to broaden our shareholder base and provide us with a greater access to international capital markets for our funding 
requirements.

Revenues grew by 22% to US$16.4 billion, driven primarily by price increases, particularly for steel products. Stronger revenues and a higher proportion 
of value-added products within the revenue mix had a positive impact on EBITDA, which increased 23% year-on-year to US$2.9 billion. Whilst the Steel 
division was the major contributor to revenue growth, our mining operations were responsible for more than half the Group’s EBITDA, reinforcing the 
value of a strong raw materials asset base.

Despite such growth in EBITDA, the net profit attributable to equity holders of EVRAZ plc in 2011 was US$461 million compared with US$486 
million in 2010, a decrease of 5%. This is due to the fact that our net profit line in 2011 was negatively affected by one-off items. In H1 2011 
we booked a loss of US$161 million relating to the successful incentivised conversion of our 2014 convertible bonds. In H2 2011 we incurred 
US$19 million of expenses for obtaining the Premium listing on the London Stock Exchange. Without these items our 2011 net profit would have 
been US$633 million. Our H1 2011 profit was also affected by US$71 million of charges on early repurchase of our 2013 Eurobonds. 
Cash Costs
With regard to our cost structure, raw materials and goods for resale represent over 50% of our operating expenses and these costs are largely 
dependent on commodity prices and the wider market environment. Auxiliary materials, contractor services, production labour and energy 
account for a further 40% and have been subject to inflation during the year.
With regard to personnel expenses for 2012, we have reached agreements with our Russian operations on wage increases to take effect twice 
a year, in March/April and October. Wage increases in our operations are agreed at a level of 10-12% for the year in the CIS, and 2-3% for our 
international operations.
Capital Requirements
In addition to meeting its working capital requirements, EVRAZ expects that repayments of outstanding debt, capital expenditure, acquisitions 
and dividend payments will represent the Company’s most significant use of funds over the coming years. 
Our capital expenditure programme is focused on the reconstruction and modernisation of existing production facilities in order to reduce costs, 
improve process flows and expand the product range. 
We spent US$1.28 billion on total capital expenditure in 2011 compared with US$832 million in 2010, an increase of 54% due to renewed 
investment in modernisation projects and mine development. 
Cash Flow
EVRAZ’s operations delivered strong cash performance, generating substantial operating cash flows of US$2.6 billion in the period, an 
increase of 59% over the previous year. US$1.2 billion of cash flows were used in investing activities, related to own capital expenditure 
and a further US$1.3 billion were used for financing activities, principally the payment of interest and dividends. This represented a 
significant increase of 42% over 2010 as we made our first dividend payment since 2008, consisting of an interim dividend and a special 
dividend, which amounted to $491 million.

Financial Review Overview
(Continued)
Net Debt
Over the past three years, EVRAZ has focused on financial management with the objective of reducing its total level of debt and replacing its 
short-term debt with longer-term debt to better match its funding to its planned long-term capital expenditure. As a result, in 2011 we undertook 
a number of refinancing transactions which amounted to a total of approximately US$2 billion: 
 US$850 million of new 6.75% Eurobond due 2018 issued in May 2011. We used part of the proceeds from this issue to purchase 
approximately US$622 million of the outstanding bonds due in 2013 
 20 billion rouble-denominated Bonds (approximately US$721 million) placed in June 2011 at 8.40% to take advantage of the Rouble bond market. 
These were swapped into US dollars at rates of 4.45 – 4.60%.
 A 5-year US$500 million unsecured credit facility from Gazprombank closed in October 2011 used to prepay the existing US$300 million 
secured loan
 A 5-year US$610 million revolving facility signed with a consortium of banks by our North American subsidiaries at a record-low 1.5% to 2% 
over LIBOR.
In June 2011, we also incentivised a conversion of US$650 million of convertible bonds due in 2014. These transactions helped the Company 
to reduce its peak maturities in 2013 and 2014 and extend the average maturity across the debt portfolio, as well as to reduce our consolidated 
indebtedness and the average cost of debt. 
Net debt at the end of the period was US$6,442 million compared to US$7,184 million at the end of 2010, a decrease of 10% year-on-year. 
Furthermore, we have significantly reduced our short-term debt from US$2 billion in December 2009 to US$626 million at the end of 2011.
The average maturity of our debt is now 3.8 years, up from 3.4 years in June 2009.
As a result of our improved financial position, EVRAZ’s credit ratings have been upgraded to B+, Stable from S&P, to Ba3, Stable from Moody’s 
and to BB-, Stable from Fitch.
To manage liquidity risk, our target is to maintain a level of liquidity of above US$1 billion at any time. This is cash as well as any undrawn credit 
facilities which can be rolled-over for a long-term period.
Dividends
On 10 October 2011 the EVRAZ Board approved a new dividend policy. Under the revised dividend policy EVRAZ is targeting a long-term average 
dividend payout ratio of at least 25% of the consolidated net profit calculated in accordance with IFRS and adjusted for non-recurring items. 
Dividends are expected to be paid semi-annually. In addition to the regular dividend payments, the Company may also employ special dividends 
from time to time at the discretion of the EVRAZ Board to return surplus capital to shareholders.
On the back of our strong financial results, during 2011 Evraz Group S.A. made its first dividend payment since 2008, paying an interim dividend 
of US$0.60 per share/US$0.20 per GDR and a special dividend of US$2.70 per share/US$0.90 per GDR. EVRAZ plc has also declared a cash 
final dividend of US$0.17 per share. This gives a total ordinary dividend for 2011 of US$317 million, which is approximately 50% of net profit 
adjusted for non-recurring items.
Exchange Rate Changes
The Group’s exposure to currency risk is disclosed in Note 29 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The currency risk is mostly related to the 
fluctuations of the Russian rouble against US dollar.
Average exchange rates Exchange rates at 31 December
2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009
USD/RUB 29.3874 30.3692 31.7231 32.1961 30.4769 30.2442
EUR/USD 1.3920 1.3240 1.3948 1.2939 1.3362 1.4406

USD/UAH 7.9677 7.9355 7.7916 7.9898 7.9617 7.9850
The USD/RUB rate was somewhat volatile during 2011, with the rouble strengthening towards the middle of the year and weakening again in the 
second half of 2011. This contributed to increasing the costs at our Russian subsidiaries compared to 2010.
Our policy is not to take any specific hedging measures to mitigate fluctuating exchange rates, because we believe that our business is to a large 
extent naturally hedged against foreign exchange risk. The majority of EVRAZ revenues are received in roubles (for sales in Russia) and US dollars 
(almost all sales in other countries). However, rouble prices in the Russian domestic market are linked to export parity, so viewed as effectively 
US dollar prices with a domestic premium in times of higher demand. Also, domestic sales in Russia are generally more profitable compared to 
exports due to the effect of transportation costs. When the Russian market performs well, the rouble appreciates, which leads to both increased 
costs and increased revenues in US dollar terms due to both the domestic premium and the higher proportion of domestic sales. On the other 
hand, when the Russian economy weakens, rouble production costs fall, while steel prices usually follow the RUB/USD exchange rate trend 
and more steel is exported. Finally, almost all of EVRAZ’s debt is US dollar denominated (including the Rouble bonds which are swapped 
into US dollars). EVRAZ plc

Financial Expenses 
Our interest expense relating to debt in 2011 was US$654 million, a decrease of 2% compared with US$670 million in 2010 due to a reduction 
in total debt. We also realised a gain of US$66 million from the cross-currency swaps on the rouble bonds. This means effectively an interest 
expense of US$588 million, which includes amortisation of debt issue costs.
Income Tax
Our income tax expense amounted to US$420 million compared to US$163 million in 2010. EVRAZ’s effective tax rate, defined as income tax 
expense (benefit) as a percentage of profit (loss) before tax, increased from 25.8% in 2010 to 48.1% in 2011. EVRAZ’s income tax expense 
in 2010 was partially offset by a benefit of US$142 million relating to enacting a new tax code in Ukraine. In 2011, the US$161 million expense 
related to the incentivised conversion of the 2014 convertible bonds and the US$71 million of premium paid in the tender of the 2013 Eurobonds 
were not deductible.
Outlook 
Given the challenging outlook for the industry, we continue carefully to monitor and proactively address any potential issues of future compliance 
with the covenants associated with the Company’s financial indebtedness. Furthermore, EVRAZ continues to have substantial financial headroom, 
having in excess of US$800 million of cash on our balance sheet at the end of 2011 as well as significant liquidity available in committed and 
uncommitted credit lines to support our operations and investment plans. The successful placement of US$600 million of 2017 Eurobonds at 
a coupon of 7.40% in April 2012 only helped to strengthen our financial position in preparing for our 2013 maturities.

Corporate Governance Report 
Introduction
EVRAZ plc is a public company limited by shares incorporated in the United Kingdom. In 2011 pursuant to a share exchange offer with 
EVRAZ Group S.A., EVRAZ plc became the new ultimate holding company of the Group, and Evraz Group S.A. became a subsidiary of the 
Company. The Company’s shares were admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities on 7 November 
2011, becoming eligible for entry into the FTSE 100 Index and affirming the Company’s commitment to high standards of corporate governance 
and control. As part of the listing process, the Company made a number of amendments to its governance documents and Board Committee 
charters in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and best practice. Additionally the Company established a Nominations Committee 
prior to the Company’s admission to trading.
Further information on the Company’s Corporate Governance policies and principles are available on our website: www.evraz.com. The UK 
Corporate Governance Code is available at www.frc.org.uk. 
Compliance with Corporate Governance Standards 
Since its admission to listing on the London Stock Exchange’s main market, EVRAZ’s approach to corporate governance is primarily based on the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The Company follows the “comply or explain” approach and 
complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code or, if it does not comply, explains the reasons for non-compliance. 
As of 31 December 2011 we comply with all the principles and best practice provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code with the following 
exceptions:
 Contrary to provisions A.2.1 and A.3.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Chairman does not meet the independence criteria set out 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code. However, the other Directors consider that Alexander Abramov’s long-term relationship with the Group 
and his importance to it mean his presence as Chairman is in the best interests of Shareholders. The presence of independent non-executive 
directors on the Board also helps to ensure that there are appropriate checks and balances in place. 
 Contrary to provision C.3.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, only two of the three members of the Audit Committee were independent 
non-executive directors during 2011. Olga Pokrovskaya is a member of the Audit Committee, but does not meet the independence criteria 
set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. Since more than 50% of EVRAZ activities and operations are based in the Russian Federation, 
Olga Pokrovskaya’s technical and regional experience and qualifications, as a past senior audit manager at Arthur Anderson and as Head of 
Corporate Finance at Sibneft, is of particular value to the Committee and her experience would be extremely difficult to replicate, particularly 
as EVRAZ is seeking to strengthen diversity on its Board. The Company considers that, in light of her involvement with the Group over a 
number of years and her experience in this area, her membership of the Audit Committee is to the benefit of the Group. Furthermore, on 
28 February 2012 Sir Michael Peat, an independent non-executive director, was appointed to the Audit Committee, and the Company has 
therefore been compliant with provision C.3.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code since that date. 
 Contrary to provision D.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, only two of the five members of the Remuneration Committee were 
independent non-executive directors during 2011. Mr. Abramov and Mr. Tenenbaum are members of the Remuneration Committee, but do not 
meet the independence criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. However, independent non-executive directors comprise the 
majority (these are Mr. Baxter (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee), Mr. Gruber and Mr. Izosimov) and, when matters affecting their 
membership of the Board and Mr. Abramov’s chairmanship of the company are discussed, Mr. Abramov and/or Mr. Tenenbaum (as applicable) 
will not be present, as required.
Board of Directors 
The Board of EVRAZ plc was formed upon its incorporation on 14 October 2011. Prior to this date, the Group was controlled by Evraz Group S.A. 
which was responsible for governance and management of the Group. In 2011, EVRAZ plc held four Board meetings between its incorporation and 
31 December 2011. Evraz Group S.A. held 11 meetings during the year prior to the listing of EVRAZ and a further three meetings between that 
date and 31 December 2011.
The members of the Board of EVRAZ plc as at 31 December 2011 were: Alexander Abramov (Chairman), Alexander Frolov (CEO), 
Olga Pokrovskaya, Eugene Shvidler, Eugene Tenenbaum, Duncan Baxter, Karl Gruber, Terry Robinson and Sir Michael Peat.

attended one out of the three meetings. The Audit Committee meeting held on 20 April 2012 was attended via a conference call by all members of the Committee.
Board Balance and Independence
As at 31 December 2011, the Board of EVRAZ plc consisted of nine members, comprising eight non-executive directors and one executive 
director. In addition, on 28 February 2012, Alexander Izosimov was appointed to the Board as an additional non-executive director. During 2011, 
there were four members of the Board (those other than Alexander Frolov, Alexander Abramov, Olga Pokrovskaya, Eugene Shvidler and Eugene 
Tenenbaum) that were deemed to be independent in character and judgement pursuant to the UK Corporate Governance Code and free from any 
business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. In reaching its determination of 
independence, the Board concluded that each one provided an objective challenge to management and was willing to stand up to defend their 
own beliefs and viewpoints in order to support the ultimate good of the Company and there were no relationships or circumstances likely to 
affect, or which could have appeared to affect, the judgement of any of its independent non-executive directors. 
For completeness, the Board did consider an arm’s length business arrangement between one of the non-independent directors and the son of 
Sir Michael Peat, the senior independent director of the Company, and satisfied itself that this arrangement has no impact on Sir Michael Peat’s 
independence. Since the appointment of Alexander Izosimov in February 2012, at least half of the members of the Board are independent 
non-executive directors in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Company regards this as an appropriate board structure. 
The Company notes the Financial Reporting Council’s recent announcement to amend the UK Corporate Governance Code to strengthen the 
principle of boardroom diversity.

Activities in 2011 
The Committee’s principal activities during 2011 including the activities of both Evraz Group S.A. Audit Committee and EVRAZ plc Audit 
Committee were:
Financial Reporting
 Considering the issues and financial reporting timelines and processes relating to the Group and reporting obligations following the primary 
listing of EVRAZ plc. 
 Considering matters relating to the Committee’s recommendation to the Board relating to annual Financial Statements for the year ended 
December 2010 and the audited half year statements as of June 2011, including consideration and testing:
– The Going Concern review;
– The Impairment review of operating assets and goodwill; and
– Other significant accounting judgements and management estimates.

auditors the Management Letter.

 Similarly considering matters relating to the Committee’s review and recommendation to the Board with regard to EVRAZ plc’s unaudited 
Financial Statements and, the inclusion thereof, in the unaudited Preliminary Results Statement for the year to December 2011, together with 
reviewing the draft 2011 Analysts’ presentation. In addition to considering and testing the Impairment review and the significant accounting 
judgements and management estimates, the Audit Committee, as a result of the uncertainty and instability of the current economic climate 
considered various sensitized group cash flow models, together with a detailed review of the Group’s borrowing covenants. As a consequence, 
the Audit Committee reported to the Company’s directors that after their due and careful consideration and approval, it was appropriate that 
there was a reasonable expectation that the Group had adequate liquidity and resources to support the going concern Basis of Preparation of 
the Financial Statements.
Since 31 December 2011, the Audit Committee’s activities were:
 Reviewing the Company’s 2011 Annual Report, its Financial Statements, operating and financial review, Directors’ Report and other reports 
for consistency with the Financial Statements and regulatory requirements, and recommending the Annual Report for the approval of the 
Company’s directors.
Risk Management
 Reviewing the Group’s key risks as detailed and evaluated in the Group’s risk register together with the appropriateness of the scope and 
nature of the management’s agreed risk mitigating actions.
External Auditors 
 Reviewing the external auditor’s terms, independence and scope of engagement and the external audit fee.

Non-Audit Services 
As reported in previous years, the Group engages accountancy firms for due diligence work in connection with acquisitions and capital market 
transactions and for tax advice. Where such services are provided by the external auditors, at the discretion of management, the Committee has 
agreed fee limits for the engagement of non-audit services. The limit for such management discretion is for non-audit fees of US$25,000 or less 
than US$100,000 in aggregate during the financial year. 
In instances where these limits would be exceeded, on the request of management, prior approval to such engagements is required together with 
the detail and scope of such engagement mandates and corresponding fees. Such approval is given after proper enquiry in the first instance by the 
Audit Committee Chairman and then by subsequent Audit Committee approval. Generally non-audit engagements are subject to a tender process. 
The Committee has recorded with management that it is uncomfortable with the current level of non-audit fees, particularly in comparison with 
the audit fee. The 2011 audit fee has been increased on a one-off basis by the interim audit connected with the Company’s primary listing. 
Similarly the 2011 non-audit fee has been bolstered by significant capital market engagements relating to the Group’s primary listing on the 
London Stock Exchange, such fees being the normal responsibility of a Company’s external auditor. While the Audit Committee does not believe 
the independence of the external audit is compromised, if engagement of the external auditors for consultative work continues at the 2011 level, 
there is a danger that the question of independence of the external advisors will increase, in perception if not in reality.
The cause of the increase is that as part of the Group’s Project Lean, the external auditor is engaged on a number of separate productivity 
initiatives and the key issue driving the level of non-audit fees is the scarcity within the CIS of alternative economic and qualified consultants. 
The Audit Committee has requested management to investigate alternative consultative processes.

Risk Management and Internal Control
Risk Management
The Group’s business and operations are exposed to various business risks. While a number of these risks are operational or procedural in 
nature, several of these risks are inherent in the character and jurisdiction of the Group’s international business activities, while others relate 
to changes in the global economy and are largely outside management’s control. 
As a structured and coordinated Group-wide governance approach, the Group’s executives have created an enterprise risk management process 
(ERM) designed to identify, quantify, respond to and monitor the consequences of an executive agreed risk schedule that encompasses both 
internal and external critical risks. This process is consistent with the listing rules published by the UK Financial Services Authority and is based 
on the Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control. 
The ERM process is fully supported by the Board, the Audit Committee and executive management. Senior management, tasked with the 
development of the ERM process, identified key risk elements and, in order to further risk management accountability, assigned ownership of 
the relevant risk areas to senior managers according to their designated functions. 
As a result of the ERM process, a Risk Committee, under the chairmanship of the Audit Committee Chairman and including within its membership 
the Group CEO and vice presidents, is established and mandated to have oversight of the Group’s risk profile and supervise the entire risk 
management process including response procedures. 
The Group’s executive management is responsible for embedding the agreed Risk Management related internal controls and mitigating actions 
throughout the entirety of the Group’s business and operations and through all levels of management and supervisory personnel. Such practices 
serve to encourage a risk conscious business culture.
We apply the following core principles to the identification, monitoring and management of risk throughout the organisation:
 Risks are identified, documented, assessed, monitored, tested and the risk profile communicated to the relevant risk management team on 
a regular basis. 
 Business management and the risk management team are primarily responsible for ERM and accountable for all risks assumed in their 
operations. 
 The Board is responsible for assessing the optimum balance of risk through the alignment of business strategy and risk tolerance on an 
enterprise-wide basis.
 All acquired businesses are brought within the Group’s system of internal control as soon as practicable. OAO Raspadskaya, in which the 
Group indirectly holds a 40% interest, is not within the Group’s system of internal control.
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee was established on 14 October 2011 prior to the Company’s admission to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s main 
market and the terms of reference were approved by the Risk Committee on 30 November 2011.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Terry Robinson, a non-executive director, also chairs the Risk Committee. Further members of the Risk 
Committee include the relevant senior and executive management of EVRAZ plc with accountability for delivering appropriate business and 
operation risk management mitigation actions as part of their functional responsibility. Furthermore, the Committee invites Head of Group 
Internal Audit, members of senior management and Audit Committee members to attend all its meetings.
The Committee meets at least twice a year at appropriate times and at other times as required. 
The Committee’s role is one of oversight and supervision of the Group’s risk profile and risk framework. It is tasked with reviewing the overall 
risk profile and resulting Risk Register of the Group for completeness and monitoring the related risk management actions and risk event 
management ownership within the divisions, functions and at corporate level.
Responsibilities of the Risk Committee include:
 Reviewing annually the Group’s internal control and assurance framework to satisfy itself on the design and completeness of the framework 
relative to the Group’s activities and risk profile;
 Considering and recommending to the Board for approval via the Group Chief Executive and/or the Committee chairman parameters for the 
Group’s risk appetite;
 Reviewing and monitoring the Group’s risk profile and the appropriateness of the Group’s risk measurement systems;
 Reviewing the completeness of the Group’s Principal Risk Categories and appropriateness of the supporting documentation and approving the 
creation of new Key Risk Categories in the Risk Register; and
 Receiving and reviewing reports that assess the nature and extent of risks facing the Group.
During 2011, the Risk Committee reviewed and updated the Group’s risk matrix together with related risk mitigating actions and delivered its 
proposals to the Board for consideration and adoption. The Committee also recommended the development of a risk appetite profile based 
on the Group’s Impact and Probability risk matrix. Both the risk appetite and the Probability risk matrix with mitigating actions were adopted. 
Additionally, regional executive risk committees were established in North America and South Africa to enhance the risk identification process 
using a bottom up approach to complement the top down approach which was used for initial risk identification and assessment and preparation 
of the Group risk register in 2011. 
The Committee also reviewed plans to extend the risk management process to the entity-level during 2012. 
Controls
EVRAZ’s internal control systems have been designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Consistent with its governance policies, the Group 
continues to improve the process through which the effectiveness of its internal control system can be regularly reviewed as required by provision 
C.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The process enables the Board and the Audit Committee to review the effectiveness of the system 
of internal controls in place within the Group to manage significant business, operational and financial risks (including, environmental, safety and 
ethical risks) throughout the year.

Internal Audit
Internal audit is an independent appraisal function established by the Board to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls, systems and 
procedures, within EVRAZ plc, in order to reduce business risks to an acceptable level in a cost effective manner. 
The latest version of the Internal Audit Charter of EVRAZ plc was approved by the Board on 13 December 2011. The role of internal audit in the 
Group is to provide an independent, objective, innovative, responsive and effective value-added internal audit service through a systematic and 
disciplined approach by assisting management in controlling risks, monitoring compliance, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of internal 
control systems and governance processes. 
In 2011, EVRAZ’s Head of Internal Audit attended all the meetings of the Audit Committee and addressed any reported deficiencies in internal 
control as required by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee continued to engage with executive management during the year to monitor 
the effectiveness of internal control and accordingly considered certain deficiencies that had been identified in internal control together with 
management’s response to such deficiencies. The Audit Committee also agreed timelines for effecting the proposed corrective actions in respect 
of the aforementioned deficiencies. 
The annual internal audit programme is predominantly risk-based and in 2011 incorporated particular assignments and priorities agreed by the 
Audit Committee. Further, the scope of the 2011 annual internal audit plan included a review of the internal control systems of newly acquired 
trading subsidiaries as considered appropriate for effective risk management.
The Company’s internal audit is structured on a regional basis, reflecting the developing geographic diversity of the Group’s operations. In the 
light of this the head office internal audit function has furthered implementation of common internal audit practices throughout the Group. 
During 2011 the internal audit function worked in cooperation with Ernst & Young, EVRAZ’s external auditor, in conducting their respective 
responsibilities for the Group. In 2011 KPMG conducted a quality assessment review of EVRAZ’s internal audit function in Russian Federation 
and Ukraine, and the Institute of Internal Auditors (the IIA) in US and Canada, to attest the conformity of EVRAZ’s internal audit activity with the 
International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal auditing developed by the Institute of Internal Auditors as well as best practice in 
internal auditing. Based on this review KPMG and the IIA issued reports with the assessment of the respective EVRAZ’s Internal audit activities. 
Recommendations of these reports contributed to further refinement of the function. 
Further information regarding the Company’s internal control processes can be found on the Company’s website.
Conﬂicts of Interest
Alexander Abramov is the Chairman of the Company and Alexander Frolov is the CEO. Olga Pokrovskaya, Eugene Shvidler, Alexander Abramov 
and Alexander Frolov have been appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company by the major shareholder pursuant to the terms of the 
relationship agreement. The indirect and direct shareholdings of these Directors in the share capital of the Company are set out in the Directors’ 
Report. No other conflicts of interests exist between the private interests of the Directors or Members of Senior Management and their duties to 
the Company.
Relations with Shareholders
An ongoing dialogue with stakeholders is an essential aspect of corporate activity. We use various communication channels including, in terms 
of financial calendar reporting and disclosure, announcements made via the London Stock Exchange (the LSE), the Annual Report and Accounts, 
the Annual General Meeting (“the AGM”) and the Company’s website www.evraz.com.
The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, senior management and the investor relations team regularly engage with institutional investors 
to discuss the Company’s operations and a wide range of issues including governance. Approximately 210 individual/group meetings, 
conferences and other public events involving the investment community took place during 2011.
The senior independent director is available to shareholders if they have concerns that have not been resolved by contact through the normal 
channels of chairman, chief executive or finance director or for which such contact is inappropriate.
Constructive use of Annual General Meeting
The AGM is an opportunity for shareholders to communicate with the Board and the Board welcomes their participation. The Chairman and the 
respective Chairmen of the respective Committees will be present at the AGM to answer shareholders’ questions. The next AGM will be held 
on 18 June 2012.
Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the next AGM can be found in the Notice of AGM. The Board has determined that voting on all 
resolutions at the AGM will be by way of a poll. Each member present in person or by proxy has one vote for each fully paid ordinary share 
of which she/he is a holder.
Information Pursuant to the Takeovers Directive
The Company has provided the additional information required by DTR 7.2.7 (directors interests in shares; appointment and replacement 
of directors; powers of the directors; restrictions on voting rights and rights regarding control of the Company) in the Directors’ Report.  EVRAZ plc

This report has been prepared in accordance with The Companies Act 2006, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. It also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the principles of good governance as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in June 2010.
The Group’s auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have audited the information contained in the tables set out in the non-executive director Remuneration 
and executive director emoluments sections below.
Members of the Remuneration Committee
The EVRAZ plc Remuneration Committee was constituted and appointed by the Board on 14 October 2011, superseding the Evraz Group S.A. 
Remuneration Committee, and the members comprised the following non-executive directors during the period to 31 December 2011:
 Duncan Baxter (Committee Chairman);
 Alexander Abramov;
 Eugene Tenenbaum;
 Karl Gruber;
 Sir Michael Peat
No directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration. The Committee may invite other individuals to attend Committee meetings, in 
particular the Chief Executive Officer, the Head of Human Resources and external advisers for all or part of any Committee meeting as and 
when appropriate and necessary.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a formal committee of the Board and can operate with a quorum of three Committee members. It is operated 
according to its Terms of Reference, a copy of which can be found on the Company’s website.
The main responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are:
 To determine and agree with the Board the framework or policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, the Company’s Chief 
Executive Officer, the Company Secretary and key senior management and recommend non-executive directors’ remuneration.
 To take into account all factors which it deems necessary to determine such framework or policy, including all relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements, the provisions and recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code and associated guidance.
 To review and take into account the remuneration trends across the Group when setting remuneration policy for directors.
 To review regularly the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy.
 To determine the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman of the Board, the Company Secretary and key senior management, 
including pension rights, bonuses, benefits in kind, incentive payments and share options or other share awards within the terms of the 
agreed policy and in consultation with the Committee Chairman and/or Chief Executive Officer.
 To approve awards for participants where existing share incentive plans are in place.
 To review and approve any compensation payable to executive directors and senior executives.
 To oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures throughout the Group. 
During 2011, the Evraz Group S.A. Remuneration Committee met twice. The purpose of the meetings was to consider and to make 
recommendations to the Board on management compensation, as well as the remuneration packages of the Chairman and the Executive Director. 
Remuneration Policy
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board and CEO, proposes the level of fees at a 
Committee meeting and, subject to approval, the proposal is put forward to the Board for consideration. Subject to Board approval the proposed 
fees are put to shareholders at the AGM. 
The Company linked remuneration policy with Company strategy through:
 Alignment to Company strategy achieved through the operation of a performance related bonus which is based on the achievement of 
Company KPIs. 
 Measuring achievement for bonus against three separate KPIs (EBITDA, relative share price performance and return on assets) ensures focus 
is spread across different aspects of Company performance, necessary for long-term success.
 Use of relative measures (share price and ROA) to ensure focus is on driving performance compared to the market. 
 High level of executive director and key management shareholding to promote alignment with creation of shareholder value.
 Fixed remuneration to be sufficient to attract and retain world-class talent.
Details of the executive director and non-executive director remuneration policies are given in the sections that follow. The full text of the 
Remuneration Policy can be found on the Company’s website.
Currently none of the directors receive any fees paid in shares of the Company and they are not entitled to participate in the Group pension plan 
or long-term incentive schemes.
Executive Director’s Remuneration
Mr. Alexander Frolov, as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is entitled to a base salary, a performance related bonus and provision of benefits. 
As a Member of the Board of Directors he is also entitled to the director’s fee (US$150,000) and any applicable fees for participation in the work 
of the Board committees as laid out in the section on non-executive director remuneration. Alexander Frolov’s current shareholding (12.32% of 
issued share capital) provides alignment to the delivery of long-term growth in shareholder value. As such, the CEO does not participate in any 
long-term incentive plan. However, the Remuneration Committee will review this on an ongoing basis. EVRAZ plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Sustainability Business Overview Strategy Operating Review Sustainability Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
The current balance between fixed and variable pay for the executive director means, at target performance, 50% of remuneration is performance-
related, rising to 66.7% for the achievement of maximum performance. Bonus levels are based on the CEO’s base salary as approved by the 
Remuneration Committee on 23 May 2008. The pay and conditions of employees across the group (increasing rate, management remuneration 
level) have been taken into account when setting executive director remuneration. The CEO did not hold any external appointments during the year. 
Base Salary
The CEO did not receive an increase in base salary in 2011. From 1 March 2012, the CEO salary will be set at a level which was originally 
approved by the Remuneration Committee on 23 May 2008, giving a base salary of US$ 2,500,000 (which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, 
the directors’ fees, the fees that are paid for committees’ membership and salary in EVRAZ plc subsidiaries). Due to the challenging economic 
environment at that time, the CEO voluntarily accepted a decrease in salary and deferred the approved increase in base salary to a later date. 
The CEO has waived the right to receive any catch-up payments forgone between 2008 to 2012. 
Annual Bonus
The CEO is eligible to participate in a performance-related bonus which is subject to the agreement of the Remuneration Committee and approval 
by the Board of Directors. The bonus is linked to the achievement of performance conditions based on predetermined targets set by the Board of 
Directors. The target bonus is 100% of base salary with a maximum potential of up to 200% of base salary. The calculation of the bonus is based 
on the CEO’s base salary as approved by the Remuneration Committee on 23 May 2008. 
The bonus is linked to corporate performance. Three indicators are taken into account when determining the CEO’s annual bonus: EBITDA 
(30% weighting), Return on Assets (40% weighting) and Relative Share Price Performance (30% weighting).
Due to the challenging economic environment, the CEO voluntarily deferred his annual bonus payment for the year 2010 in the amount 
of US$ 1,340,000. The Remuneration Committee will determine when this payment is made but it is currently expected that part or all 
of this will be made in 2012. The extent to which any payments are made in 2012 will be disclosed in the 2012 Annual Report. 
For 2011, the CEO has been awarded a bonus of 22.6% of base salary (as noted above, this is calculated by reference to the CEO’s base salary 
as approved in 2008). It is expected that this will be also paid in 2012. 
Pension and Benefits
The CEO does not participate in any pension plans. Benefits principally consist of a car allowance and private healthcare.

Executive Director’s Service Contract
The CEO has a service contract with a subsidiary of EVRAZ Plc.
The terms of the CEO’s service contract are summarised below:
Executive directors Date of contract Notice period (months)
Alexander V. Frolov 31 December 2010 N/A*
* The service contract does not provide for any specific notice period and therefore, in the event of termination, the applicable notice period will be as provided for in the 
Russian labour code (where the termination is at the company’s initiative the entitlement to pay in lieu of notice is to 3 months’ base salary). Other than entitlement to 
notice and a payment in lieu of notice, the CEO will not be entitled to compensation on termination of his contract.
Non-Executive Director Remuneration
The Company’s policy on non-executive director remuneration is based on the following key principles: 
 Remuneration should be: 
– sufficient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent;
– consistent with recognised best practice standards for non-executive director remuneration;
–  in the form of cash fees, but with the flexibility to forgo all or part of such fees (after deduction of applicable income tax
and social security contributions) to acquire shares in the Company should the non-executive director so wish; and
– set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the Board and its committees.
 Non-executive directors may not participate in the Company’s share incentive schemes or pension arrangements.
A director’s remuneration consists of an annual fee of US$150,000 and a fee for committee membership (US$24,000) or chairmanship 
(US$100,000 in respect of the Audit Committee chairmanship and US$50,000 for the chairmanship of other committees). There was no 
increase in fees for 2011 and the fees for all non-executive directors will remain unchanged for 2012 except for the Chairman. The fee for the 
Chairman of the Board was increased at a Board meeting of 28 February 2012 and shall be US$750,000 from the 1 March 2012 (this fee 
includes, for the avoidance of doubt, the directors fees and the fees that are paid for committees’ membership). The fees payable for the 
chairmanship of a committee include the membership fee, and any director elected chairman of more than one committee is only entitled to 
receive fees in respect of one chairmanship. EVRAZ plc

Principal Activities
EVRAZ plc is a global, vertically-integrated, steel, mining and vanadium business with operations in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, the Czech 
Republic, Italy, the USA, Canada and South Africa. EVRAZ plc has a Premium Listing on the London Stock Exchange. Additional information on the 
Group’s operations during the year and the information that fulfils the requirements of the Business Review is provided in the Business Overview, 
Strategy, Operating Review, Sustainability, Financial Review and Governance sections of this document, which are deemed to form part of this 
report by reference. 
Group Reorganisation
In 2011 EVRAZ plc became a new parent company of the Group. EVRAZ plc, registered in the United Kingdom, is a public company limited by 
shares. The Company’s shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities and included in the FTSE 100 Index. 
The listing of GDRs of Evraz Group S.A. on the London Stock Exchange was cancelled in February 2012. More details on the Group reorganisation 
are provided in Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 129.
Sustainable Development
The Sustainability section of this report focuses on the health and safety, environmental and employment performance of the Company’s 
operations, and outlines the Company’s core values and commitment to the principles of sustainable development and development of 
community relations programmes.
Going Concern
The financial position and performance of the Group and its cash flows are set out in the Financial Review section of the report on pages 52 to 55. 
The Directors have considered the Group’s debt maturity and cash flow projections and an analysis of projected debt covenants compliance 
for the period to the end of 30 June 2013. The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and has neither the intention 
nor the need to liquidate or materially curtail the scale of its operations.
For this reason the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements. More details are provided in Note 1 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 91 including further information regarding certain risks related to projected debt covenant 
compliance.
Results and Dividends
On 10 October 2011, the EVRAZ Board approved a new dividend policy. Under the revised dividend policy, EVRAZ is targeting a long-term average 
dividend payout ratio of at least 25% of the consolidated net profit calculated in accordance with IFRS and adjusted for non-recurring items. 
Dividends are expected to be paid semi-annually. In addition to the regular dividend payments, the Company may also employ special dividends 
from time to time at the discretion of the EVRAZ Board to return surplus capital to shareholders.
On the back of our strong financial results, during 2011 Evraz Group S.A. made its first dividend payment since 2008, paying an interim dividend 
of US$0.60 per share/US$0.20 per GDR and a special dividend of US$2.70 per share/US$0.90 per GDR. EVRAZ plc has also declared a cash 
final dividend of US$0.17 per share. This gives a total ordinary dividend for 2011 of US$317 million, which is approximately 50% of net profit 
adjusted for non-recurring items.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the dividend at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 18 June 2012 for payment on 9 July 2012 to 
ordinary shareholders on the register on 8 June 2012.
Fixed Assets
The Group’s property, plant and equipment is stated at purchase or construction cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.

of land was 1.7 times higher than its carrying value. At 31 December 2011, the carrying value of land amounted to US$187 million. In the opinion 
of the directors, the total market value of land has not decreased significantly since the last valuation. 
It is not practicable to estimate the market value of buildings and mineral reserves as at 31 December 2011.

Major Shareholder or a member of the Major Shareholder Group (on the other) shall be entered into and conducted on an arm’s length and

considers to be independent in accordance with paragraph B.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘‘Independent Committee’’);
(d) the Major Shareholder shall not, and shall procure, insofar as it is legally able to do so, that each member of the Major Shareholder Group

Major Shareholder or any member of the Major Shareholder Group; (e) the quorum for any Board meeting of the Company shall be two, of which at 
least one must be a Director other than a Shareholder Director and/or a Director who is (or has, in the 12 months prior to the relevant date) any

be approved at a duly convened meeting of the Independent Committee or in writing by a majority of the Independent Committee; and (i) for 
so long as the Major Shareholder holds an interest in 50% or more in the Company, the Major Shareholder undertakes that it will not and

competing business.
The Board is satisfied that the Company is capable of carrying on its business independently of the Major Shareholder and makes its decisions 
in a manner consistent with its duties to the Company and stakeholders of EVRAZ plc. 
8.875% notes due 2013 and 9.50% notes due 2018, issued by EVRAZ Group S.A., as well as a structured credit facility agreement for a 
syndicated loan of US$950 million contain change of control provisions. If a change of control occurs under the terms of these notes, noteholders

the event of a change of control over Evraz Group S.A., any lender will have the right to cancel its commitments and declare that amounts relating 
to that lender’s participation in the loan become immediately payable. At 31 December 2011, the principal amount of these borrowings amounted 
to US$1,993 million, accrued interest was US$21 million.

applicable contract terms.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Relation to the Annual 
Report and the Financial Statements 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements 
for each financial year. Under the law, the directors are required to prepare Group financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under Company Law the directors must not approve the Group and parent company financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of the profit or loss of the Group and parent company for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements the directors are required to:
 Present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group and parent company.
 Select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS8 Accounting Policies, changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply 
them consistently.
 Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information.
 Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable.
 Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs as adopted by the European Union is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s and parent company’s financial 
position and financial performance.
 State that the Group and parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, subject to any material departures discloses and explained in the financial statements. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and parent company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, with respect to the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and parent company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the Director’s Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Corporate Governance Report 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including the requirements of the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of EVRAZ plc
We have audited the group financial statements of EVRAZ PLC for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the Consolidated 
Statement of Operations, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, The Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 33. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 79, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the group financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 the directors’ statement, set out on page 74, in relation to going concern; and
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of EVRAZ PLC for the period ended 31 December 2011 and 
on the information in the Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Business Overview Strategy Operating Review Sustainability Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
1. Corporate Information 
These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of EVRAZ plc on 24 April 2012. 
EVRAZ plc (“EVRAZ plc” or “the Company”) was incorporated on 23 September 2011 as a public company under the laws of the United Kingdom 
with the registered number 7784342. The Company’s registered office is at 5th Floor, 6 St. Andrew Street, London, EC4A 3AE, United Kingdom.
As a result of the reorganisation implemented by way of the share exchange offer made by the Company for the shares of Evraz Group S.A. 
(Note 20), on 7 November 2011, the Company became a new parent entity of Evraz Group S.A., a joint stock company registered in Luxembourg 
in 2004. Evraz Group S.A. is a holding company which owns steel production, mining and trading companies. At 31 December 2011, the 
Company held 99.82% in Evraz Group S.A. Lanebrook Limited (Cyprus) is the ultimate controlling party of the Group.
The Company, together with its subsidiaries (the “Group”), is involved in the production and distribution of steel and related products and coal 
and iron ore mining. In addition, the Group produces vanadium products. The Group is one of the largest steel producers globally.
The major subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group were as follows at 31 December:

Going Concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Group’s activities in all of its operating segments continue to be affected by the uncertainty and instability of the current economic 
environment. In the event that the financial results of the Group deteriorate further and are below the management’s current forecasts, the Group 
may not be in compliance with financial covenants under certain bank loans, which, if not resolved, may trigger a cross default under other debt 
instruments. Such an event would permit the Group’s lenders to demand immediate payment of the outstanding borrowings under the relevant 
debt instruments. 
Directors and management have considered a number of alternatives to proactively address this situation in the event that the Group fails to 
be in compliance with its financial covenants, including, if and when necessary, a repayment of certain borrowings, a financial covenant reset, 
a waiver from its lenders and a refinancing of certain borrowings. The Group may incur additional costs related to these alternatives. 
Based on the analysis of available alternatives, management’s track record of resolving similar matters and the probabilities of their successful 
implementation, directors and management concluded that there is no material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. Consequently, directors and management have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Preparation 
These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”), as adopted by the European Union.
International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (“IASB”). IFRSs that are mandatory for 
application as of 31 December 2011, but not adopted by the European Union, do not have any impact on the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the directors believe there are no material 
uncertainties that lead to significant doubt that the entity can continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting policies 
below. Exceptions include, but are not limited to, property, plant and equipment at the date of transition to IFRS accounted for at deemed cost, 
available-for-sale investments measured at fair value, assets classified as held for sale measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair 
value less costs to sell and post-employment benefits measured at present value.
Group Reorganisation
As the Group has been formed through a reorganisation in which EVRAZ plc became a new parent entity of the Group (Note 20), these consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared as a continuation of the existing group using the pooling of interests method. The difference in share 
capital and legal reserve in the amount of $895 million was recorded as an adjustment to accumulated profits. At 31 December 2011, there were 
shareholders which did not accept the share exchange offer. Accordingly, the Group recognised non-controlling interests of $11 million representing 
these shareholders.
Completion of Initial Accounting
In 2011, the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of ZAO Koksovaya by the Group’s joint venture has been completed (Note 11). As a 
result, the Group recognised adjustments to the provisional values of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity and 
restated the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2010 and for the year then ended. Consequently, the 2010 comparative 
information differs from the previously published financial statements.
The effects of the completion of purchase price allocation are summarised below.

Changes in Accounting Policies
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group followed the same accounting policies and methods of computation 
as compared with those applied in the previous year, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations and revision of the existing 
standards as of 1 January 2011.
New/Revised Standards and Interpretations Adopted in 2011
 IAS 24 (revised) “Related Party Disclosures” 
The amendment clarifies the definition of a related party. The amendment introduces an exemption from the general related party disclosure 
requirements for transactions with a government and entities that are controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by the same 
government as the reporting entity. The adoption of the amendment did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
 Amendment to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation”
The amendment alters the definition of a financial liability in IAS 32 to enable entities to classify rights issues and certain options or warrants as 
equity instruments. The amendment is applicable if the rights are given pro rata to all of the existing owners of the same class of an entity’s non-
derivative equity instruments, to acquire a fixed number of the entity’s own equity instruments for a fixed amount in any currency. The amendment 
had no effect on the financial position or performance of the Group.
 IFRIC 19 “Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments”
The interpretation clarifies that equity instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish a financial liability qualify as consideration paid. The equity 
instruments issued are measured at their fair value. In case that this cannot be reliably measured, the instruments are measured at the fair value 
of the liability extinguished. Gains and losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss. The adoption of this interpretation had no effect on the 
financial statements of the Group.
 Amendments to IFRIC 14/IAS 19 “Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement”
The amendment removes an unintended consequence when an entity is subject to minimum funding requirements and makes an early payment 
of contributions to cover such requirements. The amendment permits a prepayment of future service cost by the entity to be recognised as 
pension asset. The amendment to the interpretation had no effect on the financial position or performance of the Group.
 Amendments to standards following the May 2010 “improvements to IFRS” project 
The third omnibus of amendments to IFRS was issued primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording. The adoption of 
these amendments did not have significant impact on the financial statements of the Group.

 Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2014
 IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” 1 January 2015
The Group expects that the adoption of the pronouncements listed above will not have a significant impact on the Group’s results of operations 
and financial position in the period of initial application. 
Amended IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” introduced recognition of actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income in the period they 
occur. This amendment is required to be applied retrospectively. At 31 December 2011, the Group had $261 million actuarial losses (Note 23), 
they will increase the Group’s liabilities under defined benefit plans.
Signiﬁcant Accounting Judgements and Estimates
Estimation Uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below. 94 EVRAZ plc

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Signiﬁcant Accounting Judgements and Estimates (continued)
Estimation Uncertainty (continued)
Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the 
Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s 
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that 
are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, 
the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the assets. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $105 million, $109 million and $23 million, 
respectively (Note 9).
The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment involves the use of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, 
timing and amount of the impairment. Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, 
expectations of growth in the industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological obsolescence, 
discontinuance of service, current replacement costs and other changes in circumstances that indicate that impairment exists. The determination 
of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the use of estimates by management. Methods used to determine the value in use 
include discounted cash flow-based methods, which require the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-
generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. These estimates, including 
the methodologies used, may have a material impact on the fair value and, ultimately, the amount of any impairment. 
Useful Lives of Items of Property, Plant and Equipment
The Group assesses the remaining useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment at least at each financial year end and, if expectations 
differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8 “Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”. These estimates may have a material impact on the amount of the carrying values of 
property, plant and equipment and on depreciation expense for the period. 
In 2011 and 2009, the Group changed its estimation of useful lives of property, plant and equipment, which resulted in a $16 million and $102 
million decrease in depreciation expense, respectively, as compared to the amounts that would have been charged had no change in estimate 
occurred. In 2010, the change in estimates of useful lives of property, plant and equipment resulted in an additional depreciation expense of 
approximately $10 million. 
Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations
The Group is required to recognise separately, at the acquisition date, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or 
assumed in a business combination at their fair values, which involves estimates. Such estimates are based on valuation techniques which 
require considerable judgement in forecasting future cash flows and developing other assumptions.
Impairment of Goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-
generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future 
cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $2,180 million, $2,219 million and $2,186 million, respectively. 
In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Group recognised an impairment loss in respect of goodwill in the amount of $Nil, $16 million and $160 million, 
respectively. More details of the assumptions used in estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are 
provided in Note 5.
Mineral Reserves 
Mineral reserves are a material factor in the Group’s computation of depreciation, depletion and amortisation charge. The Group estimates its 
mineral reserves in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (“JORC 
Code”). Estimation of reserves in accordance with the JORC Code involves some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty depends mainly on the 
amount of reliable geological and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of this data, which also requires 
use of subjective judgement and development of assumptions. 
Site Restoration Provisions
The Group reviews site restoration provisions at each reporting date and adjusts them to reflect the current best estimate in accordance 
with IFRIC 1 “Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities”. The amount recognised as a provision is the best 
estimate of the expenditures required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period based on the requirements of the current 
legislation of the country where the respective operating assets are located. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and 
circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate of a provision. Considerable judgement is required in forecasting future site 
restoration costs.
Future events that may affect the amount required to settle an obligation are reflected in the amount of a provision when there is sufficient 
objective evidence that they will occur.
In 2011 and 2010, the independent experts made a re-assessment of site restoration provisions (Note 25). EVRAZ plc

Estimation Uncertainty (continued)
Post-Employment Beneﬁts
The Group uses an actuarial valuation method for the measurement of the present value of post-employment benefit obligations and related 
current service cost. This involves the use of demographic assumptions about the future characteristics of the current and former employees 
who are eligible for benefits (mortality, both during and after employment, rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement, etc.) as well 
as financial assumptions (discount rate, future salary and benefit levels, expected rate of return on plan assets, etc.). 
Allowances
The Group makes allowances for doubtful receivables to account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required 
payments. When evaluating the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts, management bases its estimates on the current overall 
economic conditions, the ageing of accounts receivable balances, historical write-off experience, customer creditworthiness and changes 
in payment terms. Changes in the economy, industry or specific customer conditions may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful 
accounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. As of 31 December 2011, 2010 and 2009, allowances for doubtful accounts in 
respect of trade and other receivables have been made in the amount of $108 million, $117 million and $92 million respectively (Note 29). 
The Group makes an allowance for obsolete and slow-moving raw materials and spare parts. In addition, certain finished goods of the Group are 
carried at net realisable value (Note 14). Estimates of net realisable value of finished goods are based on the most reliable evidence available 
at the time the estimates are made. These estimates take into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring 
subsequent to the end of the reporting period to the extent that such events confirm conditions existing at the end of the period. 
Litigations
The Group exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposure to contingent liabilities related to pending litigations or 
other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities. 
Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of 
the final settlement. Because of the inherent uncertainties in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated 
provision. These estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available, primarily with the support of internal specialists or 
with the support of outside consultants. Revisions to the estimates may significantly affect future operating results. More details are provided 
in Note 31.
Current Taxes
Russian and Ukrainian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations and changes occur frequently. Further, the 
interpretation of tax legislation by tax authorities as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group’s entities may not coincide with that of 
management. As a result, tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Group’s entities may be assessed for additional taxes, penalties 
and interest, which can be significant. In Russia and Ukraine the periods remain open to review by the tax and customs authorities with respect 
to tax liabilities for three calendar years preceding the year of review. Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods. More details 
are provided in Note 31.
Deferred Income Tax Assets
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The estimation of that probability includes judgements based on the expected 
performance. Various factors are considered to assess the probability of the future utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating 
results, operational plans, expiration of tax losses carried forward, and tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from these estimates or 
if these estimates must be adjusted in future periods, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected. 
In the event that the assessment of future utilisation of deferred tax assets must be reduced, this reduction will be recognised in the statement 
of operations.
Foreign Currency Transactions
The presentation currency of the Group is the US dollar because presentation in US dollars is convenient for the major current and potential users 
of the consolidated financial statements.
The functional currencies of the Group’s subsidiaries are the Russian rouble, US dollar, euro, Czech koruna, South African rand, Canadian dollar 
and Ukrainian hryvnia. As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the US dollar 
are translated into the presentation currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period, and their statements of operations 
are translated at the exchange rates that approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising 
on the translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity. On disposal of a subsidiary with a functional currency other than the 
US dollar, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular subsidiary is recognised in the statement of operations.
Transactions in foreign currencies in each subsidiary of the Group are initially recorded in the functional currency at the rate ruling at the date 
of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency rate 
of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period. All resulting differences are taken to the statement of operations.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.  96 EVRAZ plc

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries, which are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than 50% of the voting rights, or otherwise has power to 
exercise control over their operations, are consolidated. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated; unrealised losses are 
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Where necessary, accounting policies for 
subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
Non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Non-controlling interests are presented 
in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from the parent’s shareholders’ equity. 
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling 
interests having a deficit balance.
Acquisition of Subsidiaries from 1 January 2010
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount 
of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree 
is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair 
value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or 
loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until 
it is finally settled within equity.
The initial accounting for a business combination involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the cost of the combination. If the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined 
only provisionally by the end of the period in which the combination is effected because either the fair values to be assigned to the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities or the cost of the combination can be determined only provisionally, the Group accounts for 
the combination using those provisional values. The Group recognises any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of completing the 
initial accounting within twelve months of the acquisition date. 
Comparative information presented for the periods before the completion of initial accounting for the acquisition is presented as if the initial 
accounting had been completed from the acquisition date. 
Acquisition of Subsidiaries prior to 1 January 2010
The previous accounting policies relating to business combinations include the following differences as compared with the policies applied 
starting from 1 January 2010: 
 Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition formed part of the acquisition costs. 
 The non-controlling interest (formerly known as minority interest) could be measured only at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets.
 Business combinations achieved in stages were accounted for as separate steps. Any additional acquired share of interest did not affect 
previously recognised goodwill. 
 Contingent consideration was recognised if the Group had a present obligation, the economic outflow was more likely than not and a reliable 
estimate was determinable. Subsequent adjustments to the contingent consideration were recognised as part of goodwill. 
Increases in Ownership Interests in Subsidiaries
The differences between the carrying values of net assets attributable to interests in subsidiaries acquired and the consideration given for such 
increases is either added to additional paid-in capital, if positive, or charged to accumulated profits, if negative, in the consolidated financial 
statements.
Purchases of Controlling Interests in Subsidiaries from Entities under Common Control
Purchases of controlling interests in subsidiaries from entities under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interests method. 
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiary transferred under common control are recorded in these financial statements at the historical cost 
of the controlling entity (the “Predecessor”). Related goodwill inherent in the Predecessor’s original acquisition is also recorded in the financial 
statements. Any difference between the total book value of net assets, including the Predecessor’s goodwill, and the consideration paid is 
accounted for in the consolidated financial statements as an adjustment to the shareholders’ equity. EVRAZ plc

Basis of Consolidation (continued)
Purchases of Controlling Interests in Subsidiaries from Entities under Common Control (continued)
These financial statements, including corresponding figures, are presented as if a subsidiary had been acquired by the Group on the date it was 
originally acquired by the Predecessor.
Put Options over Non-controlling Interests
The Group derecognises non-controlling interests if non-controlling shareholders have a put option over their holdings. The difference between 
the amount of the liability recognised in the statement of financial position over the carrying value of the derecognised non-controlling interests 
is charged to accumulated profits. 
Investments in Associates
Associates are entities in which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or is otherwise able to exercise significant 
influence, but which it does not control or jointly control. 
Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost including goodwill. 
Subsequent changes in the carrying value reflect the post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate and goodwill 
impairment charges, if any. 
The Group’s share of its associates’ profits or losses is recognised in the statement of operations and its share of movements in reserves is 
recognised in equity. However, when the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does 
not recognise further losses, unless the Group has legal or constructive obligations to make payments to, or on behalf of, the associate. If the 
associate subsequently reports profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the 
share of losses not recognised.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates; 
unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Interests in Joint Ventures
The Group’s interest in its joint ventures is accounted for under the equity method of accounting whereby an interest in jointly controlled entities is 
initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of joint ventures. The statement 
of operations reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of joint ventures.
Property, Plant and Equipment
The Group’s property, plant and equipment is stated at purchase or construction cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of plant and equipment when that 
cost is incurred and recognition criteria are met. 
The Group’s property, plant and equipment include mining assets, which consist of mineral reserves, mine development and construction costs 
and capitalised site restoration costs. Mineral reserves represent tangible assets acquired in business combinations. Mine development and 
construction costs represent expenditures incurred in developing access to mineral reserves and preparations for commercial production, 
including sinking shafts and underground drifts, roads, infrastructure, buildings, machinery and equipment.
At each end of the reporting period management makes an assessment to determine whether there is any indication of impairment of property, 
plant and equipment. If any such indication exists, management estimates the recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less cost to sell and its value in use. The carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount, and the difference is recognised as impairment 
loss in the statement of operations or other comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for an asset in previous years is reversed if 
there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, except for mining assets, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment and methods of their depreciation are reviewed, 
and adjusted as appropriate, at each fiscal year end. The table below presents the useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.

The Group determines the depreciation charge separately for each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Depletion of mining assets including capitalised site restoration costs is calculated using the units-of-production method based upon proved and 
probable mineral reserves.  98 EVRAZ plc

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Property, Plant and Equipment (continued)
Maintenance costs relating to items of property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are 
capitalised, and the replaced assets are derecognised. 
The Group has the title to certain non-production and social assets, primarily buildings and facilities of social infrastructure, which are carried 
at their recoverable amount of zero. The costs to maintain such assets are expensed as incurred.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date as 
to whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to 
use the asset. 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised from 
the commencement of the lease term at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to interest expense.
The depreciation policy for depreciable leased assets is consistent with that for depreciable assets which are owned. If there is no reasonable 
certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or 
its useful life.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating 
lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred for an acquisition of a subsidiary or an associate and the 
amount recognised for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than 
the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree, the difference is recognised in the consolidated statement of operations. 
Goodwill on acquisition of a subsidiary is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisition of an associate is included in the carrying amount 
of the investments in associates. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or 
more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units 
that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. 
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, or the group of cash-generating units, to which the 
goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the 
operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill 
disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating 
unit retained. 
Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Expenditures on internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development 
costs, are expensed as incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that 
the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite life are reviewed 
at least at each year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in 
the asset are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, they are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating 
unit level. EVRAZ plc

Certain water rights and environmental permits are considered to have indefinite lives as management believes that these rights will continue 
indefinitely. 
The most part of the Group’s intangible assets represents customer relationships arising on business combinations (Note 10).
Emission Rights
One of the Group’s subsidiaries participates in the programme for emission reduction established by the Kyoto protocol. Emission rights 
(allowances) for each compliance period (one year) are issued at the beginning of the year, actual emissions are verified after the end of the year. 
Allowances, whether issued by government or purchased, are accounted for as intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”. 
Allowances that are issued for less than fair value are measured initially at their fair value. 
When allowances are issued for less than fair value, the difference between the amount paid and fair value is recognised as a government grant. 
Initially the grant is recognised as deferred income in the statement of financial position and subsequently recognised as income on a systematic 
basis over the compliance period for which the allowances were issued, regardless of whether the allowances are held or sold.
As emissions are made, a liability is recognised for the obligation to deliver allowances equal to emissions that have been made. This liability is 
a provision that is within the scope of IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” and it is measured at the best estimate 
of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period being the present market price of the number of 
allowances required to cover emissions made up to the end of the reporting period. 
Financial Assets
The Group classified its investments into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-
maturity, and available-for-sale. When investments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair 
value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group determines the classification of its investments after initial recognition. 
Investments that are acquired principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price are classified as held for 
trading and included in the category “financial assets at fair value through profit or loss”. Investments which are included in this category are 
subsequently carried at fair value; gains or losses on such investments are recognised in income.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such 
assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and 
receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that management has the positive intent and ability to 
hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
Investments intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest 
rates, are classified as available-for-sale; these are included in non-current assets unless management has the express intention of holding the 
investment for less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period or unless they will need to be sold to raise operating capital, in which 
case they are included in current assets. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of the purchase 
and re-evaluates such designation on a regular basis. After initial recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value with 
gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined 
to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the statement of operations. Reversals of 
impairment losses in respect of equity instruments are not recognised in the statement of operations. Impairment losses in respect of debt 
instruments are reversed through profit or loss if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after 
the impairment loss was recognised in the statement of operations.
For investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted market bid 
prices at the close of business on the end of the reporting period. For investments where there is no active market, fair value is determined using 
valuation techniques. Such techniques include using recent arm’s length market transactions, reference to the current market value of another 
instrument, which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.  100 EVRAZ plc

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Financial Assets (continued)
All purchases and sales of financial assets under contracts to purchase or sell financial assets that require delivery of the asset within the time 
frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place are recognised on the settlement date i.e. the date the asset is 
delivered by/to the counterparty.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable, which generally are short-term, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any 
uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written 
off when identified.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment of accounts receivable that represents its estimate of incurred losses. The main components 
of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established 
for groups of similar receivables in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined 
based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets. 
Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventory is determined on the weighted average basis and includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring or producing inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. The cost of finished goods 
and work in progress includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale.
Value Added Tax 
The tax authorities permit the settlement of sales and purchases value added tax (“VAT”) on a net basis.
The Group’s subsidiaries located in Russia apply the accrual method for VAT recognition, under which VAT becomes payable upon invoicing and 
delivery of goods or rendering services as well upon receipt of prepayments from customers. VAT on purchases, even if not settled at the end 
of the reporting period, is deducted from the amount of VAT payable.
Where provision has been made for impairment of receivables, an impairment loss is recorded for the gross amount of the debtor, including VAT. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, borrowings are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method; any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption amount 
is recognised as interest expense over the period of the borrowings. 
Prior to 2008, borrowing costs were expensed as incurred. Since 1 January 2008 borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets are capitalised 
(Note 9). 
Financial Guarantee Liabilities
Financial guarantee liabilities issued by the Group are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it 
incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee 
contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the guarantee. 
Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of 
the reporting period and the amount initially recognised.
Equity
Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown as a deduction in equity from 
the proceeds. Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued is recognised as additional paid-in 
capital.
Treasury Shares
Own equity instruments which are acquired by the Group (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in statement 
of operations on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the treasury shares.
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity only if they are declared before or the end of the reporting period. Dividends are 
disclosed when they are proposed before the end of the reporting period or proposed or declared after the end of the reporting period but before 
the financial statements are authorised for issue.  EVRAZ plc

Business Overview Strategy Operating Review Sustainability Financial Review Governance Financial Statements
2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised 
as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. 
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is 
used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Provisions for site restoration costs are capitalised within property, plant and equipment. 
Employee Beneﬁts
Social and Pension Contributions
Defined contributions are made by the Group to the Russian and Ukrainian state pension, social insurance, medical insurance and unemployment 
funds at the statutory rates in force (approximately 36%), based on gross salary payments. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to 
pay further contributions in respect of those benefits. Its only obligation is to pay contributions as they fall due. These contributions are expensed 
as incurred.
Deﬁned Beneﬁt Plans
The Group companies provide pensions and other benefits to their employees (Note 23). The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional 
on the completion of a minimum service period. Certain benefit plans require the employee to remain in service up to retirement age. Other 
employee benefits consist of various compensations and non-monetary benefits. The amounts of benefits are stipulated in the collective 
bargaining agreements and/or in the plan documents. 
The Group involves independent qualified actuaries in the measurement of employee benefit obligations. 
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of post-employment benefits is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of the plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or 
losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method. The present value 
of the benefits is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality government bonds that 
are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related 
obligations. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as income or expense when the cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains or losses for each individual 
plan exceed 10% of the higher of defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The excess of cumulative actuarial gains or losses 
over the 10% of the higher of defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recognised over the expected average remaining 
working lives of the employees participating in the plan.
The past service cost is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the 
benefits are already vested immediately following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, past service cost is recognised immediately. 
The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less past service cost not yet recognised and 
less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. 
The Group includes expected return on plan assets in the interest expense caption of the consolidated statement of operations.
Other Costs
The Group incurs employee costs related to the provision of benefits such as health services, kindergartens and other services. These amounts 
principally represent an implicit cost of employment and, accordingly, have been charged to cost of sales. 
Share-based Payments 
The Group has management compensation schemes, under which certain directors, senior executives and employees of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby they render services as consideration for equity instruments 
(“equity-settled transactions”). 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with non-executive directors and employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the Company’s 
shares at the date on which they are granted. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton model, further details of which are 
given in Note 24. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any conditions, other than market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity (additional paid-in capital), over the period 
in which service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant persons become fully entitled to the award (“the vesting date”). 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The charge or credit in the 
statement of operations for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. 102 EVRAZ plc

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Share-based Payments (continued)
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. Once a share-settled transaction is vested, no further accounting entries are 
made to reverse the cost already charged, even if the instruments that are the subject of the transaction are subsequently forfeited. In this case, 
the Group makes a transfer between different components of equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. 
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, 
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the 
award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the 
date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous 
paragraph.
Cash-settled share-based payments represent transactions in which the Group acquires goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash 
or other assets to the supplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price (or value) of the Group’s shares or other equity 
instruments. 
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured initially at fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton model. This fair value 
is expensed over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability is remeasured to fair value at each 
reporting date up to and including the settlement date with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of operations.
The dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share (Note 20).
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured.
When goods are sold or services are rendered in exchange for dissimilar goods or services, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents transferred. When the fair value of the goods or services 
received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of 
any cash or cash equivalents transferred. 
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of Goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue 
can be measured reliably. The moment of transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership is determined by the contract terms.
Rendering of Services
The Group’s revenues from rendering of services include electricity, transportation, port and other services. Revenue is recognised when services 
are rendered.
Interest
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method.
Dividends
Revenue is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is established.
Rental Income
Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.
Current Income Tax 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the end 
of the reporting period. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the statement of operations.
Deferred Income Tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred income taxes are 
provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting 
purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. EVRAZ plc

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Deferred Income Tax (continued)
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
3. Segment Information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their products and services, and has four reportable operating 
segments:
 Steel production segment includes production of steel and related products at eleven steel mills. 
 Mining segment includes iron ore and coal mining and enrichment. 
 Vanadium products segment includes extraction of vanadium ore and production of vanadium products. Vanadium slag arising in the steel-
making process is also allocated to the vanadium segment.
 Other operations include energy-generating companies, seaports, shipping and railway transportation companies.
Management and investment companies are not allocated to any of the segments.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Management monitors the results of the operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and 
performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on EBITDA. This performance indicator is calculated based on management 
accounts that differ from the IFRS consolidated financial statements for the following reasons:
1) for the last month of the reporting period, the statement of operations for each operating segment is prepared using a forecast for that month;
2) the statement of operations is based on local GAAP figures with the exception of depreciation expense which approximates the amount 
under IFRS.
Segment revenue is revenue reported in the Group’s statement of operations that is directly attributable to a segment and the relevant portion of 
the Group’s revenue that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to a segment, whether from sales to external customers or from transactions 
with other segments. 
Segment expense is expense resulting from the operating activities of a segment that is directly attributable to the segment and the relevant 
portion of an expense that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to the segment, including expenses relating to external counterparties and 
expenses relating to transactions with other segments.
Segment result is segment revenue less segment expense that is equal to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(“EBITDA”).
Segment EBITDA is determined as a segment’s profit/(loss) from operations adjusted for impairment of assets, profit/(loss) on disposal of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, foreign exchange gains/(losses) and depreciation, depletion and amortisation expense. 
The following tables present measures of segment profit or loss based on management accounts.

4. Business Combinations 
Vanady-Tula
On 20 December, 2007 , the Group signed an option agreement with OOO SGMK-Engineering (the “Seller”) in respect of shares of OAO Vanady-Tula 
(“Vanady-Tula”), a vanadium refinery located in Russia. Under the agreement, the Group had the right to acquire (the call option) and OOO SGMK- 
Engineering had the right to sell to the Group (the put option) 90.84% of shares in Vanady-Tula for 3,140 million roubles ($108 million at the exchange 
rate as of 2 November 2009, the date of the business combination). The options were extended to 31 December 2009. The exercise of the 
options was conditional upon the approval of the regulatory authorities. To secure the put option, the Group provided the seller with a non-interest 
bearing deposit in the amount of 3,091 million roubles ($121 million at the exchange rate as at the payment date). The deposit would have been 
repayable to the Group if neither the call option nor the put option were exercised before their expiration.
During 2008 and 2009, the Group purchased shares in Vanady-Tula and immediately prior to the business combination held a 1.88% ownership 
interest in the entity. The consideration paid for these shares was $2 million.
On 2 November 2009, the Group obtained the necessary regulatory approvals. The share options became exercisable and economic benefits 
have been effectively transferred to the Group since that date. As a result, the financial position and results of operations of Vanady-Tula were 
included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements beginning 2 November 2009 as the Group effectively exercised control over the entity’s 
operations since that date. 
In December 2009, the option agreement was dissolved and the companies entered into a new agreement for the purchase of an 82.96% 
ownership interest in Vanady-Tula. The purchase consideration amounted to 2,854 million roubles ($95 million at the exchange rate as of the 
date of the transaction, which was completed on 15 December 2009). 
The table below sets forth the fair values of Vanady-Tula’s consolidated identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date 
of business combination:

Vanady-Tula (continued)
At 31 December 2009, the Group’s accounts receivable include $12 million due from the seller.
For the period from 2 November 2009 to 31 December 2009, Vanady-Tula reported net profit amounting to $2 million.
In accordance with the Russian legislation, an acquirer which purchases at least 30% of the acquiree’s share capital is obliged to offer to other 
shareholders to sell their holdings (“obligatory offer”). On 15 December, 2009, the date when the Group became the legal owner of the shares 
under the new purchase agreement, the Group derecognised all non-controlling interests in the entity and accrued a liability to the non-controlling 
shareholders in the amount of $17 million. This transaction resulted in a $5 million charge to accumulated profits. 
In February 2010, the Group made an offer to non-controlling shareholders of Vanady-Tula to sell their stakes to the Group. The non-controlling 
shareholders sold an 11.26% ownership interest to the Group. The Russian legislation allows a shareholder owning more than 95% of a company 
to increase its stake to 100% through a forced disposal of the shares held by non-controlling shareholders. Consequently, in August 2010, the 
Group started the buy-out of non-controlling shares of Vanady-Tula. In November 2010, the Group completed the buy-out of the remaining shares 
(3.90%).
The total purchase consideration for a 15.16% ownership interest amounted to 521 million Russian roubles ($18 million at the exchange rate 
as of the dates of transactions). 
Steel Dealers
On 15 October 2009, the Group acquired a 100% interest in a holding company owning steel dealers throughout Russia (formerly known as 
Carbofer). The purchase consideration amounted to $11 million. 
The financial position and the results of operations of this holding were included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements beginning 
15 October 2009.

Inprom Group
On 22 December 2010, the Group acquired 100% in a holding entity owning steel dealers throughout Russia (known as Inprom Group). 
The purchase consideration consisted of cash amounting to $19 million plus the fair value of a deferred consideration of $21 million. 
The financial position and the results of operations of Inprom were included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements beginning 
22 December 2010.

In 2011, the Group made a final payment of $1 million for the acquisition of Inprom Group.
For the period from 22 December to 31 December 2010, Inprom Group reported net loss amounting to $1 million.
Other Payments for Acquisition of Subsidiaries
In 2009, the Group and Lanebrook Limited signed an amendment agreement under which the purchase price for the Ukrainian subsidiaries 
acquired in 2008 has been reduced by $65 million. This reduction in the purchase price was accounted for as a contribution from a shareholder 
in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
In 2010, the Group fully settled a $16 million liability under earn-out payments for the acquisition of Stratcor in 2006. In 2011, the Group paid 
$3 million of synergy payments related to the same acquisition (Note 26).
In 2011, the Group paid $20 million for the acquisition of Kachkakanar Heat and Power Plant. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, 
the control over operating activities of the entity is transferred to the Group on 1 January 2012. As such, this payment was included in other 
non-current assets as of 31 December 2011 (Note 13). 
In 2011, the Group purchased a 100% ownership interest in an entity whose assets comprise only land to be used for construction of a rolling 
mill in Russia. The cash consideration amounted to $11 million. This purchase did not qualify for a business combination, as the acquired 
company does not constitute a business. 
Disclosure of Other Information in Respect of Business Combinations
As the acquired subsidiaries either did not prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS before the business combinations or applied 
accounting policies that are significantly different from the Group’s accounting policies, it is impracticable to determine revenues and net profit 
of the combined entity for each year presented on the assumption that all business combinations effected during each year had occurred at the 
beginning of the respective year. 112 EVRAZ plc

Goodwill relates to the assembled workforce and synergy from integration of the acquired subsidiaries into the Group. The carrying amount of 
goodwill was allocated among cash-generating units as follows at 31 December:
US$ million 2011 2010 2009

The cash-generating units within EVRAZ Inc. NA and EVRAZ Inc. NA Canada represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets, primarily 
individual mills, which generate cash flows that are largely independent from other assets or groups of assets.
Goodwill was tested for impairment as of 31 December 2011. For the purpose of the goodwill impairment testing the Group assessed the 
recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. The recoverable amount has been determined based on a 
value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on the actual operating results and business plans approved by management and 
appropriate discount rates reflecting time value of money and risks associated with respective cash-generating units. For the periods not covered 
by management business plans, cash flow projections have been estimated by extrapolating the respective business plans results using a zero 
real growth rate.  EVRAZ plc

5. Goodwill (continued)
The key assumptions used by management in the value-in-use calculations are presented in the table below.
     Average
     price of the
Period of Pre-tax  commodity
forecast, discount per tonne
years rate, % Commodity in 2012
EVRAZ Inc. NA 5 9.11-14.47 steel products $966 
EVRAZ Inc. NA Canada 5 13.32 steel products $1,175 
EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli 5 12.47 steel plates €754 
EVRAZ Vanady-Tula 5 14.42 vanadium products $22,583 
Strategic Minerals Corporation   5 14.47 ferrovanadium products $29,917 
Nikom, a.s. 5 13.60 ferrovanadium products $24,460 
EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited 5 14.92 ferrovanadium products $27,462 
steel products $986
The calculations of value in use are most sensitive to the following assumptions:
Discount Rates 
Discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit. The discount rates have been determined 
using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and analysis of industry peers. Reasonable changes in discount rates could lead to an additional impairment 
at EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli, Strategic Minerals Corporation and General Scrap Inc. cash-generating units. If discount rates were 10% higher, this 
would lead to an additional impairment of $9 million. The recoverable amount of these cash-generating units based on the discount rates applied 
exceeds their carrying amount by $38 million.
Sales Prices 
The prices of the products sold by the Group were estimated using industry research. The Group expects that the nominal prices will grow with a 
compound annual gross rate of 4% in 2012–2016, 3.0% in 2017 and thereafter. If the prices assumed for 2012 and 2013 in the impairment test 
were 10% lower, this would not lead to any additional impairment.
Sales Volumes
Management assumed that the sales volumes of steel products would increase on average by 5% during 2012 and would grow evenly during 
the following four years to reach normal asset capacity thereafter. Reasonable changes in sales volumes could lead to an additional impairment 
at General Scrap Inc. cash-generating unit. If the sales volumes were 10% lower than those assumed for 2012 and 2013 in the impairment 
test, this would lead to an additional impairment of $2 million. The recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit based on the sales volumes 
applied exceeds its carrying amount by $2 million.
Cost Control Measures
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on the business plans approved by management. A reasonable deviation of 
cost from these plans could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Vanady-Tula and EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli cash-generating units. If the 
actual costs were 10% higher than those assumed for 2012 and 2013 in the impairment test, this would lead to an additional impairment 
of $36 million. The recoverable amount of these cash-generating units based on the cost control measures applied exceeds their carrying 
amount by $50 million.
6. Acquisitions of Non-controlling Interests in Subsidiaries
Evraztrans
In 2011, the Group acquired an additional non-controlling interest of 24% in Evraztrans, a subsidiary, which renders railway transportation 
services. The cash consideration amounted to $51 million. The excess of the amounts of consideration over the carrying values of non-controlling 
interests acquired amounting to $18 million was charged to accumulated profits. 
Stratcor
In 2010, the Group acquired an additional non-controlling interest of 5.92% in Strategic Minerals Corporation (“Stratcor”) for a cash consideration 
of $8 million paid in 2009. The excess of the amount of consideration paid over the carrying value of acquired non-controlling interest amounting 
to $3 million was charged to accumulated profits. 
LDPP
In 2010, the Group acquired an additional non-controlling interest of 25% in OAO Large Diameter Pipe Plant (“LDPP”) for a cash consideration of 
$8 million. The excess of the carrying value of acquired non-controlling interest over the amount of consideration paid amounting to $1 million 
was recorded in additional paid-in capital.  114 EVRAZ plc

In 2010, a new Tax Code has been adopted in Ukraine, which introduced a gradual reduction in income tax rates from 25% in 2010 to 16% in 
2014. In addition, in accordance with the new Tax Code the carrying values of property, plant and equipment per statutory books as of 1 April 2011 
will become a new tax base of these assets for income tax calculations. The Group’s subsidiaries measured the respective deferred tax assets and 
liabilities at 31 December 2010 based on the new tax bases using the announced tax rates and a forecast of temporary differences reversal. 
Major components of income tax expense for the years ended 31 December were as follows:

As of 31 December 2011, 2010 and 2009, deferred income taxes in respect of undistributed earnings of the Group’s subsidiaries have not been 
provided for, as management does not intend to distribute accumulated earnings in the foreseeable future. The current tax rate on intra-group 
dividend income varies from 0% to 10%. 
At 31 December 2011, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax liability and deferred tax asset in respect of temporary differences of 
$5,686 million and $3,478 million, respectively (2010: $5,764 million and $2,831 million, 2009: $4,270 million and $2,713 million, respectively). 
These differences are associated with investments in subsidiaries and were not recognised as the Group is able to control the timing of the 
reversal of those temporary differences and does not intend to reverse them in the foreseeable future. 
In the context of the Group’s current structure, tax losses and current tax assets of the different companies may not be set off against current 
tax liabilities and taxable profits of other companies, except for the companies registered in Cyprus where group relief can be applied. As of 
31 December 2011, the unused tax losses carry forward approximated $3,481 million (2010: $3,365 million, 2009: $2,757 million). The Group 
recognised deferred tax asset of $151 million (2010: $150 million, 2009: $203 million) in respect of unused tax losses. Deferred tax asset in the 
amount of $694 million (2010: $655 million, 2009: $463 million) has not been recorded as it is not probable that sufficient taxable profits will 
be available in the foreseeable future to offset these losses. Tax losses of $2,568 million (2010: $2,555 million, 2009: $1,873 million) for which 
deferred tax asset was not recognised arose in companies registered in Luxembourg, Cyprus, Russia, Ukraine and Canada. Losses in the amount 
of $2,479 million (2010: $2,535 million, 2009: $1,870 million) are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies 
in which the losses arose and $89 million will expire during 2012–2022 (2010: $20 million, 2009: $3 million). 118 EVRAZ plc

Scrip Dividends (continued)
The voluntary partial scrip dividend alternative was voted for in respect of 97,553,473 shares, representing 79.62% of the share capital of 
Evraz Group S.A., entitling the holders to subscribe to 9,755,347 new shares issued at a price of $22.50 per share. The new shares are ranked 
pari passu with the existing ordinary shares of Evraz Group S.A. The major shareholder, Lanebrook Limited, subscribed to 9,193,477 shares. 
Convertible Bonds and Equity Offerings
On 13 July 2009, Evraz Group S.A. completed the offering of $600 million unsecured convertible bonds (the “Convertible Bonds Offering”) 
and $300 million equity in the form of global depository receipts (“GDRs”) listed on the London Stock Exchange, representing ordinary shares 
of Evraz Group S.A. (the “Equity Offering”). 
The bonds were issued at 100% of their principal amount. They bore interest of 7.25% per annum payable on a quarterly basis and matured 
on 13 July 2014. 
The conversion could be exercised at the option of bondholders on any date during the period from 11 September 2009 till 6 July 2014. The 
bonds would be convertible into GDRs at an initial conversion price of $21.20 per GDR. The conversion price represented a 28% premium to the 
equity offering placement price of $16.50 per GDR, which was the reference price for the convertible bonds. Lanebrook, the Company’s parent, 
and its affiliate, subscribed for $200 million of the bonds. 
The Group could early redeem the bonds at their principal amount plus accrued interest if 15% or less of the bonds remained outstanding.
In the equity offering, on 13 July 2009, 6,060,608 new shares were issued as GDRs at an issue price of $16.50 per GDR. 
Evraz Group S.A. granted to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (the “Joint Bookrunners”) in the convertible bonds offering an over-allotment 
option to subscribe to additional bonds for up to $50 million, which was exercised in full on 27 July 2009 and resulted in an increase in the 
aggregate principal amount of the bonds to $650 million.
Evraz Group S.A. granted to the Joint Bookrunners in the equity offering an over-allotment option to subscribe to up to 909,090 additional GDRs, 
represented by 303,030 additional new shares, corresponding to additional gross proceeds of $15 million. This option was exercised in full on 
27 July 2009. Transaction costs relating to the bonds and equity offerings amounted to $10 million and $5 million, respectively.
The Group considered that the convertible bonds represent a financial instrument that creates a financial liability and grants an option to the 
holders of the instrument to convert it into an equity instrument of the Company. The Group recognised the liability and equity components 
separately in its statement of financial position.
The Group determined the carrying amount of the liability component by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an 
associated equity component. The fair value of this liability was calculated based on cash flows discounted at the Group’s market rate of interest 
(without a conversion option) at the date of the convertible bonds offering (13.26%). 
The carrying amount of the equity instrument represented by the option to convert the instrument into ordinary shares was then determined by 
deducting the fair value of the financial liability from the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole. Transaction costs relating 
to the convertible bonds offering were allocated between liability and equity components on a pro rata basis. As a result, the equity component 
of the convertible bonds amounting to $133 million was included in equity.
Shares Lending Transactions
In order to facilitate the issuance of the convertible bonds, Morgan Stanley offered to certain institutional investors an opportunity to borrow 
ordinary shares of Evraz Group S.A., represented by GDRs, during the term of the bonds by means of a loan of GDRs beneficially owned by 
Lanebrook (the “Borrowed GDRs”).
On 4 August 2009, the Board of Directors approved the issue of the new ordinary shares to Lanebrook in the amount equal to the number 
of shares underlying the borrowed GDRs. The Group effected a novation of the shares lending arrangements, whereby Evraz Group S.A. was 
substituted for Lanebrook as a lender of the borrowed GDRs. As a result, on 12 August 2009, 7,333,333 new shares were issued to Lanebrook 
in exchange for the right to receive 7,333,333 shares lended under the shares lending transactions. These transactions had no impact on 
equity, as the Group’s net assets did not change as a result of these transactions. At 31 December 2011, 2010 and 2009, Evraz Group S.A. 
was the owner of these shares.
Conversion of Bonds into Shares
In July and August 2011, Evraz Group S.A. issued 30,771,756 GDRs representing 10,257,252 ordinary shares to bondholders which had 
accepted the offer to convert 7.25% convertible bonds due 2014 (Note 21).
Share Capital of EVRAZ plc
On 17 October 2011, following the decision of the Board of directors, Evraz Group S.A. commenced the Group’s reorganisation and re-
domiciliation to the United Kingdom. This was implemented by means of the share exchange offer made by the Company to the shareholders 
of Evraz Group S.A. which were entitled to receive 9 shares of EVRAZ plc for each share of Evraz Group S.A. EVRAZ plc

Upon the closure of the offer, the admission of the global depository receipts of Evraz Group S.A. to trading on the London Stock Exchange 
has been cancelled.
On 17 February 2012, the Group purchased the remaining GDRs, representing 96,607.67 shares of Evraz Group S.A., for $4 million and 
exchanged them for the newly issued shares of EVRAZ plc. Since that date Evraz Group S.A. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of EVRAZ plc.
Treasury Shares
In 2011, the Group purchased 235,878 treasury shares for $22 million, sold 34,332 shares for $3 million and transferred 115,389 shares to 
participants of the Incentive Plan (Note 24). The cost of treasury shares gifted under the Incentive Plan, amounting to $11 million, was charged 
to accumulated profits. As of 31 December 2011, after the share exchange described above, the Group had 775,410 treasury shares.
In 2009, the Group purchased 67,569 treasury shares for $5 million and sold 135,000 treasury shares, including 27,902 shares that were 
sold to the plan participants at exercise prices determined in the Incentive Plans. The excess of the purchase cost of treasury shares over the 
proceeds from their sale, amounting to $6 million, was charged to accumulated profits. 
Repurchase of Vested Share-based Awards
In 2007, the Group made a decision to cease the issuance of new shares for the settlement of share-based awards. Since that date the Group 
acquired its own shares (in the form of global depositary receipts) on the open market for the grantees or repurchased the share options after 
vesting. In 2009, 234,813 share options were repurchased after vesting. The cash spent on repurchase of vested options, amounting to $3 million, 
was charged to accumulated profits. 
Earnings per Share
Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period. Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity 
holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
that would be issued on the conversion of all the potential dilutive ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:
2011 2010 2009
Weighted average number of ordinary shares for basic earnings per share 1,293,795,125 1,247,614,092 1,210,116,474

The fair value of shares issued as a scrip alternative on 30 January 2009 exceeded the cash alternative, thus giving rise to a bonus element in 
the issue of shares. The per share figures for all the periods presented have been restated to include a bonus element of 1,045,216 shares of 
Evraz Group S.A. in the calculation of basic earnings per share from the beginning of the earliest period presented. 132 EVRAZ plc

Earnings per Share (continued)
The weighted average number of ordinary shares for basic earnings per share does not include 7,333,333 shares of Evraz Group S.A. issued in 
2009 to Lanebrook in exchange for the right to receive 7,333,333 shares lended under the shares lending transactions. These transactions had 
no impact on equity, as the Group’s net assets did not change as a result of these transactions. 
In 2011 and 2010, share-based awards (Note 24) had a dilutive effect. In 2009, the Group reported net loss. Consequently, they were 
antidilutive. 
In 2010 and 2009, the convertible bonds were antidilutive as the interest (net of tax) per ordinary share obtainable on conversion exceeded basic 
earnings per share. 
In 2011, the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding from 1 January 2011 to the date of the first share exchange (“the 
reorganisation date”) was computed on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of Evraz Group S.A. outstanding during the 
period multiplied by the share exchange ratio. The number of ordinary shares outstanding from the reorganisation date to the end of 2011 was 
the actual number of ordinary shares of EVRAZ plc outstanding during that period. The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 
and earnings per share for each comparative period have been recalculated using the share exchange ratio.
There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of 
completion of these consolidated financial statements.

can be used only in case of a bankruptcy.
Other Movements in Equity
Acquisitions of Non-controlling Interests in Subsidiaries
In 2011 and 2010, the Group acquired non-controlling interests in certain subsidiaries (Note 6). The excess of consideration over the carrying 
value of non-controlling interests amounting to $18 million and $3 million, respectively, was charged to accumulated profits and the excess 
of acquired non-controlling interests over the consideration amounting to $Nil and $1 million, respectively, was recorded as additional paid-in 
capital. 
Derecognition of Non-controlling Interests in Subsidiaries
In 2009, the Group derecognised non-controlling interests in Vanady-Tula resulting in a $5 million charge to accumulated profits (Note 4). 
In 2010, the non-controlling shareholder’s right to put a 49% share in Frotora Holdings Ltd. (“Frotora”) to the Group at fair value of the ownership 
interest become exercisable. The Group derecognised a 49% ownership interest in Frotora amounting to $6 million and accrued a liability for the 
same amount. The assets of Frotora comprised mostly the rights under a long-term lease of land to be used for the construction of a commercial 
seaport in Ukraine. These rights are included in contract terms category of the intangible assets. In 2010, the Group recognised an impairment 
loss of $30 million in respect of these rights due to the change in plans for the use of this land.

Covenants Reset
Some of the loan agreements and terms and conditions of notes provide for certain covenants in respect of Evraz Group S.A. and its subsidiaries. 
The covenants impose restrictions in respect of certain transactions and financial ratios, including restrictions in respect of indebtedness and 
profitability.
In November 2009, the lenders under certain bank facilities approved the requested amendments to the agreements, which included a reset 
of the financial covenants. The total principal amount of these borrowings at 31 December 2009 was $2,895 million. 
In December 2009, the Group received the consent of the holders of its notes due in 2013, 2015 and 2018 totalling $2,242 million to amend 
the terms of certain covenants in the notes. The financial covenant ratios of the notes were subsequently amended in a manner similar to the 
amendments to the bank facilities.
In connection with the covenants reset, the Group incurred transaction costs comprising consent fees and legal fees amounting to $114 million, 
which will be amortised during the period of the borrowings. These costs were fully paid during 2009 and 2010. 
Pledged Assets
The Group pledged its rights under some export contracts as collateral under the loan agreements. All proceeds from sales of steel pursuant 
to these contracts can be used to satisfy the obligations under the loan agreements in the event of a default. 134 EVRAZ plc

recognised a loss on extinguishment of debts in the amount of $71 million within gain/(loss) on financial assets and liabilities caption of the 
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended 31 December 2011 (Note 7).
On 22 June 2011, Evraz Group S.A. made an incentive offer to the holders of 7.25% convertible bonds due 2014 to convert these bonds into 
GDRs at $21.12 per GDR. In addition, the holders were offered an incentive payment (“conversion premium”) of $24,443.89 per bond with

for refinancing of short-term loans.
In December 2009, the Group fully repaid its liabilities under an $800 million loan from VEB and a 10,000 million rouble loan from VTB.
In November 2009, the maturity of the VEB loan facility in the total amount of $1,007 million was extended for another twelve months.

23. Employee Beneﬁts
Russian Plans
In 2009–2010, the Russian subsidiaries of the Group provided regular lifetime pension payments and lump-sum amounts payable at the 
retirement date. These benefits generally depend on years of service, level of remuneration and amount of pension payment under the collective 
bargaining agreements. Other post-employment benefits consist of various compensations and certain non-cash benefits. The Group funds the 
benefits when the amounts of benefits fall due for payment. 
In addition, certain Russian subsidiaries have defined benefit plans under which contributions are made to a separately administered non-state 
pension fund. The Group matches 100% of the employees’ contributions to the fund up to 4% of their monthly salary. The Group’s contributions 
become payable at the participants’ retirement dates.
In 2009, the Group realised a staff optimisation programme. The Group paid $22 million as termination benefits to approximately 10,000 
employees discharged as a result of the staff optimisation measures. The termination payments were recognised as expense and included 
in other operating expense caption of the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Defined contribution plans represent payments made by the Group to the Russian state pension, social insurance, medical insurance and 
unemployment funds at the statutory rates in force, based on gross salary payments. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to 
pay further contributions in respect of those benefits. 
Ukrainian Plans
The Ukrainian subsidiaries make regular contributions to the State Pension Fund thereby partially compensating preferential pensions paid by 
the fund to employees who worked under harmful and hard conditions. The amount of such pension depends on years of service and salary. 
The Ukrainian enterprises gradually increase these compensations and in 2012 they will compensate 100% of preferential pensions. In addition, 
employees receive lump-sum payments on retirement under collective labour agreements. These benefits are based on years of service and level 
of compensation. All these payments are considered as defined benefit plans. 136 EVRAZ plc

US and Canadian Plans
The Group’s subsidiaries in the USA and Canada have defined benefit pension plans, post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefit 
plans and supplemental retirement plans that cover all eligible employees. Benefits are based on pensionable years of service, pensionable 
compensation, or a combination of both depending on the individual plan. Certain employees that were hired after specified dates are no longer 
eligible to participate in the defined benefit plans. Those employees are instead enrolled in defined contribution plans and receive a contribution 
funded by the Group’s subsidiaries equal to 2–7% of annual wages, including bonuses for certain employees. The defined contribution plans are 
funded annually, and participants’ benefits vest after three years of service. The subsidiaries also offer qualified Thrift (401(k)) plans to all of their 
eligible employees.
Other Plans
Defined benefit pension plans and a defined contribution plan are maintained by the subsidiaries located in South Africa, Italy and the 
Czech Republic.
Deﬁned Contribution Plans
The Group’s expenses under defined contribution plans were as follows:
US$ million 2011 2010 2009
Expense under defined contribution plans $404 $257 $217
Deﬁned Beneﬁt Plans
The Russian, Ukrainian and other defined benefit plans are mostly unfunded and the US and Canadian plans are partially funded.

24. Share-based Payments 
On 5 September 2006, 14 December 2010 and 13 October 2011, the Group adopted Incentive Plans under which certain members of the Board 
of Directors, senior executives and employees (“participants”) could acquire or be gifted shares of Evraz Group S.A. Share options granted on 
5 September 2006 under the Incentive Plan 2006 could be exercised at $65.37 per share. Shares under the Incentive Plans 2010 and 2011 
are gifted to the participants upon vesting.
Under Plan 2006, the vesting date for each tranche was the date falling 15 days after the date when the Board of Directors approves the 
annual results. 
The actual vesting dates were as follows:
Incentive Plan
Number of Shares of Evraz Group S.A.  2006
11 May 2007 99,282
15 April 2008 148,904
15 May 2009 248,183
496,369
According to the Plan 2010 and 2011, the vesting date for each tranche occurs within the 90-day period after announcement of the annual 
results. The expected vesting dates of the awards outstanding at 31 December 2011 are presented below:
Incentive Plan Incentive Plan
Number of Shares of EVRAZ plc 2011 2010
29 March 2012      851,068739,686
29 March 2013      894,399739,491
29 March 2014      1,235,903 –
2,981,370 1,479,177
The plans are administrated by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Board of Directors has the right to accelerate vesting of the grant. 
In the event of a participant’s employment termination the following rules were established:
 Plans 2010 and 2011: unless otherwise determined by the Board or by a decision of the authorised person, a participant loses the 
entitlement for the shares that were not gifted up to the date of termination. 
 Plan 2006: all options granted to a participant, whether vested or not, expired on termination date. 
There have been no modifications or cancellations to the plans during 2009–2011. In 2011, after the Group’s reorganisation (Notes 1 and 20), 
the shares of Evraz Group S.A., which were granted to the participants, have been substituted by the shares of EVRAZ plc. 
The Group accounted for share-based compensation at fair value pursuant to the requirements of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”. The weighted 
average fair value of share-based awards granted in 2011, 2010 and 2006 was $48.26, $102.07 and $14.15 per share of Evraz Group S.A., 
respectively. The fair value of these awards was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing models with the 
following inputs, including assumptions:
Incentive Plan Incentive Plan Incentive Plan
2011 2010 2006
Dividend yield (%) 3.6 – 4.8 1.2 – 1.5 4 – 6
Expected volatility (%) n/a n/a 45.37
Risk-free interest rates (%) n/a n/a 5.42 – 5.47
Expected life (years) 0.5 – 2.5 0.5 – 2.5 0.7 – 2.7
Market prices of the shares of Evraz Group S.A. at the grant dates  $51.57 $103.83 $66.06
The historical volatility has been used for valuation of the share-based awards. The volatility reflects the assumption that it is indicative of future 
trends which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. EVRAZ plc

Under the legislation, mining companies and steel mills have obligations to restore mining sites and contaminated land. The respective liabilities 
were measured based on estimates of restoration costs which are expected to be incurred in the future discounted at the annual rate ranging 
from 3.7% to 14% (2010: 6.1% to 13%, 2009: from 8% to 13%).

Contingent Consideration Payable
Contingent consideration represents additional payments for the acquisition of Stratcor in 2006. This consideration could be paid each year up to 
2019. The payments depend on the deviation of the average prices for vanadium pentoxide from certain levels and the amounts payable for each 
year are limited to maximum amounts. In 2011, the Group paid $3 million in respect of this liability (2010: $16 million, 2009: $Nil).
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
In 2009–2011, the Group issued rouble-denominated bonds in the total amount of 70,000 million Russian roubles (Note 21). To manage the 
currency exposure, the Group concluded swap contracts under which it agreed to deliver US dollar-denominated interest payments at the rates 
ranging from 4.45% to 8.90% per annum plus the notional amount totalling $2,177 million, in exchange for rouble-denominated interest payments 
plus the notional amount totalling 63,790 million roubles ($1,981 million at the exchange rate as of 31 December 2011). The exchange is 
exercised on approximately the same dates as the payments under the bonds.
The swap contracts are summarised in the table below.
Hedged
Principal, amount, Swap
millions of millions of amount, Interest rates on 
roubles roubles US$ million the swap amount
13.5 per cent bonds due 2014  20,000 14,019 $475 7.50% – 8.90%

70,000 63,790 $2,177
These swap contracts were not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. The Group accounted for these derivatives at fair value which was 
determined using valuation techniques. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the change in fair value of the derivatives of $(176) million, $(27) million and 
$(6) million, respectively, together with a realised gain on the swap transactions, amounting to $66 million, $31 million and $Nil, respectively, 
was recognised within gain/(loss) on financial assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations (Note 7). EVRAZ plc

29. Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Financial 
instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and trade accounts receivable. 
To manage credit risk related to cash, the Group maintains its available cash, mainly in US dollars, in reputable international banks and major 
Russian banks. Management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of the banks in which it deposits cash.
The Group’s trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. There are no 
significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related 
entities. The major customers are Russian Railways and Vanomet AG (4.2% and 2.4% of total sales, respectively). 
Part of the Group’s sales is made on terms of letter of credit. In addition, the Group requires prepayments from certain customers. The Group 
does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables, except when a customer asks for a payment period which is longer than 
normal terms. In this case, the Group requires bank guarantees or other liquid collateral. The Group has developed standard payment terms 
and constantly monitors the status of accounts receivable collection and the creditworthiness of the customers. 
Certain of the Group’s long-standing Russian customers for auxiliary products, such as heat and electricity, represent municipal enterprises 
and governmental organisations that experience financial difficulties. The significant part of doubtful debts allowance consists of receivables 
from such customers. The Group has no practical ability to terminate the supply to these customers and negotiates with regional and municipal 
authorities the terms of recovery of these receivables.
At 31 December the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets, which is disclosed below.

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, 
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group prepares a rolling 12-month financial plan which ensures that the Group has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational 
expenses, financial obligations and investing activities as they arise. The Group exercises a daily monitoring of cash proceeds and payments. 
The Group maintains credit lines and overdraft facilities that can be drawn down to meet short-term financing needs. The Group’s objective is to 
refinance its short-term debt by long-term borrowings. The Group has developed standard payment periods in respect of trade accounts payable 
and monitors the timeliness of payments to its suppliers and contractors. EVRAZ plc

Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
exposures, while optimising the return on risk. 
Interest Rate Risk
The Group borrows on both a fixed and variable rate basis and has other interest-bearing liabilities, such as finance lease liabilities and other 
obligations. 
The Group incurs interest rate risk on liabilities with variable interest rates. The Group’s treasury function performs analysis of current interest 
rates. In case of changes in market fixed or variable interest rates management may consider the refinancing of a particular debt on more 
favourable terms. The Group does not have any financial assets with variable interest rates.
Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis for Fixed Rate Instruments
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore, a change in interest rates 
at the reporting date would not affect the Group’s profits.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets as assets available for sale. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting 
date would not affect the Group’s equity.
Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis for Variable Rate Instruments
Based on the analysis of exposure during the years presented, reasonably possible changes in floating interest rates at the reporting date would 
have changed profit before tax (“PBT”) by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency 
rates, remain constant. EVRAZ plc

Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currencies of the respective Group’s subsidiaries. The currencies in which these transactions are denominated are primarily US dollars and euro.
The Group does not have formal arrangements to mitigate currency risks of the Group’s operations. However, management believes that the Group 
is secured from currency risks as foreign currency denominated sales are used to cover repayment of foreign currency denominated borrowings.
The Group’s exposure to currency risk determined as the net monetary position in the respective currencies was as follows at 31 December:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
 Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or 
indirectly; and 
 Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs).
The carrying amounts of financial instruments, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, short-term accounts receivable and payable, 
short-term loans receivable and payable and promissory notes, approximate their fair value.  EVRAZ plc

The fair value of the non-convertible bonds and notes was determined based on market quotations. The fair value of convertible bonds and long-
term bank loans was calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the Group’s market rates of 
interest at the reporting dates. The discount rates used for valuation of financial instruments were as follows:
Currency in which ﬁnancial instruments are denominated  2011 2010 2009
USD 8.2 – 9.1% 7.7 – 8.3% 8.6 – 9.5%
EUR 3.2% 2.8% 7.0%
RUB 9.7% 12.0% 16.0%
Capital Management
Capital includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent entity. Revaluation surplus which is included in capital is not subject to 
capital management because of its nature. 
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order 
to support its business and maximise the return to shareholders. The Board of Directors reviews the Group’s performance and establishes key 
performance indicators. In addition, the Group and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements (loans and 
bonds covenants) which are used for capital monitoring. There were no changes in the objectives, policies and processes during 2011. 150 EVRAZ plc

Capital Management (continued)
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it by the issue of new shares, dividend payments to shareholders, and the

The capital requirements imposed by certain loan agreements include a $2,000 million minimum representing consolidated equity less goodwill. 
In 2009–2011, the Group was in compliance with this requirement.

31. Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Environment of the Group
The Group is one of the largest vertically integrated steel producers globally and the largest steel producer in Russia. The Group’s major 
subsidiaries are located in Russia, Ukraine, the European Union, the USA, Canada and the Republic of South Africa. Russia and Ukraine are 
considered to be emerging markets with higher economic and political risks.
In the wake of the global financial crisis, all countries continue to face an uneven economic recovery. Though stabilisation measures introduced 
by governments had positive effects, nevertheless, in 2010 and 2011, there was no material uplift in the ship-building, pipe-making, railway 
transportation, construction or oil and gas industries, which are the major customers of the Group. The global steel industry is highly competitive 
and has historically been characterised by overcapacity. Steel consumption is affected by the cyclical nature of demand for steel products and the 
sensitivity of that demand to worldwide general economic conditions. The global economic recession resulted in a significantly lower demand for 
steel products and decreased profitability. 
In 2011, the sovereign debt problems in Europe and the USA added extra volatility to commodity markets and led to an additional uncertainty 
in the process of recovery of the global economy. 
The global economic climate continues to be unstable and this may negatively affect the Group’s results and financial position in a manner not 
currently determinable.
Taxation
Russian and Ukrainian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. 
Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged by the relevant 
regional and federal authorities. 
Recent events within the Russian Federation suggest that the tax authorities are taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of the 
legislation and assessments and, as a result, it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the past may be 
challenged. As such, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. 
Management believes that it has paid or accrued all taxes that are applicable. Where uncertainty exists, the Group has accrued tax liabilities 
based on management’s best estimate of the probable outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, which will be required to settle these 
liabilities. Possible liabilities which were identified by management at the end of the reporting period as those that can be subject to different 
interpretations of the tax laws and other regulations and are not accrued in these financial statements could be up to approximately $46 million.
Contractual Commitments
At 31 December 2011, the Group had contractual commitments for the purchase of production equipment and construction works for an 
approximate amount of $524 million.
In 2010, the Group concluded an agreement for the supply of oxygen, nitrogen and argon by a third party for a period of 20 years. The contractual 
price comprises a fixed component and a variable component. The total amount of the fixed component approximates 252 million euro. The 
agreement is within the scope of IFRIC 4 “Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease”. At 31 December 2011, the lease had not 
commenced.
Social Commitments
The Group is involved in a number of social programmes aimed to support education, healthcare and social infrastructure development in towns 
where the Group’s assets are located. In 2012, the Group plans to spend approximately $160 million under these programmes. EVRAZ plc

31. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)
Environmental Protection
In the course of the Group’s operations, the Group may be subject to environmental claims and legal proceedings. The quantification of 
environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors, including changing laws and regulations, improvements in environmental 
technologies, the quality of information available related to specific sites, the assessment stage of each site investigation, preliminary findings 
and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement. Management believes that any pending environmental claims or proceedings will 
not have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations.
In the period from 2012 to 2017, the Group is committed to spend approximately $303 million under the environmental programmes. 
Legal Proceedings
The Group has been and continues to be the subject of legal proceedings, none of which has had, individually or in aggregate, a significant effect 
on the Group’s operations or financial position. Possible liabilities which were identified by the Group at the end of the reporting period as those that 
can be subject to different interpretations of legislation and are not accrued in these financial statements could be up to approximately $3 million.
In February 2008, the South African Competition Commission (the “Competition Commission”) received a complaint from Petrel Engineering (Pty) 
Ltd, alleging that EVRAZ Highveld (then Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Limited) and ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited were involved, 
whether directly or indirectly, in the fixing of the selling prices of their flat steel products. In April 2008, the Competition Commission initiated 
a complaint against various steel manufacturers, including EVRAZ Highveld. 
EVRAZ Highveld provided the Competition Commission with the documentation and information requested by the Competition Commission 
and the Competition Commission conducted interviews with certain of EVRAZ Highveld employees in February 2009. 
On 2 April 2012 EVRAZ Highveld has received a referral of complaint of the Competition Commission to the South African Competition Tribunal 
(the “Competition Tribunal”), seeking an order inter alia: (i) declaring that the conduct of ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited and EVRAZ Highveld 
contravened certain provisions of the South African Competition Act, Act 89 of 1998 (the “Competition Act”); and (ii) imposing administrative 
penalties against both ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited and EVRAZ Highveld. EVRAZ Highveld has to answer the allegations contained in the 
Referral of Complaint by the beginning of May, 2012. According to the Competition Act the maximum fine which could be imposed on EVRAZ 
Highveld if it is considered guilty is equal to 10% of its annual revenue. EVRAZ Highveld’s revenue in 2011 was $764 million.
No decision has yet been announced by the Competition Tribunal as to whether it will decide to impose any penalty against EVRAZ Highveld or, 
if imposed, the amount of any such fine. EVRAZ Highveld will have the right to appeal the decision of the Competition Tribunal.
Management believes that EVRAZ Highveld acted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Thus, no provision for this matter has been 
accrued as of 31 December 2011. The Group has cooperated with the Competition Commission throughout the investigation and intends to 
continue to do so. Currently, the Group is reviewing the Competition Commission’s complaint and preparing its response.

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 79, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and 
Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its loss for the period then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of EVRAZ PLC for the year ended 31 December 2011.

1. Corporate Information 
These separate financial statements of EVRAZ plc were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 24 April 2012. 
EVRAZ plc (“EVRAZ plc” or “the Company”) was incorporated on 23 September 2011 as a public company under the laws of the United Kingdom. 
The company was incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 with the registered number 7784342 (originally called Project Savannah plc 
which name was changed to EVRAZ plc by a resolution on 13 October 2011).The Company’s registered office is at 5th Floor, 6 St. Andrew Street, 
London, EC4A 3AE, United Kingdom.
As a result of the reorganisation implemented by way of the share exchange offer made by the Company for the shares of Evraz Group S.A. 
(Luxembourg), on 7 November 2011, the Company became a new parent entity of Evraz Group S.A., a joint stock company registered in 
Luxembourg in 2004. Evraz Group S.A. is a holding company which owns steel production, mining and trading companies. At 31 December 2011, 
the Company held 99.82% in Evraz Group S.A.
The Company, together with its subsidiaries (the “Group”), is involved in the production and distribution of steel and related products and coal 
and iron ore mining. In addition, the Group produces vanadium products. The Group is one of the largest steel producers globally.
Lanebrook Limited (Cyprus) is the ultimate controlling party of the Group.
2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as adopted by the 
European Union and applicable requirements of the UK law.
International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (“IASB”). IFRSs that are mandatory for 
application as of 31 December 2011, but not adopted by the European Union, do not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements. 
The standards issued but not yet effective for the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 are disclosed in the consolidated 
financial statements.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the directors believe there are no material uncertainties that lead 
to significant doubt the entity can continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future.
Foreign Currency Transactions
The presentation and functional currency of the Company is US dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in US dollar at the 
rate ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange 
at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. 
Investments in Subsidiaries
Participations in subsidiaries are initially stated at acquisition cost. Write-downs are recorded if, in the opinion of the management, there is any 
permanent impairment in value.
The cost of investment in Evraz Group S.A. was measured at the carrying amount of the equity items of Evraz Group S.A. as a separate legal 
entity at the date of the reorganisation. 
Dividend income is recognised as revenue when the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is established.
All purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the settlement date, which is the date when the investment is delivered to or by the 
Company. 
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for 
doubtful receivables is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and when it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement 
is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.

The Company recognised a reorganisation reserve of $(582) million being the difference between the net assets of Evraz Group S.A. at 7 November 
2011 and the par value of the issued shares of EVRAZ plc. This charge to equity reduced the amount of distributable reserves.
On 24 November 2011, the par value of the shares was reduced to $1, and $1,313 million representing distributable reserves were transferred 
to accumulated profits. All subsequent shares were issued with par value of $1 each. 160 EVRAZ plc

Unsolicited Calls
Unsolicited telephone calls and correspondence
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to 
buy shares at a discount, or offers of free reports about the Company. 
These are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ who target US or UK 
shareholders, offering to sell them what often turns out to be worthless 
or high risk shares. These operations are commonly known as ‘boiler 
rooms’ and the ‘brokers’ can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
 Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation. 
 Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting 
involved by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/fsaregister and contacting the 
firm using the details on the register. 
 Report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0845 606 1234 or 
visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/scams. 
 If the calls persist, hang up. 
Details of any share dealing facilities that the company endorses will be 
included in Company mailings.

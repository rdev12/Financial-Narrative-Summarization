Case Study
Protecting Shareholders’ Interests
On 1 August 2012 we announced we had bought the 10% interest held by Leni 
Gas & Oil Investments Limited in the PSC covering offshore Malta Area 4 Blocks, 4, 
5, 6, and 7, bringing our holding to 100%.
Leni Gas & Oil plc (‘LGO’) announced on 1 August that ‘LGO has decided as a 
result of its own technical assessment of the project to divest, at no further cost, its 
interest in the Malta venture which is both non-core and non-strategic to LGO’s 
onshore oil development mission. This will allow us to avoid any further 
expenditure on Malta and to focus our management and cash resources on our 
core business of production growth in Trinidad’.
On 23 August 2012 we announced that we had farmed out 75% of our 100% 
working interest in offshore Malta Area 4 PSC.
The following morning at 7:00am, LGO issued an announcement referring to our 
Malta farm out and stating ‘LGO is surprised by the content of the announcement 
and is seeking immediate advice from the Company’s litigation lawyers, Mishcon 
de Reya.’ Following this, notwithstanding the undoubtedly good news of the farm 
out, our share price fell over 20% in the space of 20 days.
Apparently concerned to hear that another party had taken a different view of 
the prospectivity of the Malta asset in which they had just divested their 10% 
interest, LGO proceeded to make various allegations to the effect that they had 
been misled about the prospectivity. There were exchanges of correspondence 
before solicitors and in January 2013 LGO issued proceedings in the High Court 
claiming they had been induced to sell their 10% interest by a comment made 
on a telephone call on 10 July 2012 about MOG opening a data room the 
following week. The comment is alleged by LGO to have been an implied 
representation as to the timing and prospects of the MOG’s farm out process and 
was designed to cause LGO to sell ‘cheaply’ and ‘speedily’.
Throughout the period of this dispute, LGO has made numerous comments 
about the case via Regulatory News Announcements, Twitter, e-mail and even in 
statements made at investor conferences that were then posted on You Tube. 
The nature of the allegations made by LGO became widely known in the sector 
and spawned a profusion of speculation, including on-line investor forums, as to 
the potential impact on MOG.
Although not all of the comments have been adverse to MOG – indeed, many of 
them were supportive, the MOG Board took the view that it could not allow LGO’s 
claim, and often inaccurate information in the public domain, to erode 
shareholder value. The Company took all steps to equip it to defend the claim 
and to set the record straight, where possible, in relation to any misinformation. 
This was not always an easy task, particularly given the ability of commentators 
to post anonymously. The successful defence against LGO’s claim in an open 
court process will ultimately allow us to defend ourselves, and the interests of our 
shareholders to:
a) set the record straight;
b) enhance the reputation of the MOG team;
c) re-establish investor confidence and interest in MOG stock;
d) recover legal defence fees incurred; and
e) demonstrate MOG’s determination to protect itself from speculative 
rumours and legal claims. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 6

Chairman’s statement
Keith Henry
Chairman
€12.4m. Net cash flow from operations 
in 2013 was an outflow of €1.2m, down 
from €6.5m inflow in 2012.
We were informed at the start of 2013 
that Italy’s Environmental Impact 
Assessment (’EIA’) Commission, 
charged by the Ministry of Environment 
and of Protection of Land and Sea 
(‘MEPLS’) to rule on the Ombrina Mare 
oil and gas field development EIA, had 
ruled in favour of the Company’s 
submission. This positive news slowly 
turned to disappointment as the year 
progressed, with the Minister declining 
to sign the resulting EIA Decree that 
was presented to him for signature in 
February 2013. The MOG team, 
together with our advisers, have 
invested very considerable time and 
effort, often behind the scenes, to 
engage with all key stakeholders. 
Despite our many attempts at the 
highest levels to resolve this matter, 
ultimately we have been obliged to 
lodge an appeal with the Italian 
courts. Post this reporting period our 
legal appeal against the actions of the 
Minister was heard at a tribunal 
hearing held on 9 January 2014 at the 
Administrative Court in Rome. The 
Company is presently awaiting the 
decision of the appeal. We remain 
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board of 
Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc, I am 
pleased to announce the Company’s 
2013 results.
A significant challenge for the 
Company in 2013 was the sudden loss 
of production from two of our key 
production wells at the Guendalina 
Field, offshore Italy, which resulted in us 
missing our production expectations 
by over 40%. I am pleased to report 
that, following a well clean-up 
operation at the start of 2014, 
production has been restored at GUE 
3SS, and that the updated reservoir 
analysis carried out during this exercise 
indicates the reservoir is in better 
condition and less depleted than we 
thought at the time of our Interim 
Results statement. As such, in these 
results, we are able to reverse €1.2 
million of the €1.8 million impairment  
of the Guendalina Field reported in 
September 2013. We look forward to 
continued safe and reliable operations 
at the Guendalina Field, which 
remains our main source of revenue.
Total annual production was 27.6 
MMscm (175,420 boe) and total 
revenue was €8.4m. Cash and cash 
equivalents at the period end was 
‘We have turned  
the corner after  
a challenging year  
and are well placed  
to advance the value 
of our portfolio in the 
year ahead.’ Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 9
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
convinced that the development of 
the Ombrina Mare Field will benefit the 
Abruzzo region and we are resolute 
that we will protect our shareholders’ 
interests in what is a very important 
asset within our portfolio.
On a more positive note, we have 
made good progress preparing for our 
upcoming drilling activities offshore 
Malta in Area 4. All of the necessary 
logistics and contracts are in place 
and we are now awaiting arrival of the 
rig and final clearances to start drilling. 
Post this reporting period, we received 
an extension of six months to the first 
exploration period to July 2014, 
enabling sufficient time to complete 
the drilling activities.
In 2012 the Board implemented a 
revised remuneration policy for the 
executives and all staff that more closely 
aligns their total reward based on a 
weighted combination of their individual 
performance, and the overall 
performance of the Company as 
compared with our peers. At the end  
of 2012, the Company was in the top 
quartile in terms of share value growth 
when compared with over 100 E&P 
companies listed on AIM, and this report 
reflects the executive and staff bonuses 
for 2012 performance that were 
awarded in January 2013. As a result of 
the general underperformance of our 
share price during the last twelve 
months, no executive bonuses or 
options were awarded for 2013.
Outlook
There is no doubt that 2014 will be an 
important year in the growth of the 
Company. We are excited to have two 
exploration wells and 1,500km of 2D 
seismic acquisition planned for the 
first half of the year. The drilling of the 
first exploration well, Hagar Qim, 
offshore Malta Area 4, has the 
potential to open up a new 
hydrocarbon basin. The onshore Italy 
Faseto 1 exploration well, while not a 
high-impact well like Hagar Qim, is an 
opportunity for rapid implementation 
as the development options have 
already been pre-approved.
During 2013 significant time, effort and 
resources have been spent by the 
Company in preparing to defend the 
interests of our shareholders against 
the claim and proceedings initiated  
by Leni Gas & Oil plc (‘LGO’) in 
January 2013. The Company continues 
to refute the various claims that have 
been made by LGO. The allegations 
made are unfounded and the 
Company will defend itself and the 
interests of its shareholders rigorously. 
The case is due to come before the 
Commercial High Court in London in 
early March 2014.
Particularly given the production 
challenges of 2013, we have 
maintained a strong focus on the cost 
of our operations, and our corporate 
overheads. At the close of the year we 
moved our four-person London 
head-quarters to a small serviced 
office and, at the beginning of 
January, we announced that two of 
our Non-Executive Directors, Jake 
Ulrich and Matthew Clarke, had 
stepped down from the Board. I am 
very grateful to Jake and Matthew for 
their guidance and I know that they 
remain strong supporters of the 
Company. I am confident we have a 
Board of Directors that is well placed to 
guide the Company through its next 
phase of development.
Mediterranean Oil & Gas continues to 
build up a very experienced technical 
and management team highly 
capable of exploring and developing 
oil and gas assets. To that end the 
Board remains focused and committed 
to growing the Company and we are 
actively seeking additional opportunities 
to expand our current portfolio.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
thank our shareholders and our 
employees for their continued support.

Chief Executive’s report
William Higgs
Chief Executive
At the beginning of 2013 we were 
looking forward to another full year of 
production from the Guendalina Field. 
Sadly this was not to be. With 
production being shut-in first at GUE 
2SS in March and then GUE 3SS in 
August our annual production fell over 
40% short of our 2013 expectations. The 
Group delivered total sales revenue of 
€8.4 million and had a cash and cash 
equivalents position of €12.4 million at  
31 December 2013.
We were pleased to note that the GUE 
3SS re-started production after the 
operator (ENI) initiated remedial 
operations on 24 December 2013. 
These operations were hampered  
by difficult weather conditions in  
the Adriatic. The intervention  
was completed successfully on  
11 January 2014 and the well returned 
to low-rate production. The well is  
now on stable production of 
approximately 5,500 scm per day net 
to MOG. In addition, the updated 
analysis of the reservoir by ERCE has 
confirmed our view that the reservoir  
is more substantial and in a better 
condition than we had assumed for 
the 2013 Interim Results statement.

factory
‘2013 was a tough year 
for the Company. It is 
good that 2014 will see 
us drilling wells and 
shooting seismic for the 
first time since 201 1 – 
these are the activities 
that will progress our 
portfolio’
Using this latest analysis we are able to 
reverse €1.2 million of the €1.8 million 
impairment of the Guendalina Field 
reported in September 2013.
Our critical commercial objective for 
2013 was to seek the approval of the 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
(‘EIA’) for our Ombrina Mare Field. The 
year started well with the EIA 
Commission, charged by the Ministry 
of Environment and of Protection of 
Land and Sea (‘MEPLS’) to rule on the 
Ombrina Mare oil and gas field 
development EIA, ruling positively in 
favour of MOG’s submission. The 
resulting EIA Decree was presented to 
the MEPLS for signature in February 
2013, where it has remained unsigned, 
despite continued lobbying from the 
Company with all key stakeholders, 
ever since. Once the EIA Decree is 
countersigned by the MEPLS, and by 
the Minister of Heritage and Cultural 
Activities, MOG will be able to seek 
award of the d30 BC MD Ombrina 
Mare Production Concession from the 
Ministry of Economic Development 
(‘MED’). The MED granted technical 
approval of the Field Development 
Plan for Ombrina Mare in June 2009. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 11
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
In 2013 we acquired a 40% working 
interest in the Exploration Study 
Agreement for offshore Malta Area 3 
Blocks 1, 2, and 3. We believe that this 
region is a complementary asset to 
offshore Malta Area 4, as it lies on the 
margin of a proven hydrocarbon 
province. We have also made good 
progress in preparing for our 
upcoming drilling activities offshore 
Malta in Area 4. All of the necessary 
logistics and contracts are in place 
and we are now awaiting arrival of the 
Noble rig ‘Paul Romano’, which is 
finalising refurbishments in Malta. Post 
the reporting period we received an 
extension of six months to the first 
exploration period to enable sufficient 
time to complete the drilling activities.
The Company has a broad asset base 
across the exploration, development 
and production phases of the 
business. These assets have significant 
upside potential and we are looking 
ahead to de-risk and mature these 
assets over the coming years, while 
also looking for valuable opportunities 
for asset acquisition.
Gas Production and Prices
All gas production of the Group is 
currently from onshore and offshore Italy.
In 2013, total gas production was 0.97 
Bcf (27.6 MMscm), which represented a 
42% reduction relative to the prior year 
(2012: 1.69 Bcf). This was largely due to 
the reduction in gas production at the 
Guendalina Gas Field caused by the 
shut-in of wells GUE 2SS and GUE 3SS.
During 2012, the Brent oil price has 
fluctuated around $100-110/bbl, while 
the Euro versus US Dollar exchange rate 
has experienced significant volatility 
which has influenced gas prices. The 
average gas sales price achieved  
by the Group during the period was 
€0.30/scm (USD 11.2/Mcf).
The Company’s forecasts for future gas 
prices indicate continued downward 
pressure in 2014 and 2015 and the 
Italian gas price is expected to remain 
between 28.1 and 29.3 Euro cents per 
scm which is below the long run 
average gas price, due to the excess 
of gas supply relative to gas demand 
in the Italian market.
What Happened at Guendalina?
The problems encountered at the 
Guendalina Field in 2013 are still under 
investigation, but appear to have their 
origins in the spring of 2012 when the 
operating conditions of the two wells 
GUE 2SS and GUE 3SS changed in late 
May 2012.
In the case of GUE 2SS, both the 
production rate and the flowing 
wellhead pressure increased, which  
at the time was (correctly) interpreted 
as a cleaning up of the well and the 
unexpected addition of incremental 
production from sand intervals not 
originally connected to the well. In 
September 2012, after a short well 
shut-in, GUE 2SS had a sudden 
deterioration in gas rate as well  
as wellhead tubing pressure. 
Unfortunately on 5 March 2013, after 
several months of decline, GUE 2SS was 
taken offline to determine the cause of 
an influx of water that resulted in the 
well ceasing production. The probable 
cause of the well shut-in is the 
premature water breakthrough from 
the bottom aquifer associated with the 
additional sand intervals that started 
contributing in May 2012. This well is 
currently shut-in and will remain shut-in 
for the foreseeable future. However, the 
gas level completed for production at 
GUE 2SS is being produced from well 
GUE 3LS, which is in an up dip location.
In the case of GUE 3SS, the production 
rate increased and the flowing well 
head pressure decreased. Once 
again, the characteristics of the well 
indicate cleaning up of the completion 
and, in this case, an increase in the 
drawdown of the reservoir. In July and 
August 2013 the production rate on 
GUE 3SS started to decline more rapidly 
and the well was taken offline on  
30 August 2013 due to low pressure at 
the manifold. Subsequent analysis 
indicated that the reservoir was in 
good condition and at a higher static 
pressure than predicted. With these 
new data it was possible to 
demonstrate that the well performance 
had been progressively deteriorating 
since the late May 2012 event and that 
the observed increased ‘skin’ to the 
well was probably the consequence of 
the migration of fine grained material 
towards the wellbore, which 
progressively reduced productivity. This 
was unknowable during the period of 
time that the well was on production. 
With these new data the operator (ENI) 
designed and executed a remedial 
treatment of the well to remove the 
fines. The well was brought back onto 
low-rate production on 11 January 
2014. The well continues to clean up 
and is currently achieving stable 
production of approximately 5,500 scm 
per day net to the Company.
Well GUE 3LS has maintained its 
operating conditions throughout 2012 
and 2013. GUE 3LS has been performing 
in line with expectations and is currently 
producing about 31,000 scm per day 
net to the Company.
The knock-on effects of the damage  
to these two wells cannot be 
understated. We quickly went from a 
cash flow positive to cash flow negative 
business when including all operating 
and capital costs. This has placed 
downward pressure on the share price 
and created sufficient uncertainty in 
our future cash flows that it has been 
very difficult to undertake any 
accretive transactions.
Oil & Gas Reserves and Resources
In 2013 the Company selected ERCE  
to undertake an audit of the Group’s 
reserves and resources. This analysis, 
which has been detailed and robust, 
has resulted in some significant 
movement and reductions on our 
Reserves and Resources ledger. The 
changes year-on-year are highlighted 
below. Importantly, we can now be 
confident in the assessment and 
therefore value of our Reserves and 
Resources.
As at 31 December 2013, the Company 
recorded 2P reserves of 5.3 Bcf (net) of 
gas (1.0 MMboe) and 2,376 boe of 
condensate. Best estimate contingent 
resources were 26 MMbbls oil (net) 
and 32.4 Bcf (net) of gas. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 12

Asset Overview
Exploration, Development and 
Production
Italy – Offshore Northern Adriatic
The Company’s efforts during the 
period under review were mostly 
focused on understanding the 
production challenges at the 
Guendalina gas field offshore Italy  
in the northern Adriatic.
Other North Adriatic Gas Discoveries 
(MOG WI 15%, ENI WI 85% and 
Operator)
The Guendalina project is located in 
one of the most important gas 
exploration and production areas in 
Italy and is situated 70km south of four 
other discovered, but still 
undeveloped, offshore gas fields in 
which the Group has a 15% interest.
These four gas discoveries amount to 
between 10 to 50 Bcf net contingent 
gas resources to the Group and 
represent an important growth 
opportunity for the Company. Their 
reclassification from 2C (Contingent 
Resources) to 2P reserves is expected 
to take place following authorisation of 
the development plans for the fields.
The tables set out on pages 12 and 13 
summarise the evolution of the 
Group’s hydrocarbon Reserves and 
Resources since 2006 and include 
the latest update, as at 31 December 
2013.
 > 2P Oil Reserves were reduced with 
the movement of the Ombrina 
Mare Field into the Contingent 
Resources Category
 > The Company’s 2P RRR was -129%, 
which was caused by a negative 
revision of Reserves
 > The Company’s 2P Reserves to 
Production (‘R/P’) ratio for gas has 
dropped to 5.5
 > Prospective Resources for the 
Monte Grosso prospect have been 
certified as 9.8 MMbbls (1E), 29.9 
MMbbls (2E) and 85.3 MMbbls (3E) 
with a mean of 41.5 MMbbls
 > The Company is committed to 
de-risk and mature resources, to 
progressively replace reserves, 
maintaining the 2P RRR at around 
100% and targeting an R/P ratio of 
approximately 9
Development activity for these fields 
was frozen from 2001, initially pending 
the resolution of environmental 
concerns about subsidence caused 
by developing the offshore region.  
The Italian Government indicated in 
2009 that it is in favour of a positive 
resolution of these issues in this area of 
the Northern Adriatic. As a portion of 
the Company’s AC19 PI concession lies 
within 12 miles of nature reserves it was 
impacted by the 2010 offshore 
restrictions introduced by the Italian 
Government for the offshore E&P 
activities. On 7 August 2012 the Italian 
Parliament issued the Law 134/2012 
containing Article 35, which relates to 
offshore exploration and production 
activities. The Article states that the 
restrictions introduced under Decree 
DLGS 128/2010 would no longer be 
applicable for the pre-existing offshore 
E&P activities such as concession AC19 
PI. The Company can now work with 
ENI to increase the priority of the 
development of the Northern Adriatic 
discoveries within AC19 PI.

Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Italy – Onshore Foredeep Gas
In Italy, the Company has focused its 
footprint of onshore production and 
exploration gas assets that target gas 
traps in the Pliocene aged sand 
deposits of the Apennines Foredeep 
with the completion of the sale  
of 13 non-core assets to Canoel 
International Energy Limited. In our 
remaining E&P acreage the existing 
production is not the only value. In fact, 
several interesting development and 
exploration projects are also present, 
mainly within existing production 
concessions that have the potential to 
unlock approximately 26 to 64 Bcf net 
unrisked prospective resources to the 
Group and achieve new near to 
mid-term gas production.
In December 2012, we received the 
award of the Aglavizza Production 
Concession onshore central Italy 
where we have a 100% interest in the 
7km
2
 concession that includes the 
Civita 1 discovery with estimated 
proved and probable reserves close  
to 1 Bcf. Post the award, we safely 
conducted a production test of Civita 
1 that confirmed excellent permeability 
and no near-well bore formation 
damage. In Q3 2013 the Board made 
the final investment decision for the 
Aglavizza development. First gas is 
expected in Q3 2015 and over the 
two-year development cycle the 
Company will invest €2.8 million.  
The asset is expected to start with 
production rates of 18,000 to  
20,000 scm per day.
Italy – Ombrina Mare
Oil & Gas Discovery (MOG WI 100%)
The Ombrina Mare discovery is an 
important asset for the Company that 
represents an important future growth 
opportunity.
Following the successful drilling of two 
exploration/appraisal wells in 2008, the 
completion of a well as an oil producer 
and the set-up of a tripod platform in 
preparation for the development 
phase, the Company applied for a 
production Concession (d 30 B.C-MD) 
in December 2008. In the reporting 
period the Company worked with ERCE 
to complete a revised independent 
certification of Ombrina Mare on the 
expectation that we would be soon 
moving forwards with the development. 
Because of the continued delay to the 
award of the EIA for the project and the 
need for further appraisal drilling to fully 
assess the potential of the asset, ERCE 
certified Ombrina Mare oil and gas into 
the Contingent Resources category 
with 9.8 MMboe oil and 4.03 Bcf gas 
(1C), 25.1 MMboe oil and 8.04 Bcf gas 
(2C), and 62.8 MMboe oil and 17 .2 Bcf 
gas (3C). We plan on drilling a pilot 
development well as soon as 
logistically and safely possible post the 
award of the production concession. 
The goals of the pilot appraisal well 
would be:
 > To assess the potential for a 
hydrodynamic or tilted oil-water 
contact
 > To assess net reservoir distribution  
to the north away from the crest  
of the structure
 > To test the hydrodynamic 
performance of the reservoir
 > To test the potential of the 
Cretaceous interval to contribute to 
the productivity
The year started well with the EIA 
Commission, charged by the MEPLS to 
rule on the Ombrina Mare oil and gas 
field development EIA, ruling positively 
in favour of MOG’s submission. The 
resulting EIA Decree was presented to 
the MEPLS for signature in February 
2013, where it has remained unsigned 
ever since. Significant effort and 
resources have been directed at 
creating the correct environment for 
the Italian authorities to make a 
positive decision. We have engaged 
with the local communities onshore 
from the proposed development 
location including the opening of a 
new office in the important port town 
of Ortona.

Malta – Offshore Area 4
The Group holds a 25% working interest 
in offshore Malta Area 4, which 
comprises 5,700km
2
 of deep water 
acreage north of the internationally 
recognised border between Malta  
and Libya.
During the period:
 > We completed the sale of a 75% 
interest in offshore Malta Area 4  
to Genel for:
 > US$10 million cash payment 
(received in February 2013);
 > 100% carry on the first exploration 
well, and a 100% carry on the 
second exploration well up to 
US$30 million gross expenditure;
 > At MOG’s option, should the costs 
of the second well exceed US$30 
million, Genel will provide a 
financing arrangement to fund 
MOG’s 25% share of any 
additional expenditure, at an 
interest rate equivalent to 3 
Month LIBOR plus 400 bps.
 > We completed the logistics, 
contract awards and procurement 
required to support the drilling of the 
first exploration well, which is 
expected to spud in Q1 2014.
The area is frontier exploration where 
no drilling activity has occurred and  
it is one of the rare areas that still 
remains to be explored in the 
Mediterranean basin. The transaction 
with Genel means that a minimum of 
two exploration wells are now fully 
funded.
Post period the Company received an 
extension of the first exploration period 
by six months until 17 July 2014 to 
enable completion of the drilling 
activity. In addition, the Company 
modified the terms of its sale to Genel 
such that the two parties are now in a 
Joint Venture partnership, with a Joint 
Operating Agreement.
We have taken all necessary steps, 
including legal action, to protect 
shareholders’ interests. We will 
continue our active dialogue with the 
Italian Government, with a view to 
securing approval of the EIA for 
Ombrina Mare and the award  
of the associated Production 
Concession. Once the EIA Decree is 
countersigned by the MEPLS and the 
Minister of Heritage and Cultural 
Activities, MOG will be able to seek 
the award of the d30 BC MD Ombrina 
Mare Production Concession from 
the MED. The MED has already 
granted technical approval of the 
Field Development Plan for Ombrina 
Mare in June 2009.
Wildcat Exploration
Italy – Southern Apennines
In the Southern Apennines, the Group 
operates the Monte Grosso project, 
holding a 22.89% interest. The project 
is a high quality near field exploration 
opportunity close to one of the 
largest onshore oil producing areas 
in western Europe. The Monte Grosso 
exploration project presently remains 
on hold, pending resolution of 
residual permitting issues, which the 
Group presently believes should be 
positively resolved and allow a 
project start-up in late 2015 (subject 
to rig availability). The Monte Grosso 2 
well is targeting 181 MMbbls of 
unrisked mean Prospective Resources 
(41.5 MMbbls net to the Group) at a 
depth of 6,800m. Permitting and 
existing well site maintenance works 
were the main activities conducted 
during the period.
Offshore Malta Area 4 is a high risk, but 
potentially a high reward, geological 
environment where nine prospects 
and leads have been certified by ERCE 
and RPS with a total of 381 million bbls 
of unrisked prospective oil resources 
net to MOG.
Malta – Offshore Area 3
In June 2013 MOG reached agreement 
with Transunion Petroleum Ltd 
(‘Transunion’) and Nautical Petroleum 
Ltd, a subsidiary of Cairn Energy PLC 
(‘Cairn’), to join Cairn in the 
exploration of offshore Malta Area 3 
– Blocks 1, 2 and 3 (‘Area 3’).
In December 2012 Cairn entered into  
a three-year Exploration Study 
Agreement (‘SA’) with the Government 
of Malta for offshore Area 3, which is 
located in the Sicily Channel covering 
an area of approximately 6,000km
2
 
and containing a number of 
prospective leads. The ESA covers an 
initial two-year period with geological 
studies, the reprocessing of existing 2D 
seismic data, the acquisition of new 2D 
seismic data and limited capital works. 
The agreement provides the right to 
negotiate a production sharing 
contract and it can be extended to a 
third year to acquire 3D seismic. The 
assignment of an interest in the ESA  
to Melita Exploration Company Ltd,  
a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
Company, was approved by the 
Government of Malta in July 2013.
The joint venture has approved the 
acquisition of approximately 1,500km 
broadband 2D seismic in H1 2014  
and the operator is finalising the 
preparation of the seismic campaign.
France – St Laurent
The St Laurent permit is located in 
southern France in a known gas and 
oil prone province. The Company has 
an 11% WI in this asset. There has been 
little activity on the permit in 2013. The 
joint venture partners are seeking an 
extension to the exploration period 
from the French authorities. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 15

On 6 September 2012, the Group 
announced the divestment of non-
core exploration and production gas 
assets onshore Italy (‘Assets Held for 
Sale’), which belong to the subsidiaries 
Medoilgas Italia SpA and Medoilgas 
Civita Limited, to Canoel International 
Energy Limited (‘CIL’). In July 2013, the 
Company announced completion of 
the divestment of the Assets Held for 
Sale to CIL. In accordance with IFRS 5 
Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations, the assets 
are presented in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position as 
non-current assets ‘held for sale’ (refer 
Note 6(b) for further information) and 
in the income statements as 
discontinued operations.
On 28 February 2013, the transaction 
that was announced on 23 August 
2012 for Genel Energy plc (‘Genel’)  
to acquire a 75% working interest in 
offshore Malta Area 4 Production 
Sharing Contract (the ‘Malta PSC’) was 
completed. The Group’s total interest in 
Phoenicia Energy Company Limited 
(‘PECL’) was disclosed at the end of 
2012 as an asset held for sale in the 
statement of financial position in 
accordance with the provisions of IFRS 
5. Following the adoption of IFRS 11, 
Joint Arrangements, the Group has 
accounted for this transaction as a 
divestment of a 75% interest of PECL,  
as a disposal of a subsidiary resulting 
in a joint operation (refer Note 6(a) for 
further information). Therefore, all of 
the carrying amount has not been 
de-recognised and a gain on disposal 
of the 75% interest only has been 
recorded. The remaining carrying 
amount, representing 25% of the 
interest in the Malta PSC, has been 
included in Intangible Assets.

Revenue
Excluding discontinued operations, as 
noted above, significant reductions in 
gas and gas condensate production 
to 27.6 MMscm (2012: 47.7 MMscm) or 
0.97 Bcf (2012: 1.69 Bcf), resulted in a 
48% decline in revenues to €8.4m 
(2012: €16.3m). Operatorship income 
increased to €0.6m in the period (2012: 
€0.15m) as a consequence of time 
writing for work undertaken in relation 
to the interest held at the Malta PSC. 
This is not expected to be repeated in 
2014, given the latest agreed structure 
with the Company’s joint venture 
partner, Genel, which is the operator  
of the Malta PSC.
The events surrounding the shut in  
of the wells at the Guendalina Field, 
and the subsequent resumption of 
production, are discussed in the  
CEO’s Report on pages 10 to 15.  
The Guendalina Field is currently 
producing approximately 36,000 scm 
per day net to MOG.
The Group’s average realised gas sales 
price in 2013 was €0.30/scm (USD 11.2/
Mcf). The gas sales contract for the 
Guendalina Field, signed in March 
2013 with Repower Italia, has been 
extended to include the bulk of our 
Italian gas production and MOG is 
pleased to have the contract in place 
with Repower Italia until the end of the 
current thermal year, which ends  
on 30 September 2014.
Income From Operations
Loss from operations in 2013 was €4.4m 
(2012: profit of €4.1m). The decline was 
primarily attributable to the combined 
effect of a reduction in 2013 revenues, 
an increase in the cost of sales to 
€4.2m (2012: €3.8m) and an increase  
in total administrative expenses to 
€9.2m (2012: €8.5m). This arose as  
a consequence of the decline in  
the depreciation, depletion and 
amortisation charge to €2.6m  
(2012: €4.5m) being more than offset 
by a combination of the €600,000 
impairment charge (2012: €nil)  
arising at the Guendalina Field and  
an increase in other administrative 
expenses to €6.0m (2012: €4.0m).
Although Guendalina production 
royalties and gas treatment costs were 
lower, in line with the lower 2013 
production, other operating costs 
associated with the onshore Italy 
concessions were stable, while 
incremental maintenance costs 
associated with work undertaken to 
resume production at the Guendalina 
Field were higher, at €1.4m in 2013 
(2012: €0.6m). Total staff costs (refer 
Note 9), including those attributed to 
cost of sales, were €4.5m (2012: €3.6m) 
included a cash and share-based 
bonus payment to employees, in 
respect of a robust corporate 
performance in 2012, that was paid 
and therefore recognised, in 2013.
Other administrative expenses 
included legal fees of €1.0m, up from 
€0.2m in 2012, that were incurred by 
the Company in relation to the 
defence of the legal claim brought by 
Leni Gas & Oil Plc (‘LGO’) and Leni Gas 
& Oil Investments Limited (‘LGOI’).
The reduction in depreciation, depletion 
and amortisation charge to €2.6m (2012: 
€4.5m) arose primarily a consequence 
of lower production at Guendalina 
which is depreciated on a unit of 
production basis. As a result of the 
production interruptions at the 
Guendalina Field, an impairment 
charge of €1.8 million was recognised in 
the six month period ended 30 June 
2013. Following issuance of independent 
analysis by ERC Equipoise in February 
2014 which identified additional gas 
bearing intervals and a larger reservoir 
profile than had previously been 
estimated, management have partly 
written back the value of the asset by 
€1.2m, resulting in a net impairment of 
Guendalina in the period of €0.6m  
(2012: €nil).
The Group has recorded a gain of 
€2.8m from the disposal of the 75% 
interest in the Malta PSC (refer Note 
6(a) for further information).
The basic and diluted earnings  
per share on continuing operations 
were a loss of 1.41 cents per share 
(2012: earnings of 0.41 cents per 
share). No dividend is proposed  
to be paid for the year ended  
31 December 2013 (2012: €nil).
Cash Flow
Net Group cash outflow from 
operating activities was €1.2m  
(2012: €6.5m inflow), which reflects the 
significant decline in production at 
the Guendalina Field, relative to 2012.
The €8.9m proceeds for the disposal 
of the 75% interest in the Malta PSC  
to Genel were received in 2013. 
Following completion of the sale of 
non-core onshore assets to CIL in 
June, a payment of €1.25m was 
made and is reported as part of the 
cash flows from discontinued 
operations.
The Group’s total capital expenditure 
on assets of €2.5m (2012: €1.7m)  
was mainly related to development  
of the Aglavizza field, geological  
and geophysical studies and other 
activities for Ombrina Mare, and the 
acquisition of a 40% working interest 
in offshore Malta Area 3.
Statement of Financial Position
Cash and cash equivalents at 
year-end were €12.4m (2012: €8.7m). 
Among non-current assets, key 
movements from 2012 included a 
reduction in property, plant and 
equipment to €16.7m (2012: €20.4m). 
This decline resulted from the 
depreciation and impairment charge 
associated with the Guendalina Field. 
Exploration assets increased to 
€24.1m (2012: €19.8m), reflecting 
investments and the inclusion of the 
carrying amount of the 25% interest  
in the Malta PSC. Financial liabilities  
at year end were €nil (2012: €nil).  
At the end of 2013, net assets stood  
at €50.5m (2012: €53.1m), and 
non-current assets were €43.3m  
(2012: €44.1m).
Key Performance Indicators
The Group’s key financial 
performance indicators are revenue 
and the consolidated results. Its key 
non-financial performance indicators 
are the level of production and 
reserve and resources replacement 
(discussed in the Chief Executive’s 
Report – Oil & Gas Reserves and 
Resources on page 11) and the 
health, safety and environmental 
performance (discussed in the Chief 
Executive’s Report – Health, Safety 
and the Environment, on page 15). Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 18
Financial review continued
Hedging
During 2013, the Group did not have 
any oil and gas price derivatives in 
place (2012: no oil and gas price 
derivatives in place).
Cautionary Statement
This financial report contains certain 
forward-looking statements that are 
subject to the usual risk factors and 
uncertainties associated with the oil 
and gas exploration and production 
business. While the Directors believe 
the expectation reflected herein to be 
reasonable in light of the information 
available up to the time of their 
approval of this report, the actual 
outcome may be materially different 
owing to factors either beyond the 
Group’s control or otherwise within the 
Group’s control but, for example, 
owing to a change of plan or strategy. 
Accordingly, no reliance may be 
placed on the forward-looking 
statements.
Chris Kelsall
Finance Director
24 February 2014
The share price movement during the 
twelve month period to 31 December 
2013 ranged from an intra-day high of 
13.00p, to an intra-day low of 4.77p. 
The share price at close on  
31 December 2013 was 5.50p.
Events after the Reporting Period
On 9 January 2014, the Company 
entered an agreement with the 
Government of Malta for a six month 
extension to the Malta PSC covering 
offshore Malta Area 4. This extension will 
enable the contractors to the Malta 
PSC to have sufficient time to complete 
the exploration drilling activities that are 
forecast to start in Q1 2014. With this 
extension, the expiry of the first 
exploration period to the Malta PSC is 
now 17 July 2014. The Maltese 
Government also gave its consent for 
Phoenicia Energy Company Ltd 
(‘PECL’), which wholly owned the rights 
to the Malta PSC, to assign 25% of its 
interest in the Malta PSC to Melita 
Exploration Company Ltd (‘MECL’),  
a wholly owned subsidiary of MOG. 
Concurrently with this assignment, 
MOG transferred its remaining 25% 
interest in PECL to Genel Energy 
Holdings Ltd. Consequently, PECL is now 
a wholly owned subsidiary of Genel 
Energy Holdings Ltd. MECL and PECL 
have entered into a Joint Operating 
Agreement, in which PECL has been 
appointed Operator on behalf of the 
joint venture parties. Following these 
transfers, PECL will hold a 75% working 
interest in Area 4 and MECL a 25% 
working interest in Area 4 and are jointly 
the contractors to the Malta PSC.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Exploration
There is no assurance that our 
exploration activities will identify a 
commercial discovery among the 
existing portfolio. The Group mitigates 
exploration risk through the experience 
and expertise of our specialists, the 
application of appropriate technology, 
and the selection of prospective 
exploration assets. The Group’s 
objective is to acquire additional 
exploration assets, which will diversify 
exploration risk. Furthermore, we seek 
to employ individuals and contractors 
with strong technical skills and 
experience in the areas in which the 
Group operates. Where appropriate, 
we work with joint venture partners who 
have demonstrable technical skills and 
experience in similar projects. Further 
information on exploration assets is set 
out in Note 5 to the Financial 
Statements.
Operations
The nature of oil and gas operations 
means that the Group is exposed to 
the risk of equipment failure, well 
blowouts, fire, pollution and bad 
weather. In order to mitigate these 
risks, we implement recognised 
industry operating and safety 
standards, maintain sufficient levels of 
industry-specific insurance cover and 
work only with joint venture partners, 
operators and contractors who can 
demonstrate similar high standards of 
safety, operating and financial 
capability.
Health, Safety and Environment (‘HSE’)
The Group conducts operations in 
countries in Europe and the 
Mediterranean region. There is a risk of 
incidents in our operations that have 
the potential to impact the health  
and safety of staff, contractors, and 
communities, and/or the environment. 
Such incidents may have a negative 
impact on the Group’s reputation.  
This risk is mitigated through  
the implementation of our HSE 
management system, training of  
staff and selection of contractors.
The Group is subject to various risks 
and uncertainties, including those 
which derive from its oil and gas 
exploration, development and 
production activities. These risks and 
uncertainties may have a material 
impact on our performance and could 
cause future results to differ materially 
from expected and historical results.
The Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties are set out below, 
together with a summary as to how 
they are mitigated. The relative 
importance of the risks faced by the 
Group is likely to change over time as 
we implement our growth strategy and 
as a consequence of external political, 
regulatory and macroeconomic 
developments. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 21
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
We are extremely conscious of the 
environmental risks that are inherent in 
the oil and gas industry. We ensure 
that all relevant environmental impact 
studies are undertaken in advance of 
any proposed seismic or other 
operations it undertakes and best-in-
class industry environmental standards 
and practices are adopted in all of our 
operations. While the Group can never 
fully mitigate the cost, delays and other 
implications of future changes in 
environmental legislation and 
regulation, we establish strong working 
relationships with the local authorities 
in the countries in which we operate,  
to be best able to work through any 
potential significant changes that 
could arise in the future.
Funding and Financing
The nature of the Group’s business 
means that there are significant costs 
associated with seismic, drilling, and 
development campaigns. We manage 
this risk by a number of means. We 
closely monitor the Group’s cash 
position and each month produce 
updated cash flow forecasts to help 
determine appropriate strategies to 
fund short and medium-term 
operations. We also ensure that the 
Group always has adequate levels of 
cash on deposit, with varying terms of 
maturity, to match the items of 
expenditure as they become due. 
Further information on pricing, liquidity 
and credit risk is set out in Note 18 to 
the Financial Statements.
Currencies
The functional currency of the Group 
and its subsidiaries is the Euro and a 
significant proportion of its current 
portfolio of assets and near-term 
forecast revenue and expenditure is 
also in Euro. Certain expenditures are 
required to be funded in Pounds 
Sterling and US Dollars and we monitor 
the forecast expenditure profile and 
maintain sufficient levels of cash 
resources in Pounds Sterling and  
US Dollars to pay these expenses. 
Although in the period ended  
31 December 2013, we accrued a 
foreign exchange loss of €674,000 in 
the Euro value of our cash balances, 
we do not believe, at this moment, that 
the Group is particularly exposed to 
large currency fluctuations. We hold  
a significant proportion of our cash 
reserves with banks which have a 
minimum credit rating of A. Further 
information on currency risk is set out 
in Note 18 to the financial statements.
Regulation
Regulations may change with a 
consequential adverse effect on the 
Group’s exploration and production 
assets. Regulatory risk is mitigated by 
monitoring the regulatory and political 
environment within the countries in 
which we hold assets, engaging in 
constructive dialogue where and 
when appropriate, and introducing 
third-party expertise if this may assist in 
resolution of issues affecting our assets. 
Our objective is to acquire additional 
assets both for the exploration and 
production portfolio, which may assist 
in diversifying country-specific 
regulatory risk.
Risk Management
The Directors regularly monitor the 
principal and other related risks, using 
information obtained or developed 
from external and internal sources, 
and will take action as appropriate  
to mitigate the Group’s exposure.  
The main elements of the risk 
management system include regular 
Board review of the business, a 
defined process for preparation and 
approval of the annual work 
programme and budget, ethical and 
Anti-Bribery procedures, and HSE 
management systems.
We review the Group’s business risks 
and management systems on a 
regular basis and, through this 
process, the Directors have identified 
the principal risks. We manage some 
risks by maintaining a portfolio of 
projects and ensuring the Group is in 
compliance with the terms of all its 
agreements, through the application 
of appropriate policies and 
procedures and via the recruitment 
and retention of a team of skilled and 
experienced professionals.
The nature of our operations and 
holding structures means that the 
Group may be exposed to potential 
litigation. We are very conscious of 
our legal and regulatory 
responsibilities in all jurisdictions in 
which we operate and seek to ensure 
that at all times we act in accordance 
with local legislation and regulation. 
The Board will take appropriate legal 
advice from reputable legal firms 
when the need arises in order to 
mitigate such risks and, where 
appropriate to do so, will rigorously 
contest claims made against  
the Group. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 22
Corporate responsibility
Building  
a responsible 
business
Code of Ethics/Anti-Bribery
With the corporate Code of Ethics  
and Anti-Bribery Policy, we adopt the 
principles of legitimacy, fairness, 
transparency and verifiability on which 
our conduct, as well as that of our 
subsidiaries, must rest. By making such 
a commitment, we aim to be publicly 
regarded as a responsible and reliable 
enterprise, values which – in our view 
– are key elements to our success and 
to the promotion of our image.
The provisions set out in our Code of 
Ethics and Anti-Bribery Policy apply, 
without exception, to anyone involved 
in the activities carried out by the 
Company and therefore to our 
Directors, managers, employees, hired 
freelancers, suppliers as well as those 
who work for it directly or indirectly, on 
both a regular basis or temporarily.
Ethical Principles
Our activities must be carried out in full 
compliance with local laws and with 
the principles of impartiality, honesty, 
transparency and fairness towards 
employees, shareholders, partners, 
governments and local communities 
that the Company comes into contact 
with when carrying out its activities.
Our Key Principles
Compliance with Laws, Rules and 
Procedures
We are committed to complying with 
the laws and regulations in force in 
countries in which we operate, 
upholding the Code of Ethics, following 
the Group Anti-Bribery Policy and the 
corporate procedures and observing 
the articles of association.
In no case may the pursuit of 
corporate interests justify the breach  
of our principles and procedures and 
Company’s representatives are 
expected to maintain compliance  
with the letter and spirit of all laws 
governing the jurisdictions in which 
they perform their duties day by day,  
in particular on:
1. Human Rights Laws
2. Privacy Laws
3. Health and Safety Laws
4. Environmental Laws
5. Securities Laws
6. Competition Laws

regulations.’ Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 23
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Conflict of Interest
We will endeavour to avoid any conflict 
of interest arising when undertaking 
any of our activities and in all the 
relationships we establish.
A conflict of interest exists both when: 
(a) either a corporate body or one of its 
members or a shareholder, or an 
employee, holds an interest which 
contrasts with the one pursued by the 
Company; and (b) when the 
representatives of commercial partners, 
external consultants, or private or public 
institutions have a personal interest 
which contrasts with the one they hold 
in relation to their office or function.
Confidentiality
We ensure that the information we hold 
is confidential and that no confidential 
data will be collected, disseminated or 
used unless an explicit authorisation by 
the information owner is granted and 
the Regulations in force are fully 
complied with.
Top managers, commercial partners 
and consultants must use maximum 
discretion, even when not within 
business hours, in order to protect the 
know-how of our Company.
Relationship with Shareholders
MOG promotes equal information and 
protects its interests and the interests of 
its shareholders from any attempt by 
other shareholders or coalitions of 
shareholders to further their personal 
interests before others.
In addition, we undertake best efforts 
so that our economic and financial 
performance preserves and increases 
the Company’s value, and our 
shareholders’ investments achieve 
appropriate returns.
The Value of Human Resources
Employees, advisers and consultants 
are key to achieving corporate success. 
For this reason, the Company protects 
and promotes the value of its human 
resources in order to improve and 
increase experience and knowledge.
We also guarantee that the Company 
will provide the proper working 
conditions where human dignity and 
personal beliefs and opinions are fully 
respected in a safe and secure 
working environment.
Fairness in Employee Relations
Employee relations must be guided by 
fairness, collaboration, loyalty and 
mutual respect at all levels. Authority 
must be exercised with fairness, respect 
and moderation, avoiding any abuse.
In particular, any action which is  
likely to impact on the dignity or 
independence of employees, advisers 
or contractors must be avoided. 
Moreover, any choice regarding work 
planning must always safeguard the 
value of individual contributions.
Non-discrimination
In taking its decisions affecting external 
and internal parties, MOG avoids any 
discrimination based on age, sex, sexual 
orientation, health, race, nationality, 
political opinions, religion or any other 
criteria interfering with the fundamental 
rights and freedoms of individuals.
Quality of Services
We aim to satisfy and protect our 
contractual counterparts, while 
holding in high regard any request 
which is likely to improve the quality of 
the services and products supplied.
Environmental Protection
The environment is our main asset  
and we must protect it.
Consistent with this principle, the 
planning of MOG’s activities looks 
forward to striking the right balance 
between the commercial activities of 
the Company and the protection of 
the environment in which we work.
Renouncing Bribery and Corruption
We have implemented an Anti-Bribery 
Policy and we are committed to reporting 
any corruption that we encounter during 
our dealings with others.
Protecting People and the Environment
The Company has a firm policy of 
adhering to strict industry standards 
relating to the protection of people and 
the environment. We have implemented 
Health, Safety and Environment (‘HSE’) 
management systems and policies that 
govern our expectations.
Industry practices to operate safely 
and to protect the environment have 
evolved significantly in the past few 
decades. Improvements in technology 
enable us to conduct many aspects of 
our operations far more efficiently than 
just a decade ago. This efficiency 
translates to smaller ‘footprints’ (the 
amount of surface area disturbed), 
less waste generated, cleaner and 
safer operations, and greater 
compatibility with the environment.
Oil and gas companies have developed 
and implemented sophisticated 
management systems that spell out the 
procedures that are required by 
employees and contractors to operate 
safely and to protect the environment. 
These management systems have been 
extended to include social responsibility 
and ethical considerations. The 
Company pursues a policy of sustainable 
development to balance economic, 
environmental, and social challenges.
The industry has shown repeatedly that 
energy production and environmental 
protection are not mutually exclusive. 
The industry can produce the oil and 
gas needed to give consumers the 
freedom and mobility they demand, 
the warmth and light needed to 
survive, and still preserve the natural 
beauty of the environment. We are 
committed to contributing to this goal 
throughout our operations.
We have had two incidents in our 
history, both of which have been 
injuries that required time off work. Our 
most recent injury was a slip, trip and 
fall incident in the first half of 2012.
Safe and Reliable Operations
Safe and reliable operations are key  
to protecting people and the 
environment as well as producing 
reliable energy for our customers.
We use our management structure, 
operational procedures and 
commitment to the training and 
development of our employees to 
ensure the highest standards of 
operations across our businesses.
Key areas of focus:
 > Meeting or exceeding customers’ 
expectations
 > Implementing and adhering to 
Standard Operating Procedures
 > Developing and disseminating our 
risk management plans

Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Corporate governance report
Companies on the AIM Market of the London Stock 
Exchange are not required to comply with the 2012 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and due to its 
size, the Company does not seek to comply in full with the 
Code. While the Company is not required to present a 
Corporate Governance Statement, as it is not subject to the 
Listing rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, it has 
disclosed here certain information in respect of 
Corporate Governance.
The Directors support high standards of corporate 
governance. The Company has identified areas of the 
Code it considers relevant to the current size and nature  
of its operations and these are set out below.
Board of Directors
The Company has appointed three Non-Executive Directors 
(including the Company’s Chairman) with relevant sector 
experience to complement the three Executive Directors 
and to provide an independent view to the Board. The 
composition of the Board ensures that no one individual or 
group dominates the decision-making process.
The Board is responsible to the shareholders for setting the 
direction of the Company through the establishment of 
strategic objectives and key policies. The Board meets on  
a regular basis and considers issues of strategic direction, 
approves major capital expenditure, appoints and monitors 
senior management and any other matters having a 
material effect on the Company.
The Board receives regular detailed financial and 
operational reports from senior management to enable it to 
carry out its duties. Each Director is entitled to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense provided 
that the prior approval of the Chairman is obtained. All 
Directors have unrestricted access to management and to 
such Company information as is needed to carry out their 
duties and responsibilities fully and effectively.
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the 
first opportunity following their appointment. In addition, 
Directors will retire by rotation and stand for re-election by 
shareholders at least once every three years in accordance 
with the Company’s articles of association. The composition 
of the Board is reviewed from time to time to ensure that it 
has an appropriate balance of experience and expertise.
Board Committees
The Board may establish committees to assist it in carrying 
out its responsibilities in an effective and efficient manner. 
The current Board committees are the Audit Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee. The Directors do not 
consider that, given the size of the Board, it is appropriate 
to have a Nominations Committee. The appropriateness  
of such a committee will, however, be regularly reviewed 
by the Directors.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three Non-Executive 
Directors, meets at least twice a year and considers the 
Company’s financial reporting (including accounting 
policies) and internal financial controls. Meetings are 
normally attended, by invitation, by the Finance Director 
and a representative of the Company’s auditors. The Audit 
Committee presently comprises Peter Jackson (Chairman), 
Keith Henry and Enrico Testa.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises three 
Non-Executive Directors and is responsible for establishing 
and developing the Company’s general policy on 
executive, senior management and employee 
remuneration and determining specific remuneration 
packages for Executive Directors. The Remuneration 
Committee presently comprises: Enrico Testa (Chairman), 
Keith Henry and Peter Jackson. The Remuneration 
Committee meets not less than once a year.
Internal Control
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. Any such 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. Internal controls and business 
risks were monitored in the course of 2013 through regular 
Board meetings.
Communication with Shareholders
The Board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders 
for the performance and activities of the Group. The Annual 
Report together with other information about the Group is 
available on the Group’s website at www.medoilgas.com. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 28
Directors’ report
For the year ended 31 December 2013
The Directors present their Annual Report together with  
the audited Financial Statements for the year ended 
31 December 2013.
Principal Activities and Risks
The principal activities of the Group are oil and gas 
exploration, development and production. The Group has 
its head office in London and has oil and gas interests in 
Italy, Malta and France.
The head office for operations is located in Rome, with a 
further regional base in Foggia, Italy. Subsidiary 
undertakings are set out in Note 12 to the Financial 
Statements.
Note 18 to the Financial Statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital 
and financial risk, details of its financial instruments and its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Results and Proposed Dividend
The Group loss for the year after tax from continuing 
operations was €6.1m (2012: €1.8m). This resulted in Group 
retained losses of €15.5m (2012: €12.9m) to be carried 
forward. The Directors do not recommend the payment  
of a dividend (2012: €nil).
Policy and Practice on the Payment of Creditors
While no formal code is adopted, the Group’s current policy 
concerning the payment of its creditors is to:
•	 settle the terms of payment with creditors when agreeing 
the terms of each transaction
•	 ensure that these creditors are made aware of the terms 
of payment by the inclusion of relevant terms in 
contracts, and
•	 pay in accordance with contractual and other legal 
obligations.
At the reporting date, the Company’s creditor payment 
days are 60 days (2012: 60 days).
Capital Structure
Details of the issued share capital, together with details of 
the movements in the Company’s issued share capital 
during the year are shown in Note 20 to the Financial 
Statements. The Company has one class of ordinary shares 
which carry no right to fixed income. Each share carries the 
right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. In 
addition, following the Group Recapitalisation in 2011, the 
Company has one class of deferred shares, which do not 
entitle the holder to receive any dividend or other 
distribution, or to vote at general meetings of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor 
on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the 
general provisions of the articles of association and 
prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on 
voting rights.
Details of share-based payments are set out in Note 22 to 
the Financial Statements.
No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital and all issued shares are 
fully paid.
Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position, are set out in the Chief Executive’s Report. The 
financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity 
position are described in the Finance Review. The main risks 
encountered by the Group are set out in Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties. The Directors consider that it is appropriate for 
the accounts to be prepared on a going concern basis.  
At 31 December 2013, the Group had net assets of €50.5m 
(2012: €53.1m) and net current assets of €13.0m (2012: €6.7m 
excluding Non-current Assets Held for Sale of €8.0m 
reported within the total of €14.7m).
Key in our assessment of going concern is the financial 
effect of the transaction with Genel Energy Plc (‘Genel’)  
on which more information is given below.
On 21 December 2012, Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc 
(‘MOG’) signed a share sale and purchase agreement  
(the ‘Share Sale Agreement’) with Genel which provided for 
the acquisition by Genel of a 75% interest in MOG’s wholly 
owned subsidiary, Phoenicia Energy Company Limited 
(‘PECL’). The Share Sale Agreement completed on 28 
February 2013, resulting in MOG receiving a US$10 million 
cash payment, 100% carry on the first exploration well, and 
a 100% carry on the second exploration well, up to US$30 
million gross expenditure, in relation to the PSC (the 
‘Transaction’). A decision on the timing to drill the second 
well will be made after the first well has reached total depth.
On 9 January 2014, following the issuance of Maltese 
Government consent, PECL which wholly owned the rights  
to the PSC, assigned a 25% working interest in the PSC to 
Melita Exploration Company Ltd (‘MECL’), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of MOG. Concurrently with this assignment,  
MOG transferred its remaining 25% interest in PECL to Genel 
Energy Holdings Ltd. Following these transfers, PECL holds 
75% working interest in the PSC and MECL a 25% working 
interest.
As previously reported, on 3 January 2013, Leni Gas & Oil 
Investments Limited (‘LGOI’) and Leni Gas & Oil plc 
(collectively, the ‘Claimants’) commenced legal 
proceedings in the Queen’s Bench Division of the 
Commercial Court of the High Court of Justice in England 
and Wales (the ‘High Court’), against Malta Oil Pty Limited 
(‘MOL’) and Phoenicia Energy Company Limited (‘PECL’) 
(together, the ‘Defendants’). MOL is a subsidiary of the 
Company. The Company held a 25% interest in PECL, as at 
period end. The proceedings relate to the purchase by PECL 
of LGOI’s 10% interest previously held in the Malta Offshore 
Area 4 PSC (the ‘PSC’). The Claimants seek: rescission of the 
sale agreement dated 31 July 2012 under which LGOI sold 
its 10% interest in the PSC to PECL, further or alternatively, 
damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, and interest on 
any sums which are found to be due. The Defendants and  Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 29
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
the Company’s Board of Directors continue to refute the 
various claims which have been made by the Claimants. 
The Group will defend itself and the interests of its 
shareholders rigorously. The outcome of this claim and the 
potential financial impact cannot be determined at this 
stage and therefore no provision has been made in the 
financial statements. The High Court hearing is scheduled  
to commence on 3 March 2013 (Refer to Note 27 for  
further information).
In drawing its conclusion of the going concern assessment 
performed, management has prepared cash flow 
projections reflecting the effect of completion of the 
Transaction on its future funding needs, together with the 
known effect of the cashflow requirements of other Group 
operations and development plans along with the Directors’ 
expectations, based on professional advice, relating to the 
contingencies facing the Group. The detailed assessment 
performed by the Directors indicates that the Group can 
continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due and meet its 
minimum spend commitments on its licenses for a period of 
not less than 12 months from the date of the financial 
statements.

Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic 
Report, the Directors’ Report and the Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial 
Statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare the Group and Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. The Directors are also required to 
prepare Financial Statements in accordance with the rules 
of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading 
securities on AIM. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 30
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgments and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
•	 prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Political Contributions
During the year the Group made no political contributions 
(2012: €nil).
Statement of Disclosure to Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of 
approval of this Annual Report confirms that:
•	 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s Auditors are not 
informed; and
•	 the Director has taken all steps required to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s Auditors are informed of that 
information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Website Publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements are made available on the 
Company’s website. Financial Statements are published on 
the website in accordance with legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements, which may vary from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The 
Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity 
of the Financial Statements contained therein.
Auditors
BDO LLP have expressed their willingness to continue as 
Auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be 
proposed at the AGM.

Remuneration report
For the year ended 31 December 2013
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) is 
comprised of Enrico Testa (Chairman), Keith Henry and 
Peter Jackson. The Committee is responsible for determining 
and making recommendations to the Board on the 
structure and overall remuneration package for Executive 
Directors and reviews the remuneration for the Company’s 
senior employees. It is responsible for determining individual 
remuneration packages including, where appropriate, 
bonuses, incentive payments and share options.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by  
the Board on the basis of a proposal prepared by the 
Remuneration Committee. No Director may participate in  
any Board discussion or any decision regarding his own 
remuneration. The Committee also administers the Company’s 
share option and share award schemes. The Committee 
keeps itself fully informed of all relevant developments and 
best market practice in the field of remuneration.
The Committee is permitted to appoint independent 
advisers to assist in the determination of the remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee, in forming its policy on remuneration, has 
given due consideration to the needs of the Company, the 
shareholders and the provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’). The ongoing policy of the 
Committee is that the overall remuneration package should 
be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate 
high quality employees capable of achieving the Group’s 
objectives and to incentivise them effectively, so as to 
deliver long-term shareholder value.
It is the aim of the Committee to reward key employees  
on a basis which is linked, to a significant extent, to the 
performance of the individual and of the Company. Also, 
the remuneration is subject to the broader principle that 
their remuneration should be competitive with that received 
by professionals of comparable companies.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package:
•	 Base salary;
•	 Employee benefits; 
•	 Performance-related cash bonus;
•	 Performance-related share award; and
•	 Long-term share options.
Base Salary
The policy is to pay a fair and reasonable base salary, taking 
into account comparative salaries for similar roles in similar 
companies. The base salary is reviewed annually by the 
Committee having regard to the performance of the Company, 
individual performance, market data, levels of increases 
applicable to other employees of the Company and economic 
conditions. The most recent salary review for Executive Directors 
and staff was implemented in January 2013.
Employee Benefits
Sergio Morandi receives a car and fuel allowance. In 2013, 
pension payments representing 10% of gross base salary 
were made to William Higgs and Chris Kelsall. Further details 
of Directors’ remuneration paid in the year under review are 
set out in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.
The Company provides the Company’s Directors and 
officers with third party indemnity insurance.
Bonus Arrangements
Performance-related cash bonuses may be awarded to the 
Company’s employees and Executive Directors by the 
Board, upon recommendation by the Committee. No cash 
bonuses were awarded to the Executive Directors or staff in 
2012. In January 2013, the Remuneration Committee 
recommended and the Board approved the award of the 
following cash bonuses to the Executive Directors: William 
Higgs £100,000, Sergio Morandi €90,000 and Chris Kelsall 
£71,250. Cash bonuses were paid to the Executive Directors 
and eligible staff in February 2013. No cash bonuses were 
awarded to the Executive Directors or eligible staff in relation 
to the 12 months ended December 2013. Further details of 
Directors’ remuneration paid in the year under review are 
set out in Note 10 to the Financial Statements. 
In 2013, the Board upon recommendation of the 
Remuneration Committee, adopted a procedure whereby 
the value of the potential bonus pool awarded to 
employees for the year ended 2012 was set having regard 
to the Company’s performance relative to the listed AIM E&P 
peer group in the 12 months ended 31 December 2012. The 
allocation to eligible staff was in turn dependent on their 
individual 2013 performance ranked against a peer group 
of Company employees. All awards to employees were split 
in the ratio 30% cash and 70% shares under the Employee 
Share Plan, so as to provide a sustained incentive to provide 
enhanced individual performance over a three-year vesting 
period (refer Employee Share Plan section below, for further 
details). The Board intends to continue this procedure in 
those years in which the Company’s corporate 
performance justifies the award of a bonus to employees.
Employee Share Plan
On 20 March 2013, the Board approved the implementation 
of a new long-term employee share incentive plan (the 
‘Share Plan’), designed to provide incentives to employees 
to act in the long-term best interests of the Group and its 
shareholders. Performance-related share awards may be 
granted under the Share Plan to the Company’s employees 
and Executive Directors by the Board, upon 
recommendation by the Remuneration Committee.
On 26 April 2013 (‘Award Date’), 2,532,778 shares were 
awarded to eligible employees under the Share Plan. No 
shares were awarded to Executive Directors. Each individual 
award vests in respect of:
•	 one-third of the shares awarded (rounded down) on the 
first anniversary of the Award Date (26 April 2014);
•	 one-third of the shares awarded (rounded down) on the 
second anniversary of the Award Date (26 April 2015); and
•	 the remaining shares awarded on the third anniversary of 
the Award Date (26 April 2016).
Vesting in each case is subject to the terms of the Share Plan, 
including the requirement for each recipient to remain in 
employment with the Group until vesting (provided that 
vesting may occur if employment ceases in certain limited 
circumstances specified under the terms of the Share Plan). 
The terms of each Award include a ‘claw-back’ provision that 
means, in specified circumstances, a recipient of an Award 
can be required to transfer back the shares which have been 
received or repay a cash equivalent amount, or the number of 
shares subject to any other Award made under the Share Plan 
may be reduced by the amount of the required claw-back. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 32
Long-Term Share Option Scheme
On 11 March 2010, the Board approved the implementation of a new Global Share Option Plan (the ‘Plan’), and the award 
of options to eligible employees and Directors over ordinary shares of the Company. No options were granted under the 
Plan in 2011. Following a recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, on 19 January 2012, 13,500,000 options were 
granted under the Plan to the employees and Directors over ordinary shares of the Company. On 19 March 2012, upon 
commencement of employment with the Company, 6,000,000 options were granted under the Plan to William Higgs over 
ordinary shares of the Company. Details of the terms of the options awarded to Directors and employees under the Plan  
are set out in Note 22 to the Financial Statements. On 23 January 2013, 6,870,000 options were granted under the Plan  
to the Directors over ordinary shares of the Company relating to the corporate and personal performance during 2012.  
No options are to be granted to the Directors relating to corporate or personal performance for 2013.
The grants of options to Directors under the Plan in 2012 and 2013 were as follows:

their accounts under IFRS. The Company’s functional 
currency is the Euro and it has adopted the Euro as its 
presentational currency. The Group has adopted the Euro 
as its presentational currency.
Going concern
The Directors consider that it is appropriate for the accounts 
to be prepared on a going concern basis. At 31 December 
2013, the Group had net assets of €50.5m (2012: €53.1m) 
and net current assets of €13.0m (2012: €6.7m excluding 
Non-current Assets Held for Sale of €8.0m reported within 
the total of €14.7m).
Key in our assessment of going concern is the financial 
effect of the transaction with Genel Energy plc (‘Genel’)  
on which more information is given below.
On 21 December 2012, Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc 
(‘MOG’) signed a share sale and purchase agreement (the 
‘Share Sale Agreement’) with Genel Energy plc (‘Genel’) 
which provided for the acquisition by Genel of a 75% interest 
in MOG’s wholly owned subsidiary, Phoenicia Energy 
Company Limited (‘PECL’). The Share Sale Agreement 
completed on 28 February 2013, resulting in MOG receiving, 
among other things, a US$10 million cash payment, 100% 
carry on the first exploration well, and a 100% carry on the 
second exploration well, up to US$30 million gross 
expenditure, in relation to the PSC (the ‘Transaction’).  
A decision on the timing to drill the second well will be 
made after the first well has reached total depth.
On 9 January 2014, following the issuance of Maltese 
Government consent, PECL which wholly owned the rights to 
the PSC, assigned a 25% working interest in the PSC to Melita 
Exploration Company Ltd (‘MECL’), a wholly owned subsidiary 
of MOG. Concurrently with this assignment, MOG transferred 
its remaining 25% interest in PECL to Genel Energy Holdings 
Ltd. Following these transfers, PECL holds 75% working interest 
in the PSC and MECL a 25% working interest. 
As previously reported, on 3 January 2013, Leni Gas & Oil 
Investments Limited (‘LGOI’) and Leni Gas & Oil plc 
(collectively, the ‘Claimants’) commenced legal 
proceedings in the Queen’s Bench Division of the 
Commercial Court of the High Court of Justice in England 
and Wales (the ‘High Court’), against Malta Oil Pty Limited 
(‘MOL’) and Phoenicia Energy Company Limited (‘PECL’) 
(together, the ‘Defendants’). MOL is a subsidiary of the 
Company. The Company held a 25% interest in PECL, as at 
period end. The proceedings relate to the purchase by 
PECL of LGOI’s 10% interest previously held in the Malta 
Offshore Area 4 PSC (the ‘PSC’). The Claimants seek: 
rescission of the sale agreement dated 31 July 2012 under 
which LGOI sold its 10% interest in the PSC to PECL, further 
or alternatively, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, 
and interest on any sums which are found to be due. The 
Defendants and the Company’s Board of Directors 
continue to refute the various claims which have been 
made by the Claimants. The Group will defend itself and 
the interests of its shareholders rigorously. The outcome of 
this claim and the potential financial impact cannot be 
determined at this stage and therefore no provision has 
been made in the financial statements. The High Court 
hearing is scheduled to commence on 3 March 2013 
(Refer to Note 27 for further information).
In drawing its conclusions of the going concern assessment 
performed, management has prepared cash flow 
projections reflecting the effect of completion of the 
Transaction on its future funding needs, together with the 
known effect of the cashflow requirements of other Group 
operations and development plans along with the Directors’ 
expectations, based on professional advice, relating to the 
contingencies facing the Group. The detailed assessment 
performed by the Directors indicates that the Group can 
continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due and meet its 
minimum spend commitments on its licenses for a period  
of not less than 12 months from the date of the financial 
statements. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 42

Basis of accounting and adoption of new and revised standards
a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2013:
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the Group for the financial 
year beginning 1 January 2013. Except as noted, the implementation of these standards did not have a material effect on 
the Group:
Standard Impact on initial application Effective date
IAS 1 (Amendment) Presentation of items of other comprehensive income 1 July 2012
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 1 January 2013
IAS 19 (Amendment 2011) Employee benefits 1 January 2013
IFRS 7 (Amendment 2011) Disclosures – offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2013
IAS 16 (improvements) Classification of servicing equipment 1 January 2013
IAS 16 changes for classification of items such as spare parts, stand-by or servicing equipment as part of property, plant  
and equipment have been applied and part of the inventory transferred to property, plant and equipment (Notes 4 and 14). 
The effect of this is to increase noncurrent assets and reduce current assets by €2.123m at 31 December 2012 and 1 January 
2012. There is no impact on the income statement in 2013 or 2012.
b) Standards, amendments and interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted:
Standard Impact on initial application Effective date

The Group does not expect the pronouncements to have a material impact on the Group’s earnings or shareholders’ funds.
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another 
entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial 
statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) as if they formed a single entity. 
Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not 
presented its own income statement in these financial statements. The Group profit for the year includes a loss after tax of 
€6.1m (2012 profit €3.2m) in respect of the Company. This is dealt with in the financial statements of the Parent Company.
Business combinations
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the 
consolidated statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are 
initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the 
consolidated income statement from the date on which control is obtained.
Jointly controlled operations and jointly controlled assets
The Group includes the assets it controls, its share of any income and the liabilities and expenses of jointly controlled 
operations and jointly controlled assets in accordance with the terms of the underlying contractual arrangement.
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries
In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost, less any impairment. 
The cost of acquisition includes directly attributable professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with 
the acquisition. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 43
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived from sales of oil and gas to third party 
customers and fees received from third parties in return for 
services associated with the operation of oil and gas fields 
owned in conjunction with other parties. Sales of oil and 
gas production are recognised at the time of delivery  
of the product to the purchaser which is when the risks  
and rewards of ownership pass and are included in the 
statement of comprehensive income as Revenue.
Sales of oil and gas services are recognised based on the 
services provided and the timing of the provision of those 
services and are included in the statement of 
comprehensive income as Other income.
Interest revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference 
to the principal outstanding at the effective interest 
rate applicable.
Royalties, resource rent-tax and revenue-based taxes
Royalties or taxes based on production quantities or 
calculated as a percentage of revenue are included in  
cost of sales together with any resource rent-tax.
Tax
The major components of tax on profit or loss include 
current and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on the profit or loss adjusted for items 
that are non-assessable or disallowed and is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except 
when the tax relates to items credited or charged directly to 
equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the 
carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of 
financial position differs to its tax base.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those 
instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available, against which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the reporting date and are expected to apply when the 
deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).
Oil and gas assets: exploration and evaluation
The Group applies the full cost method of accounting for 
Exploration and Evaluation (‘E&E’) costs, having regard to 
the requirements of IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation  
of Mineral Resources’. Under the full cost method of 
accounting, costs of exploring for and evaluating oil and 
gas properties are accumulated and capitalised by 
reference to appropriate cash generating units (‘CGUs’). 
Such CGUs are based on geographic areas such as a 
concession and are not larger than a segment.
E&E costs are initially capitalised within ‘Intangible assets’. 
Such E&E costs may include costs of licence acquisition, 
third party technical services and studies, seismic 
acquisition, exploration drilling and testing, but do not 
include costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal 
rights to explore an area, which are expensed directly to the 
income statement as they are incurred.
Plant, Property and Equipment (‘PPE’) acquired for use in 
E&E activities are classified as property, plant and 
equipment. However, to the extent that such PPE is 
consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the 
amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part  
of the cost of the intangible E&E asset.
Intangible E&E assets related to exploration licences are not 
depreciated and are carried forward until the existence (or 
otherwise) of commercial reserves has been determined. The 
Group’s definition of commercial reserves for such purpose is 
proven and probable reserves on an entitlement basis.
If commercial reserves have been discovered, the related 
E&E assets are assessed for impairment on a CGU basis as 
set out below and any impairment loss is recognised in the 
income statement. The carrying value, after any impairment 
loss, of the relevant E&E assets is then reclassified as 
development and production assets within property, plant 
and equipment and are amortised on a unit of production 
basis over the life of the commercial reserves of the pool to 
which they relate. Intangible E&E assets that relate to E&E 
activities that are not yet determined to have resulted in the 
discovery of commercial reserves remain capitalised as 
intangible E&E assets at cost, subject to meeting impairment 
tests as set out below.
E&E assets are assessed for impairment when facts and 
circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may 
exceed its recoverable amount. Such indicators include the 
point at which a determination is made as to whether or not 
commercial reserves exist. Where the E&E assets concerned 
fall within the scope of an established CGU, the E&E assets 
are tested for impairment together with all development 
and production assets associated with that CGU, as a 
single cash generating unit. The aggregate carrying value 
is compared against the expected recoverable amount of 
the pool. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in 
use and the fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is 
assessed generally by reference to the present value of the 
future net cash flows expected to be derived from 
production of commercial reserves. Where the E&E assets to 
be tested fall outside the scope of any established CGU, 
there will generally be no commercial reserves and the E&E 
assets concerned will generally be written off in full. Any 
impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Oil and gas assets: development and production
Development and production assets are accumulated on a 
field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the 
commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into 
production, together with the decommissioning asset (see 
below) and the E&E expenditures incurred in finding 
commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets 
as outlined above. They are presented as oil and gas 
properties in Note 4. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 44
Notes forming part of the financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2013
1 Accounting policies and significant accounting 
judgments, estimates and assumptions continued
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated 
on a field-by-field basis using the units of production (UOP) 
method by reference to the ratio of production in the period 
to the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into 
account estimated future development expenditures 
necessary to bring those reserves into production.
An impairment test is performed whenever events and 
circumstances arising during the development or 
production phase indicate that the carrying value of a 
development or production asset may exceed its 
recoverable amount. The aggregate carrying value is 
compared against the expected recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Value in 
use is assessed generally by reference to the present value 
of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from 
production of commercial reserves. The cash generating 
unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the 
field, except that a number of field interests may be 
grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash 
flows of each field are interdependent.
Decommissioning
Where a material liability for the removal of production 
facilities and site restoration at the end of the productive life 
of a field exists, a provision for decommissioning is 
recognised from the outset. The amount recognised is the 
present value of estimated future expenditure determined  
in accordance with local conditions and requirements. 
Included within the relevant asset is an amount equivalent 
to the provision which is depreciated on a unit of 
production basis. Changes in estimates are recognised 
prospectively, with corresponding adjustments to the 
provision and the associated asset.
Over time, the discounted provision for decommissioning is 
increased for the change in present value based on the 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments. The 
periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income as a finance cost.
The Company does not include the result of any timing 
differences resulting from the decommissioning asset or the 
decommissioning provision in determining deferred taxation.
Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets
Property, plant and equipment includes Inventory such as 
spare parts, stand-by or servicing equipment that meet the 
criteria for recognition as property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less estimated 
residual values, initially recognised and carried, of all 
property, on a reducing balance basis over their expected 
useful lives. Depreciation is calculated at the following rates:
Plant and equipment – range 10% – 12% per annum
Assets held for sale
Where the Company has commenced the sale of a 
business, any non-current assets and liabilities related 
thereto are classified separately as held for sale in the 
statement of financial position. This condition is only met 
when the sale is highly probable, assets are available for 
immediate sale in current condition, the liabilities will be 
transferred and the management is committed to the sale 
which should be completed within one year of the 
classification. Property, plant and equipment once 
classified as held for sale are not subject to depreciation or 
amortisation. The net assets and liabilities of a disposal 
group classified as held for sale are measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. In 
accordance with IFRS 5, the Group also assess whether the 
Assets held for sale constitute discontinued operations. 
Where the Assets held for sale are classified as discontinued 
operations, the results of such are recorded as a single 
amount in the income statement. Comparative information 
relating to the discounted operations is also reanalysed into 
the single amount in the comparative income statement 
and related notes.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised at initial recognition at fair 
value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at 
fair value through profit and loss, transaction costs that are 
attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. The 
Group’s financial assets consist of available for sale 
investments, and loans and receivables. There are no 
financial assets classified as held to maturity or at fair value 
through profit or loss.
All financials assets, other than the available for sale 
investments and cash and cash equivalents are initially 
measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Available-for-sale investments comprise the Group’s 
strategic investments in entities not qualifying as 
subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities. 
Unquoted available for sale investments whose fair value 
cannot be reliably valued are carried at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand or held 
on current account or on short-term deposits (up to 
90 days) at variable interest rates. Any interest earned is 
accrued monthly and classified as finance income.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net 
of directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s 
financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans 
and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative 
financial liabilities.
All financial liabilities are initially stated at their fair value 
and subsequently at amortised cost. Interest and other 
borrowing costs are recognised on a time-proportion basis 
using the effective interest method and expensed as part of 
financing costs in the statement of comprehensive income. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 45
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by group entities in a currency other 
than the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which they operate (the ‘functional currency’) are recorded 
at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign 
currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the 
rates ruling at the reporting date.
Share capital is denominated in Sterling and translated at 
historic rate.
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
(the functional currency). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in Euro, which is also the functional 
currency of the Company and its significant subsidiaries.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the 
relevant functional currency using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year end exchange 
rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income in other income and expenses.
Other provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial 
position when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that 
an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle  
the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows 
at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair 
value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest.
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than 
employees, the income statement is charged with the fair 
value of goods and services received.
Options granted by the parent company to employees of 
subsidiaries are measured as equity-settled share-based 
payments, and expensed in the Company receiving 
employee services.
Inventories
Inventories are initially recognised at cost, and subsequently 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion 
and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Oil and gas production 
flows directly into the national grid therefore there are no oil 
and gas inventories held.
Leased assets
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to the 
Group (a ‘finance lease’), the asset is treated as if it had 
been purchased outright. The amount initially recognised 
as an asset is the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, 
the present value of the minimum lease payments payable 
over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease 
commitment is shown as a liability. Lease payments are 
analysed between capital and interest. The interest element 
is charged to the income statement over the period of the 
lease and is calculated so that it represents a constant 
proportion of the lease liability. The capital element reduces 
the balance owed to the lessor.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership are retained by the lessor (an ‘operating lease’), 
the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term. The land and buildings elements of property leases 
are considered separately for the purposes of 
lease classification.
(b) Significant accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
which are described in Note 1, management has made the 
following judgements that have the most significant effect on 
the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart 
from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below).
(a) Joint arrangements
Judgement is required to determine when the Group has joint 
control over an arrangement, which requires an assessment 
the relevant activities and when the decisions in relation to 
those activities require unanimous consent. Judgement is 
also required to classify a joint arrangement requiring the 
Group to assess the respective rights of the parties to the 
arrangement. These assessments require significant 
judgement, and a different conclusion may materially impact 
the accounting.
(b) Contingencies
The assessment of the existence, and potential quantum, of 
contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant 
judgement and the use of estimates regarding the 
outcome of future events. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 46
Notes forming part of the financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2013
1 Accounting policies and significant accounting 
judgments, estimates and assumptions continued
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are discussed below.
(a) Exploration and evaluation expenditures
The Group’s policy for E&E expenditure requires an 
assessment of both the future likely economic benefits from 
future exploitation or sale and whether the activities are at a 
stage that permit a reasonable assessment of the existence 
of reserves. Any such assessment may change as new 
information becomes available. If after capitalisation, 
information becomes available suggesting that the 
recovery of the carrying amount is unlikely, the relevant 
capitalised amount is written off in the statement of 
comprehensive income in the period when the new 
information becomes available.
(b) Impairment reviews
Whilst conducting an impairment review of its assets, the 
Group exercises judgement in making assumptions about 
future gas prices, reserves, rehabilitation costs, future 
development and production costs. Changes in estimate 
can result in significant changes to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. The policy in respect 
of impairment reviews is set out above and details of reviews 
carried out during the year are set out in Notes 4 and 5.
(c) Decommissioning
Provision was made in the accounts for future 
decommissioning costs to plug and abandon wells. The cost 
of provision should be added to the value of the development 
and production asset and depreciated on the unit of 
production basis. The decommissioning liability is stated in 
the accounts at discounted present value and accreted up 
to the final liability by way of an annual finance charge.
The Group has potential decommissioning obligations in 
respect of its producing interests in Italy. The extent to which 
a provision is required in respect of these potential 
obligations depends, inter alia, on the legal requirements at 
the time of decommissioning, the cost and timing of any 
necessary decommissioning works, and the discount rate to 
be applied to such costs. The decommissioning provision 
and how the cost is calculated are described in more detail 
in Note 19.
(d) Reserves
Development and production assets (oil and gas 
properties) within Property, Plant and Equipment are 
depreciated on a concession basis using the unit of 
production method at a rate calculated by reference to 
proven plus probable reserves. These reserves have been 
determined using technical estimates of oil and gas in 
place and recovery factors. Future development costs are 
estimated using assumptions as to the number of wells 
required to produce the commercial reserves, the cost of 
such wells and associated production facilities, and other 
capital costs. The carrying amount of development and 
production assets at 31 December 2013 is shown in Note 4.
(e) Units of production (UOP) depreciation of oil and 
gas assets
Oil and gas assets are depreciated using the UOP method 
over total proved developed and undeveloped 
hydrocarbon reserves. This results in a depreciation/
amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the 
anticipated remaining production from the field. The life of 
each item, which is assessed at least annually, has regard 
to both its physical life limitations and present assessments 
of economically recoverable reserves of the field at which 
the asset is located. These calculations require the use of 
estimates and assumptions, including the amount of 
recoverable reserves and estimates of future capital 
expenditure. The calculation of the UOP rate of 
depreciation/amortisation could be impacted to the extent 
that actual production in the future is different from current 
forecast production based on total proved reserves, or 
future capital expenditure estimates change.
(f) Deferred tax
Judgement is applied in making assumptions about future 
taxable income, including gas prices, production, 
rehabilitation costs and expenditure to determine the extent 
to which the Group recognises deferred tax assets, as well 
as the anticipated timing of the utilisation of the losses.
(g) Share-based payment
Refer to Note 22 for the keys assumptions used in 
determining the value of Share-based payments.
(h) Liabilities
Refer to Note 27 for the contingent liability related to the 
dispute with Leni Gas & Oil Investments Limited and Leni 
Gas & Oil plc. A provision has not been made as the 
financial impact cannot be determined. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 47

*1 Following the revision to IAS 16, the Group has reclassified inventory as PPE and adjusted the opening balance as at 1 January 2012 by €2.123m. There is no 
impact on the income statement in any period. 
*2 PPE increase in 2012 includes €2.176m for transfer of Aglavizza from intangibles due to grant of the production concession.
The assets affected by impairment losses are oil and gas properties. Management reviewed the carrying values of all 
properties classified as PPE to ascertain the recoverability of values in respect of concessions where facts and 
circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based on 
value in use. A discount rate of 10% post tax has been used in the value in use calculation which has been deemed 
appropriate given the risk profile of the Group. Refer Note 1(b) for the significant accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions underlying this assessment.
As a result of this exercise, an impairment loss of €0.6m was recognised on Guendalina during the year (2012: €nil). Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 49

The intangible assets include all those costs incurred for the exploration and economic evaluation of potentially productive 
fields. In the prior periods a gas storage asset held as intangible was written off to nil.
Management review the carrying values of exploration and evaluation assets, classified as intangible assets pending 
evaluation of commercially viable reserves, to ascertain the recoverability of values in respect of concessions where facts 
and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based 
on value in use. A discount rate of 10% post tax has been used in the value in use calculation which is deemed appropriate 
given the risk profile of the Group. Refer Note 1(b) for the significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
underlying this assessment.

On 21 December 2012, the Group announced that it had signed the two key contracts with Genel Energy plc (‘Genel’) that 
enabled Genel’s acquisition of a 75% working interest in Offshore Malta Area 4 Production Sharing Contract (the ‘PSC’). 
These contracts were: (1) a Share Sale Agreement which resulted in Genel acquiring 75% of the issued share capital of the 
Group wholly owned subsidiary, Phoenicia Energy Company Limited (‘PECL’) on completion, and (2) a Shareholders’ 
Agreement, which governs the operation of PECL in relation to its execution of obligations under the PSC and the rights and 
obligations of the shareholders of PECL, being Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc and a subsidiary of Genel. Completion of the 
Share Sale Agreement occurred on 28 February 2013. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 50

Detail of our exploration activities in the period, developments and the legal and regulatory status of these assets is 
included in the Chief Executive’s report.
Under IFRS, non-current assets are classified separately as ‘Held for Sale’ in the statement of financial position when their 
carrying amount will be recovered through a sale rather than continuing use. This condition is only met when the sale is 
highly probable, assets are available for immediate sale in their current condition, and the management is committed to 
the sale which should be completed within one year of the classification. Liabilities directly associated with the assets 
classified as held for sale and expected to be included as part of the sale transactions are correspondingly also classified 
separately. Property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale are not subject to depreciation or amortisation. 
The net assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying 
amount and fair value less cost to sell.
At 31 December 2012, the total carrying amount related to the PSC was classified as ‘Held for sale’. The Group has in 
accounting for this transaction concluded that all of the carrying amount should not be de-recognised and therefore a 
gain on disposal of the 75% interest only has been recorded and the remaining carrying amount, €2,505m included in 
Intangible Assets. Further information is provided in Note 25.

On 6 September 2012, the Group had entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Canoel International Energy 
Limited (‘CIL’) to transfer to CIL and/or its nominated subsidiary, the Group’s entire working interest in 13 exploration and 
production gas assets onshore Italy (the ‘Sale and Purchase Agreement’) comprising: Masseria Grottavecchia, San 
Teodoro, Torrente Cigno, Misano Adriatico, Sant’Andrea, Masserai Petrilli, Masseria Acquasalsa, Lucera, San Mauro, 
Montalbano, Serra dei Gatti, Villa Carbone and Colle dei Nidi (the ‘Assets’). As part of this agreement the Group was 
required to pay €1.25m to CIL at completion as partial contribution towards future plug, abandonment and site 
remediation cost for these assets. In June 2013, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development issued preliminary 
authorisation to CIL and MOG to sign the notarised transfer of the interest to CIL. CIL and MOG received the final decree 
authorising the transfer from the Ministry of Economic Development on 28 June 2013, as published in the Official 
Hydrocarbon Gazette on 30 June 2013.
At 31 December 2012, the Assets are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as non-current assets 
‘held for sale’ in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and in the income statement as discontinued

7 Segmental reporting
In the opinion of the Directors, the operations of the Group companies comprise three operating segments conducting 
exploration, production, and corporate activities.
The Group operates in one geographic area, being Mediterranean Europe. The Group’s oil and gas revenues are 
generated entirely in Italy and result from sales to European based customers. 99% of Group revenue is generated from 
sales of gas and condensate to two customers (2012: 92% from four customers). The reportable segments have been 
identified on the basis that these operating segments form the main identifiable cost centres for the Group as reported to 
the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). The CODM is defined as the Board of Directors.
The top four customers contributed the following proportions to Group oil and gas revenues:
2013 2012
Customer 1 85% 60%
Customer 2 14% 15%
Customer 3 – 13%
Customer 4 – 4%
The primary financial statements presented reflect all the activities of these three operating segments. For the Group’s 
operating segments these are the key reportable items:

Deferred tax assets of €3.7m recognised in 2011 were in regard to tax losses brought forward, to be utilised against taxable 
profits arising in the foreseeable future from oil and gas production, most notably from the Guendalina asset which 
commenced production in the year ended 31 December 2011. The jurisdiction that these tax losses have arisen in and are 
expected to be used in is Italy.
The amount recognised in 2013 and in 2012 arises for Italy and relates to temporary timing differences. The Company also 
has available tax losses of €4.7m (2012 €3.8m) which can be utilised against future taxable profits which may arise on the 
profits/gains arising on transactions, from production or from other taxable income streams. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 55

The current tax receivable has arisen predominantly from VAT reimbursement which is receivable from the Italian 
government by the Italian subsidiary, Medoilgas Italia S.p.A. The non-current tax receivable relates to VAT recoverable in 
Italy of €0.466m (2012: €0.8m), which is not expected to be reimbursed in the next 12 month period.
The recoverability of the current and non-current VAT receivable balances is due to be via a net reduction in taxation 
settlements made with the Italian tax authorities on charges to be incurred in the future as a result of tax liabilities arising 
from production activities.
The net movement in amounts due from Group undertakings of €9.2m represents a €10.1m reduction on account of the 
Genel transaction and a €0.9m increase in funding to the Group’s subsidiaries.

Fair value of financial instruments
At 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, the fair value and book value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities 
were materially the same. All financial assets and liabilities indicated above with a * are shown in the statement of financial 
position at their amortised costs, which approximates to underlying fair value. Financial instruments listed above valued at 
fair value are assessed as tier 3. Tier 3 means inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
At 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, there were no financial instruments assessed as tier 2 and carried at fair 
value through profit or loss. A tier 2 classification means that inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Financial risk management
General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, 
whilst retaining responsibility for them it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the 
effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s finance function. The Board receives regular updates 
from accounting and financial management through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and 
the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets. The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to 
reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding 
these policies are set out below. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 58

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counter party to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales in relation to gas production. It is Group 
policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts in accordance with best 
local business practices, and seek external credit rating assessments where applicable and when available. Credit risk of 
existing customers is assessed when deemed necessary.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and 
financial institutions, only independently rated parties with an acceptable rating are utilised. It is the Group policy that it 
endeavours to maintain substantial bank deposits and bills with financial institutions with Standard & Poors ‘A’ rating or 
equivalent. The Group holds cash balances with its primary banks that have a Standard & Poors (‘S&P’) rating as noted: 
HSBC (S&P: A-1/A+), Banca Intesa SanPaolo SpA (S&P: BBB/A-2) and Deutsche Bank (S&P: BBB/A-1), to meet minimum 
working capital requirements for the Italian operations.
Interest rates received on deposit accounts held with HSBC, Banca Intesa SanPaolo and Deutsche Bank are between 0.01% 
and 0.20% (31 December 2012: 0.09% to 0.20%), based on bank interest rates.
The Group does not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk, although in certain isolated cases may take steps to 
mitigate such risks if it is sufficiently concentrated.

The Group has not historically suffered defaults from its customers for onshore gas production. The Group faces credit risk 
through onshore and offshore gas sales to Repower Italia and joint venture cash calls to ENI, Total, Edison, and Gas Plus 
Italiana arising from various joint venture projects where Medoilgas Italia S.p.A acts as operator. The Group’s main credit risk 
exposure through its subsidiary Medoilgas Italia S.p.A, is with Repower Italia which at present purchases the Group’s entire 
gas production. Price risk under this contract is mitigated by the provision of a bank guarantee in favour of the Group in 
respect of a material proportion of forecast gas purchases under the contract. Management believes the credit risk 
currently faced by the Group is low given the high credit worthiness of Repower Italia ENI, Total, Edison, Gas Plus Italiana.
The Group from time to time reviews whether a greater utilisation of credit ratings would be appropriate. Given that much of 
the Group’s trade receivables are under joint operating agreements, the security against joint venture assets provided by 
those agreements adequately mitigates any risk of default. At the reporting date, the Group does not envisage any losses 
from non-performance of existing counterparties.
Management considers that given the presently challenging macroeconomic position in the Eurozone and in Italy, credit 
risk remains elevated as at the reporting date, but that this risk has not had a material impact on earnings or shareholders’ 
equity. Management continues to monitor the financial and energy market conditions and will consider any steps required 
to mitigate associated risks to the Group.
The Group seeks to maintain deposit accounts for its cash balances, primarily with banks which hold a high credit rating. 
The applicable interest rate on cash balances is also considered. Current bank deposits are held primarily with HSBC Bank 
plc and Deutsche Bank AG, with funds necessary for adequate working capital availability to the Italian operations held on 
deposit with Banca Intesa SanPaolo.
Funds which are not expected to be required in the near term are placed on short-term (i.e. up to 90 days) deposit with 
fixed interest rates for the relevant term, which reduce the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk. At the same time, 
management reviews the Group’s forecast cashflows in order to ensure that the maximum level of interest is received for the 
available funds but without adversely affecting the working capital flexibility the Group requires. There is no material 
difference between the book value and fair value of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 59
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
A 1% interest rate movement does not have a material effect on the Group’s financial assets and liabilities therefore no 
sensitivity analysis is provided.
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group and Company are exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from deposits of cash and cash equivalents with banks. 
The cash and cash equivalents balances maintained by the Group are proactively managed in order to ensure that the 
maximum level of interest is received for the available funds but without affecting the working capital flexibility the Group 
requires.
There is no material difference between the book value and fair value of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has operations located in various parts of the world and because some of 
its major suppliers utilise contracts denominated in US dollars irrespective of the location where services are provided. 
Although its geographical spread reduces the Group’s operational risk, the Group’s net assets arising from such overseas 
operations are exposed to currency risk resulting in gains and losses on retranslation into Euro. Only in exceptional 
circumstances will the Group consider hedging its net investments in overseas operations as generally it does not consider 
that the reduction in foreign currency exposure warrants the cash flow risk created from such hedging techniques. It is the 
Group’s policy to ensure that individual Group entities enter into local transactions in their functional currency wherever 
possible or acquire the relevant contract currency ahead of the expenditure obligation. The Group considers this policy 
minimises any unnecessary foreign exchange exposure.
The Board continues to monitor the effectiveness of this policy on an ongoing basis through its approval of Group budgets 
and the review of the currency profile of cash balances.
The proportion of cash and cash equivalent balances held in Euro as at the year end was 39.4% (2012: 57.1%), USD 38.8% 
(2012: 26.6%), GBP 21.8% (2012: 16.3%).
The Group is exposed to changes in exchange rates. At 31 December 2013, the currency exposure of the Group was

18 Financial instruments – risk management continued
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments 
on its debt instruments.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. 
To achieve this aim, it seeks to maintain readily available cash balances (or agreed facilities) to meet expected 
requirements. See further information on Going Concern in Note 1.
Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced monthly. These are reviewed regularly by 
management and the Board to ensure that sufficient financial headroom exists.
The contractual undiscounted amounts of financial liabilities are repayable as follows:

In respect of the Company, included in Euro amounts receivable within one year are amounts due from group companies 
totalling €6.1m (2012: €15.4m).
Price risk
Gas sales revenue is subject to energy market price risk. The Group’s gas revenues are sourced from the sale of gas under 
term supply contracts.
Estimated production volumes for sales of onshore gas production are set out in the contracts. The applicable gas price for 
each month is set according to a formula which is linked to the oil price that applies a constant to the average price from 
fuel oil, gas oil and crude oil (Brent) prices over each of the nine months prior to the actual month of gas delivery. The oil 
prices which are applied in the formula are sourced from the Platts Oilgram Price Report (average of the highest and lowest 
for each oil type in each of the nine prior months) in US$ and convertible to Euro value by reference to the average monthly 
US$/€ exchange rate, which is in the actual month of gas supply, as published by the European Central Bank. Given the 
gas price formula for onshore gas sales is based on an oil price formula which takes an average measure of the prior 
nine-month period, any short-term material oil price fluctuations are likely to be mitigated. At present, the Group does not 
intend to hedge oil price risk in the short term.
MOG presently sells its net gas volumes from both onshore and offshore producing gas fields in which it holds a working 
interest, under one gas sale contract. This contract governs the offtake of gas volumes for one ‘thermal year’, which 
currently runs from 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014. The applicable gas sales price for each month under the 
contract is set having regard to: (a) an average of the European Market price of Gas Oil, BTZ, and Crude Oil (Brent) over 
each of the nine months prior to the actual month of gas delivery; and (b) the USD/Euro exchange rate average applying 
in the month of gas supply.
Defaults and breaches
There have been no defaults or breaches in respect of current and non-current liabilities recognised at the reporting date.
Capital disclosures
The Group seeks to maintain sufficient capital to fund its growth and safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern. 
The primary objective of the Group is to maximise shareholder value, which from a capital management perspective, is 
achieved by maintaining the capital structure that is most suited to the Group’s size, project and strategic priorities, as well 
as underlying business risk.
Currently, the Group does not pay dividends, focusing instead, on delivering capital growth by developing its exploration 
portfolio and its Italian development assets, to optimise future returns. As at 31 December 2013 and the date of this report, 
the capital employed by the Group to fund projects is comprised solely of equity attributable to shareholders. 
Management will continue to review the scope to apply other sources of capital and equity finance, such as potential farm 
outs, to support key projects. The details and movements in the Company’s share capital are set out in Note 20. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 61

The decommissioning provision is the discounted present value of the estimated cost of decommissioning the Group’s oil 
and gas production facilities in Italy. The discount factor used is 10%. The Group makes provision for the cost of 
decommissioning its producing wells at the completion of their useful lives. There are in excess of 30 wells for which 
provision has been made. Individual final decommissioning costs vary. Decommissioning of the wells is anticipated over a 
10-year period with additional provision to be made as new production wells are brought on stream. The time frame for 
decommissioning is based upon the projected production profile and remaining proved and probable reserves. The costs 
of decommissioning both onshore and offshore wells are certified by independent qualified engineers and specialists.
Other provisions include amounts due to employees for accrued holiday and for staff in Italy, leaving indemnity, that will 
become payable when they cease employment.

Share options
The Group’s policy is to utilise share awards and options as part of the management reward structure. Option terms are set 
by agreement with an incoming executive or based upon the recommendations of the remuneration committee to the 
Board of Directors. Refer to Note 22 for further details.
Deferred shares
On 10 May 2011, the Group raised £20m before expenses (approximately £19.1m net of cash transaction expenses) by the 
subscription for 333,333,333 new ordinary shares in the Company (the ‘Subscription’) at 6 pence each (‘Subscription 
Price’). In addition, the Company agreed terms with the Bank of Scotland Plc (‘BoS’), Stark Select Asset Master Limited 
(‘Stark Select’) as holder of the convertible bonds (‘Convertible Bonds’), and with holders of the convertible loan notes 
(‘CLNs’), as a result of which, all outstanding amounts due to the BoS under the BoS bank facility were settled and all 
outstanding Convertible Bonds and CLNs were converted into new ordinary shares (together, the ‘Conversion Shares’)  
of the Company at a price of 24 pence per new ordinary share (together, the ‘Group Recapitalisation’). As a result of the 
Group Recapitalisation, the Group does not have any outstanding financial debt.
The nominal value of the existing ordinary shares as at 31 December 2010, was 20 pence. The issue of new shares at the 
Subscription Price therefore required the adjustment of the nominal value of each of the Company’s ordinary shares to 
1 penny, rather than 20 pence. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 62
Notes forming part of the financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2013

Conversion of convertible bonds and convertible notes
The holder of all of the outstanding Convertible Bonds, Stark Select, agreed to convert the whole of the outstanding 
principal amount of its Convertible Bonds into 19,858,333 Conversion Shares at a price of 24 pence per Conversion Share.
With the approval of an extraordinary resolution of the holders of the CLNs, the Company agreed to amend the deed poll 
constituting the CLNs to give the Company the right to convert the outstanding CLNs at its election into 21,061,225 Conversion 
Shares, at a price of 24 pence per Conversion Share. The Company elected to convert all of the outstanding CLNs.
The original conversion prices of the CLNs and the Convertible Bonds were 40 pence and 50 pence respectively and the 
Company had no right to require conversion. The amendments to the terms and conversion prices of the CLNs and the 
Convertible Bonds were necessary to enable the Subscription and the Debt Cancellation to take place. The Conversion 
Shares were issued credited as fully paid, subject to the memorandum of association and Articles of the Company and 
rank pari passu in all respects with new ordinary shares then in issue, including the right to receive any future dividends and 
other distributions.
Share consolidation
The Subscription Price of 6 pence was below the nominal value of the ordinary shares of the Company, of 20 pence. As 
Company law prohibits the issue of shares at a price less than their nominal value, in order to effect the Subscription, a 
share consolidation was undertaken whereby each ordinary share of the Company was subdivided into one new ordinary 
share with nominal value of 1 penny and one deferred share with nominal value of 19 pence (the ‘Share Consolidation’).
The Share Consolidation resulted in 38,912,736 new ordinary shares and 38,912,736 deferred shares (the ‘Deferred Shares’) 
being in issue immediately following the Share Consolidation but before the completion of the Group Recapitalisation.
After the implementation of the Share Consolidation the nominal value of each new ordinary share was one twentieth of 
that of each existing ordinary share. Each new ordinary share has the same rights (including voting and dividend rights 
and rights on a return of capital) as each ordinary share existing prior to completion of the Group Recapitalisation.
The rights attaching to the Deferred Shares, which have not been admitted to trading on AIM, are minimal, thereby 
rendering them effectively valueless. The rights attaching to the Deferred Shares are summarised as follows:
•	 they do not entitle holders to receive any dividend or other distribution or to receive notice of, attend, speak at or vote at 
general meetings of the Company;
•	 on a return of assets on a winding up, they will only entitle the holder to the amounts paid up on such shares after the 
repayment of £10m per New Ordinary Share;
•	 they authorise the Company to appoint any person to execute on behalf of the holders of the Deferred Shares a transfer 
of such shares to the Company, or such person as the Company may nominate as custodian, without any payment 
therefore and without the sanction of the holders of the Deferred Shares; and
•	 the creation and issue of further shares which rank equally or in priority to the Deferred Shares or the passing of a 
resolution of the Company to cancel the Deferred Shares or to effect a reduction in capital shall not constitute a 
modification or abrogation of their rights.
There are no immediate plans to purchase or cancel the Deferred Shares, but the Company may seek to do so in the future.

Employee Share Plan
On 20 March 2013, the Board approved the implementation of a new long-term employee share incentive plan (the 
‘Employee Share Plan’), designed to provide incentives to employees to act in the long-term best interests of the Group and 
its shareholders. Performance related share awards may be granted under the Employee Share Plan to the Company’s 
employees and Executive Directors by the Board, upon recommendation by the Remuneration Committee.
On 26 April 2013 (‘Award Date’), 2,532,778 shares were awarded to eligible employees under the Share Plan. No shares were 
awarded to Executive Directors. Each individual award vests in respect of:
•	 one-third of the shares awarded (rounded down) on the first anniversary of the Award Date (26 April 2014);
•	 one-third of the shares awarded (rounded down) on the second anniversary of the Award Date (26 April 2015); and
•	 the remaining shares awarded on the third anniversary of the Award Date (26 April 2016).
Vesting in each case is subject to the terms of the Share Plan, including the requirement for each recipient to remain in 
employment with the Group until vesting (provided that vesting may occur if employment ceases in certain limited 
circumstances specified under the terms of the Share Plan). The terms of each Award include a ‘claw-back’ provision that 
means, in specified circumstances, a recipient of an Award can be required to transfer back the shares which have been 
received or repay a cash equivalent amount, or the number of shares subject to any other Award made under the Share 
Plan may be reduced by the amount of the required claw-back.
The weighted average fair value of each award granted during the period was £0.07 (2012: nil).

Long-Term Share Option Scheme
On 11 March 2010, the Board approved the implementation of a new Global Share Option Plan (the ‘Plan’), and the award 
of options to eligible employees and Directors over ordinary shares of the Company. Following a recommendation of the 
Remuneration Committee, on 19 January 2012, 13,500,000 options were granted under the Plan to the employees and 
Directors over ordinary shares of the Company. Upon commencement of employment with the Company, on 19 March 2012,

details of such transactions and amounts owed to and from these entities are provided in Notes 15 and 16.
Information regarding the remuneration of key management personnel and their connected persons is disclosed in Note 10.
On 8 November 2011, the Company entered into a short-term secured loan facility with affiliates of certain of its substantial 
shareholders, namely affiliated investment funds of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (‘Och Ziff’), for up to €3.5m (the 
‘Loan Facility’) to assist the Company in relation to its licence commitment at Area 4 Offshore Malta.
On 7 February 2012, the Company borrowed €2.0m (the ‘Principal’) under the Loan Facility. Repayment of the entire 
Principal and accrued interest thereon was completed on 26 April 2012. The Loan constituted a Related Party Transaction 
pursuant to the AIM Rules. The Directors of MOG consider, having consulted with Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited, MOG’s 
nominated adviser, that the terms of the Loan, as set out, are fair and reasonable insofar as its shareholders are 
concerned.
25 Events after the reporting period
Board appointments
Mathew Clarke and Jake Ulrich, both Non-Executive Directors of the Company, resigned down from the Board on 
8 January 2014.
Malta offshore Area 4 PSC
On 9 January 2014, the Company entered an agreement with the Government of Malta for a six month extension to the 
Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’) covering Area 4 Blocks 4, 5, 6 & 7 (‘Area 4’). This extension will enable the contractors 
to the PSC to have sufficient time to complete the exploration drilling activities that are forecast to start in Q1 2014. With this 
extension, the expiry of the first exploration period to the PSC is now 17 July 2014. The Maltese Government also gave its 
consent for Phoenicia Energy Company Ltd (‘PECL’), which wholly-owned the rights to the PSC, to assign 25% of its interest in 
the PSC to Melita Exploration Company Ltd (‘MECL’), a wholly owned subsidiary of MOG. Concurrently with this assignment, 
MOG transferred its remaining 25% interest in PECL to Genel Energy Holdings Ltd. Consequently, PECL is now a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Genel Energy Holdings Ltd. MECL and PECL have entered into a Joint Operating Agreement, in which PECL has 
been appointed Operator on behalf of the joint venture parties. Following these transfers, PECL will hold 75% working interest 
in Area 4 and MECL 25% working interest in Area 4 and are jointly the contractors to the PSC.
Ombrina Mare (Italy) Exploration Permit
On 13 January 2014, the Company announced that, further to the appeal filed on the 8 August 2013 (the ‘Appeal’) aimed 
at obtaining the annulment of the letter dated 9 July 2013 from Ministry of the Environment and of Protection of Land and 
Sea (‘MEPLS’) requesting the Company to apply for and obtain an Integrated Environmental Authorisation (‘AIA’) as a 
precondition for MEPLS’ approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment (‘EIA’) for Ombrina Mare, a tribunal hearing was 
held on 9 January 2014 at the Administrative Court in Rome. The Company is now awaiting the decision of the Appeal and 
a further update will be provided in due course. The Company is in continuing dialogue with the Italian Government and 
other key stakeholders to seek resolution on a way forward for the project outside of the Courts. In the Board’s view, such 
discussions are not hindered by the Appeal. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 66

26 Capital commitments
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had committed €2.6m (2012: €2.9m) in operational and exploration expenditure 
relating to various concessions. The above number represents all open/outstanding contracts and purchase orders that 
are not met under any partner ‘carry’.
27 Contingent liability
LGOI
On 3 January 2013, Leni Gas & Oil Investments Limited (‘LGOI’) and Leni Gas & Oil plc (collectively, the ‘Claimants’) 
commenced legal proceedings in the Queen’s Bench Division of the Commercial Court of the High Court of Justice in 
England and Wales (the ‘High Court’), against Malta Oil Pty Limited (‘MOL’) and Phoenicia Energy Company Limited 
(‘PECL’) (together, the ‘Defendants’). MOL is a subsidiary of the Company. The Company held a 25% interest in PECL, as at 
period end.
The proceedings relate to the purchase by PECL of LGOI’s 10% interest previously held in the Malta Offshore Area 4 PSC (the 
‘PSC’). The Claimants seek: rescission of the sale agreement dated 31 July 2012 under which LGOI sold its 10% interest in the 
PSC to PECL, further or alternatively, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, and interest on any sums which are found 
to be due. 
On 25 February 2013, the Defendants filed a Defence with the High Court. The Defendants and the Company’s Board of 
Directors continue to refute the various claims which have been made by the Claimants. The Group will defend itself and 
the interests of its shareholders rigorously. The outcome of this claim and the potential financial impact cannot be 
determined at this stage and therefore no provision has been made in the financial statements. The High Court hearing is 
scheduled to commence on 3 March 2014.
The Genel Energy Plc transaction announced by the Company on 21 December 2012, which completed on 28 February 2013 
and the proposed Malta work programme are unaffected by this dispute. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 67

authorised in accordance with section 551 of the 2006 
Act to allot Relevant Securities (as defined in this 
resolution) up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£1,291,677, provided that this authority shall, unless 
renewed, varied or revoked by the Company in general 
meeting, expire on the date falling 15 months from the 
date of the passing of this resolution, or if earlier at the

by the Company in general meeting) PROVIDED THAT 
such power shall be limited to:

rights issue or any other offer to holders of ordinary 
shares in proportion (as nearly as may be 
practicable) to their respective holdings and to 
holders of other equity securities as required by the 
rights of those securities or as the Directors otherwise 
consider necessary, but subject to such exclusions or 
other arrangements as the Directors may deem 
necessary or expedient in relation to treasury shares, 
fractional entitlements, record dates, legal or 
practical problems in or under the laws of any 
territory or the requirements of any regulatory body or 
stock exchange; and
(b) the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to sub 
paragraph (a) above) of equity securities up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £645,838 representing 
approximately 15% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company
 and the power hereby conferred shall operate in 
substitution for and to the exclusion of any previous 
power given to the Directors pursuant to section 570 of 
the 2006 Act and shall expire on whichever is the earlier 
of the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company held in 2015 or the date falling 15 months from 
the date of the passing of this resolution (unless renewed 
varied or revoked by the Company prior to or on that 
date) save that the Company may, before such expiry 
make an offer or agreement which would or might 
require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry 
and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance 
of such offer or agreement notwithstanding that the 
power hereby conferred has expired.

Notes
1. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only those 
members registered on the Company’s register of 
members at 6:00pm on Monday 31 March 2014 shall be 
entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting.
2. If you are a member of the Company at the time set out 
in Note 1 above, you are entitled to appoint a proxy to 
exercise all or any of your rights to attend, speak and 
vote at the Annual General Meeting. You can only 
appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these 
notes and the notes to the proxy form.
3. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company 
but must attend the Annual General Meeting to 
represent you. Details of how to appoint the Chairman of 
the Annual General Meeting or another person as your 
proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the 
proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf 
at the Annual General Meeting you will need to appoint 
your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give 
your instructions directly to them.
4. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each 
proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different 
shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to 
exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint 
more than one proxy, please contact the Company’s 
registrars on the telephone numbers set out in Note 7.
5. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your 
proxy how to vote on each resolution or withhold their 
vote.
 To appoint a proxy using the proxy form, the form must 
be:
(a) completed and signed;
(b) sent or delivered to Capita Asset Services, PXS, 34 
Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU; and
(c) received by Capita Asset Services no later than 
11:00am on Monday 31 March 2014.
 In the case of a member which is a company, the proxy 
form must be executed under its common seal or signed 
on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney 
for the company.
 Any power of attorney or any other authority under which 
the proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such 
power or authority) must be included with the proxy form.
 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 
through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the Annual General Meeting to be held at 
11:00am on Wednesday 2 April 2014 and any 
adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures 
described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal 
members or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider should refer to their CREST sponsors or voting 
service provider(s), who will be able to take the 
appropriate action on their behalf.
 In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by 
means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST 
message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited’s specifications and must contain the information 
required for such instructions, as described in the CREST 
Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be 
received by the Company’s agent, Capita Asset Services 
(CREST Participant ID: RA10), no later than 11:00am on 
Monday 31 March 2014. For this purpose, the time of 
receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the 
time stamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Application Host) from which the Company’s agent is 
able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the 
manner prescribed by CREST.
 CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider should note that 
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. 
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply 
in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take 
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or 
sponsored member or has appointed a voting service 
provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary 
to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the 
CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider are referred in 
particular to those sections of the CREST Manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system  
and timings.
 The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy 
Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 
35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
6. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the 
joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the 
appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be 
accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which 
the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s 
register of members in respect of the joint holding (the 
first-named being the most senior).
7. Except as provided above, members who have general 
queries about the Annual General Meeting should call 
the Capita Asset Services’ shareholder helpline on 
+44(0)871 664 0300 or, if calling from outside the UK,  
on +44(0)20 8639 3399. Lines are open from 8:30am to 
5:30pm, Monday to Friday. Calls to Capita Asset Services’ 
0871 664 0300 number are charged at 10 pence  
per minute (including VAT) plus any of your service 
provider’s network extras. Calls to Capita Asset Services’ 
+44(0)20 8639 3399 number from outside the UK are 
charged at applicable international rates. Different 
charges may apply to calls made from mobile 
telephones and calls may be recorded and monitored 
randomly for security and training purposes. No other 
methods of communication will be accepted.

(a) in this Notice of Annual General Meeting; or
(b) any related documents (including the proxy form),
 to communicate with the Company for any purposes 
other than those expressly stated.
9. As at 5:00pm on the day immediately prior to the date of 
posting of this Notice of Annual General Meeting, the 
Company’s issued share capital comprised 430,559,210 
ordinary shares of 1 pence each and 38,912,736 deferred

and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the 
Company as at 5:00pm on the day immediately prior to 
the date of posting of this Notice of Annual General 
Meeting is 430,559,210. The deferred shares do not carry

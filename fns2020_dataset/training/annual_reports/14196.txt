including the development of new treatments 
for unmet patient needs. 
We balance the risks of developing different 
treatments. With the acquisition of Premacure 
for example, we added SHP607 to our Pipeline – 
our Phase 2 clinical program for the prevention 
of the rare eye disorder Retinopathy of Prematurity 
(“ROP”). This acquisition also gives us access to 
neonatology, a growing market with many 
underserved specialist patient needs.

Governance Financial statements Other information Chairman’s review
I am proud to be the Chairman of a 
company with a $28 billion
1
 market 
capitalization that focuses on developing 
and marketing innovative specialty 
medicines for patients.
If you look at the track record of Shire over 
the past 25 years you will see a theme of 
change as the Company has adapted to 
anticipate and meet patient needs and 
maximize growth opportunities. From 
acquiring new businesses, to expanding 
overseas, from developing new treatments, 
to reorganizing our Company – change 
has always been part of Shire, and 2013 
was a standout year in this respect. But at 
the core of all this change is an enduring 
commitment to meet the needs of patients 
with a range of specialized conditions. 
This has always been at Shire’s heart 
and we are determined to continue 
making the most of this strength for 
all our stakeholders.
Changing for the better
For us, 2013 was a year of further success. 
Our new Chief Executive Dr. Flemming 
Ornskov led a major reorganization, 
re-focusing our Company on our core 
strengths and on where we need to be 
to continue to grow and succeed in the 
future. Flemming has a rare combination of 
science, medical, business and commercial 
acumen and his impact on Shire has been 
2013 highlights
• We grew significantly, both 
organically and through a 
number of targeted acquisitions
• We strengthened our enduring 
focus on specialty medicines  
for patients
• We created a simpler, more 
streamlined and effective  
organization – One Shire

Correct at February 24, 2014
WWW.SHIRE.COM 04 SHIRE PLC immediate and significant. We have reset 
Shire to create a simpler, more streamlined 
and effective organization – One Shire – 
entirely focused on developing and 
marketing innovative specialty medicines 
to meet significant unmet patient needs. 
Making big changes quickly is inevitably 
challenging, but the ones we have made 
through 2013 are making our Company 
stronger and better positioned to drive 
a new era of growth ahead as a result. 
We face the future fit and lean, more 
focused and flexible and we remain as 
motivated as ever to make the most of a 
world where medical science is getting 
more sophisticated, treatments are 
becoming more specialized and better-
informed patients are demanding access 
to new and better treatments. 
Continuing to specialize
Specializing has served us well over the 
years, particularly so in a pharmaceuticals 
industry which is not only more competitive 
but also more geared towards highly 
differentiated and effective treatments, and 
often very niche scientific developments. 
Going forward, Shire will continue to look 
for specialist areas where there is high 
unmet medical need.
Identifying and developing assets
One of our greatest strengths has been 
our ability to identify assets that address 
very specific patient needs, and to develop 
and bring these assets to market. These 
products and product candidates are 
typically either already approved and 
marketed or we assess them as having 
a high probability of being approved. 
Our skill is finding those assets to deliver 
growth and knowing how to maximize 
their commercial potential.
Over the years, we have established 
ourselves as an active dealmaker. Our 
most recent acquisition, of ViroPharma, 
Inc. (“ViroPharma”), is an excellent strategic 
fit and we are confident in our ability to 
maximize value for shareholders and, of 
course, for patients. The acquisition is 
expected to enhance Shire’s revenue and, 
earnings growth profile going forward. 
Expanding internationally
We continue to focus on expanding our 
international presence. We have developed 
a robust international strategy through the 
commercialization of our Rare Diseases 
treatments which are now sold in over  
50 countries in addition to the continued 
launch of ELVANSE in Europe. We have 
succeeded in scaling up steadily while 
building valuable understanding along 
the way of how to gain approval and 
market the same products in many 
different countries. We continue to 
expand, particularly into Asia. In 2013, 
we announced the establishment of a 
subsidiary office in Japan, the second 
largest pharmaceutical market in the 
world. We also established a presence 
in China and in South Korea.
Doing the right things
I am pleased with the composition of 
our Board. We have a good multi-national 
mix of skills and experience drawn from 
different areas including the worlds of 
pharmaceuticals, science, finance and 
banking. The atmosphere is open, 
participative and constructively challenging. 
Together, we focus on ensuring that Shire 
does the right things and does things right 
– strategically and responsibly. 
We welcomed Dominic Blakemore to 
the Board of Directors on January 1, 2014. 
Dominic is a non-executive Director and 
member of the Audit, Compliance & 
Risk Committee. He brings a wealth 
of experience and fresh perspective 
to the Board. 
Making the most of specialty
Looking ahead, we see even more 
growth potential in and around focusing 
on specialized unmet needs. With ever 
more finely-focused scientific developments 
and highly-targeted therapies for rare 
diseases, we aim to find new opportunities 
to lead the way in our core space. 
Specialized, high-value, targeted medicine 
is the future for Shire – we will continue to 
develop and market innovative treatments 
for distinct patient populations with 
specialized and often quite rare conditions 
around the world.
I’d like to thank all Shire employees for 
their immense efforts and unwavering 
commitment to meeting the needs of 
our patients and creating value for our 
shareholders during another 
successful year.
After more than ten years at Shire, at the 
Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2014, 
I will hand over the Chairmanship to Susan 
Kilsby. Having worked with Susan on the 
Board for a number of years I believe she is 
the ideal Chairman for the Company going 
forward; she has excellent commercial 
experience and will be a great new leader 
for the next era of Shire’s growth. I have 
thoroughly enjoyed my time with Shire as 
it has developed and grown and I am 
confident that its track record of success 
will continue.

Governance Financial statements Other information Chief Executive Officer’s review
We have enjoyed a strong year 
characterized by wide‑ranging change, 
good results and the outstanding 
contributions of our people who 
continue to make all the difference 
to our patient‑focused success.
Delivering strong results
In 2013, we refined and strengthened 
our strategy and created a simpler, 
more streamlined, integrated 
organization – One Shire. We also 
established our In-line and Pipeline 
committees to further reinforce our 
focus on commercial excellence 
and innovation. This enabled 
us to significantly reset our cost 
base and accelerate our growth.
  MORE ONLINE AT : 
AR2013.SHIRE.COM
WWW.SHIRE.COM 06 In my first year as Chief Executive, 
I am pleased to say that Shire has 
made considerable progress, achieving 
a great deal. 
Resetting our strategy
The first accomplishment was to reset 
our strategy – honing in on certain high 
growth areas within specialty medicine. 
We are focusing even more than before 
on rare, specialized conditions, building 
on our strengths and on where there is the 
greatest potential to grow and make a real 
difference to patients’ lives. Our priorities 
are to drive optimum performance from 
our currently marketed In-line products 
for patients today, and to build our Pipeline 
of potential products for patients in the 
future through focused R&D and business 
development.
Reorganizing to form One Shire
To better support this strategic focus, 
we reorganized the Company to form a 
simpler, more cohesive and streamlined 
organization – One Shire. Instead of three 
separate divisions, we now have four 
business units, focused exclusively on 
the commercial execution of our In-line 
products in our specialist therapeutic 
areas: Rare Diseases, Neuroscience, 
Gastrointestinal (GI) and Internal Medicine. 
Our single R&D organization focuses 
on developing our pipeline of innovative 
treatments to address unmet patient 
needs. And we have one global business 
development team that searches for 
value-added therapeutics that fit our 
strategic focus.
The reorganization of Shire is well 
advanced, with some final internal 
systems and processes to be concluded 
over 2014. We will, however, always seek 
to adopt new approaches and structures 
in the pursuit of continuous improvement 
and delivery of growth.
Changing the way we manage 
the Company
We also changed the way we manage the 
business – reconstituting the Executive 
Committee (formerly known as the 
Leadership Team) as well as establishing 
two new management committees – the 
In-line Committee and the Pipeline 
Committee. The Executive Committee 
manages the business of the Shire group. 
The In-line Committee is responsible for 
ensuring the optimal performance of our 
current portfolio of marketed products. 
The Pipeline Committee is responsible for 
overseeing and driving the development of 
our pipeline of future products. As a result, 
we have been better able to enhance sales 
and address performance of our In-line 
products and also consider our Pipeline 
investments and business development 
strategy on a Shire-wide basis.
Reducing costs
Significant cost savings are coming from 
our much simpler, more streamlined, 
integrated organization. This has enabled 
us to direct our investment into the areas 
that we believe will provide growth for the 
Company in the future.
Delivering efficient growth
Additionally, we have been able to 
streamline decision making, so we can 
make faster decisions with a more acute 
focus on customers. In our Neuroscience

Strategic report
Governance Financial statements Other information The Premacure AB (“Premacure”) 
acquisition brought us a Phase 2 protein 
replacement therapy for the prevention 
of ROP . A rare and potentially blinding eye 
disorder that primarily affects premature 
babies, ROP is one of the most common 
causes of visual loss in childhood and 
there are only symptomatic treatments 
available. 
Our move into ophthalmology was 
enhanced by the acquisition of SARcode 
Bioscience, Inc. (“SARcode”). SARcode 
brought us Lifitegrast (SHP606) in Phase 3 
development for the treatment of Dry Eye 
disease, a chronic and potentially 
debilitating ocular disease. The worldwide 
market for Dry Eye disease was worth 
$1.5 billion
1
 in 2012 and is growing. We 
announced top-line data from a Phase 3 
clinical trial and were pleased to meet the 
primary symptom endpoint, although the 
primary sign endpoint was not met. This 
is the first drug to show a statistically 
significant improvement in the prespecified 
symptoms of Dry Eye disease in a Phase 3 
clinical trial. We will be discussing these 
findings with the Food and Drug 
Administration (“FDA”) and hope in due 
course to be able to make Lifitegrast 
available to patients with this potentially 
debilitating condition.
Towards the end of the year, we 
announced a significant strategic 
acquisition of the high growth, rare 
disease biopharmaceutical company 
ViroPharma for approximately $4.2billion. 
The acquisition brought us a new growth-
driving product, CINRYZE, used for the 
prophylactic treatment for Hereditary 
Angiodema (HAE), complementing Shire’s 
FIRAZYR, which is used for the treatment 
of acute HAE attacks. The acquisition also 
brought us other In-line and Pipeline 
assets. In addition to enhancing both 
Shire’s immediate and long term growth 
prospects, the acquisition is also expected 
to bring significant cost synergies.

Making the most of existing assets
As well as focusing on finding and 
acquiring great new assets and 
opportunities for Shire, we also work 
hard to make the most of our existing 
assets, whether by taking them into new 
countries or by exploring and developing 
new uses for them. Take for example 
lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (“LDX”), 
as the active ingredient in VYVANSE, 
our treatment for ADHD in the US. We 
are exploring the very real potential for 
LDX to form the basis of treatment for 
Binge Eating Disorder (BED). Estimates 
suggest there are around three million 
patients with BED in the US. This is a 
huge unmet need with no currently 
approved pharmacologic treatment. 
Positive results in Phase 3 BED trials 
in 2013 underline the great potential of 
this new use for LDX. We are currently 
discussing the next steps with the FDA.
In line with our strategy to prioritize 
investments that have the greatest 
strategic clinical and commercial value, in 
January 2014 we sold our DERMAGRAFT 
assets to Organogenesis, Inc. Despite 
great efforts, we could not generate the 
growth in sales that we expected from 
this product. As a result of this transaction, 
we are now able to concentrate our 
investment and resources on products 
and pipeline programs that have better 
profitability and growth prospects.
Continuing to change
If you look at the history of Shire over 
the past 25 years, we have always been 
a fast growing, adaptive company. Shire 
continues to evolve, never stands still and 
we strive to surprise, positively. This ability 
to embrace and incorporate change is key 
to our success. It is in our DNA.
Chief Executive Officer’s 
review continued
business unit for example, we have 
restructured and reinvested in our sales 
force in the US to help provide better 
service to physicians. 
As a result of strong product sales 
growth and reducing costs, our bottom 
line profitability has improved, reflecting 
our focus on delivering efficient growth.
Focusing our innovation
We have restructured our R&D 
organization into one innovation-driven 
team. In our early stage research we 
have committed to focus on rare diseases, 
where there is significant unmet need 
and where we have strong expertise. 
Our current pipeline has a very promising 
range of late stage assets and we will 
seek to add to these through business 
development. By aligning our efforts and 
investments on fewer areas with greater 
potential, we aim to be more efficient 
and effective in developing our portfolio 
of distinctive and innovative products in 
our chosen areas of specialization.
Acquiring great new assets
We announced four acquisitions in 2013 to 
further strengthen our Pipeline and In-line 
portfolio. These all fit our growth strategy 
by adding to our strength in specialized 
or Rare Diseases.
With Lotus Tissue Repair, Premacure and 
SARcode Biosciences, we have exciting 
new assets in areas of unmet patient need, 
with significant growth opportunities. 
Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc. (“Lotus Tissue 
Repair”) is developing the first and 
currently only protein replacement therapy 
for the treatment of DEB, a devastating 
orphan disease for which there is no 
currently approved treatment option other 
than palliative care. The product is in late 
preclinical development and has the 
potential to be a first-in-class systemic 
therapy for the treatment of DEB. 
08 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Putting patients at the heart of our 
business
A core aspect of Shire is our very real 
focus on patients. Like change, it has 
always been part of what makes us 
special. When we try to be great in a 
specialized area, the first thing we look at 
is the patient. Are there significant unmet 
patient needs? Do we truly understand 
these patients? Do we have the product 
or potential product to meet their needs? 
Putting patients at the heart of our 
business has always been our guiding 
principle. It is why there are pictures of 
patients around our offices everywhere 
and it is reinforced by our enduring culture 
of striving to be as brave as the patients we 
serve. Our BRAVE culture is integral to the 
way we attract and retain great people. It 
keeps the Company fresh and engaged. 
And it plays a major part in our people’s 
remarkable ability to continue to deliver 
results while also focusing on changing 
for the future.
Our people
I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank everyone in Shire for their 
tremendous contribution this year and 
for their amazing willingness to embrace 
change for the better.
After almost six years at Shire, Graham 
Hetherington is stepping down as Chief 
Financial Officer (CFO) on March 1, 2014. 
We are grateful for Graham’s many 
contributions to the Company and wish 
him all the best. Shire’s Senior Vice 
President and Group Financial Controller 
James Bowling will be interim CFO and 
we are undertaking the global search for 
Graham’s successor.
Evolving the business
This year we have undergone another 
evolution in Shire. We have increased 
our focus on developing and marketing 
innovative specialty medicines to meet 
significant unmet patient needs and we 
have simplified and streamlined to reset 
our cost base and accelerate our growth. 
We now have a sharper, stronger Shire – 
a Shire that is well set for high growth 
both in the top and bottom line. In the 
years ahead we will focus on even more 
specialty, even more rare diseases, even 
more targeted conditions where we can 
lead the way in developing and delivering 
treatments for patients.
Investors have responded well to the 
changes and we were pleased with the 
steady and significant increase in Shire’s 
share price during 2013. We are grateful 
to our shareholders for their continued 
support as we continue to do everything 
we can to build the success and grow 
the value of Shire. 
Focusing on growth
Where 2013 was essentially a year of 
evolution, we expect that 2014 will above 
all be a year of growth. We now have 
a sharper focus and a stronger more 
streamlined organization together with 
our BRAVE culture and unswerving 
commitment to patients with specialized 
conditions. 
Boosted by this firm foundation, we will 
focus on growth – through our existing 
In-line products, through our Pipeline of 
potential products and through identifying 
and maximizing all the opportunities that 
lie ahead. I look forward to another 
exciting year for Shire.

VYVANSE product sales grew strongly 
(+19%) in 2013 primarily as a result of 
price increases as well as higher 
prescription demand, due to growth 
in the US ADHD market (+6%) and 
VYVANSE’s share of that market.
Reported ELAPRASE sales growth 
(+10%) was driven by an increase in 
the number of patients on therapy. 
The increase in ELAPRASE sales 
between Q3 and Q4 of 2013 was 
partly driven by the timing of certain 
large orders from markets which 
order less frequently.
The growth in product sales for 
LIALDA/MEZAVANT (+32%) in 
2013 was primarily driven by higher 
market share in the US, the effects

REPLAGAL sales were down 6% 
compared to 2012 (down 4% on a

Our vision
Our vision is to transform the lives 
of people around the world whose 
health is impacted by rare and other 
specialized conditions, through 
providing innovative treatments. 
We bring this vision to life through 
our strategy and business model.
Our strategy
Our strategy describes how we will 
achieve our vision.
Our strategy is to grow our business 
and deliver value to our stakeholders by 
focusing on significant unmet patient need 
in specialist areas and providing more 
innovative treatments to more patients.
Our business model
We implement our strategy through 
our business model. It is our structure 
for success and drives our growth.
During 2013 we unified our business 
– our One Shire model has created a 
simple structure and focused efficient 
organization that is scalable for growth.
Strategy and business model
We are focused on growing Shire by 
developing and marketing innovative 
specialty medicines that address 
significant unmet patient needs.

To deliver this, we:
• Serve patients with high unmet needs in 
select, commercially attractive specialty 
therapeutic areas.
• Drive optimum performance of our 
In-line, marketed products – to serve 
patients today.
• Build our Pipeline of innovative treatments 
through both Research and Development 
(“R&D”) and Business Development 
activities – to enable us to serve patients 
in the future.
• Concentrate our R&D capabilities on 
the development of innovative specialist 
medicines. 
Commercial excellence
We have four business units that focus 
exclusively on the commercial execution 
of our In-line products in our specialist 
therapeutic areas: Rare Diseases, 
Neuroscience, Gastrointestinal and 
Internal Medicine. This ensures we 
provide innovative treatments, and 
service the needs of our customers 
and patients, as efficiently as possible.
Innovation
We have moved to a single R&D 
organization that focuses on developing 
our pipeline of innovative treatments to 
address unmet patient needs. This 
ensures we prioritise the treatments 
we focus on to ensure they have the 
highest chance of clinical success and 
are aligned with our priority therapeutic 
areas and potential new areas such as 
ophthalmology and hematology/oncology. 
Our early stage research is primarily 
focused on rare diseases.
Our growth is also fueled by the acquisition 
of new compounds and marketed 
products. Shire’s global Business 
Development team searches the industry 
for value-added therapeutics that fit our 
strategic focus and address patients’ 
unmet needs. The team is engaged in 
conversations with scientists and 
entrepreneurs all around the world, while 
collaborating daily with commercial and 
R&D experts throughout Shire. 
Support
Our support functions, including Technical 
Operations, are unified across the 
business to ensure we support our In-line 
and Pipeline activities as efficiently and 
effectively as possible. 
One way of working 
We lead our business through our 
Executive Committee which, supported 
by our In-line and Pipeline Committees, 
ensures we allocate resources and make 
decisions across the enterprise in the best 
interests of One Shire, our patients, 
shareholders and other stakeholders.
Our unified way of working means we can 
quickly adapt to focus our resources 
where the greatest opportunities exist.
One culture
We have a clear and strong patient-
focused culture where we all strive 
to be BRAVE:
Bold: We have the courage to lead 
the way
Resilient: We are agile and adaptable 
to meet the changing needs of our 
stakeholders
Accountable: We deliver on our 
promises to all of our stakeholders
Visionary: We fearlessly innovate 
to address unmet patient need
Ethical: We do the right thing, in the 
right way
Our culture comes to life through our 
employees who together form One Shire. 
We value and invest in our employees 
to ensure they have the capabilities 
and support to implement our strategy, 
achieve our vision and deliver value to 
our patients, payors and shareholders.

Governance Financial statements Other information Responsibility
We are committed to 
demonstrating responsibility 
throughout Shire.
Responsibility at Shire
Our vision is to transform the lives of people 
around the world whose health is impacted 
by rare and other specialized conditions by 
providing innovative treatments. To this end, 
we ground everything we do in our BRAVE 
values – to be bold, resilient, accountable, 
visionary, and ethical. This underpins our 
approach to responsibility, and ultimately 
how we strive to develop novel treatments 
to serve patients and to create enduring 
value for stakeholders.
Responsibility at Shire has always been 
embedded in our business – we have never 
separated it from our daily business 
activities, decisions and relationships.
  MORE ONLINE AT : 
WWW.SHIRE.COM/CR
Taking an ethical and responsible 
approach in the best interests of our 
patients underpins everything we do. 
We see this in the programs and activities 
designed to improve access to our rare 
disease medicines where they aren’t 
currently available; in our efforts to raise 
awareness among physicians and parents 
of the signs of many rare and specialist 
diseases and provide the extra support 
often required with this type of diagnosis; 
in our work with policy makers to raise 
awareness of the serious social impact 
of untreated ADHD on families, education 
and the criminal justice system; and 
through our campaign in the US to 
discourage the misuse, abuse and 
diversion of ADHD medications.
We are proud of the progress we are 
making, but are not complacent. We know 
there is more we can and will do. We will 
continue to strive towards greater 
transparency of our policies, goals and our 
progress towards those goals. We will 
continue to work with governments, policy 
makers and payors to improve access to 
treatments in both developed and 
developing countries. And we will continue 
to invest in developing and marketing new 
treatments where the need is great and 
our skills and experience are most relevant.
WWW.SHIRE.COM Core areas of focus 
While responsibility at Shire covers a wide 
range of topics and areas – including the 
environment, community involvement, 
and our people – our stakeholders have 
emphasized that there are two primary 
areas where they believe we have the 
greatest responsibility: access to 
medicines and disease awareness. 
Access to medicines
Access to treatment for those with rare 
or specialist conditions can be a big 
challenge, even in developed parts of 
the world such as North America and 
Western Europe. Shire’s Rare Disease 
Impact Report revealed that it takes more 
than seven and a half years in the US to 
receive a proper diagnosis of a rare 
disease – it isn’t difficult to see how much 
longer this might be in less developed 
parts of the world. Some 7 ,000 rare 
diseases have been identified, and 
treatment exists for less than 5%. 
For those with rare and specialist 
conditions, improving access is largely 
about continuing to focus on developing 
new treatments for unmet patient needs, 
where there is currently little hope. As a 
result, we view the development of orphan 
drugs, and treatments for other specialist 
conditions with significant unmet needs, 
as a core responsibility in itself. 
Other ways to improve access involve 
reducing barriers, such as affordability and 
geographic access for our existing 
treatments. We have several programs to 
assist patients with affordability challenges 
in the US. Outside the US, we have Named 
Patient programs to provide products to 
patients where they might not otherwise 
be available. For countries where we have 
no commercial presence, and there is no 
reimbursement, we have a Charitable 
Access Program administered by our NGO 
partner Direct Relief in conjunction with an 
independent Medical Expert Committee. 
We also have a long-standing relationship 
with AmeriCares, donating medicines to 
people in need in poorer countries around 
the world. These are just some of the ways 
we are working to provide hope to patients 
with few, if any, treatment options.
Disease awareness
Disease awareness is especially important 
for Shire because the conditions our 
products treat are often extremely rare 
or not well understood. Without the 
appropriate level of awareness, conditions 
often remain undiagnosed to the detriment 
of the patient, their family, the health care 
system and society. We believe that 
creating fact- and evidence-based 
awareness of these conditions is key to 
enabling proper diagnosis and treatment. 
We aim to share our expertise and provide 
balanced, reliable and scientifically sound 
information to help improve understanding 
and appreciation of difficult and life-altering 
conditions. We do this in a variety of ways, 
for example by sponsoring new research 
and conducting educational work with 
doctors, patients and policy makers.
We have a cross-functional working 
group that convenes quarterly to share 
and encourage best practice and explore 
ways to improve how we can create 
awareness in the most effective, and 
responsible manner.
Other areas of focus
Diversity
Our success continues to be driven by our 
diverse employee talent around the world. 
We value all genders, ages, cultures, 
experiences and backgrounds as we build 
and grow our global organization. Shire is 
an equal opportunity employer and strives 
to ensure that there is no discrimination 
against anyone applying for a job or in 
employment for reasons related to race, 
religion, national origin, gender, disability 
or on any other personal characteristic. 
We do not have diversity targets or quotas 
and we do not focus exclusively on one 
group of employees over and above any 
other group of employees. However, 
we do focus very strongly on fostering 
our BRAVE culture, which aims to provide 
all our employees with a supportive work 
environment that values diverse opinions 
and experiences, and enables individual, 
group and organizational success. 
In 2013, we communicated our diversity 
and inclusion philosophy statement to 
employees and on shire.com.

Strategic report
Governance Financial statements Other information Having a diverse workforce is only half the 
equation – the benefit to our employees, 
our patients, our business, and society 
comes from the respect, consideration 
and inclusion of these different views into 
our work every day. Our growing global 
reach gives us the opportunity to bring to 
our business, and for the benefit of our 
patients, greater depth of experiences and 
capabilities. Beyond our immediate 
workforce, we also have a Supplier 
Diversity Program in place in the US which 
provides opportunities for minority or 
disabled and veteran-owned businesses. 
More than 10% of Shire’s total 2013 US 
spend was in support of these businesses. 
In all hiring and employment practices, 
Shire is committed to ensuring that it 
does not discriminate against qualified 
individuals who have a disability. The 
Company further asserts its commitment 
to fair treatment and reasonable 
accommodation of applicants’ or 
employees’ disabilities in accordance 
with all applicable laws in the respective 
locations of all Shire facilities. 
Our people
As of December 31, 2013, Shire employed 
over 5,000 talented people with operations 
in 31 countries. We promote the best use 
of our human resources on the basis of 
individual skills and experience matched 
against those required for the work to be 
performed, and actively seek out a 
diversity of views and experiences.
We believe we are better able to achieve 
our goals and continuously improve by 
supporting a strong performance culture. 
While many factors contribute to this, 
research has shown that the most 
important factor in performance is an 
employee’s relationship with his or her 
manager. That’s why we have devoted 
considerable resources to help our 
managers be the best they can be. This 
includes a dedicated online resource 
center for managers, which provides 
critical support, tips and e-learning 
opportunities. This tool is supplemented 
by face-to-face and group opportunities 
to learn how to 1) manage performance, 
2) develop people, and 3) foster a BRAVE 
culture – also known as the ‘three 
expectations of people managers’– for 
which all Shire people managers are 
accountable. Our pay for performance 
philosophy provides managers with a 
variety of programs to recognize and 
reward employee contributions, and our 
employee share purchase plans enable 
employees to have a ‘vested’ interest in 
the success of the business.
Driving performance requires a clear 
understanding of where we are heading, 
and this happens at every level of the 
business – from the one-on-one 
performance discussions between 
managers and employees, to the all-
employee meetings held at many of 
our major sites. Shire communicates 
with all employees via an active internal 
communications program which included 
the launch of a new global intranet in 2013. 
Designed to promote greater engagement 
and dialog, the new intranet enables 
more effective and efficient two-way 
communication with the introduction 
of social features including a CEO blog 
and regular live CEO chats. Other 
communications include all-employee 
emails from the CEO, our own social 
networking platform (known as Shiral), 
and quarterly leadership briefings 
and cascades. 
Our planet
Shire is committed to operating a 
sustainable organization that protects 
our employees, the environment and 
the communities where we conduct 
our activities. We are committed to 
demonstrating respect for the individual 
and the environment. We firmly believe that 
effective environmental management is 
a key component in achieving excellent 
company performance and making Shire 
a world-class organization and responsible 
corporate citizen. 
We strive to conserve resources and 
minimize adverse environmental impacts 
and risks that may be associated with our 
products, facilities and operations. We are 
committed to promoting the sustainable 
and efficient use of natural resources, 
waste minimization, recycling, energy 
efficiency, and responsible product 
stewardship in our business activities. 
We have implemented key components 
of a health, safety and environmental 
management system for our operations,

Our health, safety and environmental team 
continually work to improve this system. 
While Shire is a global company, most 
environmental impacts from our facilities 
are local, so we believe the impacts 
are most effectively addressed locally. 
We therefore focus on setting local 
site-specific goals rather than global 
goals to reduce our impacts. At Shire, 
we continuously strive to do the right thing 
and at each of our facilities our staff work 
to identify and implement projects to 
reduce our environmental impacts. 
Shire’s reporting of its Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions (GHG) is outlined in 
the table below. 
Human Rights
We support the UN Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights (http://www.un.org/en/
documents/udhr/) and recognize the 
obligation to promote universal respect 
for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all, without 
distinction to sex, age, race, religion, or 
any other characteristic protected by law.
Of paramount importance, we safeguard 
the human rights of those taking part in our 
clinical trials, which is primarily achieved 
through the process of informed consent. 
Shire adheres to the International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines. In 2013, 
we summarized and posted on shire.com 
our approach to clinical trials which makes 
explicit reference to the rights and 
protection of clinical trial participants.
We are committed to the protection of the 
human rights of our employees in our 
offices and manufacturing facilities around 
the world. We recognize that commercial 
success depends on the full commitment 
of all our employees and commit to 
respecting their human rights, to provide 
them with safe and favorable working 
conditions that are free from unnecessary 
risk and to maintain fair and competitive 
terms and conditions of service at all times. 
We seek to comply fully with all relevant 
laws, rules and regulations governing labor, 
employment and the employment 
relationship in all of the countries where 
Shire does business. 
We commit to the principles articulated in 
the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) 
“Declaration on Fundamental Principles 
and Rights at Work” which includes the 
following four major principles: (1) Freedom 
of association and the effective recognition 
of the right to collective bargaining; 
(2) Elimination of all forms of forced or 
compulsory labor; (3) Abolition of child 
labor, and; (4) Elimination of employment 
discrimination.
We also commit to the protection of 
human rights of our partners and 
suppliers, and in turn, expect them to do 
the same in their operations and to their 
employees around the world. We do this 
through a regular and systematic audit 
of our suppliers, and our Responsible 
Supply Chain policy explicitly states our 
expectations of suppliers to uphold the 
ILO principles. This policy can be found 
on our website, shire.com. 
Organizing for greatest effect
We have more than a dozen internal 
responsibility leaders who serve as 
“sponsors” for focus areas such as 
the environment, our people and the 
community. The sponsors are responsible 
for setting goals which support our 
overall strategy, ensuring progress and 
maintaining high standards. They include 
senior representatives from Legal, R&D, 
Human Resources, Environment, Health 
& Safety, Compliance and Risk 
Management, Facilities, Corporate 
Communications and Public Affairs. In 
addition, we have three working groups 
in the areas of Clinical Trials, Access to 
Medicines and Disease Awareness, each 
looking to improve our programs and 
approaches. Our Responsibility Steering 
and Communications Group (RSCG) 
facilitates the activities of the working 
groups, oversees communications and 
works with sponsors. Our approach to 
responsibility is championed by our CEO, 
supported by the Executive, In-line and 
Pipeline Committees and endorsed by 
our Board.
Staying close to our stakeholders
We recognize the importance of seeking 
external input from key stakeholders such 
as patients, physicians and others to 
understand what is most important to 
them, and regularly consult and engage 
with them on these important areas. 
During the year we engaged with investors, 
patient groups and policy makers on a 
range of issues including our environmental 
approaches and disclosure, our approach 
to clinical trials, our role in ensuring the 
appropriate use of our ADHD products, 
philanthropy and access to medicines. 
Sharing and improving
We communicate widely and regularly 
on responsibility with all our stakeholders 
through our bi-annual publication 
Responsibility Matters, our intranet 
and on our website, shire.com. We’re 
always interested to hear feedback 
and suggestions on how we can be 
an even more responsible organization.

Monitors the effectiveness of the risk management 
process and the internal control structure.
•  B oa r d
Established a risk governance framework  
and ensures the ACR Committee has the  
resources to fulfill its role.
• Internal Audit & Other  
Assurance Functions
Provides an independent assurance to the EC  
and ACR Committees that the risk management and 
internal control environment is operating effectively.
• Global Compliance & Risk  
Management/Risk Council (“GCRM”)
Facilitates and supports the enterprise risk

• Business Units &  
Corporate Functions
Implements a risk management process and 
establishes internal controls within their respective 
organizations.
• The Executive Committee (“EC”)
Ensures that an effective risk management  
process and a robust internal control structure  
are implemented.
The Company has adopted a risk 
management strategy designed to identify, 
assess and manage the significant risks 
that it faces. While the Company aims to 
identify and manage such risks, no risk 
management strategy can provide 
absolute assurance against loss.
Mitigation of principal risks
The management and mitigation of risks 
are a key focus of the Board which, 
together with the Audit, Compliance & Risk 
(“ACR”) Committee, reviews risks impacting 
the Company on a timely basis as they 
arise, as well as periodically. In addition, 
the Company has established a Risk 
Council, which is supported by the Global 
Compliance and Risk Management 
(“GCRM”) Department, to oversee 
the management and mitigation of the 
principal risks faced by the Company, 
as set out below. The Risk Council and 
the GCRM Department are respectively 
chaired and managed by the Chief 
Compliance and Risk Officer. 
Risk Council
The Risk Council’s membership includes 
senior members of the Company’s 
business units and corporate functions, in 
addition to the Head of Internal Audit. It is 
charged with overseeing the Company’s 
risk management process and activities, 
and as such, ensures that each business 
unit and corporate function periodically 
reviews the significant risks they face in 
accordance with an approved framework. 
This review, which occurs biannually, 
includes identifying operational risks, 
compliance risks and risks to the 
achievement of goals and objectives. 
The Risk Council ensures that there is 
an owner who is responsible for the 
management or mitigation of each 
identified risk. Material risks and 
associated mitigation plans are recorded 
on a corporate risk schedule for ongoing 
review and assessment by the Risk 
Council, which is also reviewed and 
validated by the Executive Committee. 
In addition, the risk schedule is reviewed 
biannually by the ACR Committee, and 
annually by the Board.

Department provides assistance to help 
employees meet high ethical standards 
and comply with applicable laws and 
regulations; encouraging them to seek 
help and to report suspected cases of 
misconduct without fear of retaliation 
(further details are available on page 61).
Chief Compliance and Risk Officer
The Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, 
who reports directly to the Chief Executive, 
has access at all times to the Chairman of 
the ACR Committee which provides a 
mechanism for bypassing executive 
management should the need arise. In 
addition, the ACR Committee is regularly 
provided with summary reports on the 
Risk Council and general compliance 
activities. 
Risk factors
Set out below are the Company’s key risk 
factors that have been identified through 
the implementation of the Company’s risk 
management strategy. Some of these risk 
factors are specific to the Company, and 
others are more generally applicable to the 
pharmaceutical industry or specific 
markets within which the Company 
operates. The Company considers that 
these risk factors apply equally and 
therefore all should be carefully considered 
before any investment is made in Shire.
Risk factors related to the 
Company’s business 
The Company’s products may not be 
a commercial success
The commercial success of the Company’s 
marketed products and other new 
products that the Company may launch 
in the future, will depend on their approval 
and acceptance by physicians, patients 
and other key decision makers, as well 
as the receipt of marketing approvals in 
different countries, the time taken to obtain 
such approvals, the scope of marketing 
approvals as reflected in the product labels, 
approval of reimbursement at commercially 
sustainable prices in those countries where 
price and reimbursement is negotiated, 
and safety, efficacy, convenience and 
cost-effectiveness of the product as 
compared to competitive products.
The Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations may 
be adversely affected if any or all of the 
following occur: 
• if the Company’s products, or competitive 
products, are genericized; 
• if the prices of the Company’s products 
suffer forced reductions or if prices of 
competitor products are reduced 
significantly; 
• if there are unanticipated adverse events 
experienced with the Company’s 
products or those of a competitor’s 
product not seen in clinical trials that 
impact physicians’ willingness to 
prescribe the Company’s products; 
• if issues arise from clinical trials being 
conducted for post-marketing purposes 
or for registration in another country 
which raise questions or concerns about 
a product;
• if the regulatory agencies in one country 
act in a way that raises concerns for 
regulatory agencies or for prescribers 
or patients in another country;
• if patients, payors or physicians favor 
other treatments over the Company’s 
products;
• if the Company’s products are subject 
to more stringent government regulation 
than competitor products; 
• if patent protection or other forms of 
exclusivity are lost or curtailed, or if 
competitors are able to challenge or 
circumvent the Company’s patents or 
other forms of exclusivity (See Note 19 to 
the consolidated financial statements set 
forth in this Annual Report for details of 
current litigation);
• if launch of the Company’s products in 
new markets is not successful; 
• if the sizes of the patient populations for 
the Company’s products are less than 
expected; or
• if there are lawsuits filed against Shire, 
including but not limited to, product 
liability claims, consumer law claims, and 
payor or reimbursement litigation.
If the Company is unable to commercialize 
its products successfully, there may be a 
material adverse effect on the Company’s 
revenues, financial condition or results of 
operations.
Revenues from ADDERALL XR are 
subject to generic competition and 
revenues from INTUNIV will become 
subject to generic erosion starting in 
December 2014
During 2012 the FDA clarified the 
regulatory pathway required for approval 
of generic versions of ADDERALL XR. 
Consequently in June 2012 and February 
2013, Actavis and Teva, respectively, 
received approval to launch their own 
generic versions of ADDERALL XR. Shire 
currently sells authorized generic versions 
of ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax and 
also continues to sell the branded version 
of ADDERALL XR. 
In 2013, Shire settled a number of patent 
lawsuits in the United States against 
certain companies that had filed for 
approval of their generic versions of 
INTUNIV. Under the terms of the 
settlements, Actavis was granted a license 
to make and market Actavis’ generic 
versions of INTUNIV in the United States 
on December 1, 2014. All other parties 
with whom Shire has settled will be able 
to enter the market with their respective 
ANDA-approved products after Actavis’ 
180-day exclusivity period has expired.
Revenues from ADDERALL XR declined 
following the launch of Actavis’ generic 
version of ADDERALL XR. Revenues from 
INTUNIV are expected to decline as a 
result of the launch of Actavis’ generic 
versions of INTUNIV and to decline further 
following the expected launch of generic 
versions of INTUNIV by other companies 
after Actavis’ 180-day exclusivity period 
expires. 
Factors which could cause further or more 
rapid revenue decline include:
• generic or authorized generic versions 
of the Company’s products capture 
more of Shire’s branded market share 
than expected;
• the FDA approves additional ANDAs for 
generic versions of the Company’s 
products which, if launched, further 
reduce branded market share or impact 
the amount of authorized generic sales 
and related royalties; 
• the production of ADDERALL XR is 
disrupted by difficulties in obtaining a 
sufficient supply of amphetamine salts 
including, but not limited to, an inability 
to obtain sufficient quota from the DEA;
• there are changes in reimbursement 
policies of third party payors; or 
• there are changes to the level of sales 
deductions for ADDERALL XR and 
INTUNIV for private or public payors.
The failure to obtain and maintain 
reimbursement, or an adequate level 
of reimbursement, by third-party 
payors in a timely manner for the 
Company’s products may impact 
future revenues, financial condition 
and results of operations
The Company’s revenues are partly 
dependent on the level of reimbursement 
provided to the Company by governmental 
reimbursement schemes for its products. 
Changes to governmental policy or 
practices could adversely affect the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
and results of operations. In addition, the 
WWW.SHIRE.COM ANNUAL REPORT 2013 SHIRE PLC 25
Strategic report
Governance Financial statements Other information reimbursement of treatments by health 
care providers, private health insurers 
and other organizations, such as health 
maintenance organizations and managed 
care organizations is under downward 
pressure and this, in turn, could adversely 
impact the prices at which the Company 
can sell its products. Factors affecting 
the Company’s ability to obtain and 
maintain adequate reimbursement for 
its products include:
• higher levels of controls on the use of the 
Company’s products and/or requirements 
for additional price concessions by 
managed health care organizations 
or government authorities;
• legislative proposals to reform health care 
and government insurance programs in 
many of the Company’s markets; and
• price controls, unsuccessful government 
tenders, or non-reimbursement of new 
medicines or new indications. 
The cost of treatment for some of the 
Company’s products is high, particularly 
those which are used for the treatment 
of rare genetic diseases. The Company 
may encounter difficulty in obtaining or 
maintaining satisfactory pricing and 
reimbursement for such products. The 
failure to obtain and maintain pricing and 
reimbursement at satisfactory levels for 
its products may adversely affect the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
or results of operations.
The Company conducts its own 
manufacturing operations for certain 
of its Rare Diseases products and is 
reliant on third party contract 
manufacturers to manufacture other 
products and to provide goods and 
services. Some of the Company’s 
products or ingredients are only 
available from a single approved 
source for manufacture. Any 
disruption to the supply chain for any 
of the Company’s products may result 
in the Company being unable to 
continue marketing or developing a 
product or may result in the Company 
being unable to do so on a 
commercially viable basis for some 
period of time 
The Company sources some products 
from third party contract manufacturers, 
and for certain products has its own 
manufacturing capability. Although the 
Company dual-sources certain key 
products and/or active ingredients, the 
Company currently relies on a single 
source for production of the final drug 
product for each of ADDERALL XR, 
CINRYZE, FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL, 
INTUNIV, LIALDA, PENTASA, and 
RESOLOR, relies on a single active 
ingredient source for each of ELAPRASE, 
FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL, INTUNIV, 
REPLAGAL, RESOLOR and VPRIV (in 
the US), and relies on limited third party 
sources to provide the donated human 
plasma necessary for the manufacture 
of CINRYZE. 
The Company may experience supply 
failures or delays beyond its control if it 
does not, or if any of its third party 
manufacturers do not supply the Company 
on time with the required volumes, or 
supply products that do not meet 
regulatory requirements. Any such supply 
failures could lead to significant delays, 
increase in operating costs, lost product 
sales, an interruption of research activities, 
or the delay of new product launches, all of 
which could have a material adverse effect 
on the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations.
The Company has also entered into 
many agreements with third parties for the 
provision of goods and services to enable 
it to manufacture its products. If these 
third parties are unable to manufacture 
products, or provide these goods and 
services, in each case in accordance 
with its respective contractual obligations, 
the Company’s ability to manage its 
manufacturing processes or to operate 
its business, including to continue the 
development or commercialization of its 
products as planned or on a commercial 
basis, may be adversely impacted.
The development, approval and 
manufacturing of the Company’s 
products is subject to extensive 
oversight by various regulatory 
agencies and regulatory approvals 
or interventions associated with 
changes to manufacturing sites, 
ingredients or manufacturing 
processes could lead to significant 
delays, increase in operating costs, 
lost product sales, an interruption of 
research activities or the delay of new 
product launches
Pharmaceutical and device manufacturing 
sites must be inspected and approved by 
regulatory agencies such as the FDA, and 
similar agencies in other countries. Active 
ingredients, excipients and packaging 
materials used in the manufacturing 
process must be obtained from sources 
approved by regulatory agencies.
The development, approval and 
manufacturing of the Company’s products 
depend on the ability to procure ingredients 
and packaging materials from approved 
sources and for the manufacturing process 
to be conducted at approved sites. 
Changes of manufacturer or changes of 
source of ingredients or packaging 
materials must generally be approved by 
the regulatory agencies, which will involve 
testing and additional inspections to 
ensure compliance with the applicable 
regulatory agency’s regulations and 
standards. The need to qualify a new 
manufacturer or source of ingredients or 
packaging materials can take a significant 
amount of time. Should it become 
necessary to change a manufacturer or 
supplier of ingredients or packaging 
materials, or to qualify an additional 
supplier, the Company may not be able 
do so quickly, or at all, which could delay 
or disrupt the manufacturing process. 
US-based manufacturers must be 
registered with the DEA and similar 
regulatory authorities in other countries 
if they handle controlled substances. 
Certain of the Company’s products, 
including ADDERALL XR and VYVANSE, 
contain ingredients which are controlled 
substances subject to quotas managed 
by the DEA. As a result, the Company’s 
procurement and production quotas 
may not be sufficient to meet 
commercial demand. 
CINRYZE, ELAPRASE, REPLAGAL and 
VPRIV are manufactured using highly 
complex biological processes. The 
complexity of the manufacturing results in a 
number of risks, including the risk of viral or 
other contamination. Additionally, CINRYZE 
is derived from human plasma, and is 
therefore subject to the risk of biological 
contamination inherent in plasma-derived 
products. The sole manufacturer of 
CINRYZE has received observations on 
Form 483 and a warning letter from the 
FDA identifying issues with respect to the 
manufacturing process for CINRYZE which 
must be addressed to the satisfaction 
of the FDA. Any regulatory interventions, 
in relation to these, or any other issues, 
if they occur, may delay or disrupt the 
manufacture of the Company’s products. 
The Company has made significant 
investments in a new biologics 
manufacturing plant at its site in Lexington, 
Principal risks and uncertainties
continued
26 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Massachusetts. The Company’s ability to 
manufacture certain of its Rare Diseases 
products or constituents in this new facility 
remains subject to the approval of the 
facility by the FDA and other international 
agencies. 
The failure to obtain regulatory approvals 
promptly or at all and/or regulatory 
interventions associated with changes 
to manufacturing sites, ingredients or 
manufacturing processes could lead to 
significant delays, an increase in operating 
costs, lost product sales, an interruption 
of research activities, the delay of new 
product launches or constraints on 
manufacturing output, all of which could 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
The actions of certain customers 
could affect the Company’s ability 
to sell or market products profitably. 
Fluctuations in buying or distribution 
patterns by such customers can 
adversely impact the Company’s 
revenues, financial conditions or 
results of operations 
A considerable portion of the Company’s 
product sales are made to major 
pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, as 
well as to large pharmacies, in both the US 
and Europe. In 2013, for example, 52% of 
the Company’s product sales were 
attributable to three customers in the US: 
[McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health, Inc and 
AmerisourceBergen Corp]. In the event of 
financial failure of any of these customers 
there could be a material adverse effect 
on the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations. The 
Company’s revenues, financial condition or 
results of operations may also be affected 
by fluctuations in customer buying or 
distribution patterns. These fluctuations 
may result from seasonality, pricing, 
wholesaler inventory objectives, or other 
factors. A significant portion of the 
Company’s revenues for certain products 
for treatment of rare genetic diseases are 
concentrated within a small number of 
customers. Changes in the buying patterns 
of those customers may have an adverse 
effect on the Company’s revenues, 
financial condition or results of operations.
Investigations or enforcement action 
by regulatory authorities or law 
enforcement agencies relating to the 
Company’s activities in the highly 
regulated markets in which it 
operates may result in significant 
legal costs and the payment of 
substantial compensation or fines
The Company engages in various 
marketing, promotional and educational 
activities pertaining to, as well as the sale 
of, pharmaceutical products and medical 
devices in a number of jurisdictions around 
the world. The promotion, marketing and 
sale of pharmaceutical products and 
medical devices is highly regulated and the 
operations of market participants, such as 
the Company, are closely supervised by 
regulatory authorities and law enforcement 
agencies, including the US Department of 
HHS, the FDA, the US Department of 
Justice, the SEC and the DEA. These 
authorities and agencies and their 
equivalents in countries outside the US 
have broad authority to investigate market 
participants for potential violations of laws 
relating to the sales, marketing and 
promotion of pharmaceutical products and 
medical devices, including the False 
Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute and 
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, among 
others, for alleged improper conduct, 
including corrupt payments to government 
officials, improper payments to medical 
professionals, off-label marketing of 
pharmaceutical products and medical 
devices, and the submission of false claims 
for reimbursement by the federal 
government. Healthcare companies may 
also be subject to enforcement actions or 
prosecution for such improper conduct. 
Any inquiries or investigations into the 
operations of, or enforcement or other 
regulatory action against, the Company by 
such authorities could result in significant 
defense costs, fines, penalties and 
injunctive or administrative remedies, 
distract management to the detriment of 
the business, result in the exclusion of 
certain products, or the Company, from 
government reimbursement programs or 
subject the Company to regulatory 
controls or government monitoring of its 
activities in the future. The Company is 
subject to certain ongoing investigations 
by governmental agencies. (For further 
information, see Note 19 to the 
consolidated financial statements). 
Adverse outcomes in legal matters 
and other disputes, including Shire’s 
ability to enforce and defend patents 
and other intellectual property rights 
required for its business, could have a 
material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations
During the ordinary course of its business 
the Company may be involved in claims, 
disputes and litigation with third parties, 
employees, regulatory agencies, 
governmental authorities and other parties. 
The range of matters of a legal nature that 
might arise is extremely broad but could 
include, without limitation, employment 
claims and disputes, intellectual property 
claims and disputes, contract claims and 
disputes, product liability claims and 
disputes, regulatory litigation and tax 
audits and disputes.
Any unfavorable outcome in such matters 
could adversely impact the Company’s 
ability to develop or commercialize its 
products, adversely affect the profitability 
of existing products, subject the Company 
to significant defense costs, fines, 
penalties, audit findings and injunctive 
or administrative remedies, distract 
management to the detriment of the 
business, result in the exclusion of 
certain products, or the Company, from 
government reimbursement programs 
or subject the Company to regulatory 
controls or government monitoring of its 
activities in the future. Any such outcomes 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenue, financial condition or 
results of operations. (For further information 
see Note 19 to the consolidated financial 
statements).
The Company faces intense 
competition for highly qualified 
personnel from other companies, 
academic institutions, government 
entities and other organizations. The 
Company is undergoing a corporate 
reorganization and the consequent 
uncertainty could adversely impact 
the Company’s ability to attract and/
or retain the highly skilled personnel 
needed for the Company to meet its 
strategic objectives
The Company relies on recruiting and 
retaining highly skilled employees to meet 
its strategic objectives. The Company 
faces intense competition for highly 
qualified personnel and the supply of 
people with the requisite skills may be 
limited, generally or geographically. 
The range of skills required and the 
geographies in which they are required 
by the Company may also change 
over time as Shire’s business evolves. 
The Company’s ongoing One Shire 
reorganization, which aims to simplify 
the Company’s organizational structure, 
involves changes to, and geographic 
relocation of, certain skilled roles. If the 
Company is unable to retain key personnel 
or attract new personnel with the requisite 
skills and experience, it could adversely 
affect the implementation of the Company’s 
strategic objectives and ultimately adversely 
impact the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations. 
Failure to achieve the Company’s 
strategic objectives with respect to 
the acquisition of ViroPharma may 
adversely affect the Company’s 
financial condition and results of 
operations 
On January 24, 2014, Shire completed the 
acquisition of ViroPharma for a total cash 
consideration of approximately $4.2 billion. 
Acquisitions of this size typically entail 
various risks, which, if they materialize, may 
adversely impact the Company’s revenues, 
financial condition or results of operations. 
These risks include but are not limited to:
• failure to achieve the targeted growth and 
expected benefits of the acquisition if 
sales of ViroPharma products, including 
CINRYZE, are lower than anticipated;
WWW.SHIRE.COM ANNUAL REPORT 2013 SHIRE PLC 27
Strategic report
Governance Financial statements Other information • difficulties in integrating ViroPharma into 
Shire may lead to the combined 
company not being able to realize the 
expected operating efficiencies, cost 
savings, revenue enhancements, 
synergies or other benefits in the 
timeframe anticipated, or at all;
• undiscovered or unanticipated risks and 
liabilities, including legal and compliance 
related liabilities, may emerge after 
closing the acquisition or may be higher 
than anticipated; and
• the Company may not be able to retain 
the existing customers of ViroPharma or 
attract new customers.
Any failure to achieve the Company’s 
strategic objectives with respect to the 
ViroPharma acquisition could result in 
slower growth, higher than expected 
costs, the recording of asset impairment 
charges and other actions which could 
adversely affect the Company’s business, 
financial condition and results of 
operations. 
General risk factors related to the 
Company and to the healthcare industry
The actions of governments, industry 
regulators and the economic 
environments in which the Company 
operates may adversely affect its 
ability to develop and profitably 
market its products 
The healthcare industry is heavily 
regulated. Changes to laws or regulations 
impacting the healthcare industry, in any 
country in which the Company conducts 
its business, may adversely impact the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition or 
results of operations. For example, 
changes to the regulations relating to the 
exclusivity periods available for the 
Company’s products may allow for the 
earlier entry of generic or biosimilar 
competitor products. 
A slowdown of global economic 
growth, or continued instability of 
the Eurozone, could have negative 
consequences for the Company’s 
business and increase the risk of 
non-payment by the Company’s 
customers
Growth of the global pharmaceutical 
market has become increasingly tied to 
global economic growth. Accordingly 
a substantial and lasting slowdown of 
the global economy or major national 
economies could negatively affect growth 
in the markets in which the Company 
operates. Such a slowdown, or any 
resultant austerity measures adopted by 
governments in response to a slowdown, 
could also reduce the level of 
reimbursement that governments are 
willing and able to provide to the Company 
for its products and, as a result, adversely 
affect the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations.
Any slowing economic environment may 
also lead to financial difficulties for some 
of the Company’s significant customers. 
In such situations, the Company could 
experience delays in payment or non-
payment of amounts owed which may 
result in a rising level of contractual defaults 
by its contractual counterparties. 
The Company does business, both directly 
(with government hospitals, clinics, 
pharmacies and other agencies) and 
indirectly (through wholesalers and 
distributors), with a number of Eurozone 
governments, including the governments 
of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and 
Spain. These and other countries have 
experienced, and may continue to 
experience, declines in their 
creditworthiness. These events could 
in turn result in these countries making 
significant cuts to their public spending, 
including national healthcare budgets, in 
an attempt to manage their budget deficits, 
or could result in a greater risk of default 
or non-payment of outstanding payment 
obligations, any of which could adversely 
affect the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations.
In addition, concerns have been expressed 
for the overall stability and suitability of 
the Euro as a single currency, given the 
economic and political challenges facing 
individual Eurozone countries. Continuing 
deterioration in the creditworthiness of 
Eurozone countries, the withdrawal of one 
or more member countries from the EU, 
or the failure of the Euro as a common 
European currency could adversely affect 
the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations. 
The introduction of new products 
by competitors may impact future 
revenues
The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and 
device industries are highly competitive 
and are characterized by substantial 
investment in continuous product 
development and technological change. 
The Company’s products could, therefore, 
be rendered obsolete or uneconomic, 
through the development of new products, 
new methods of treatment, or technological 
advances in manufacturing or production 
by its competitors which may impact 
future revenues.
The successful development of 
products is highly uncertain and 
requires significant expenditures 
and time
Products that initially appear promising 
in research or development may be 
delayed or fail to reach later stages of 
development as:
• preclinical or clinical tests may show 
the product to lack safety or efficacy;
• delays may be caused by slow enrolment 
in clinical studies; regulatory requirements 
for clinical trial drug supplies; extended 
length of time to achieve study endpoints; 
additional time requirements for data 
analysis or dossier preparation; time 
required for discussions with regulatory 
agencies, including regulatory agency 
requests for additional preclinical or 
clinical data; delays at regulatory 
agencies due to staffing or resource 
limitations; analysis of or changes to 
study design; unexpected safety, efficacy, 
or manufacturing issues; delays may 
arise from shared control with 
collaborative partners in the planning and 
execution of the product development, 
scaling of the manufacturing process, 
or getting approval for manufacturing;
• manufacturing issues, pricing or 
reimbursement issues, or other factors 
may render the product economically 
unviable;
• the proprietary rights of others and their 
competing products and technologies 
may prevent the product from being 
developed or commercialized; or
• the product may fail to receive necessary 
regulatory approvals.
Success in preclinical and early clinical 
trials does not ensure that late stage 
clinical trials will be successful. Clinical 
results are frequently susceptible to varying 
interpretations that may delay, limit, or 
prevent regulatory approvals. The length of 
time necessary to complete clinical trials 
and to submit an application for marketing 
approval for a final decision by a regulatory 
authority varies significantly and may be 
difficult to predict. If the Company’s 
large-scale or late-stage clinical trials for a 
product are not successful, the Company 
Principal risks and uncertainties
continued
28 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM will not recover its substantial investments 
in that product. 
In addition, even if the products receive 
regulatory approval, they remain subject 
to ongoing regulatory requirements, 
including, for example, obligations to 
conduct additional clinical trials or other 
non-clinical testing, changes to the 
product label (which could impact its 
marketability and prospects for 
commercial success), new or revised 
requirements for manufacturing, written 
notifications to physicians, or product 
recalls or withdrawals. 
The failure of a strategic partner to 
develop and commercialize products 
could result in delays in development, 
approval or loss of revenue
The Company enters into strategic 
partnerships with other companies in 
areas such as product development, 
manufacturing, sales and marketing. In 
these partnerships, the Company is 
sometimes dependent on its partner to 
deliver results. While these partnerships 
are governed by contracts, the Company 
may not exercise direct control. If a partner 
fails to perform or experiences financial 
difficulties, the Company may suffer a 
delay in the development, a delay in the 
approval or a reduction in sales, or 
royalties of a product.
The failure to secure new products 
or compounds for development either 
through in-licensing, acquisition or 
internal research and development 
efforts, or the failure to realize 
expected benefits from acquisitions 
of businesses or products, may have 
an adverse impact on the Company’s 
future results
The Company’s future results will depend, 
to a significant extent, upon its ability to 
develop, in-license or acquire new 
products or compounds, or to acquire 
other businesses. The expected benefits 
from acquired products, compounds or 
businesses may not be realized or may 
require significantly greater resources 
and expenditure than originally anticipated. 
The failure to realize expected benefits 
from acquisitions of businesses or 
products including those resulting from 
integration into the Group, or the failure 
to develop, in-license or acquire new 
products or compounds on a commercially 
viable basis, could have a material adverse 
effect on the Company’s revenues, 
financial condition or results of operations.
The Company may fail to obtain, 
maintain, enforce or defend the 
intellectual property rights required 
to conduct its business
The Company’s success depends upon 
its ability and the ability of its partners and 
licensors to protect their intellectual 
property rights. Where possible, the 
Company’s strategy is to register 
intellectual property rights, such as patents 
and trademarks. The Company also relies 
on various trade secrets, unpatented 
know-how and technological innovations 
and contractual arrangements with third 
parties to maintain its competitive position. 
The failure to obtain, maintain, enforce or 
defend such intellectual property rights, for 
any reason, could allow third parties to 
make competing products or impact the 
Company’s ability to develop, manufacture 
and market its own products on a 
commercially viable basis, or at all, which 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition or 
results of operations.
The Company intends to enforce its patent 
rights vigorously and believes that its 
commercial partners, licensors and third 
party manufacturers intend to enforce 
vigorously those patent rights they have 
licensed to the Company. However, the 
Company’s patent rights, and patent rights 
that the Company has licensed, may not 
provide valid patent protection sufficiently 
broad to prevent any third party from 
developing, using or commercializing 
products that are similar or functionally 
equivalent to the Company’s products or 
technologies. These patent rights may be 
challenged, revoked, invalidated, infringed 
or circumvented by third parties. Laws 
relating to such rights may in future also 
be changed or withdrawn.
Additionally, the Company’s products, or 
the technologies or processes used to 
formulate or manufacture those products 
may now, or in the future, infringe the 
patent rights of third parties. It is also 
possible that third parties will obtain patent 
or other proprietary rights that might be 
necessary or useful for the development, 
manufacture or sale of the Company’s 
products. The Company may need to 
obtain licenses for intellectual property 
rights from others and may not be able to 
obtain these licenses on commercially 
reasonable terms, if at all. 
The Company also relies on trade secrets 
and other unpatented proprietary 
information, which it generally seeks to 
protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure 
agreements with its employees, consultants, 
advisors and partners. These agreements 
may not effectively prevent disclosure of 
confidential information and may not 
provide the Company with an adequate 
remedy in the event of unauthorized 
disclosure. In addition, if the Company’s 
employees, scientific consultants or 
partners develop inventions or processes 
that may be applicable to the Company’s 
products under development, such 
inventions and processes will not 
necessarily become the Company’s 
property, but may remain the property 
of those persons or their employers. 
The Company has filed applications to 
register various trademarks for use in 
connection with its products in various 
countries and also, with respect to certain 
products, relies on the trademarks of third 
parties. These trademarks may not afford 
adequate protection or the Company or 
the third parties may not have the financial 
resources to enforce their rights under 
these trademarks which may enable 
others to use the trademarks and dilute 
their value.
In the regular course of business, the 
Company is party to litigation or other 
proceedings relating to intellectual property 
rights. (See Note 19 to the consolidated 
financial statements for details of current 
patent litigation).
If a marketed product fails to work 
effectively or causes adverse side 
effects, this could result in damage 
to the Company’s reputation, the 
withdrawal of the product and legal 
action against the Company
Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable 
publicity from complaints concerning any 
of the Company’s products, or those of its 
competitors, could have an adverse effect 
on the Company’s ability to obtain or 
maintain regulatory approvals or 
successfully market its products. 
The testing, manufacturing, marketing and 
sales of pharmaceutical products and 
medical devices entails a risk of product 
liability claims, product recalls, litigation 
and associated adverse publicity. The cost 
of defending against such claims is 
expensive even when the claims are not 
merited. A successful product liability claim 
against the Company could require the 
Company to pay a substantial monetary 
award. If, in the absence of adequate 
insurance coverage, the Company does 
not have sufficient financial resources to 
satisfy a liability resulting from such a claim 
or to fund the legal defense of such a 
claim, it could become insolvent. Product 
liability insurance coverage is expensive, 
difficult to obtain and may not be available 
in the future on acceptable terms. 
Although the Company carries product 
liability insurance when available, this 
coverage may not be adequate. In 
addition, it cannot be certain that 
insurance coverage for present or future 
products will be available. Moreover, an 
adverse judgment in a product liability 
suit, even if insured or eventually 
overturned on appeal, could generate 
substantial negative publicity about the 
Company’s products and business and 
inhibit or prevent commercialization of 
other products.

Overview
• Double digit product sales growth

• Step change in operating leverage
• Expecting 2014 Non GAAP EPS 
growth at a similar level to 2013
• Repositioned for further growth
Overview
Shire is a leading specialty 
biopharmaceutical company that focuses 
on developing and marketing innovative 
specialty medicines that address 
significant unmet patient needs. The 
Company has grown through acquisition, 
completing a series of major transactions 
that have brought therapeutic, geographic 
and pipeline growth and diversification. 
The Company will continue to evaluate 
companies, products and pipeline 
opportunities that offer a good strategic 
fit and have the potential to deliver 
demonstrable value to all of the Company’s 
stakeholders: patients, physicians, policy 
makers, payors, investors and employees.
The Company’s vision is to transform the 
lives of people around the world whose 
health is impacted by rare and other 
specialized conditions, through providing 
innovative treatments. The Company will 
execute on its vision through its strategy 
and business model. For further details 
of Shire’s strategy and business model, 
refer to page 18.
34 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Through deep understanding of patients’ 
needs, the Company is able to:
• serve patients with high unmet needs 
in select, commercially attractive specialty 
therapeutic areas;
• drive optimum performance of its 
marketed products – to serve 
patients today;
• build its pipeline of innovative specialist 
treatments through both R&D and 
Business Development activities – 
to enable the Company to serve patients 
in the future.
Shire’s in-licensing and acquisition efforts 
are focused on products in specialist 
markets with strong intellectual property 
protection or other forms of market 
exclusivity and global rights. Shire believes 
that a carefully selected and balanced 
portfolio of products with strategically 
aligned and relatively small-scale sales 
forces will deliver strong results.
Substantially all of the Company’s 
revenues, expenditures and net assets 
are attributable to the R&D, manufacture, 
sale and distribution of pharmaceutical 
products within one reportable segment. 
The Company also earns royalties (where 
Shire has out-licensed products to third 
parties) which are recorded as revenues. 
Revenues are derived primarily from two 
sources – sales of the Company’s own 
products and royalties: 
• 96% (2012: 94%) of total revenues are 
derived from product sales; and
• 3% of total revenues are derived from 
royalties (2012: 5%). 
The markets in which the Company 
conducts its business are highly 
competitive and highly regulated.
There is increasing legislation both in the 
US and the rest of the world which is 
placing downward pressure on the net 
pricing of pharmaceutical products and 
medical devices. For example the US 
government passed healthcare reform 
legislation in 2010 which included an 
increase in Medicaid rebate rates and 
extended Medicaid rebates to those 
products provided through Medicaid 
managed care organizations. 
The legislation also imposed excise fees 
to be paid by both pharmaceutical 
manufacturers (from 2011) and medical 
device companies (from 2013). The CMS 
are also increasingly bundling drug 
reimbursement into procedure costs, which 
can severely decrease the reimbursement 
rates to physicians for some manufacturers’ 
drugs, biologicals and medical devices. 
The impact of these recent changes to US 
healthcare legislation, and other healthcare 
reforms in the rest of the world, has not to 
date had a material impact on the 
Company’s results of operations.
The healthcare industry is also 
experiencing:
• pressure from governments and health 
care providers to keep prices low while 
increasing access to drugs;
• increasing challenges from third party 
payors for products to have 
demonstrable clinical benefit, with pricing 
and reimbursement approval becoming 
increasingly linked to a product’s clinical 
effectiveness and impact on overall costs 
of patient care; 
• increased R&D costs, because 
development programs are typically 
larger and take longer to get approval 
from regulators; 
• challenges to existing patents from 
generic manufacturers;
• governments and healthcare systems 
favoring earlier entry of low cost generic 
drugs; and
• higher marketing costs, due to increased 
competition for market share.
Shire’s strategy has been developed to 
address these industry-wide competitive 
pressures. This strategy has resulted in a 
series of initiatives in the following areas:
Markets
Shire’s current portfolio of approved 
products focuses on the following markets: 
Rare Diseases, Neuroscience and 
Gastrointestinal (“GI”) diseases. Shire also 
has a number of marketed products for 
other therapeutic areas from which it 
generates product revenues or royalties 
from third parties. In 2013 Shire derived 
41% of product sales from Neuroscience 
products, 33% from Rare Diseases 
products, 17% from GI products and 9% 
from products addressing other 
therapeutic areas. Shire’s early stage 
research is focused on rare diseases.
Shire has grown through acquisition which 
has brought therapeutic, geographic and 
pipeline growth and diversification. For 
example the recent acquisitions of Ferrokin 
Biosciences Inc (“Ferrokin”) in 2012 and 
Lotus Tissue Repair, Premacure and 
SARcode in 2013 provide potential access 
to new markets such as ophthalmology, 
neonatology and hematology/oncology. 
The acquisition of ViroPharma, which 
closed in January 2014, expands Shire’s 
Rare Diseases portfolio including adding 
CINRYZE, a leading currently marketed 
product for the prophylactic treatment 
of HAE.
In 2013 Shire derived 30% of product sales 
from outside of the US. Shire has ongoing 
commercialization and late-stage 
development activities, which are expected 
to further supplement the diversification of 
revenues in the future, including the 
following:
• filing in 2013 of an application in Japan for 
the approval of VPRIV for the treatment of 
Gaucher disease;
• filing in 2013 of an application in Japan for 
the approval of XAGRID for the treatment 
of elevated platelet counts in at risk 
essential thrombocythemia patients; and
• INTUNIV Phase 3 clinical program to 
support submission of an MAA in the EU. 
WWW.SHIRE.COM ANNUAL REPORT 2013 SHIRE PLC 35
Strategic report
Governance Financial statements Other information R&D
The Company reorganized its R&D efforts 
in 2013, combining the R&D organizations 
of its former divisions into a single One 
Shire R&D organization focused around a 
prioritized portfolio of development and 
research programs. Shire has focused its 
R&D efforts on five therapeutic areas; Rare 
diseases, Neuroscience, GI, Hematology 
and Ophthalmology. Shire concentrates its 
resources on obtaining regulatory approval 
for later-stage pipeline products within 
these therapeutic areas and focuses its 
early stage research activities primarily in 
rare diseases.
Evidence of the successful progression of 
the late stage pipeline can be seen in the 
granting of approval and associated 
launches of the Company’s products over 
the last five years. In this time several 
products have received regulatory 
approval including: in the US, INTUNIV in 
2009, VPRIV in 2010, and FIRAZYR in 
2011; in the EU, VPRIV in 2010 and 
ELVANSE/TYVENSE in 2012; in Canada, 
VYVANSE in 2010.
Prior to the One Shire R&D reorganization, 
the Company’s management reviewed 
R&D expenditure by operating segment. 
Following the One Shire R&D 
reorganization, Shire’s management 
reviews direct costs for R&D projects by 
development phase.
Shire’s R&D costs in 2013 included 
expenditure on programs in all stages of 
development. The following table provides 
an analysis of the Company’s direct R&D 
spend categorized by development stage, 
based upon the development stage of 
each program as at December 31, 2013:
Year to December 31,
2013 
$’M
Early stage programs 102
Late stage programs 327
Currently marketed products 179
Total 608
In addition to the above, the Company 
recorded R&D employee costs of $282 
million in 2013 and other indirect R&D 
costs (comprising depreciation and 
impairment charges) of $43 million.
Patents and market exclusivity
The loss or expiration of patent protection 
or regulatory exclusivity with respect to any 
of the Company’s major products could 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
and results of operations, as generic or 
biosimilar products may enter the market. 
Companies selling generic products often 
do not need to complete extensive clinical 
studies when they seek registration of a 
generic or biosimilar product and 
accordingly, they are generally able to sell 
generic versions of the Company’s 
products at a much lower price.
As expected, in 2009 Teva and Impax 
commenced commercial shipments of 
their authorized generic versions of 
ADDERALL XR, which led to lower sales 
of branded ADDERALL XR compared 
to the period prior to the authorized 
generic launch. 
In 2011, authorized generic and generic 
versions of the Company’s CARBATROL 
and REMINYL products respectively were 
launched, which led to lower sales of these 
branded products compared to the period 
before loss of exclusivity.
Shire is engaged in various legal 
proceedings with generic manufacturers 
with respect to its VYVANSE, LIALDA and 
ADDERALL XR patents. For more detail of 
current patent litigation, see Note 19 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Business Development
Shire seeks to focus its business 
development activity on the acquisition and 
in-licensing of products and compounds 
which offer a good strategic fit and have 
the potential to deliver demonstrable value 
to all of the Company’s stakeholders. 
Recent mergers or acquisitions
On January 24, 2014 Shire completed 
the acquisition of ViroPharma which added 
a marketed product for the prophylactic 
treatment of HAE, CINRYZE, as well as 
a number of other marketed products 
and a pipeline of product candidates 
in the rare disease area.
In 2013, Shire acquired:
• SARcode which added SHP606 to the 
Shire portfolio (SHP606 is currently in 
Phase 3 development for the treatment 
of Dry Eye disease).
• Premacure which added SHP607 to the 
Shire portfolio (SHP607 is currently in 
Phase 3 for the prevention of ROP).
• Lotus Tissue Repair which added global 
rights to a protein replacement therapy 
in pre-clinical development, for the 
treatment of DEB.
In 2012, Shire acquired:
• FerroKin which added SHP602 to the 
Shire portfolio (SHP602 is in Phase 2 for 
the treatment of iron overload following 
numerous blood transfusions).
• Substantially all the assets and certain 
liabilities of Pervasis Therapeutics Inc., 
which added VASCUGEL (now SHP613) 
to the Shire portfolio (SHP613 is in Phase 
2 development for acute vascular repair).
Review of our business

36 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Collaboration and licensing activity
Shire has also entered into a number of 
collaboration and license agreements in 
recent years, including:
• a collaboration and license agreement 
with Sangamo to develop therapeutics 
for hemophilia and other monogenic 
diseases based on Sangamo’s ZFP 
technology in 2012;
• a worldwide exclusive license from IGAN 
Biosciences, Inc. (“IGAN”) to develop and 
commercialize protease-based 
therapeutics for the treatment of IgA 
nephropathy, a rare kidney disease in 
2012; and
• Shionogi co-development and co-
commercialization agreement in 2012 for 
VYVANSE and INTUNIV in Japan.
Organization and Structure 
On May 2, 2013, the Company announced 
that there would be a reorganization of the 
Company’s business to integrate its 
Specialty Pharmaceuticals (“SP”), Human 
Genetic Therapies (“HGT”) and 
Regenerative Medicine (“RM”) business 
units and reportable segments into a 
simplified One Shire organization in order 
to drive future growth and innovation. 
Consequently the SP , HGT and RM 
segments no longer exist. Shire now 
comprises a single operating and 
reportable segment. For further details see 
Note 25 “Segment reporting” to the 
consolidated financial statements.
On November 7 , 2013, the Company 
announced that, as part of the One Shire 
reorganization, the Company had 
undertaken a review of all of Shire’s 
pipeline programs to identify those projects 
that fit with Shire’s new strategic direction 
and have an acceptable likelihood of 
success. Shire’s pre-clinical investments 
will now be primarily focused on rare 
diseases, meaning that the majority of 
other pre-clinical projects will not continue. 
Several clinical programs have also been 
discontinued.
The impact of the prioritization and 
rationalization of the Company’s 
development portfolio means many of 
the R&D programs currently run from 
Basingstoke, UK will cease. Taken together 
with the overall streamlining of the R&D 
organization, this has resulted in a 
significant number of R&D roles in 
Basingstoke being eliminated and some 
positions being re-located. A small number 
of functional roles that support R&D in 
Basingstoke have also been affected. 
In addition the Company announced plans 
to re-locate its international commercial 
hub from Nyon, Switzerland to Zug, 
Switzerland. All Nyon based employees 
have been impacted by the One Shire 
transition and the move to Zug. Shire is 
planning for the new Zug office to be ready 
for occupancy in summer 2014, and will 
phase out the Nyon office over a 
reasonable period of time to enable 
employees and their families to manage 
their re-locations.
On October 22, 2013 Shire announced 
that it had decided to discontinue the 
construction of its new manufacturing 
facility in San Diego. On January 16, 2014, 
the Company sold and transferred certain 
of the assets relating to the manufacturing, 
marketing, sale and distribution of 
DERMAGRAFT to Organogenesis Inc. For 
further information, see Note 9, “Results of 
discontinued operations and assets held 
for sale” to the consolidated financial 
statements).
On January 23, 2013 Shire announced that 
it had decided to proceed with a collective 
dismissal and business closure at its site in 
Turnhout, Belgium. This decision followed 
the conclusion of an information and 
consultation process. Shire continues to 
sell RESOLOR in Europe and the supply of 
RESOLOR for patients in Europe who rely 
on the medicine will not be affected. The 
closure of the Turnhout site was completed 
during 2013.

Strategic report
Governance Financial statements Other information Results of operations for the year to 
December 31, 2013
Financial highlights for the year to 
December 31, 2013 are as follows:
Product sales from continuing operations 
in 2013 were up 12% to $4,757 million 
(2012: $4,253 million).
The strong growth in product sales from 
continuing operations was driven by 
VYVANSE (up 19% to $1,228 million), 
LIALDA/MEZAVANT (up 32% to $529 
million), VPRIV (up 12% to $343 million), 
INTUNIV (up 16% to $335 million) and 
FIRAZYR (up 102% to $235 million).
Total revenues from continuing operations 
were up 9% to $4,934 million (2012: 
$4,527 million) as the growth in product 
sales was partially offset, as expected, 
by lower royalties and other revenues 
(down 36%).
Operating income from continuing 
operations in 2013 was up 66% to 
$1,734 million (2012: $1,045 million), 
primarily due to the strong growth in 
product sales and an overall reduction in 
total operating expenses in 2013 compared 
to 2012 as the Company focuses on 
delivering efficient growth. Operating 
expenses in 2013 include a net credit of 
$159 million due to change in the fair value 
of contingent consideration liabilities, in 
particular relating to the acquisition of 
SARcode following the release of top-line 
Opus-2. Operating expenses in 2012 
include impairment charges of $197 .9 
million in 2012 related to RESOLOR 
intangible assets. Research and 
Development expenditure decreased by 
2%. SG&A expenditure decreased by 15%.
Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share 
from continuing operations increased 
74% to $2.45 (2012: $1.41) due to the 
higher operating income from continuing 
operations and a lower effective tax 
rate of 16% (2012: 20%).

The Company’s management analyzes product sales and revenue growth for certain products sold in markets outside of the US on a constant exchange rate (“CER”) 
basis, so that product sales and revenue growth can be considered excluding movements in foreign exchange rates. Product sales and revenue growth on a CER 
basis is a Non GAAP financial measure (“Non GAAP CER”), computed by comparing 2013 product sales and revenues restated using 2012 average foreign 
exchange rates to 2012 actual product sales and revenues. This Non GAAP financial measure is used by Shire’s management, and is considered to provide useful 
information to investors about the Company’s results of operations, because it facilitates an evaluation of the Company’s year-on-year performance on a comparable 
basis. Average exchange rates for the year to December 31, 2013 were $1.56:£1.00 and $1.33:€1.00 (2012: $1.59:£1.00 and $1.29:€1.00).
VYVANSE – ADHD
VYVANSE product sales grew strongly 
(+19%) in 2013 primarily as a result of price 
increases as well as higher prescription 
demand, primarily due to growth in the 
US ADHD market (+6%).
Litigation proceedings regarding VYVANSE 
are ongoing. Further information about this 
litigation can be found in Note 19 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
ELAPRASE – Hunter syndrome
Reported ELAPRASE sales growth (+10%) 
was driven by an increase in the number of 
patients on therapy.
LIALDA/MEZAVANT – Ulcerative colitis
The growth in product sales for LIALDA/
MEZAVANT (+32%) in 2013 was primarily 
driven by higher market share in the US, 
the effects of which were partially offset 
by higher sales deductions in 2013 as 
compared to 2012.
Litigation proceedings regarding LIALDA/
MEZAVANT are ongoing. Further 
information about this litigation can be 
found in Note 19 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
REPLAGAL – Fabry disease
REPLAGAL sales were down 6% 
compared to 2012 (down 4% on a Non 
GAAP CER basis) as sales in 2013 were 
impacted by foreign exchange, pricing 
pressure (primarily in Europe) and slightly 
lower volumes due to the return of 
competition to the Fabry market.
ADDERALL XR – ADHD
ADDERALL XR product sales decreased 
12% in 2013 as a result of higher sales 
deductions, partially offset by the effect of 
higher stocking in 2013 compared to 2012.
Litigation proceedings regarding 
ADDERALL XR are ongoing. Further 
information about this litigation and the 
Impax settlement, can be found in Note 19 
to the consolidated financial statements.
VPRIV – Gaucher disease
Reported VPRIV sales growth of 12% was 
driven by an increase in the number of 
patients on therapy.
INTUNIV – ADHD
INTUNIV product sales were up 16% 
compared to 2012, driven by growth in US 
prescription demand (up 9% compared to 
2012), together with price increases
1
. 
These positive factors were partially offset 
by higher sales deductions in 2013 
compared to 2012.
Further information about litigation 
proceedings regarding INTUNIV can be 
found in see Note 19 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
PENTASA – Ulcerative Colitis
PENTASA product sales were up 6% as 
the benefit of price increases was partially 
offset by higher sales deductions in 2013 
as compared to 2012.
FIRAZYR – Hereditary Angioedema
FIRAZYR sales growth (+102% compared 
to 2012) was primarily driven by the US 
market, where we continue to see both 
good growth in new patients and 
increased levels of repeat usage by 
existing patients.
1 
The actual net effect of price increases on current 
period net sales compared to the comparative 
period is difficult to quantify due to the various 
managed care rebates, Medicaid discounts, 
other discount programs in which the Company 
participates and fee for service agreements with 
wholesalers customers.

Total 153.7 241.6 -36%
Royalties from ADDERALL XR in 2013 
were significantly impacted by the lower 
royalty rate payable on sales of authorized 
generic ADDERALL XR by Impax, following 
the launch of a new generic version of 
ADDERALL XR late in the second quarter 
of 2012 as well as by Impax’s lower market 
share in 2013 versus 2012.
Royalties from 3TC and ZEFFIX in 2013 
were lower, as 2012 included one-time 
royalty income of $38 million in respect 
of prior periods due to resolution of a 
disagreement with GlaxoSmithKline and 
ViiV Healthcare.
Cost of product sales from continuing 
operations
Cost of product sales increased to $670.8 
million for the year to December 31, 2013 
(14% of product sales), up from $585.8 
million in the corresponding period in 2012 
(14% of product sales). The costs of 
product sales as a percentage of product 
sales remained broadly constant in 2013 
as compared to 2012.
For the year to December 31, 2013 cost 
of product sales included depreciation 
of $37 .5 million (2012: $29.0 million).
R&D from continuing operations
R&D expenditure decreased to $933.4 
million for the year to December 31, 2013 
(20% of product sales), compared to 
$953.0 million in the corresponding period 
in 2012 (22% of product sales). In the year 
to December 31, 2012 R&D included 
up-front payments of $13.0 million to 
Sangamo and $10.0 million to acquire the 
US rights for prucalopride (marketed in 
certain countries in Europe as RESOLOR) 
and IPR&D impairment charges in respect 
of RESOLOR of $71.2 million (2013: $19.9 
million). Excluding these costs R&D 
increased by $54.7 million or 6% in the 
year to December 31, 2013 due to the 
Company’s continuing investment in 
a number of targeted R&D programs, 
particularly new uses for LDX and other 
recently acquired assets including 
SHP606 (Lifitegrast), SHP607 (for 
the prevention of ROP) and SHP608 
(for the treatment of DEB).
R&D in the year to December 31, 2013 
included depreciation of $23.3 million 
(2012: $22.5 million).
SG&A from continuing operations
SG&A expenditure decreased to $1,651.3 
million (35% of product sales) for the year 
to December 31, 2013 from $1,948.0 
million (46% of product sales) in the 
corresponding period in 2012. In the year 
to December 31, 2012 SG&A included 
impairment charges of $126.7 million 
related to RESOLOR intangible assets and 
higher legal and litigation costs, including 
a charge of $57 .5 million in relation to the 
agreement in principle with the US 
Government. Excluding these costs SG&A 
decreased by $43.1 million or 3% due to 
the Company’s continuing focus on 
simplifying its business and delivering 
efficient growth.
For the year to December 31, 2013 SG&A 
included depreciation of $66.8 million 
(2012: $57 .5 million) and amortization of 
$152.0 million (2012: $153.6 million).
Goodwill impairment charges from 
continuing operations
In the first quarter of 2013 Shire recorded 
a goodwill impairment charge of $198.9 
million (2012: $nil) in relation to the former 
RM business unit. Following a review of 
future forecasts for the RM business unit, 
management determined in the first 
quarter of 2013 that future sales were 
expected to be lower than anticipated at 
the time of acquisition and consequently 
in accordance with US GAAP , it was 
determined that the goodwill attributable 
to the RM business unit was impaired. 
Following the divestment of DERMAGRAFT 
on January 16, 2014 the Company has 
reclassified $191.8 million of the impairment 
charge (being the portion of the RM 
reporting unit goodwill impairment charge 
that related to the DERMAGRAFT 
business) to discontinued operations.
Reorganization costs from continuing 
operations
For the year to December 31, 2013 Shire 
recorded reorganization costs of $88.2 
million (2012: $nil) comprising costs relating 
to the “One Shire” reorganization ($64.6 
million), which included involuntary 
termination benefits and other 
reorganization costs (of which 
approximately $42 million was paid in cash 
during 2013) as the Company transitions to 
a new operating structure, and the cost of 
closing the Company’s facility at Turnhout, 
Belgium ($23.6 million).
Integration and acquisition costs from 
continuing operations
For the year to December 31, 2013 
the Company recorded a net credit of 
$134.1 million in integration and acquisition 
costs (2012: $13.5 million charge). This 
comprised a credit of $159.1 million (2012: 
$9.2 million charge) relating to the change 
in fair values of contingent consideration 
liabilities, in particular relating to the 
acquisition of SARcode, partially offset by 
$25.0 million of acquisition and integration 
costs, primarily for the acquisition of 
ViroPharma and integration of SARcode 
and Lotus Tissue Repair. In 2012 integration 
and acquisition costs was primarily related 
to the acquisition of FerroKin.
Interest expense from continuing 
operations
For the year to December 31, 2013 the 
Company incurred interest expense of 
$38.1 million (2012: $38.2 million). Interest 
expense principally related to the coupon 
and amortization of issue costs on the 
Bonds which were fully redeemed or 
converted in the year, and to a lesser 
extent costs incurred on facilities related 
to the purchase of ViroPharma.
Review of our business

40 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Taxation from continuing operations
The effective tax rate was 16% (2012: 
20%).
The effective tax rate is lower than 2012 
primarily due to the impact of changes in 
the fair values of contingent consideration 
liabilities which have no tax impact and 
impairment charges in 2012 which had no 
tax benefit and were not repeated in 2013.
Discontinued operations
The loss from discontinued operations 
for the year to December 31, 2013 was 
$754.5 million net of tax (2012: $60.3 
million), which included impairment 
charges in respect of the assets held for 
sale ($636.9 million), goodwill impairment 
charges ($191.8 million), net losses on the 
discontinued DERMAGRAFT business 
($252.2 million including reorganization 
costs) and related taxes (credits) of 
$326.4 million.
Financial condition at December 31, 
2013
Cash & cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents increased 
by $757 .2 million to $2,239.4 million 
(December 31, 2012: $1,482.2 million). 
Cash generated by operating activities of 
$1,463.0 million was offset by the cost of 
acquiring SARcode, Premacure and Lotus, 
the purchase of shares (both by the 
employee benefit trust (“EBT”) and under 
the share buy-back program), other capital 
expenditure and dividend payments.
Accounts receivable, net
Accounts receivable, net increased by 
$137 .0 million to $961.2 million (December 
31, 2012: $824.2 million), primarily due to 
the increase in revenue in the year to 
December 31, 2013. Days sales 
outstanding decreased to 46 days 
(December 31, 2012: 50 days).
Other intangible assets, net
Other intangible assets increased by 
$75.5 million to $2,312.6 million (December 
31, 2012: $2,388.1 million), due to the 
IPR&D assets acquired with SARcode, 
Premacure and Lotus, offset by the 
divestment of DERMAGRAFT intangible 
assets, intangible asset amortization, 
IPR&D impairment and foreign exchange 
movements.
Convertible Bonds
As of December 31, 2013, Bondholders 
had voluntarily converted $1,099,050,000 
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds 
into 33,806,464 fully paid Ordinary Shares. 
The remaining outstanding Bonds in an 
aggregate principle amount of $950,000 
were redeemed pursuant to the Optional 
Redemption Notice issued on November 
26, 2013.
Non-current deferred tax liabilities
Non-current deferred tax liabilities 
increased by $39.8 million to $560.6 million 
(December 31, 2012: $520.8 million), 
primarily due to deferred tax liabilities 
arising on the IPR&D assets acquired 
with SARcode and Lotus offset by a 
reduction in deferred tax liabilities arising 
from the impairment of DERMAGRAFT 
intangible assets.
Other non-current liabilities
Other non-current liabilities increased by 
$346.9 million to $588.5 million (December 
31, 2012: $241.6 million) primarily due to 
the recognition of non-current contingent 
consideration payable related to the 
SARcode, Premacure and Lotus business 
combinations.
Liquidity and capital resources
General
The Company’s funding requirements 
depend on a number of factors, including 
the timing and extent of its development 
programs; corporate, business and 
product acquisitions; the level of resources 
required for the expansion of certain 
manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
as the product base expands; increases 
in accounts receivable and inventory which 
may arise with any increase in product 
sales; competitive and technological 
developments; the timing and cost of 
obtaining required regulatory approvals 
for new products; the timing and quantum 
of milestone payments on collaborative 
projects; the timing and quantum of tax 
and dividend payments; the timing and 
quantum of purchases by the EBT of 
Shire shares in the market to satisfy 
awards granted under Shire’s employee 
share plans; and the amount of cash 
generated from sales of Shire’s products 
and royalty receipts.
An important part of Shire’s business 
strategy is to protect its products and 
technologies through the use of patents, 
proprietary technologies and trademarks, 
to the extent available. The Company 
intends to defend its intellectual property 
and as a result may need cash for funding 
the cost of litigation.
The Company finances its activities 
through cash generated from operating 
activities; credit facilities; private and 
public offerings of equity and debt 
securities; and the proceeds of asset 
or investment disposals.
Shire’s balance sheet includes $2,239.4 
million of cash and cash equivalents at 
December 31, 2013. Shire has a revolving 
credit facility of $1,200 million which 
matures in 2015, of which $700 million 
was utilized on January 24, 2014 to 
partially fund the ViroPharma acquisition 
(See section “Term Loan”, “Facilities 
Agreement” for further details). In addition 
in connection with its acquisition of 
ViroPharma, Shire entered into a $2.60 
billion Facilities Agreement which was 
subsequently reduced to $1.40 billion, 
and comprises of two credit facilities: 
(i) a $0.55 billion term loan facility, of which 
$0.35 billion was utilized on January 24, 
2014 and (ii) a $0.85 billion term loan 
facility, fully utilized on January 24, 2014 
(See section “Term Loan Agreement” for 
further details). Further on January 24, 
2014 ViroPharma commenced a tender 
offer to repurchase, at the option of each 
holder, any and all of ViroPharma’s 
outstanding 2.00% Convertible Senior 
Notes Due 2017 (the “Convertible Notes”) 
and notified the holders of their separate 
right to convert the Convertible Notes. The 
repurchase and payment for conversion of 
the Convertible Notes forms part of the 
cash consideration payable to ViroPharma.
Shire 2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014
On May 9, 2007 Shire issued $1,100 million 
in principal amount of Bonds. As of 
December 31, 2013 all of the Bonds 
had been converted or redeemed as 
described below.
WWW.SHIRE.COM ANNUAL REPORT 2013 SHIRE PLC 41
Strategic report
Governance Financial statements Other information On November 26, 2013, Shire issued an 
optional redemption notice under the Trust 
Deed to the holders of the Bonds. The 
aggregate outstanding principal amount 
of Bonds on November 25, 2013, the last 
practicable date prior to the date of the 
optional redemption notice, was 
$1,075,070,000. The last day on which 
bondholders were able to exercise their 
conversion rights was December 13, 2013. 
Those Bonds which were not voluntarily 
converted were redeemed by the 
Company on December 27 , 2013 at par 
together with interest accrued to that date. 
As of December 31, 2013, Bonds in an 
aggregate principal amount of the 
$1,099,050,000 had been voluntarily 
converted into 33,806,464 fully paid 
Ordinary Shares at a conversion price 
of US$32.51 per Ordinary Share, in the 
capital of the Company, with par value 
of £0.05 each. The remaining outstanding 
Bonds in an aggregate principle amount 
of $950,000 were redeemed pursuant 
to the Optional Redemption Notice issued 
on November 26, 2013. Following the 
redemption of all the outstanding Bonds, 
the Company cancelled the listing of 
the Bonds on the Official List maintained 
by the UK Listing Authority and the 
admission to trading of the Bonds 
on the Professional Securities Market 
of the London Stock Exchange.
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement
On November 23, 2010, the Company 
entered into a committed multicurrency 
revolving and swingline facilities agreement 
with a number of financial institutions, for 
which Abbey National Treasury Services 
Plc (trading as Santander Global Banking 
and Markets), Bank of America Securities 
Limited, Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global 
Markets Limited, Lloyds TSB Bank plc 
and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc 
acted as mandated lead arrangers and 
bookrunners (the “RCF”). The RCF is for 
an aggregate amount of $1,200 million 
and cancelled the Company’s then 
existing committed revolving credit facility. 
The RCF, which includes a $250 million 
swingline facility, may be used for general 
corporate purposes and matures on 
November 23, 2015.
The interest rate on each loan drawn under 
the RCF for each interest period is the 
percentage rate per annum which is the 
aggregate of the applicable margin 
(ranging from 0.90 to 2.25 per cent per 
annum) and LIBOR for the applicable 
currency and interest period. Shire also 
pays a commitment fee on undrawn 
amounts at 35 per cent per annum 
of the applicable margin.
Under the RCF it is required that (i) Shire’s 
ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA (as defined 
within the RCF agreement) does not 
exceed 3.5 to 1 for either the 12 month 
period ending December 31 or June 30 
unless Shire has exercised its option 
(which is subject to certain conditions) to 
increase it to 4.0 to 1 for two consecutive 
testing dates; (ii) the ratio of EBITDA to Net 
Interest (as defined in the RCF agreement) 
must not be less than 4.0 to 1, for either 
the 12 month period ending December 31 
or June 30, and (iii) additional limitations on 
the creation of liens, disposal of assets, 
incurrence of indebtedness, making of 
loans, giving of guarantees and granting 
security over assets. These financial and 
operating covenants have not had, and are 
not expected to have, an effect on the 
Company’s financial position and liquidity.
On entering into the RCF in November 
2010 the Company paid arrangement 
costs of $8.0 million, which have been 
recorded as deferred charges, with 
amortization of these costs to the 
Company’s income statement over the 
contractual term of the RCF.
The availability of loans under the new 
RCF is subject to customary conditions.
Term Loan Agreement
On November 11, 2013, Shire entered into 
a $2.60 billion Facilities Agreement with, 
among others, Morgan Stanley Bank 
International Limited (acting as lead 
arranger and agent) (the “Facilities 
Agreement”). The Facilities Agreement 
comprises two credit facilities: (i) a $1.75 
billion term loan facility and (ii) a $0.85 
billion term loan facility.
On December 13, 2013 and on February 
21, 2014, the Company cancelled part of 
the $2.60 billion term loan facility. The 
revised Facilities Agreement of $1.40 billion 
now comprises two credit facilities: (i) a 
$0.55 billion term loan facility and (ii) a 
$0.85 billion term loan facility. All other 
terms and conditions remain unchanged.
The $0.55 billion term loan facility, which 
matures on November 10, 2014, may be 
used only to finance the purchase price 
payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition 
of ViroPharma (including certain related 
costs) and for the redemption of Shire’s 
Bonds. Shire has the option to extend 
the maturity of the $0.55 billion term loan 
facility once by a further 364 days.
The $0.85 billion term loan facility, which 
matures on November 11, 2015, may 
be used only to finance the purchase 
price payable in respect of Shire’s 
acquisition of ViroPharma (including 
certain related costs).
Interest on any loans made under the 
facilities will be payable on the last day 
of each interest period, which may be 
one week or one, two, three or six months 
at the election of Shire, or as otherwise 
agreed with the lenders. The interest rate 
applicable to the $0.55 billion term loan 
facility is LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum 
and increases by 0.25% per annum on 
August 11, 2014 and on three-month 
intervals thereafter.
The interest rate applicable to the 
$0.85 billion term loan facility commenced 
at LIBOR plus 1.15% per annum until 
delivery of the compliance certificate for 
the year ending December 31, 2013 and 
thereafter is subject to change depending 
upon the prevailing ratio of Net Debt to 
EBITDA of the Group (each as defined in 
the Facilities Agreement), in respect of the 
most recently completed financial year or 
financial half year.
Review of our business
continued
42 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Shire shall also pay a commitment fee on 
the available but unutilized commitments 
under the $0.55 billion term loan facility 
and the $0.85 billion term loan facility for 
the availability period applicable to each 
facility. With effect from first utilization, the 
commitment fee rate will be 35% of the 
applicable margin. Before first utilization, 
the commitment fee rate will increase in 
stages from 0% to 35% of the applicable 
margin over a period of 3 months.
The Facilities Agreement includes 
customary representations and warranties, 
covenants and events of default, including 
requirements that the ratio of Net Debt to 
EBITDA of the Group (each as defined in 
the Facilities Agreement) must not, at any 
time, exceed 3.5:1 for the Relevant Period 
(as defined in the Facilities Agreement), 
except that following certain acquisitions, 
including the Viropharma acquisition, Shire 
may elect to increase the ratio to 4.0:1 in 
the relevant period in which the acquisition 
was completed and the immediately 
following relevant period. In addition, for 
each 12-month period ending December 
31 or June 30, the ratio of EBITDA of the 
Group to Net Interest (each as defined in 
the Facilities Agreement) must not be less 
than 4.0:1.
The Facilities Agreement restricts (subject 
to certain covenants) Shire’s ability to incur 
additional financial indebtedness, grant 
security over its assets or provide or 
guarantee loans. Further, any lender may 
require mandatory prepayment of its 
participation if there is a change of control 
of Shire. In addition, in certain 
circumstances, the net proceeds of certain 
shares, undertakings or business 
disposals by Shire must be applied 
towards the mandatory prepayment of the 
facilities, subject to certain exceptions.
Events of default under the facilities 
include: (i) non-payment of any amounts 
due under the facilities, (ii) failure to satisfy 
any financial covenants, (iii) material 
misrepresentation in any of the finance 
documents, (iv) failure to pay, or certain 
other defaults, under other financial 
indebtedness, (v) certain insolvency events 
or proceedings, (vi) material adverse 
changes in the business, operations, 
assets or financial condition of Shire and 
its subsidiaries, (vii) if it becomes unlawful 
for Shire or any of its subsidiaries that are 
parties to the Facilities Agreement to 
perform their obligations or (viii) if Shire or 
any subsidiary of Shire which is a party to 
the Facilities Agreement repudiates the 
Facilities Agreement or any other finance 
document, among others.
The Facilities Agreement is governed by 
English law.
Financing
Shire anticipates that its operating cash 
flow together with available cash, cash 
equivalents and, the RCF will be sufficient 
to meet its anticipated future operating 
expenses, capital expenditures, tax and 
interest payments, lease obligations and 
milestone payments as they become due 
over the next twelve months.
Shire’s existing cash, the Facilities 
Agreement and the RCF are sufficient to 
finance the acquisition of ViroPharma.
If the Company decides to acquire other 
businesses in addition to ViroPharma, it 
expects to fund these acquisitions from 
cash resources, the RCF and possibly 
through new borrowings or the issuance 
of new equity if necessary.
Share buy-back program
Shire has a strong balance sheet and 
continued robust cash generation, and 
considers efficient use of capital on behalf 
of shareholders an important objective. 
Therefore, during the year to December 31, 
2012 the Company commenced a share 
buy-back program, for the purpose of 
returning funds to shareholders, of up 
to $500 million through both direct 
purchases of Ordinary Shares and 
through the purchase of Ordinary Shares 
underlying ADRs.
During the year ended December 31, 2013, 
the Company made on-market repurchases 
totaling 6,191,965 Ordinary Shares at a 
cost of $193 million (excluding transaction 
costs). The program covers purchases of 
Ordinary Shares for cancellation or to be 
held as treasury shares, in accordance 
with the authority renewed by shareholders 
at the Company’s AGM on April 30, 2013 
when the Company was authorized to 
make market purchases of up to 
55,741,587 of its own Ordinary Shares.
On November 11, 2013, contemporaneous 
with Shire’s announcement of its 
acquisition of ViroPharma, the Company’s 
share buyback program was terminated. 
Since the inception of the share buyback 
program the Company had purchased 
$300 million of Ordinary Shares and 
Ordinary Shares underlying ADRs.

Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held by foreign subsidiaries (i.e, those 
subsidiaries incorporated outside of Jersey, Channel Islands, the jurisdiction of incorporation of Shire plc, 
Shire’s holding company). The amount of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries has not 
had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company’s liquidity and capital resources.
 Net cash is a Non GAAP measure. The Company believes that Net cash is a useful measure as it indicates 
the level of borrowings after taking account the cash and cash equivalents that could be utilized to pay down 
the outstanding borrowings.

Net cash provided by operating activities 
for the year to December 31, 2013 
increased by $80.1 million or 6% to 
$1,463.0 million (2012: $1,382.9 million) as 
higher cash receipts from gross product 
sales were more than offset by payments 
made in relation to the One Shire 
reorganization (approximately $42 million), 
costs incurred on the closure of Shire’s 
facility at Turnhout in Belgium 
(approximately $24 million) and the 
payment to settle the litigation with Impax 
($48 million) (see Note 19 for details).

for the year to December 31, 2012 
increased by $309.3 million or 29% to 
$1,382.9 million (2011: $1,073.6 million) as 
higher cash receipts from gross product 
sales and improved cash collections for 
aged European receivables more than 
offset higher operating expenses and sales 
deduction payments in the year.
Net cash used in investing activities was 
$360.9 million in the year to December 31, 
2013, principally relating to the cash paid 
(net of cash acquired) for the acquisitions 
of SARcode, Premacure and Lotus Tissue 
Repair and for purchases of PP&E.
Net cash used in investing activities was 
$271.0 million in the year to December 31, 
2012, principally relating to the expenditure 
on property, plant and equipment of 
$149.6 million and the cash paid (net of 
cash acquired) of $97 .0 million for the 
acquisition of FerroKin ($94.5 million) and 
Pervasis ($2.5 million). Capital expenditure 
on property, plant and equipment primarily 
includes expenditure of $65.0 million on 
computer software and hardware due to 
SAP upgrade and construction and 
leasehold improvements at different 
Company sites of $45.2 million.
Net cash used in financing activities was 
$344.6 million for the year to December 31, 
2013, principally due to the purchase of 
shares under the share buy-back program, 
purchase of shares by the EBT and the 
dividend payment.
Net cash used in financing activities was 
$244.3 million for the year to December 31, 
2012, principally due to the purchase of 
shares by the EBT, the purchase of shares

dividend payments, offset by the tax 
benefit associated with the exercise of 
stock options.
Outstanding letters of credit
At December 31, 2013, the Company had 
irrevocable standby letters of credit and 
guarantees with various banks totaling 
$51.3 million, providing security for the 
Company’s performance of various 
obligations. These obligations are primarily 
in respect of the recoverability of insurance

equipment), including open purchase 
orders, that are enforceable and legally 
binding and that specify all significant 
terms. Shire expects to fund these 
commitments with cash flows from 
operating activities.
(iii) Unrecognized tax benefits and 
associated interest and penalties of $115.7 
million are included within payments due in 
one to three years.
The contractual obligations table above 
does not include certain milestones and 
other contractual commitments where 
payment is contingent upon the 
occurrence of events which are yet to

significant of the Company’s milestone and 
contractual commitments which are 
contingent on the occurrence of future 
events are as follows:
(i) Research Collaboration with Santaris 
Pharma A/S (“Santaris”) on Locked Nucleic 
Acid (“LNA”) Drug Platform
On August 24, 2009, Shire announced that 
it had entered into a research collaboration 
with Santaris, to develop its proprietary 
LNA technology in a range of rare 
diseases. LNA technology has the benefit 
of shortened target validation and proof of 
concept, potentially increasing the speed 
and lowering the cost of development. As 
part of the joint research project Santaris 
will design, develop and deliver pre-clinical 
LNA oligonucleotides for Shire-selected 
orphan disease targets, and Shire will have 
the exclusive right to further develop and 
commercialize these candidate 
compounds on a worldwide basis.

Strategic report
Governance Financial statements Other information Off-balance sheet arrangements
There are no off-balance sheet 
arrangements, aside from the 
collaborations containing contractual 
commitments and milestones which are 
contingent on future events as outlined 
above, that have, or are reasonably likely 
to have, a current or future material effect 
on the Company’s financial condition, 
revenues or expenses, results of 
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures 
or capital resources.
Foreign currency fluctuations
A number of the Company’s subsidiaries 
have a functional currency other than the 
US Dollar. As such, the consolidated 
financial results are subject to fluctuations 
in exchange rates, particularly in the Euro, 
Swiss Franc and Pound Sterling against 
the US Dollar.
The accumulated foreign currency 
translation differences at December 31, 
2013 of $25.3 million are reported within 
accumulated other comprehensive income 
in the consolidated balance sheet and 
foreign exchange losses for the year to 
December 31, 2013 of $8.7 million are 
reported in the consolidated statements 
of income.
At December 31, 2013, the Company had 
outstanding swap and forward foreign 
exchange contracts to manage the 
currency risk associated with 
intercompany transactions. At December 
31, 2013 the fair value of these contracts 
was a net asset of $1.2 million.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially 
expose Shire to concentrations of credit 
risk consist primarily of short term cash 
investments, derivative contracts and trade 
accounts receivable (from product sales 
and from third parties from which the 
Company receives royalties). Cash is 
invested in short term money market 
instruments, including money market and 
liquidity funds and bank term deposits. 
The money market and liquidity funds in 
which Shire invests are all triple A rated by 
both Standard and Poor’s and by Moody’s 
credit rating agencies.
The Company is exposed to the credit risk 
of the counterparties with which it enters 
into derivative instruments. The Company 
limits this exposure through a system of 
internal credit limits which vary according 
to ratings assigned to the counterparties 
by the major rating agencies. The internal 
credit limits are approved by the Board 
and exposure against these limits is 
monitored by the corporate treasury 
function. The counterparties to these 
derivatives contracts are major 
international financial institutions.
The Company’s revenues from product 
sales in the US are mainly governed by 
agreements with major pharmaceutical 
wholesalers and relationships with other 
pharmaceutical distributors and retail 
pharmacy chains. For the year to 
December 31, 2013 there were three 
customers in the US that accounted for 
52% of the Company’s product sales. 
However, such customers typically have 
significant cash resources and as such 
the risk from concentration of credit is 
considered acceptable. The Company has 
taken positive steps to manage any credit 
risk associated with these transactions and 
operates clearly defined credit evaluation 
procedures. However, an inability of one or 
more of these wholesalers to honor their 
debts to the Company could have an 
adverse effect on Company’s financial 
condition and results of operations.
A substantial portion of the Company’s 
accounts receivable in countries outside of 
the United States is derived from product 
sales to government-owned or 
government-supported healthcare 
providers. The Company’s recovery of 
these accounts receivable is therefore 
dependent upon the financial stability and 
creditworthiness of the relevant 
governments. In recent years the 
creditworthiness and general economic 
condition of a number of Eurozone 
countries (including Greece, Italy, Portugal 
and Spain (the “Relevant Countries”)) has 
deteriorated. As a result, in some of these 
countries the Company is experiencing 
delays in the remittance of receivables due 
from government-owned or government-
supported healthcare providers. 
The Company continued to receive 
remittances in relation to government-
owned or government-supported 
healthcare providers in all the Relevant 
Countries in the year to December 31, 
2013, including receipts of $116.8 million 
and $144.7 million in respect of Spanish 
and Italian receivables, respectively.
To date the Company has not incurred 
significant losses on accounts receivable in 
the Relevant Countries, and continues to 
consider that such accounts receivable are 
recoverable. The Company will continue to 
evaluate all its accounts receivable for 
potential collection risks and has made 
provision for amounts where collection is 
considered to be doubtful. If the financial 
condition of the Relevant Countries or 
other Eurozone countries suffer significant 
deterioration, such that their ability to make 
payments becomes uncertain, or if one 
or more Eurozone member countries 
withdraws from the Euro, additional 
allowances for doubtful accounts may 
be required, and losses may be incurred, 
in future periods. Any such loss could 
have an adverse effect on the Company’s 
financial condition and results of operations.
Inflation
Although at reduced levels in recent years, 
inflation continues to apply upward 
pressure on the cost of goods and 
services which are used in the business. 
However, the Company believes that the 
net effect of inflation on its revenues and 
operations has been minimal during the 
past three years.

46 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Treasury policies and organization
The Company’s principal treasury 
operations are coordinated by its corporate 
treasury function. All treasury operations 
are conducted within a framework of 
policies and procedures approved annually 
by the Board of Directors. As a matter of 
policy, the Company does not undertake 
speculative transactions that would 
increase its credit, currency or interest 
rate exposure.
Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate 
risk on its $1,200 million RCF, its $0.55 
billion term loan facility, its $0.85 billion 
term loan facility (the “Facilities”), to the 
extent the Facilities are utilized, restricted 
cash, cash and cash equivalents and on 
foreign exchange contracts on which 
interest is at floating rates. This exposure is 
primarily to US Dollar, Pounds Sterling, 
Euro and Canadian Dollar interest rates. 
The Company has evaluated the interest 
rate risk on its debt facilities and considers 
the floating rate as appropriate. As the 
Company maintains all of its cash, liquid 
investments and foreign exchange 
contracts on a short term basis for liquidity 
purposes, this risk is not actively managed. 
In the year to December 31, 2013 the 
average interest rate received on cash and 
liquid investments was less than 1% per 
annum. The largest proportion of these 
cash and liquid investments was in US 
dollar money market and liquidity funds.  
At December 31, 2013 the Facilities were 
not utilized.
No derivative instruments were entered 
into during the year to December 31, 2013 
to manage interest rate exposure. The 
Company continues to review its interest 
rate risk and the policies in place to 
manage the risk.
Foreign exchange risk
The Company trades in numerous 
countries and as a consequence has 
transactional and translational foreign 
exchange exposures.
Transactional exposure arises where 
transactions occur in currencies different 
to the functional currency of the relevant 
subsidiary. The main trading currencies of 
the Company are the US Dollar, Pounds 
Sterling, Swiss Franc and the Euro. It is the 
Company’s policy that these exposures 
are minimized to the extent practicable 
by denominating transactions in the 
subsidiary’s functional currency.
Where significant exposures remain, the 
Company uses foreign exchange contracts 
(being spot, forward and swap contracts) 
to manage the exposure for balance sheet 
assets and liabilities that are denominated 
in currencies different to the functional 
currency of the relevant subsidiary. These 
assets and liabilities relate predominantly 
to intercompany financing. The foreign 
exchange contracts have not been 
designated as hedging instruments. 
Cash flows from derivative instruments 
are presented within net cash provided 
by operating activities in the consolidated 
cash flow statement, unless the derivative 
instruments are economically hedging 
specific investing or financing activities.
Translational foreign exchange exposure 
arises on the translation into US Dollars of 
the financial statements of non-US Dollar 
functional subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2013, the Company had 
29 swap and forward foreign exchange 
contracts outstanding to manage currency 
risk. The swap and forward contracts 
mature within 90 days. The Company 
did not have credit risk related contingent 
features or collateral linked to the 
derivatives. The Company has master 
netting agreements with a number of 
counterparties to these foreign exchange 
contracts and on the occurrence of 
specified events, the Company has the 
ability to terminate contracts and settle 
them with a net payment by one party to 
the other. The Company has elected to 
present derivative assets and derivative 
liabilities on a gross basis in the 
consolidated balance sheet. As at 
December 31, 2013 the potential effect of 
rights of set off associated with the foreign 
exchange contracts would be an offset to 
both assets and liabilities of $0.7 million, 
resulting in net derivative assets and 
derivative liabilities of $3.3 million and 
$2.1 million, respectively. Further details 
are included on the next page.

countries and in the year to December 31, 
2013 received $284.9 million in settlement 
of accounts receivable in the relevant 
countries – $9.5 million was from Greece; 
$145.0 million from Italy; $13.4 million from 
Portugal and $117 .0 million from Spain.
To date the Company has not incurred 
significant losses on the accounts 
receivable in the relevant countries, 
and continues to consider that such 
accounts receivable are recoverable.
Other than the accounts receivable  
from government-owned or supported 
healthcare providers outlined above,  
the Company does not hold any other 
government debt from the relevant 
countries. Additionally the Company  
does not consider it is currently exposed  
to significant sovereign credit risk outside 
of the relevant countries.
The Company continues to evaluate all its 
accounts receivable for potential collection 
risks and has made provision for amounts 
where collection is considered to be 
doubtful. If the financial condition of the 
relevant countries or other Eurozone 
countries suffer significant deterioration, 
such that their ability to make payments 
becomes uncertain, or if one or more 
Eurozone member countries withdraws 
from the Euro, additional allowances for 
doubtful accounts may be required, and 
losses may be incurred, in future periods.

distinctive qualities of our treatments, we 
strive for excellence throughout our business. 
Our work exploring how LDX, the active 
ingredient in VYVANSE, can be used to 
treat BED is a great example of how we aim 
to excel – by building on our strengths and, 
as ever, focusing on people with high unmet 
specialist needs. 
We’re working on extending LDX to treat adults with BED 
1 BED in adults is a huge unmet need and according to 
physicians there are few treatments of any kind available  
2 The seriousness of the disorder is increasingly 
acknowledged in the physician community 
3 The market is ready for a safe and effective treatment 
 
4 Estimates suggest that there are around 3 million 
adults with BED in the US and about 9 out of 10 
of them are undiagnosed
5 Of those that are diagnosed not all are being treated 
 
6 Health care practitioners are generally dissatisfied with 
the mixed results from the current treatment options 
that include counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy, 
or off label anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs

Matthew Emmens
Chairman
Dear Shareholder
Shire’s governance structure 
is central to the operation of 
the Board and the wider Group, 
and is therefore critical to the 
delivery of sustainable growth 
for our shareholders and other 
stakeholders. This report 
outlines our approach to 
governance and Shire’s 
application of the main 
principles outlined in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.

AR2013.SHIRE.COM
Having been a member of the Board since 
2003, serving as Chairman since 2008, 
the Board and I agreed in 2013 that it 
was timely to consider my succession. 
Following a rigorous selection process, 
the Board decided in January that Susan 
Kilsby would succeed me as Chairman 
of the Board and that this would take 
effect from the conclusion of Shire’s 2014 
Annual General Meeting. I am delighted 
with this decision. Having worked with 
Susan on the Board over the past few 
years, I believe she is the ideal Chairman 
for Shire as the Company embarks upon 
a new era of growth.
As part of our continued review of 
the composition of the Board and its 
committees, a number of other changes 
have also been effected. Dominic 
Blakemore was appointed as a Non-
Executive Director and member of the 
Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee 
with effect from January 1, 2014. Dominic 
brings to the Board, amongst other things, 
his strategic and financial experience. 
Detail on the selection process is outlined 
on page 62 of this report. Susan Kilsby 
succeeded David Kappler as Chairman of 
the Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee 
and Dr. David Ginsburg was appointed as 
Chairman of the Science & Technology 
Committee, with effect from May 2, 2013. 
Susan Kilsby was also appointed as a 
member of the Nomination Committee 
with effect from February 1, 2014. 
Upon Susan’s appointment as Chairman 
of the Board, she will be succeeded 
by Dominic as Chairman of the Audit, 
Compliance & Risk Committee. In addition, 
Graham Hetherington will step down as 
Chief Financial Officer on March 1, 2014, 
to be succeeded on an interim basis by 
James Bowling, Shire’s Group Financial 
Controller. A search for Graham’s 
successor is currently underway.
The annual Board performance evaluation 
was conducted internally in 2013 and 
concluded that the individual members 
of the Board remain effective in their 
ability to undertake their respective roles. 
Disclosure of the process and outcomes 
can be found on page 57 of this report.
In leaving the Company I am pleased to 
see that the Board and its committees 
have the appropriate balance of skills 
and experience to lead Shire through 
its next phase of growth. The refreshed 
governance structure brought about 
through the implementation of the One 
Shire operating model sees Shire well 
placed to achieve continued enhanced 
value for shareholders and other 
stakeholders.
54 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM UK Corporate Governance Code
This report seeks to demonstrate how 
the main principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012 (the “Governance 
Code”) were applied throughout the 
financial year ended December 31, 2013. 
The Board is of the opinion that, during 
this period, the Company complied with 
the provisions of the Governance Code. 
Published by the Financial Reporting 
Council, the Governance Code is 
publicly available at www.frc.org.uk.
Leadership
Role of the Board
The principal purpose of the Board is 
to provide leadership to the Company 
in a manner that promotes its success, 
thereby maximizing value for stakeholders 
including shareholders. The Board is 
responsible for determining the Group’s 
strategy, as well as overseeing its 
implementation by management. In 
addition, the Board has oversight of all 
material matters impacting the Company 
and its operations including its key policies, 
material financial matters, acquisitions, 
the risks that the Company faces and the 
actions taken to mitigate these, and 
succession planning.
Chairman’s succession
Given that Matthew Emmens has been 
a member of Shire’s Board since 2003, 
holding the position of Chairman since 
2008, both he and the Board agreed in 
2013 that it was timely to consider the 
skills and experience that would be sought 
in his successor as Chairman. A special 
committee of the Board, chaired by the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director, was established to progress this. 
In determining the skills and experience 
sought, the special committee took 
account of, amongst other things, the 
Company’s strategy, its operations and 
the diversity and expertise currently on 
the Board. A process was followed which 
included meetings with interested existing 
Board members and external candidates, 
and was assisted by Odgers Berndtson 
and Catalyst Advisors. Following 
consideration of the candidates, the 
Board decided in January that Susan 
Kilsby would be appointed as Matthew 
Emmens’ successor and that this would 
take effect from the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2014. 
Ms Kilsby was also appointed to the 
Nomination Committee on February 1, 
2014. Upon becoming Chairman of 
the Company she will step down as 
Chairman of the Audit, Compliance & 
Risk Committee, to be succeeded by 
Mr. Blakemore.
Division of responsibilities
The Board comprises the Chairman, 
eight other Non-Executive Directors, 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer. The Executive Directors 
together with the Executive Committee 
are responsible for business operations. 
The Non-Executive Directors are charged 
with exercising independent judgment 
in Board deliberations and ensuring 
the effective performance by senior 
management of their responsibilities.
The Chairman, Deputy Chairman, 
Senior Independent Director and Chief 
Executive Officer have distinctly different 
functions which are defined in writing 
and have been approved by the Board. 
These are summarised as follows:
• Chairman 
As Chairman it is Matthew Emmens’ 
primary responsibility to provide 
leadership to the Board; ensuring that it 
operates effectively. This is achieved in 
part through his promotion of a culture 
that fosters open and robust debate, 
and that in turn contributes to positive 
engagement and constructive dialog in 
meetings. Matthew is also responsible 
for ensuring effective communications 
between the Board and shareholders. 
Susan Kilsby will succeed Matthew as 
Chairman on April 29, 2014.
• Deputy Chairman 
As Deputy Chairman David Kappler is 
responsible for supporting, and 
deputising for, the Chairman as required.
• Senior Independent Director 
As Senior Independent Director it is 
David Kappler’s responsibility to provide 
a sounding board for the Chairman and 
to serve as a trusted intermediary for the 
other Directors. He is also responsible for 
leading meetings of the Non-Executive 
Directors in the absence of the 
Chairman, and for consulting with 
shareholders when communication with 
the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer 
would be inappropriate.
• Chief Executive Officer 
Flemming Ornskov’s principal 
responsibility as Chief Executive Officer 
is to manage Shire’s day-to-day business. 
He is accountable to the Board for the 
development of the Company and its 
operations; having due regard for 
objectives, strategy and policies set 
forth by the Board and its committees.
Full details of the aforementioned roles

As agreed in advance by the Board, David Kappler was absent from one scheduled Board meeting as 
a result of external commitments.
8 
David Stout was absent from one ad hoc Board meeting which, at short notice, was timed to facilitate 
maximum possible Board attendance.
9 
Angus Russell stood down as Chief Executive Officer on April 30, 2013.
Only members of the Board have 
entitlement to attend Board meetings, 
however, during the year, additional 
individuals attended by invitation. The 
General Counsel and Company Secretary 
attended all meetings of the Board, with 
regular additional attendees including the 
Chief Compliance and Risk Officer and the 
Head of Business Development. External 
professional advisors also attended 
meetings when necessary. At the 
conclusion of each Board meeting the 
Non-Executive Directors met without the 
Executive Directors being present, following 
which a meeting of the Non-Executive 
Directors was held in the absence of the 
Chairman. Typically, matters considered 
by the Board were those reserved for 
their judgment and decision, as defined 
in the Board Reserve Powers, although 
supplementary matters were considered 
by the Board as circumstances required. 
The Board Reserve Powers are available 
on the Company’s website.
The agenda for Board meetings is 
determined by the Chairman in collaboration 
with the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Company Secretary. The Chairman also 
has the responsibility of providing all 
necessary materials to each of the Directors, 
in respect of which he is supported by the 
Company Secretary and other members 
of management. At Board meetings the 
Chairman encourages debate with a view to 
achieving resolution by consensus, however, 
decisions are taken by majority vote when 
this is unable to be achieved, with the 
Chairman having a casting vote in the 
case of an equality of votes.
Board effectiveness
Effective leadership is integral to the 
execution of the Company’s strategy and 
therefore to the fulfillment of its objectives. 
The Board is committed to providing the 
Company with the highest caliber of 
governance and in doing so promoting 
the Company’s success for the benefit 
of all stakeholders.
Composition and diversity
During the year the Board reviewed the 
independence of the Non-Executive 
Directors, other than the Chairman, in 
accordance with the factors set forth for 
consideration in the Governance Code 
and determined that each continued to 
be independent. The Governance Code 
suggests that a length of service of more 
than nine years is relevant to the 
determination of a Director’s independence. 
Therefore, in considering the independence 
of Mr. Kappler, the Board gave particular 
regard to the fact that at the time of the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting in April 
2014 he will have served as a member of the 
Board for a period of ten years. Despite his 
length of tenure, the Board concluded that 
Mr. Kappler remained independent in 
character and judgment; demonstrating 
continued effective performance and 
commitment to his role. Details of the Board 
performance evaluation, which included 
the consideration of Non-Executive Director 
independence, are available on page 57 . 
In addition, the Board regards each of its 
members as possessing the skills, 
knowledge and experience necessary for 
it to function effectively, with its composition 
commensurate to the complexity of the 
business. Board members’ biographical 
information can be found on pages 52 
and 53.
The Board recognizes the inherent value of 
diversity at all levels within the Group and 
is therefore committed to its furtherance. 
In 2012 Shire’s Board Diversity Policy was 
implemented which acknowledges that 
the Company, its shareholders and other 
stakeholders are best served by a Board 
diverse in skill, experience and background 
including gender. The principles of the 
policy are taken into consideration 
during both the contemplation of new 
appointments and the annual evaluation of 
the Board’s performance, with its diversity-
Corporate governance report
continued
56 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM endorsing values reflected in recruitment 
policies in effect throughout the Group. 
Additional disclosure relating to diversity 
within Shire is made on page 21.
Appointments
The Board may appoint any individual as 
a Director either to fill a vacancy or as an 
additional member of the Board. The 
process for new appointments is typically 
headed by the Nomination Committee 
(procedural details are available on page 62) 
which ultimately makes a recommendation 
to the Board. Appointments may be made 
by the Board at any time subject to election 
and annual re-election by the Company’s 
shareholders. With the exception of Matthew 
Emmens and Graham Hetherington, all of 
the Directors are seeking either election or 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting 
to be held on April 29, 2014, at which 
Non-Executive Directors’ terms of 
appointment and Executive Directors’ 
service contracts will be made available 
for inspection by shareholders. The Board 
confirms that, during the year, each of the 
Directors seeking re-election underwent 
a performance evaluation with each 
evidencing continued effective 
performance and commitment to their 
role. Further details relating to the Board 
performance evaluation can be found below.
Commitment
Prior to appointment, each Non-Executive 
Director is required to disclose to the 
Board their other significant commitments 
so as to enable an assessment of their 
capacity to effectively discharge their 
anticipated duties and responsibilities. 
The Board in turn is informed by each 
Non-Executive Director of any changes 
to their other significant commitments. 
Each Non-Executive Director has 
undertaken that they are able to meet 
the time commitment expected of them, 
which was duly communicated by the 
Board prior to appointment. As part of 
its performance evaluation the Board 
determined that each of its members 
had committed sufficient time to 
perform their role effectively.
Conflict of interests
Directors are required to seek consent from 
the Board prior to being appointed to, or 
acquiring any material financial interest in, 
any enterprise which competes, is likely to 
compete or has a significant business 
relationship with the Group. In addition, 
Directors are required to disclose the nature 
and extent of any interest they have, whether 
direct or indirect, in any transaction entered 
into, or proposed to be entered into, by the 
Group which conflicts, or may conflict, with 
the Group’s interests. Such disclosures are 
made at the first Board meeting at which the 
transaction is considered after the Director 
concerned becomes aware of the conflict of 
interest, or potential conflict, following which 
the Director abstains from all associated 
discussion and voting.
Induction and development
Upon appointment to the Board, all 
Directors undergo a formal induction 
program tailored to their individual skills, 
knowledge and experience. The purpose 
of such a program is to facilitate each 
Director’s familiarisation with the Company’s 
business and strategy, as well as their own 
duties and responsibilities. Prior to his 
appointment as Chief Executive Officer, 
Flemming Ornskov held the position of 
Chief Executive Officer Designate for a 
period of four months. During this time 
he became familiar with the Company, 
its people, the risks it faces and its 
opportunities through meeting Board 
members and investors, through visiting 
many of the Company’s sites and meeting 
employees from across the business.
In addition to undergoing an initial 
induction, on an annual basis each 
Director discusses with the Chairman 
their individual development requirements 
with a view to ensuring that their skills, 
knowledge and experience are regularly 
refreshed, and that their familiarity with 
the Company’s business is maintained.
Information and support
The Chairman, in collaboration with the 
Company Secretary and the Executive 
Directors, is responsible for ensuring that 
Board members are provided at all times 
with the information necessary for them 
to effectively discharge their duties and 
responsibilities. Before decisions are 
made at Board meetings, consideration 
is had as to the adequacy of the information 
available to the Board; prompting the 
deferral of decisions if further information 
is required. Directors are able to seek 
clarification, additional information or 
professional advice necessary to the 
fulfillment of their duties and responsibilities 
from across the business, from the 
Company Secretary, or from independent 
sources at the Company’s expense. In 
addition, the Chairman, supported by the 
Company Secretary, ensures that effective 
channels of communication exist between 
the Board, its committees and the 
Company’s senior management, and that 
Directors are kept up-to-date of matters 
pertaining to the Company’s governance.
Board performance evaluation
2012 progress
The 2012 externally facilitated evaluation 
identified two key action points in terms of 
enhancing the Board’s effectiveness. 
Progress made against these items during 
the 2013 financial year is as follows:
Increased time for discussion concerning 
feedback from Board committees
At Board meetings more time has been 
allowed to enable discussion around 
committee feedback. Committee 
Chairmen have increased the level of detail 
they include in their reports to the Board 
summarising the material issues 
considered at committee meetings.
Enhanced Board connectivity between 
meetings
There has been an increase in the level 
of informal Board member contact 
between meetings, with Board members 
also invited to attend meetings of some 
committees of which they are not 
members. In addition, the Board is 
provided with a formal operational 
update from the Chief Executive Officer 
on a monthly basis.
2013 procedure, conclusions and 
action points
The 2013 Board performance evaluation 
was carried out internally, led by the 
Chairman with the support of the Company 
Secretary, and covered the performance of 
the Board and of its members. In addition, 
the Chairman of each Board committee 
conducted a committee effectiveness 
review with their respective members. 
The evaluation and review procedures 
consisted of one-to-one interviews 
between the Chairmen and individual 
Board and committee members. The 
Board performance evaluation included 
WWW.SHIRE.COM ANNUAL REPORT 2013 SHIRE PLC 57
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information a review of strategy, risks and internal 
controls, Chief Executive Officer 
succession, Board dynamics including 
Board member independence, and 
individual development requirements.
The overall conclusion drawn from the 
2013 evaluation is that the individual 
members of the Board remain effective 
in their ability to discharge their duties 
and responsibilities. Each continues to 
make a valuable contribution whilst 
demonstrating commitment to their role, 
with the Chairman displaying continued 
effectiveness in leadership. The resultant 
Board and committees can be seen to 
operate at a standard conducive to Shire’s 
commitment to effective governance. 
They enjoy open and robust debate 
and are provided with the information 
necessary for them to make informed 
judgments and decisions.
In contemplating the results of the 2013 
evaluation and how effectiveness might 
be improved, the Board agreed that 
periodically it would invite speakers to 
provide an external perspective on issues 
or trends which may impact the 
Company’s strategy or operations.
Relations with shareholders
The Board is committed to maintaining 
open and constructive dialog with 
shareholders; helping to ensure common 
awareness and interpretation of strategic 
objectives, matters of governance and of 
the Company’s performance. The principal 
points of contact for major shareholders 
are the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Chief Financial Officer with the views of 
investors communicated to the Board 
as a whole. During the year the Group 
engaged with shareholders through 
the following media:

further details as to their operation and 
activities presented in the respective 
reports below.
auditor attended all meetings at the invitation 
of the Committee Chairman. So as to 
facilitate open and unreserved discussion, 
time was set aside at each meeting for the 
Committee’s private deliberation, with 
additional meetings held with the Group’s 
external auditor, the Head of Internal Audit 
and the Chief Compliance and Risk Officer 
in the absence of the Executive Directors or 
other members of senior management.
Role of the Committee
The purpose of the Committee is to

reporting processes, the audits of its 
financial statements and the effectiveness 
of the Company’s risk management and 
internal control framework. In doing so, 
the Committee’s principal duties are to:
• monitor the integrity of the financial 
reports and statements of the Group and, 
where requested by the Board, advise on 
whether, taken as a whole, the Annual 
Report and Accounts is fair, balanced 
and understandable;
• make recommendations to the Board 
on matters relating to the appointment of 
the external auditor and to consider the 
findings and recommendations arising 
from the external audit process;
• monitor and review the integrity and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
financial controls and internal control 
and risk management systems;
• review the Group’s strategy for the 
management of key corporate and 
financial risks; and

compliance program to ensure 
adherence to applicable legal and 
regulatory standards and to the 
Group’s internal policies.
In addition, the Committee is authorized to 
investigate any activity included within its 
terms of reference and is responsible for 
the resolution of any disagreement 
between senior management and the 
Group’s external auditor regarding financial 
reporting matters. The Committee is also

Key considerations
The significant issues considered by the 
Committee during the year in relation to 
the financial statements were:
• purchase accounting related to the 
Group’s acquisition of SARcode, Lotus 
Tissue Repair and Premacure. The 
Committee reviewed and critiqued the 
valuation techniques and critical 
accounting estimates used in the financial 
statements and satisfied itself that these 
were reasonable and appropriately 
applied. The Committee addresses 
these matters through receiving reports 
from management which discuss the 
assumptions used. In addition, as a 
prime source of audit focus, Deloitte 
provide detailed reporting to the 
Committee (see Note 4 to the 
consolidated financial statements);
• accounting for litigation provisions and 
costs (see Note 3 (iv) and Note 19 to the 
consolidated financial statements);
• the carrying value of the Company’s 
intangible assets. The Committee 
reviewed and critiqued the judgments and 
sensitivities relevant to intangible asset and 
goodwill impairment reviews, and the 
impairment charges recognised in respect 
of goodwill in the Group’s former 
Regenerative Medicine division and the 
RESOLOR in-process research and 
development assets. The judgments in 
relation to asset impairment largely relate 
to the assumptions underlying the 
calculation of the value in use of the asset 
being tested, primarily the achievability of 
the long term business plan underlying the 
valuation process. The Committee 
received reports from management 
outlining the basis for the assumptions 
used and in addition Deloitte provided 
detailed reporting to the Committee 
(see Note 3 (i) to the consolidated 
financial statements).
• the review of questions posed by the 
SEC regarding Shire’s 2012 Form 10-K 
filing and the approval of Shire’s 
response;
• accounting for sales deductions and 
rebates, and the key judgments and 
estimates applied by the Company in 
calculating the liability recorded in the 
balance sheet for such items. These 
judgments are discussed by the 
Committee with management and as 
an area of audit focus Deloitte provide 
regular reporting to the Committee 
(see Note 3 (ii) to the consolidated 
financial statements);
• accounting for various tax related 
matters, including the level of tax 
provisions. Accounting for income tax is 
underpinned by a range of judgments 
(see Note 3 (iii) to the consolidated 
financial statements). The Committee 
addresses these issues through a range 
of reporting from senior management 
and also receives verbal and written 
reporting from Deloitte on these 
matters; and
• disclosures contained within the Group’s 
2012 full-year and 2013 quarterly results 
announcements and related financial 
reports.
Internal controls and risk management 
pertaining to the financial reporting process
The Group’s internal controls over financial 
reporting are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.
The key features of the Company’s internal 
controls over financial reporting include a 
series of policies and procedures that:
• pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reflect the acquisitions and 
disposals of the assets of the Company;
• provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded correctly so as 
to permit the preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles and that 
receipts and expenditures of the 
Company are being made only in 
accordance with prescribed authorization 
levels; and
• provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposal 
of the Company’s assets that could have 
a material effect on the Company’s 
financial statements.
Because of inherent limitations of internal 
controls over financial reporting, material 
misstatements due to error may not be 
prevented or detected. Projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness for future 
periods are subject to the risk that controls 
may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate. To mitigate 
this risk, during the year the Group’s 
management assessed the effectiveness 
of internal controls over financial reporting 
based on the framework in Internal Control 
– Integrated Framework issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
(‘COSO’) of the Treadway Commission. 
Based on this assessment, management 
believes that the Group’s internal controls 
over financial reporting were effective as of 
December 31, 2013.
The Board, together with the Committee, 
reviews material risks impacting the 
Company on a timely basis as they arise. 
In addition, on an annual basis the Board 
reviews the key risks, associated mitigation 
plans and the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls, with the Committee 
conducting bi-annual reviews. Further 
details on risk mitigation can be found on 
page 24. In addition, the Group’s external 
auditor, Deloitte, an independent registered 
public accounting firm, has issued an 
independent auditor’s report on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls over financial reporting which 
can be found on page 95.
Committee activities
The Committee’s activities during the year 
related to the financial statements and 
associated internal controls and risk 
management systems included:
• the review of the Group’s treasury policies 
and activities including a review of the 
Company’s governance and systems 
relating to cash and investment 
management;
• the review of proposed financing 
arrangements pertaining to potential and 
ongoing M&A activity; 
• the monitoring of the Group’s accounts 
receivable exposure in certain Eurozone 
countries and the associated risk 
mitigation activities;
• annual review of the Group’s tax strategy 
and assessment of fiscal risk; and
• the review and approval of the Group’s 
delegated levels of authority.
External audit
Independence and objectivity
The Committee recognises both the need 
for an objective and independent external 
auditor and how such objectivity and 
independence might be, or appear, 
compromised through the provision of 
non-audit services. Accordingly, the 
Corporate governance report
continued
60 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Committee has overseen the 
implementation of a policy on the provision 
of non-audit services by the external 
auditor with a view to safeguarding these 
core attributes. The policy provides that, 
amongst other things, the auditor must not 
provide a service which:
• creates a mutuality of interest;
• places the auditor in a position where 
they would audit their own work;
• results in the auditor acting as a manager 
or employee of the Company; or
• puts the auditor in role of advocate for 
the Company.
In addition, the policy prescribes services 
from which the external auditor is explicitly 
prohibited from providing, and those the 
provision of which has been pre-approved 
by the Committee subject to individual and 
aggregate monetary limits. All proposed 
services falling outside of the scope of the 
policy, or the monetary limits contained 
therein, must receive pre-approval from the 
Committee or from its Chairman subject to 
Committee approval at its subsequent 
scheduled meeting.
Further factors identified as contributing to 
external auditor objectivity and 
independence include the external 
auditor’s retention of an impartial and 
questioning approach, particularly with 
respect to issues of heightened sensitivity, 
the firm’s prudent attitude to the 
consideration and undertaking of non-
audit services and Shire’s own principle 
of not recruiting staff directly from the 
external auditor engagement team.
During the year the Committee met 
with the external auditor to consider the 
external auditor’s independence and 
objectivity; ensuring that the relationship 
between the external auditor and members 
of financial management had not resulted, 
or appeared to result, in a lack of 
independence or objectivity. The 
Committee considers that, during 2013, 
the external auditor was sufficiently robust 
in dealings with members of financial 
management and that, in their absence, 
the external auditor was transparent and 
decisive in dealings with the Committee. 
Details of the breakdown and value of 
non-audit fees paid or due to the external 
auditor as a result of services provided 
during 2013 can be found in Note 30 to 
the consolidated financial statements.
Effectiveness
The Committee recognises the importance 
of having a high caliber of audit and as 
such, undertakes an annual assessment 
of the effectiveness of the external audit 
process. As part of its evaluation, the 
Committee drew upon a survey of 
members of financial management which 
measured the external auditor’s 
performance against predetermined 
“critical success factors”, designed to 
facilitate continuing and measurable 
improvement in the effectiveness of the 
external audit process. The Committee 
concluded that the “critical success 
factors” had been substantially met with 
there existing a constructive working 
relationship between the external auditor 
and members of financial management. 
Moreover, the Committee determined that 
the audit process was sufficiently robust, 
with the external auditor demonstrating 
continued commitment to the performance 
of high-quality audit work. Further areas of 
development were identified and 
communicated to the external auditor 
which in turn has committed to working 
with management and the Committee to 
address these in 2014.
Appointment and tendering
Deloitte LLP has served as Shire’s external 
auditor since 2002, with the current audit 
partner having served since his 
appointment in 2012. Following the review 
of Deloitte’s continued objectivity, 
independence, and performance in 
respect of the 2013 financial year, and 
having received an expression of 
willingness to continue in office as external 
auditor, the Committee recommended to 
the Board the re-appointment of Deloitte 
LLP as the Company’s external auditor for 
the 2014 financial year. There existed no 
contractual obligations that inhibited or 
influenced the Committee’s 
recommendation.
In accordance with developments in the 
UK corporate governance regime and best 
practice with respect to external audit 
tendering and rotation, it is the Company’s 
policy that the external audit be put to 
tender at least once in every ten-year 
period, with the external audit partner 
rotating on a five-yearly basis. 
Notwithstanding such policy, having 
regard to the Financial Reporting Council’s 
“transitional arrangements” for external 
audit tendering and the ongoing 
developments in audit regulation, it is the 
Committee’s intention, subject to then-
prevailing circumstances, to consider the 
external audit tender nearer the time of 
the next scheduled audit partner rotation 
in 2016.
Committee activities
The Committee’s activities related to 
external audit during the year included:
• the review of quarterly updates provided 
by the external auditor encompassing key 
risks, audit planning, governance updates 
and other business-related matters;
• the final review of the 2012 audit and the 
initial review of the external auditor’s 
performance and effectiveness during 
the 2013 financial year, including a review 
of management’s assessment of the 
performance and effectiveness of the 
external auditor;
• the review and approval of the 2013 
Audit Plan and audit fee; and
• an assessment of the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor.
Other matters
Internal audit
Internal audit effectiveness is monitored 
and reviewed on an ongoing basis by 
senior management, overseen by the 
Committee, with auditees providing 
supplementary feedback as appropriate. 
The Internal Audit Plan is approved 
annually by the Committee; progression 
against which is reviewed quarterly. In 
addition, every four years the Company’s 
internal audit procedures and capabilities 
undergo an independent external 
assessment against global standards, 
with the ensuing report reviewed by 
the Committee Chairman and the 
Chief Financial Officer.
Whistleblowing
Shire’s compliance effort is focused on the 
prevention and detection of misconduct 
through policy development, training, 
monitoring and audit. As part of this effort, 
Shire employees are encouraged to report 
suspected cases of misconduct, 
confidentially and without fear of retaliation, 
through management or through Shire’s 
Global Compliance Helpline. The helpline, 
the operation of which is overseen by the 
Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, is 
managed by an independent third party so 
as to preserve anonymity as appropriate. 
Concerns and allegations are thoroughly 
investigated with disciplinary action taken 
where necessary. Periodically the Chief 
Compliance and Risk Officer provides the 
Committee with a summary of matters 
raised through management and the 
helpline as well as details of any resultant 
investigations.
Committee activities
During the year the Committee’s other 
areas of review included:
• compliance updates from the 
Chief Compliance and Risk Officer 
and the Head of Internal Audit;
• the renewal of terms of the Group’s 
insurance program against the wider 
insurance market;
• developments to the UK corporate 
governance regime and the associated 
implications for the Company;
• the Company’s strategy in respect of IT 
systems and its approach to cyber 
security;
• the review of the Group’s internal audit 
program; and
• the review of the Group’s corporate risk 
schedule, including consideration of the 
key risks faced by the Group and the 
associated mitigation strategy.

Key considerations and activities
During the year the Committee’s principal 
considerations and activities were:
Appointment of Dominic Blakemore
Following a regular review of the 
composition of the Board it was agreed 
early in the year to seek a new Board 
member who would bring, amongst 
other things, financial and strategic 
experience. With Odgers Berndtson 
assisting the search, the Board agreed 
to Dominic’s appointment which was 
announced in October. Upon Dominic’s 
appointment on January 1, 2014 he 
also became a member of the Audit, 
Compliance & Risk Committee, of 
which he is to be appointed Chairman 
on April 29, 2014.
Committee effectiveness review
This process was led by the Chairman 
of the Committee with the assistance 
of the Company Secretary and involved 
one-to-one discussions with each 
Committee member. The results of the 
review and the conclusions drawn were 
noted at the next Board meeting.
Terms of reference review
During the year the Committee 
reviewed its terms of reference and 
recommended minor modifications 
to the Board for approval.
Board appointments procedure
Board composition is central to the 
effective leadership of the Group and 
therefore, prior to commencing any 
search for prospective Board members, 
the Committee reflects on the Board’s 
current balance of skills and experiences 
and those that would be conducive to 
the delivery of the Company’s strategy.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Anne Minto
Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee
Dear Shareholder
As Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee,  
I am pleased to present our 
remuneration report for the 
financial year ended December 
31, 2013 which has been 
prepared in compliance 
with the new UK reporting 
requirements. 
Directors’ remuneration report
The Committee believes that the purpose 
of its remuneration policy is to support the 
Company’s strategy to grow the business 
and deliver value to stakeholders by 
focusing on significant unmet patient need 
in specialist areas and providing more 
innovative treatments to more patients. 
The remuneration policy therefore has a 
strong focus on strategic alignment and 
both corporate and individual performance-
based remuneration, in particular 
remuneration delivered in shares and vesting 
over the longer term. It also recognizes that 
we compete internationally and in particular 
in the US labor market, for limited talent in 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical 
sectors.
We have sought to ensure that the 
Remuneration Report sets out clearly 
our remuneration policy and how it was 
implemented in 2013. Ahead of the detail, 
I would like to take this opportunity to outline 
the Committee’s key decisions over the past 
year and summarize the performance and 
other context for these decisions.
Context to the Committee’s decisions
Following the appointment of a new Chief 
Executive Officer (“CEO”) in 2013, we have 
undertaken significant changes at Shire: 
we refined our strategy; enhanced and 
reprioritized our portfolio to focus even 
more on rare diseases and late stage 
assets; created a simpler, more 
streamlined and effective organization, 
One Shire; implemented a new 
governance model to ensure enterprise-
wide decision making and resource 
allocation; and reset our cost base. 
Shareholders have responded well to 
these wide-ranging changes and share 
price performance has been strong with 
an Ordinary Share price increase of 51% 
and an American Depositary Share (ADS) 
price increase of 53% in 2013.
As well as implementing this major 
transformation which has made us even 
stronger, more flexible and focused, we 
have continued to deliver on short term 
performance as demonstrated by a strong 
set of financial results. Highlights of Shire’s 
financial performance during 2013 include:
• product sales from continuing operations 
in 2013 were up 12% to $4,757 million 
and including DERMAGRAFT product 
sales were up 10% to $4,847 million;
• non GAAP operating income
1
 increased 
by 23% to $1,860 million in 2013; and
• non GAAP Adjusted ROIC
1
 grew by 180 
basis points in 2013 over 2012 to 15.6%.
In addition, our non financial 
accomplishments include the successful 
completion of four acquisitions, notably 
our most recent acquisition, ViroPharma, 
which is the highest value deal in Shire’s 
history; further geographical expansion, 
particularly into Asia; and other 
achievements which further expanded 
our In-line product portfolio and 
development Pipeline, as described in 
the Key Performance Indicators section 
earlier in this report.
Key Committee decisions
The Committee is satisfied that there is 
strong alignment between Company 
performance and the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors. The key decisions 
made by the Committee include:
• a salary increase of approximately 8% for 
the CEO, reflecting both his performance 
in role and bringing his salary in line with 
the median for comparable roles as set 
out in last year’s Remuneration Report 
and in line with our remuneration policy. 
This is consistent with the pattern of 
increases across the organization where 
strong performers are given above 
average increases to achieve appropriate 
market positioning.
• incentive awards for the CEO subject to 
stretching performance conditions and 
above target level, reflecting Shire’s 
strong corporate performance in 2013 
as well as his individual contribution to the 
Company’s continued success.

Portfolio Share Plan (“PSP”) award to the 
Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) reflecting 
our excellent financial performance over 
the performance period (on the basis of 
a Compound Annual Growth Rate 
(“CAGR”) of 18.2% in Non GAAP EBITDA 
and a 220 basis point increase in Non 
GAAP Adjusted ROIC
2
 over the last 
three years).
• in addition, the Committee carefully 
considered the remuneration decisions in 
relation to the CFO’s departure, including 
no salary increase or long term incentive 
award to be made in 2014 in the light of 
his scheduled leave date. In line with the 
Committee’s policy of transparency with 
shareholders, further detail is set out later 
in this report.
Given the strategic and organizational 
changes through 2013 as well as the 
strong level of support from shareholders 
for our remuneration policy and decisions 
in recent years, the Committee decided 
not to make any significant changes to 
our overall remuneration approach.
However, a large amount of time was 
spent considering the new UK reporting 
requirements and associated guidance as 
well as meeting with our major shareholders 
and key shareholder advisory bodies to 
ensure the Remuneration Report was 
compliant, clear and met our shareholders’ 
expectations as far as possible. In the light 
of these shareholder discussions, the 
Committee made two important decisions. 
Firstly, pending a wider remuneration 
review in 2014, to seek shareholder 
approval for a long term incentive grant 
policy limited to existing target ranges 
rather than the higher plan rule grant 
maxima. And secondly, to further 
enhance the transparency of its annual 
incentive award disclosure compared 
to previous years.
Looking forward
2013 was an important year in Shire’s 
continued development as we laid 
foundations to grow the value of Shire for 
the benefit of our patients, shareholders 
and other stakeholders. With the revised 
strategy and organizational structure 
coming into place, a review of our 
remuneration policy and arrangements 
will take place in 2014 to ensure they 
remain appropriate. This review will take 
into account a variety of considerations 
including strategic alignment, linkages 
to performance, market practice and 
shareholder views. We will, of course, 
engage with shareholders at the 
appropriate time to discuss the findings.
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow 
Committee members for their extensive 
contributions as well as both the internal 
and external teams that have supported 
the Committee over the past year.
On behalf of the Board

Part 2 – Directors’ remuneration policy
a) Executive Director remuneration policy
Purpose & link to strategy Operation & performance assessment Opportunity 
Overall remuneration
To recruit and retain high caliber 
executives and encourage them 
to enhance the Company’s 
performance, responsibly, in line 
with the Company’s strategy and 
shareholder interests.
The overall remuneration package for the Executive Directors is 
designed to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and 
variable, performance-related components, with a significant element 
of long term variable pay given the long term nature of the business.
Overall remuneration is positioned in line with a Mid-Atlantic peer group 
which comprises a blend of US and UK companies, taking into account 
scale and international complexity. UK market data is based on other 
companies within the FTSE 100 index excluding financial services, 
utilities and mining companies. The greater number of comparable US 
companies allows further refinement of US market data to only include 
companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and related sectors.
The Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure of the 
remuneration package is appropriate and does not incentivize undue 
risk taking.
In terms of total remuneration, the Company’s 
policy is to target at around median of the relevant 
market and to allow for higher pay levels to 
recognize superior performance.
Fixed elements – base salary
To recognize the market value 
of the role, an individual’s skills, 
experience and performance, 
as well as their contribution 
to leadership and 
Company strategy.
Base salary is paid in cash and is pensionable.
Individual and corporate performance are factors considered during the 
annual base salary review process. Any increases typically take effect 
on January 1 each year.
Any significant salary increases, such as in cases where Executive 
Directors are relatively new in role, changes in responsibilities or 
significant variance to the market, will be appropriately explained.
Base salary is targeted at around median of the 
Mid-Atlantic peer group. The exact positioning 
depends on a variety of factors such as individual 
experience and performance, total remuneration 
increases across the Company and shareholder 
views.
Where appropriate, annual increases are made in 
line with the average of employees’ salary 
increases, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise based on the factors listed above.
The annual base salaries for the Executive 
Directors are set out in Part 3(a) of this report.
66 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Purpose & link to strategy Operation & performance assessment Opportunity 
Fixed elements – retirement and other benefits
To ensure that benefits are 
competitive in the markets in 
which the Company operates.
Dr. Ornskov participates in the 401(k) Plan and the Supplemental 
Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) in the US. The SERP is an unfunded 
defined contribution scheme; the benefits are payable as lump sums on 
leaving the Company’s employment or in the event of death or disability.
Mr. Hetherington’s retirement benefits are provided through a 
combination, at his election, of cash allowance and participation in a 
UK HMRC registered defined contribution plan, which the Company 
operates for UK employees.
The Company provides a range of other benefits which may include 
a car allowance, long term disability and life cover, private medical 
insurance and financial and tax advisory support. These benefits 
are not pensionable. Other benefits may be offered if considered 
appropriate by the Committee.
The Company may also meet certain mobility costs, such as relocation 
support, expatriate allowances, temporary living and transportation 
expenses, in line with the prevailing mobility policy and practice for 
senior executives.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in any all-employee 
share plans operated by the Company, such as the Sharesave scheme 
in the UK and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) in the US 
and other countries.
Dr. Ornskov receives a total fixed contribution of 
30% of annual salary and Mr. Hetherington 
receives a total fixed contribution of 25% of annual 
salary by way of retirement benefit provision.
The cost to the Company of providing other 
benefits may vary depending on, for example, 
market practice and the cost of insuring certain 
benefits.
Short term incentives – Executive Annual Incentive Plan (“EAIP”)
To reward individuals with an 
award based on achievement of 
pre-defined, Committee approved 
corporate objectives (the 
corporate scorecard) and the 
individual’s contributions toward 
achieving those objectives.
Key performance measures are 
set by the Committee both in the 
context of annual performance 
as well as to ensure progress 
towards our strategy – to grow 
our business and deliver value to 
our stakeholders by focusing on 
significant unmet patient need in 
specialist areas and providing 
more innovative treatments to 
more patients.
In determining EAIP awards for the Executive Directors, the Committee 
considers performance against each of the key performance measures 
within the corporate scorecard, taking into account the impact on the 
Company’s performance of strategic actions, as well as the Company’s 
response to external opportunities and events that could not have been 
predicted at the beginning of the year, together with performance 
against personal objectives. In addition, the Committee may amend the 
performance measures or targets in exceptional circumstances where 
it considers that they are no longer appropriate.
The cash element (75% of any award) is paid in the first quarter of the 
year following the performance year, and the deferred shares element 
(25% of any award) is deferred and released after a period of three 
years, subject to the participant’s employment not being terminated 
for cause. The release of deferred shares includes dividend shares 
representing accumulated dividends.
Clawback arrangements are in place for awards to cover situations 
where results are materially misstated or in the event of serious 
misconduct.
90% and 80% of base salary is payable for target 
performance for the CEO and CFO respectively 
and up to 180% and 160% for maximum 
performance, although actual payouts can range 
from 0% (threshold performance) upwards.
Each year the Committee determines the 
measures and weightings for the corporate 
scorecard within the following parameters:
• at least 75% of the corporate scorecard will 
be based on financial performance.
• other corporate scorecard measures will 
comprise other strategic priorities such as:
 − strengthening the commercial portfolio;
 − expanding the development pipeline; and
 − enhancing organizational effectiveness.
The precise allocation between financial and non 
financial measures (as well as the weightings 
within these measures), will depend on the 
strategic focus of the Company in any given year.

Purpose & link to strategy Operation & performance assessment Opportunity 
Long term incentives – Portfolio Share Plan
To incentivize individuals to 
achieve sustained growth 
through superior long term 
performance and create 
alignment with shareholders.
The performance measures for 
the PSP awards are Non GAAP 
EBITDA
1
 and Non GAAP 
Adjusted ROIC
2
. These 
measures were selected by the 
Committee as it believes that 
they represent meaningful and 
relevant measurements of our 
performance and are an 
important measure of our ability 
to meet our strategic objective to 
grow our business and deliver 
value to our stakeholders.
The Committee reviews annually 
whether the performance matrix 
structure and metrics remain 
appropriate and challenging 
taking into account the 
Company’s strategic objectives 
and shareholder interests.
PSP grants for the Executive Directors comprise two types of award:
• SAR awards. A Stock Appreciation Right (“SAR”) is the right to 
receive Ordinary Shares or ADSs linked to the increase in value of 
Ordinary Shares or ADSs from grant to exercise.
• PSA awards. A Performance Share Award (“PSA”) is the right to 
receive a specified number of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
SAR and PSA awards granted to Executive Directors vest three years 
from the date of grant, subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions and are governed by the PSP rules. SAR awards can be 
exercised up to the seventh anniversary of the date of grant. These two 
types of award are made to ensure a balance between the emphasis 
on share price growth that the SAR awards provide and the retentive 
properties of the PSA awards.
Vesting of awards requires the achievement of Non GAAP EBITDA and 
Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC targets within a performance matrix. The 
Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to the matrix to 
reflect significant one off items which occur during the vesting period 
(Significant Adjustment Events (“SAEs”)). Potential SAEs are reviewed 
by the Committee against pre-existing guidelines
3
. The Committee will 
make full and clear disclosure of any such adjustments in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (“DRR”), together with the Non GAAP Adjusted 
ROIC performance, at the end of the performance period.
In addition, awards only vest if the Committee determines that the 
underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the 
vesting of the award.
Performance targets are set by the Committee to ensure alignment with 
the Company’s current long range plans and strategy, the Company’s 
weighted average cost of capital and recent broker forecasts.
Clawback arrangements are in place for awards to cover situations where 
results are materially misstated or in the event of serious misconduct.
The Committee has established the following 
target levels of award in face value terms:
For the CEO:
• 400% of base salary for SAR awards; and
• 300% of base salary for PSA awards.
For the CFO:
• 300% of base salary for SAR awards; and
• 220% of base salary for PSA awards.
The Committee’s policy is that each year, awards 
will be made to Executive Directors of between 
80% and 120% of these target levels, depending 
on performance and consideration of appropriate 
benchmarks. In doing so, the Committee gives 
consideration to the expected value of the award, 
which enables comparison to other Shire 
employees (whose long term incentives are 
determined in expected value terms) as well 
as to the external market.
Threshold vesting under the performance matrix is 
equal to 25% of any award made, with maximum 
vesting being equal to 100% of any award made.
1 
Non GAAP EBITDA growth is defined as the CAGR of Non GAAP EBITDA, as derived from the Group’s Non GAAP financial results included in its full year earnings 
releases, over the three year vesting period.
2 
Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC reflects the definition used by the Company in its corporate scorecard. This definition aims to measure true underlying economic 
performance of the Company, by making a number of adjustments to ROIC as derived from the Company’s Non GAAP financial results including:
• adding back to Non GAAP operating income all R&D expenses and operating lease costs incurred in the period;
• capitalizing on the Group’s balance sheet historical, cumulative R&D, in process R&D and intangible asset impairment charges and operating lease costs which 
previously have been expensed;
• deducting from Non GAAP operating income an amortization charge for the above capitalized costs based on the estimated commercial lives of the relevant products;
• excluding the income statement and balance sheet impact of non operating assets (such as surplus cash and non strategic investments); and
• taxing the resulting adjusted operating income at the underlying Non GAAP tax rate.
3 
The Significant Adjustment Events pre-existing guidelines consist of the following:
• the event results from a strategic action that has a short term impact on Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC or Non GAAP EBITDA growth, but is in the long term interest 
of shareholders or the event was external and results in a significant change to the Company’s operating environment;
• the event is a one off (as opposed to recurring) in nature;
• the event is “significant” which is defined by reference to its impact on Non GAAP EBITDA relative to a materiality threshold; and
• the event was not taken into account when the performance matrix was set.
Legacy matters in relation to Executive Director remuneration
The Committee will honor remuneration and related commitments to current and former Directors (including the exercise of any discretions available to the 
Committee in relation to such commitments) where the terms were agreed prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report.
68 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM b) Chairman and Non-Executive Director remuneration policy
Purpose & link to strategy Operation & performance assessment Opportunity 
Overall remuneration
To attract and retain high caliber 
individuals by offering market 
competitive fee levels.
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all of his/her responsibilities. 
The Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee. The members and 
chairmen of the main Board committees and the Senior Independent 
Director are paid a committee fee to reflect their extra responsibilities.
The Non-Executive Directors receive 25% of their total fees in the form 
of shares. Given his significant shareholding in Shire, the current 
Chairman receives his fee in the form of cash only.
The Company reimburses reasonably incurred expenses and 
Non-Executive Directors are also paid an additional fee in respect of 
each transatlantic trip made for Board meetings.
The fees paid to the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not 
performance-related. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in 
any of the Group share plans, pension plans or other employee benefit 
schemes (with the exception of the current Chairman only who is 
provided with private family medical coverage to which both he and the 
Company contribute).
Fees are determined by the Executive Directors 
and the Chairman, with the exception of the 
Chairman’s fee which is determined by the 
Committee. They are benchmarked against a 
blend of US and UK companies, similar to those 
used for benchmarking the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration (the Mid-Atlantic peer group). In 
addition, the fees for the Chairman also take into 
account the anticipated time commitment for the 
role and experience of the incumbent.
Benchmarking of Non-Executive Directors’ fees 
takes place on an annual basis.
c) Recruitment remuneration policy
The following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the 
appointment of an Executive Director and the approach to be adopted by the Committee in respect of each component. The 
Committee will review this policy as part of the planned 2014 remuneration review, in particular it will reflect further on whether some 
additional flexibility would be prudent to facilitate the recruitment of a new Executive Director. Any changes envisaged as a result of 
the 2014 review will be discussed with shareholders and will be included in the recruitment remuneration policy that will be put to 
shareholders for a binding vote at the 2015 AGM.
Area Policy and operation
Overall • The Committee’s approach when considering the overall remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of a member of 
the Board from an external party is to take account of the Executive Director’s remuneration package in their prior role, the 
market positioning of the remuneration package, and to not pay more than necessary to facilitate the recruitment of the 
individual in question.
Fixed elements
(Base salary, retirement and 
other benefits)
• The salary level will be consistent with the Company’s Mid-Atlantic peer group.
• The Executive Director shall be eligible to participate in Shire’s employee benefit plans, including coverage under all 
executive and employee pension and benefit programs in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans, as 
may be amended by the Company in its sole discretion from time to time.
• The Company may meet certain mobility costs, including relocation support, expatriate allowances, temporary living and 
transportation expenses in line with the prevailing mobility policy and practice for senior executives.
Short term incentives • The appointed Executive Director will be eligible to earn a discretionary annual incentive award in accordance with the 
rules and terms of Shire’s Executive Annual Incentive Plan or successor bonus plan.
•  The level of opportunity will be consistent with that stated in Part 2(a) of this report.
Long term incentives • The Executive Director will be eligible for performance-based equity awards in accordance with the rules and terms of 
Shire’s Portfolio Share Plan or successor long term incentive plan.
•  The quantum will be consistent with that stated in Part 2(a) of this report and the Committee reserves the right to exceed 
target ranges in exceptional circumstances (within the limits set out in the plan rules).

Area Policy and operation
Replacement awards • The Committee will consider what replacement awards (if any) are reasonably necessary to facilitate the recruitment of a 
new hire Executive Director in all circumstances. This includes an assessment of the awards and any other compensation 
or benefits item that would be forfeited on leaving their current employer.
•  The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are not significantly more generous in 
terms of quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
•  In determining quantum and structure of these commitments, the Committee will seek to provide broadly equivalent value 
and replicate, as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of remuneration foregone.
•  The Committee will seek to ensure that a meaningful proportion of the replacement awards which are not attributable to 
long term incentives foregone will be delivered in Shire deferred shares, released at a later date and subject to continued 
employment.
•  If the Executive Director’s prior employer pays any portion of the remuneration that was deemed foregone, the 
replacement payments shall be reduced by an equivalent amount.
•  Replacement share awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing long term incentive plan to the extent 
possible, although awards may also be granted outside of this plan if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
•  In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding awards made in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out 
according to their original terms. If promotion is part way through the year, an additional top-up award may be made to 
bring the Executive Director’s opportunity to a level that is appropriate in the circumstances.
d) Service contracts and termination arrangements
Executive Directors
The Committee’s policy on service contracts and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below. As an overriding 
principle, it is the Committee’s policy that there should be no element of reward for failure. The Committee’s approach when 
considering payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for 
termination, performance, contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules.
Notice period • The Committee’s policy is that Executive Directors’ service contracts should provide for a notice period of 12 months from 
the Company and the Executive Director.
•  The Committee believes this policy provides an appropriate balance between the need to retain the services of key 
individuals for the benefit of the business and the need to limit the potential liabilities of the Company in the event of 
termination.
• The contracts for Flemming Ornskov and Graham Hetherington do not have a fixed term but provide for a notice period of 
12 months in line with this policy. Their contracts are dated October 24, 2012 and July 2, 2008 respectively.
Contractual payments • Executive Directors’ contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination by way of 
payment in lieu of notice, at the Company’s discretion. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the 
event of gross misconduct.
•  Payments in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months’ base salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months’ 
pension contributions, car allowance and other contractual benefits. There is no contractual entitlement to annual incentive 
payments in respect of the notice period – any award is at the Committee’s absolute discretion, performance-related and 
capped at the contractual target level.
•  Payment in lieu of notice would be made where circumstances dictate that the Executive Directors’ services are not 
required for the full 12 months of their notice period. Contracts also allow for phased payments on termination, which allow 
for further reduction in payments if the individual finds alternative employment outside of the Company during the notice 
period.
70 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Retirement benefits • Normal treatment to apply as governed by the rules of the relevant pension plan; no enhancement for leavers will be made.
Short term incentives • Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated after the end of a performance year but before the payment is 
made, the executive will remain eligible for an annual incentive award for that performance year subject to an assessment 
based on performance achieved over the period. No award will be made in the event of gross misconduct.
•  Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated during a performance year, a prorata annual incentive award for 
the period worked in that performance year may be payable subject to an assessment based on performance achieved 
over the period.
•  The Committee’s policy is not to award an annual incentive for any portion of the notice period not served.
•  The relevant plan rules provide that any outstanding deferred shares will vest in accordance with the regular vesting period, 
except for where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated for cause.
Long term incentives • The treatment of unvested long term incentive awards is governed by the rules of the relevant incentive plan, as approved 
by shareholders.
•  Where an individual’s employment terminates, the current PSP rules provide for unvested long term incentive awards to 
lapse except as set out below.
•  Under the current PSP rules, where an individual is determined to be a “good” leaver, unvested long term incentive awards 
vest upon termination subject to performance against applicable performance conditions and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, pro rating for time. Any Committee determination will take into account a number of considerations, 
in particular the individual’s performance and other circumstances relating to their termination of employment.
•  Good leaver reasons include retirement in accordance with the Company’s retirement policy, ill-health, injury or disability, 
and redundancy or in other circumstances that the Committee determines.
•  Pro rating for time will be calculated on the basis of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period during which 
the executive was employed (or would have been employed had the executive remained in employment throughout the 
notice period) as a proportion of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period.
•  Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated or an Executive Director is under notice of termination for any 
reason at the date of award of any long term incentive awards, no long term incentive awards will be made.
Change in control • In relation to unvested long term incentive awards, the current PSP rules provide that unvested awards will normally only 
vest on a change in control to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, and would be reduced where less than two years have elapsed from the relevant grant date.
•  The Committee’s policy is that contracts of employment should not provide additional compensation on severance as a 
result of change in control.
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold external non-executive directorships, subject to prior approval by the Board. Any fees 
received from such appointments are retained by the Executive Director.
Dr. Ornskov resigned from his position as Non-Executive Chairman of Evotec AG in June 2013. For his services as Non-Executive 
Chairman from January 1, 2013 to the date of resignation, he was paid fees of €35,048. Mr. Russell is a Non-Executive Director of 
Intermune, Inc. In respect of this position he was paid fees of $20,000, in respect of such service whilst serving as Chief Executive 
Officer of Shire plc. Dr. Ornskov and Mr. Russell both retained the fees paid in respect to their external appointments.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment and are appointed by the Board ordinarily for a term of two years. Their initial 
appointment and any subsequent re-appointment are subject to election, and thereafter annual re-election by shareholders. Non-
Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation for loss of office.

e) Remuneration scenarios
The composition and value of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages in three performance scenarios are set out in the 
charts below. These show that the proportion of the package delivered through long term incentives supports the long term nature of 
the business and changes significantly across the performance scenarios. The level of remuneration is in accordance with the 
Executive Director remuneration policy set out in Part 2(a) of this report.

• 2014 annualised base salary;
• benefits included in the summary of 2013 remuneration table on page 78 (excluding any one off items); and
• retirement benefits is the cash value of the total Company contributions to the Company plans (by way of a contribution 
and/or by way of a cash allowance). This represents 30% of base salary for the CEO and 25% of base salary for the CFO.
These definitions are consistent with the Schedule 8 Regulations.

In accordance with the Schedule 8 Regulations, no allowance has been made for share price appreciation. SAR awards are valued with the same Black-Scholes 
model that is used to determine the share based compensation cost included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Any dividend shares receivable 
have been ignored.
2 
A level of 50% vesting for ‘on-target’ performance reflects the midpoint of the performance range under the PSP performance matrix, which the Committee believes 
to be a fair assumption for ‘on-target’ performance.
The Executive Directors’ remuneration package promotes the achievement of superior long term performance and aligns the 
interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
72 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM f) Shareholder engagement
The Committee takes the views of shareholders very seriously and is committed to ongoing dialogue with the Company’s 
shareholder base, which has a significant transatlantic element. This can take a variety of forms including meetings with major 
shareholders to consider significant potential changes to policy or specific issues of interest to particular shareholder groups, other 
dialogue to update shareholders and receive their feedback on planned refinements to arrangements, and annual voting on the DRR.
In light of the new Schedule 8 Regulations and the first binding vote on remuneration policy scheduled for the 2014 AGM, the 
Committee carried out a shareholder consultation exercise in late 2013/early 2014 which included meetings with many of the 
Company’s largest shareholders as well as key shareholder advisory bodies. Key topics discussed included:
• application of the binding policy from January 1, 2015;
• approach to key new disclosures such as the recruitment remuneration policy and service contracts and termination arrangements; 
and
• disclosure of prospective and retrospective annual incentive award targets.
These discussions have informed the disclosures in this report, in particular the disclosure of 2013 EAIP outcomes. The Committee 
is also aware of shareholder views on a number of other issues including holding periods in relation to long term incentives. 
The Committee will take these views as well as market practice into account during the planned 2014 remuneration review.
g) Remuneration of other employees
The Committee recognizes that remuneration has an important role to play in supporting the implementation and achievement 
of the Company’s strategy and ongoing performance. When making remuneration decisions in respect of the Executive Directors, 
the Committee is sensitive to pay and employment conditions across the Company, in particular in relation to base salary decisions 
where the Committee considers the broader employee salary increase budget. The Committee approves the overall annual bonus 
funding for the Company each year and has oversight over the grant of all PSP awards across the Company. In addition, annual 
performance for the Executive Directors is measured against the backdrop of the same corporate scorecard that is appropriately 
cascaded across the organization.
Given Shire’s diverse employee base, employing over 5,000 people in 30 locations, the Committee does not consider it appropriate 
to consult with employees over the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. However, many of the Company’s employees are 
shareholders through the Company’s all-employee share plans, and are therefore able to express their views on Director remuneration 
at each general meeting. The Company also periodically carries out an employee engagement survey which provides employees the 
opportunity to feedback their views on a variety of employment-related matters, including remuneration.
The diagram set out on the following page illustrates how our remuneration policy and arrangements reinforce the achievement 
of Shire’s success and ensures that executives and employees are focused on delivering the same core objectives.

Fixed elements 
(base salary and benefits) 
Employees’ base salaries are benchmarked  
against the relevant market taking into 
account the companies with whom we 
compete for talent, geography and, where 
relevant, company size.
For example, market data for the most 
senior leadership roles, in particular the 
Executive Committee, reflects both the 
geographies in which we operate (with 
around two thirds of employees as well as 
the majority of senior management based in 
the US) and companies of a comparable 
size in the pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology sectors. 
Base salary increases across the company  
are determined in light of similar factors  
as described for the Executive Directors.
Retirement and other benefit arrangements 
are provided to employees with appropriate 
consideration of market practice and 
geographical differences.
Short term incentives 
For Executive Directors’ short term 
incentives, assessment is made against a 
corporate scorecard of key performance 
measures built around Shire’s key financial 
goals and other strategic priorities for the 
relevant year.
This same scorecard is cascaded to each 
business and corporate function to ensure 
alignment with corporate goals, and also 
funds short term incentives across the 
Company.
Scorecard targets are further cascaded to 
each employee through their performance 
objectives, with annual incentive awards 
payable in cash, strongly differentiated 
based on individual performance through 
linkages with the performance management 
system.
Long term incentives 
Discretionary long term equity awards are 
made on an annual basis dependent on  
an employee’s level of responsibility within  
the Company and individual performance.
For Executive Directors, Executive 
Committee members and EVPs, all awards 
vest at the end of a three year period. 
For the rest of the employee population, 
phased vesting of awards occurs over  
a period of three years with the majority  
vesting at the end of the three year period.
These act as a framework for remuneration  
decisions across the Company

74 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Part 3 – Annual Report on remuneration
a) Implementation of Directors’ remuneration policy in 2014
In 2014, the Executive Director and Non-Executive Director remuneration policies will be implemented as follows:
Executive Director remuneration policy
Fixed elements – base salary
Following the year end review, the Committee made the following 2014 base salary decisions (effective January 1, 2014) which are in 
line with the disclosed policy in Part 2(a) of this report:
2013 salary 2014 salary % change
Flemming Ornskov $1,200,000
1
$1,300,000 8.3%
Graham Hetherington £480,000 £480,000 0%
1 
Upon appointment to CEO effective April 30, 2013
Flemming Ornskov: in light of strong corporate performance and excellent leadership, the Committee decided to award 
Dr. Ornskov a base salary increase of 8.3% to $1,300,000. In accordance with our remuneration policy and the recruitment 
arrangements disclosed in last year’s DRR, this brings his base salary in line with the median for comparable roles. It is also 
consistent with the pattern of increases across the organization where strong performers are given above-average increases 
to achieve appropriate market positioning.
Graham Hetherington: the Committee decided that no increase would be applied to Mr. Hetherington’s base salary this year, given 
his announced departure from the Company on March 1, 2014 (see “Graham Hetherington – departure arrangements” section below 
for further details).
Fixed elements – retirement and other benefits
The implementation of policy in relation to pension and benefits is unchanged and in line with the disclosed policy in Part 2(a) of 
this report.
Short term incentives – EAIP
There is no change to the level of EAIP award opportunity for Executive Directors.
The 2014 EAIP will continue to use a scorecard approach and will be comprised of 75% financial and 25% non financial performance 
measures. This weighting recognizes the critical importance of financial results to our shareholders, bonus affordability and the 
important role that non financial performance plays in the success and growth of the Company. These measures are aligned with and 
support the budget and strategic focus for 2014 approved by the Board. In particular, for 2014, there is considerable activity related to 
the One Shire transformation, which is reflected in both the financial and non financial measures below.
The targets themselves are considered to be commercially sensitive on the grounds that disclosure could damage the Company’s 
commercial interests. However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s 
DRR to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time. Financial and non financial targets are set at the start of 
the performance year and are approved by the Committee, which believes the targets are suitably stretching, relevant and 
measurable. The 2014 corporate scorecard is set out below:
Strategic priorities Weighting Financial KPIs
Financial

75% • Net product sales
• Non GAAP EBITA
• Non GAAP ROIC
• Cost management

policy in Part 2(a) of this report:

Flemming Ornskov
SAR 111% 443% $5,761
PSA 83% 332% $4,320
The face value allocation between SARs and PSAs is estimated as it is determined on an expected value basis upon grant.
Given his announced departure from the Company on March 1, 2014, the Committee determined that no 2014 PSP award would be made to Graham Hetherington 
(see “Graham Hetherington – departure arrangements” section for further details).
The base award is one quarter of the total award made (1.0x vesting under the matrix) and is payable for threshold performance. 
There is nil vesting below this performance level. Up to four times the base award (4.0x vesting under the matrix) is payable for 
maximum performance, which would result in the total award vesting, with straight line vesting within this performance range. In all 
cases, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the 
vesting of the award.
The Committee reviewed the performance matrix and determined that the structure and performance measures will be retained in 
their current form for 2014. The performance targets have been adjusted to maintain appropriate alignment with the Company’s 
current long range plans and strategy, the Company’s weighted average cost of capital and recent broker forecasts. The 2014 
performance matrix is set out below:
2014 performance matrix
Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC Non GAAP EBITDA growth (CAGR 2013-2016)
Change in bp p.a. 9% 10% 11% 12% 13%
-100 1.0x 1.3x 1.7x 2.1x 2.5x
-80 1.3x 1.6x 2.0x 2.4x 2.8x
-60 1.6x 1.9x 2.4x 2.7x 3.1x
-40 1.9x 2.3x 2.6x 3.1x 3.5x
-20 2.2x 2.6x 3.1x 3.6x 4.0x
0 2.5x 3.0x 3.5x 4.0x 4.0x
For Non GAAP EBITDA growth, the Non GAAP EBITDA in the final performance year (2016) is compared to the Non GAAP EBITDA in 
the reference year (2013). A compound annual growth rate of Non GAAP EBITDA is then calculated. For Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC, 
the Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC in the final performance year is compared to the Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC in the reference year. The 
change in these two numbers is then divided by three and expressed in basis points (one hundredth of a percentage point) to give an 
average per annum change in Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC basis points.
The acquisition of ViroPharma in January 2014 will add approximately $4 billion to the denominator used to calculate Shire’s Non 
GAAP Adjusted ROIC. As a result, in the short term, including over the measurement period for the 2014 PSP awards, Non GAAP 
Adjusted ROIC is expected to decline from the 15.6%
1
 achieved in 2013. The performance matrix reflects this, by awarding higher 
vesting for lower declines in Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC.
Clawback arrangements are in place for awards to cover situations where results are materially misstated or in the event of serious 
misconduct.

Including results from DERMAGRAFT operations
76 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Graham Hetherington – departure arrangements
Mr. Hetherington has agreed with the Board that he will be stepping down from Shire’s Board of Directors and his role as CFO on 
March 1, 2014.
In line with the Committee’s policy, the Committee considered the overall circumstances of the departure as well as performance, 
contractual obligations and plan rules. In particular, the Committee considered Mr. Hetherington’s sustained performance and 
contribution to the Company over a period of almost six years, the excellent 2013 financial results and confident outlook for 2014. 
The Committee’s determinations, which are consistent with the Committee’s termination policy, are set out below.
Mr. Hetherington will not receive any payment in respect of salary or benefits (or compensation in lieu) in respect of any period after 
March 1, 2014 or receive any compensation for loss of office.
As set out above, the Committee determined that no 2014 base salary increase or 2014 PSP grant would be appropriate given Mr. 
Hetherington’s scheduled departure date. In addition, he will not receive any 2014 short term incentive in respect of his period of 
employment to, or in respect of any period after, March 1, 2014.
Those elements of Mr. Hetherington’s EAIP awards from previous years that were compulsorily deferred into shares under the EAIP 
will vest in accordance with the plan rules at the end of the relevant three year vesting periods (see table below).
The Committee determined that the 2012 PSP award will vest on the departure date in line with the terms of the plan rules taking into 
account the applicable performance conditions and the proportion of the performance period (approximately two thirds) during which 
Mr. Hetherington remained in employment (see table below). The 2013 PSP awards will lapse on the departure date.

The figures above represent the number of shares vesting taking into account the applicable performance conditions (resulting in the vesting of 75% of the shares 
under the original award) and, in addition, the proportion of the performance period (approximately two thirds) in which Mr. Hetherington remained in employment.
Vested SAR awards will, in accordance with the terms of the PSP , remain exercisable for a period of 12 months after the departure 
date, and if not exercised will lapse.
All other unvested equity awards, namely the 2013 PSP award and 2013 Sharesave, will lapse when Mr. Hetherington ceases to be 
employed.
Mr. Hetherington was employed throughout performance period for the 2013 EAIP and 2011 PSP , therefore payments under the 
2013 EAIP and vesting of the 2011 PSP will be made as normal.
The Committee determined that it would be appropriate to continue the same level of medical cover under the Company’s private 
medical scheme until December 31, 2014, and to pay his reasonable legal costs incurred in connection with his departure 
arrangements.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director remuneration policy
Details of fee levels for 2014 compared to 2013 are set out below. Taking into account market positioning and the need to be able to 
attract high quality, appropriately qualified individuals, it was agreed to increase the basic fee payable to Non-Executive Directors to 
£93,000. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors will continue to receive 25% of their total fees in the form of shares. Given his 
significant shareholding in Shire, the current Chairman will continue to receive his fee in the form of cash only.
Basic fees (effective January 1, 2014) 2014 2013
Chairman (inclusive of all committees) £390,000
1
£390,000
Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (inclusive of Non-Executive Director fee) £98,000 £98,000
Non-Executive Director £93,000 £86,400
1 
Given that the current Chairman (Matthew Emmens) will retire from the Board at the Company’s AGM on April 29, 2014, no increase will be made to the Chairman’s 
fee for 2014. The Chairman designate (Susan Kilsby) who will resume the role of Chairman after the conclusion of the AGM, will be paid an annualised Chairman fee 
of £365,000 (effective April 29, 2014) to reflect that she is new in role.
In addition to the basic Non-Executive Director fee, a committee fee will be paid to the members and Chairman of the following 
Committees:

b) 2013 single total figure of remuneration for Executive Directors (subject to audit)
The summary table of 2013 remuneration for the Executive Directors comprises a number of key components which are set out in 
further detail in the relevant sections that follow.
In both 2012 and 2013, the totals were significantly impacted by share price growth between the PSP grant and vesting dates. This 
alignment with shareholders and the significant role that long term variable remuneration plays in the overall remuneration package is 
consistent with our remuneration policy and the long term nature of our business. In relation to 2013, stock price growth on the 2011 
PSP awards from £17 .23 to £27 .00 (the average Ordinary Share price over the last quarter of 2013) accounts for 40% of the total 
remuneration figure for Mr. Hetherington.

2013 corporate scorecard for Executive Directors
The 2013 EAIP continued to use a scorecard approach with key corporate performance measures supporting Shire’s strategic goals 
as set out below. The non financial targets are considered by the Company to be commercially sensitive on the grounds that the 
disclosure of these targets could damage the Company’s commercial interests.
Financial goals: Net product sales
1
 – $4.9B  
(Actual: $4.847B)
Non GAAP operating income
1
 – $1.6B 
(Actual: $1.755B)
Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC
1
 – 14.9%  
(Actual: 15.6%)
Other strategic priorities: Strengthening the commercial portfolio Expanding the development pipeline Enhancing organizational effectiveness
Performance outcomes
Performance against financial goals:
Net product sales
1
• Strong revenues from net product sales in 2013 being up 10% to $4.8 billion; and
• Six of our products delivered double digit growth year-on-year, with further detail set out in the Review of our business section earlier 
in this report.
Non GAAP operating income
1
• Non GAAP operating income was up 19% to $1.755 billion (2012: $1.474 billion), demonstrating the progress made against our 
strategy to grow our business in an efficient manner, delivering value to stakeholders and also giving us the ability to provide more 
innovative treatments to more patients.
Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC
1
• Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC grew by 180 basis points in 2013 over 2012 as higher product sales (up 10%) and continued operating 
leverage led to an increase in margins.
Performance against other strategic priorities:
Strengthening the commercial portfolio
Strategic priority: Drive optimum performance from our currently marketed products to optimize revenue growth and cash generation.
Achievements against this objective in 2013 include:
• Acquisition of ViroPharma (adding CINRYZE, prophylactic treatment of Hereditary Angioedema);
• Geographic expansion in Asia (office opened in Japan and presence established in South Korea and China);
• Launch of ELVANSE (marketed as VYVANSE in the US) in a further four European countries; and
• Positive opinion received on the VPRIV Summary of Product Characteristics from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use of the European Medicines Agency.
Expanding the development pipeline
Strategic priority: Build our future assets through both R&D and Business Development to deliver innovation and value for the future.
Achievements against the 2013 objective include:
• Prioritization of the pipeline to focus on the development of innovative specialist medicines that have the best chance of clinical and 
commercial success together with early stage research in rare diseases;
• Positive top-line results evaluating the efficacy and safety of LDX versus placebo in adults with BED;
• Top-line data results announced from OPUS-2 study for lifitegrast;
• Acquisition of SARcode Bioscience Inc. (Dry Eye Disease); Premacure AB (Retinopathy of Prematurity) and Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc. 
(Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa); and
• Enrolment of the first patient in its Phase 2 clinical program for VASCUGEL.

Achievements against the 2013 objective include:
• Implementation of our revised governance model (In-line and Pipeline Committees) to ensure enterprise-wide decision making and 
resource allocation that is overseen by the Executive Committee; and
• Simplification of our business model which has reset our cost base and generated the capacity to invest in future growth.
2013 EAIP award decisions
In determining 2013 EAIP awards for the Executive Directors, the Committee considered performance against the key corporate 
performance measures, including the achievements set out above, as well as performance against personal objectives. The 
Committee approved the awards set out in the following table.
Executive Director Award % of 2013 base salary % of target opportunity % of maximum opportunity
Flemming Ornskov
1
$1,600,000 145% 162% 81%
Angus Russell
2
$200,000 44% 52% 26%
Graham Hetherington £425,000 89% 111% 55%
EAIP award figures are rounded to the nearest whole percentage.
75% of the award is payable in cash (non-pensionable) and 25% is deferred into shares and released after a period of 3 years (subject to the participant’s employment 
not being terminated for cause).
The release of deferred shares will include dividend shares representing any accrued dividends.
1 
Dr. Ornskov’s EAIP opportunity was based on his prevailing salary for periods in the CEO designate and CEO role during 2013.
2 
The Committee had previously determined that Mr. Russell should receive no EAIP award relating to the portion of his contractual notice period not served. The EAIP 
award therefore reflects time proration and an assessment of performance to the date of his retirement. The figures in the table above are expressed as percentages 
of actual 2013 base salary (the value included in the 2013 summary remuneration table) and the EAIP opportunity actually available taking into account the portion of 
his contractual notice period served in 2013. This EAIP award is also set out in Part 3(e) in the context of Angus Russell’s retirements arrangements.
Long term incentives
The value represents the market value of the 2011 PSP awards for Graham Hetherington (vesting in February 2014) and the market 
value of the 2011 and 2012 PSP awards for Angus Russell that vested following his retirement
In accordance with the Schedule 8 Regulations, the summary of 2013 remuneration figure includes the value of the 2011 PSP awards 
(performance period 2010 – 2013), which vest in February 2014. For Angus Russell, the 2013 remuneration figure includes both the 
value of his 2011 and 2012 PSP awards, which vested on June 5, 2013, following an assessment of performance to his retirement 
date by the Committee in accordance with the PSP plan rules.
As previously disclosed, the Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to the performance conditions to reflect significant 
one off items which occur during the performance period. In respect of the 2011 PSP awards, the Committee carried out a 
comprehensive review of potential adjusting events (SAEs) against pre-existing guidelines.
Consistent with the adjustments made in respect of the 2010 PSP awards (as disclosed in last year’s DRR), the Committee 
determined that the same two 2012 SAE adjustments would be appropriate for the 2011 PSP awards:
1. to exclude the impact of the acquisition of Advanced BioHealing which had a short term negative impact on Non GAAP EBITDA 
and Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC performance in 2013. This acquisition was completed in June 2011 after the 2011 performance 
matrix had been set and led to the creation of a new Regenerative Medicine business unit centered around the DERMAGRAFT 
product. In line with our refined strategy to prioritize investments that have the greatest clinical and commercial value, the 
Company subsequently announced on January 17 , 2014 that it had sold its DERMAGRAFT assets. Without DERMAGRAFT and 
its assets, Regenerative Medicine will no longer be one of the Company’s Business Units; and
2. to exclude the impact of the Japanese tsunami on Fosrenol sales in that market which benefited Shire’s Non GAAP EBITDA and 
Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC performance in 2012: the Company’s royalty and licensing revenue for Fosrenol benefited from 
increased sales made by the Company’s partner in Japan, following the tsunami which disrupted a key competitor’s supply chain.
The Committee noted that these adjustments did not in fact result in a change in the vesting outcome under the performance 
conditions applicable to the 2011 PSP awards (either individually or taken together).
80 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Graham Hetherington – vesting of 2011 PSP awards
The table below sets out a summary of the performance outcome and the resulting gross estimated vesting value for the 2011 PSP 
awards for Mr. Hetherington. This estimate is on the basis of an average share price over the last quarter of 2013 of £27 .00, given that 
the 2011 PSP awards (2011 – 2014 performance period) vest following the date of this report. There is no scheduled vesting of PSP 
awards for Dr. Ornskov until 2016 when his 2013 PSP awards (2013 – 2016 performance period) vest subject to the achievement of 
applicable performance conditions.

Angus Russell – vesting of 2011 and 2012 PSP awards
Under the PSP rules approved by shareholders in respect of a retiree, unvested share awards vest on retirement on a pro rata basis 
and subject to the early assessment of performance against the relevant performance conditions, which were measured as at the 
date of retirement. This treatment was applied to Mr. Russell’s outstanding 2011 and 2012 PSP grants.
Performance outcome
For the 2011 and 2012 PSP awards, performance was assessed over the period from the grant date up until April 30, 2013 (being the 
date of retirement) with the awards vesting on June 5, 2013.
In respect of the 2011 PSP awards, the Committee concluded that the same two 2012 SAE adjustments would be appropriate for Mr. 
Russell. These SAEs were not relevant to Mr. Russell’s 2012 PSP awards as the events were known at the time of setting targets for 
the 2012 PSP awards.
Taking into account performance against the performance matrices as well as an overall assessment of the underlying performance 
of the Company, the Committee determined that, in respect of the 2011 and 2012 PSP awards, an aggregate number of shares with 
a value on the date of vesting of $4,928,432 would vest.
Other payments
Represents the value of any other payments received during the year

No payments (other the payments made to Angus Russell set out on the previous page) have been made to past Directors for the 
relevant financial year for the purposes of the Schedule 8 Regulations.
g) Directors’ shareholdings and scheme interests (subject to audit)
Employee share ownership is an important means to support alignment of employee interests with those of shareholders
The Committee believes that employee share ownership is an important means to support long term commitment to the Company 
and the alignment of employee interests with those of shareholders.
The interests of the Executive Directors and other senior executives are closely aligned with those of other shareholders in this regard 
through the operation of the Company’s long term incentive plan and, for the Executive Committee, the deferral of one quarter of any 
EAIP award into shares for a period of three years. These remuneration elements constitute a significant proportion of their individual 
remuneration packages.
The CEO, CFO and other members of the Executive Committee are encouraged to own shares in the Company equivalent to 200%, 
150% and 100% of base salary, respectively, within a five year period following their appointment. All shares beneficially owned by an 
executive or deferred under the EAIP count towards achieving these guidelines. The Committee reviews share ownership levels 
annually for this group. Current shareholding levels for Directors are set out in the table below.

The Company also operates broad-based share plans (a Sharesave scheme in the UK and an ESPP in the US and other countries) 
to encourage wider share ownership among the Company’s employees.
Awards under the Company’s long term incentive plans and broad-based share plans are satisfied either by market purchased 
shares which are held in an employee benefit trust or the issue of new shares within the limits agreed by shareholders when the 
plans were approved. These limits comply with the Association of British Insurers’ guidelines which require that no more than 10% 
of a company’s issued share capital may be used for employee share plans in any ten year period. Within the 10% limit, up to 5% 
may be used for discretionary employee share plans under these guidelines.

The number of PSA and SAR awards granted in 2011 and subsequently is calculated using an approach based on the average three day closing mid-market share price 
at the time of grant. The number of PSA and SAR awards granted in 2010 was calculated using an approach based on the average closing mid-market share price over 
the prior twelve month period.
1 
Awards are over Ordinary Shares, except where the award type is marked as an ADS award. One ADS is equal to three Ordinary Shares.
2 
The maximum SAR and PSA awards are granted and, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, adjusted at the date of vesting.
3 
Performance conditions attached to SAR and PSA awards granted from 2010 onwards are Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC and Non GAAP EBITDA. Further information 
on the 2011 and 2013 performance matrices can be found on pages 81 and 83 respectively. For reference, the performance matrices for the 2010 and 2012 awards 
are set out on the following page. In all cases, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify 
the vesting of the award.
4 
In accordance with the plan rules, the vested PSA awards have been increased to reflect the dividends paid by Shire in the period from the grant date to the vesting date.
5 
The exercise price for SAR awards granted in 2011 and subsequently is equal to the three day average up to and including the date of award, of the closing 
mid-market share price. The exercise price for SAR awards granted in 2010 is the closing mid-market share price on the date of award. The grant price for all PSA 
awards is the closing mid-market share price on the date of award.
6 
On November 1, 2013, Dr. Ornskov was granted an option over ADSs pursuant to the Shire ESPP . Dr. Ornskov elected to save $480.76 per fortnight. In accordance 
with the plan rules the option price is the lower of 85% of the fair market value of an ADS on November 1, 2013, and 85% of the fair market value of an ADS on the 
exercise date, October 31, 2014.
7 
All information is presented as at April 30, 2013 (being the date of Mr. Russell’s retirement). The 2011 and 2012 PSP awards vested on June 5, 2013 following  
Mr. Russell’s retirement. The vesting outcome is set out on page 81 of this report.

h) TSR performance graph
The graph below shows the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) for Shire and the FTSE 100 Index over the five year period ending 
December 31, 2013. TSR is calculated as the change (indexed) between the fourth quarter TSR in the relevant year and the base 
year. The FTSE 100 Index reflects the 100 largest quoted companies by market capitalisation in the United Kingdom and has been 
chosen because the FTSE 100 represents the broad market Index within which the Company’s shares are traded.

Terms of reference
The Committee is responsible for agreeing the broad remuneration policy for the organization and the individual packages for the 
Chairman, Executive Directors, and certain other senior leadership roles. Within the agreed policy, the Committee determines the

applicable. The Committee also determines performance targets applicable to the Company’s annual bonus and long term incentive 
plans and has oversight of the Company’s share incentive schemes. In October 2013, the Committee reviewed its terms of reference 
and a number of minor changes were made to reflect various governance developments. The revised terms of reference were 
approved by the Board in December 2013 and are available in full on the Company’s website www.shire.com.

Advisors
In discharging its responsibilities in 2013, the Committee was materially assisted by those employees performing the roles of Human 
Resources Director and Vice President, Total Rewards. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), appointed by the 
Committee, continued to serve as independent external advisor to the Committee, following a competitive tendering process in early 
2012. PwC also provided global consultancy services to the Company in 2013, primarily in respect of tax matters. Fees paid to PwC 
in relation to remuneration services provided to the Committee totalled £201,200 in 2013 and were determined based on the scope 
and nature of the projects undertaken for the Committee.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received by PwC in relation to executive remuneration matters during the year was 
independent. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards 
against any potential conflicts. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group which operates a code of conduct in 
relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.

Directors 
Appointment and replacement
Directors may be appointed by the 
Company by ordinary resolution or by the 
Board. Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed ordinarily for a term of two 
years, subject to shareholder approval. 
Re-appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors following the expiry of their term 
of appointment is subject to Board 
approval. The Board may from time-to-
time appoint one or more Directors for 
such period and on such terms as it may 
determine and may also revoke or 
terminate any such appointment.
The Company’s Articles of Association (the 
“Articles”) provide that at each Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) all those 
Directors who have been appointed by the 
Board since the last AGM, or who held 
office at the time of the two preceding 
AGMs and who did not retire at either of 
them, or who held office with the 
Company, other than executive office, for a 
continuous period of nine years or more at 
the date of the meeting, shall retire from 
office and may offer themselves for 
re-election by the members. 
Notwithstanding the provisions in the 
Articles, in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, all Directors 
will be subject to annual re-election.
Powers
Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the 
“Companies Act”), the Articles and 
directions given by the Company in general 
meeting by special resolution, the business 
of the Company is managed by the Board 
which may exercise all the powers of the 
Company whether relating to the 
management of the business of the 
Company or not. In particular, the Board 
may exercise all the powers of the 
Company to borrow money and to 
mortgage or charge all or any part of the 
undertaking, property and assets (present 
and future) and uncalled capital of the 
Company and, subject to the Companies 
Act, to issue debentures and other 
securities, whether outright or as collateral 
security, for a debt, liability or obligation of 
the Company or of a third party.
Liability insurance and indemnification
In the year under review the Group 
maintained an insurance policy for its 
Directors and Officers in respect of 
liabilities arising out of any act, error or 
omission whilst acting in their capacity as 
Directors or Officers. Qualifying third party 
indemnity provisions were also in place 
during the year under review for the benefit 
of Directors in relation to certain losses and 
liabilities which they may potentially incur to 
third parties in the course of their duties. 
These remain in force at the date of this 
report.
Interests in material contracts
Other than the insurance/indemnity 
provisions disclosed under “Liability 
insurance and indemnification” above, 
none of the Directors had a material 
interest in any contract of significance to 
which the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings was a party during the 
period under review.
Dividends
Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act, the Company may by ordinary 
resolution from time-to-time, declare 
dividends not exceeding the amount 
recommended by the Board. Subject to 
the Companies Act, the Board may pay 
interim dividends, and also any fixed rate 
dividend, whenever the financial position of 
the Company, in the opinion of the Board, 
justifies its payment.
The Board may withhold payment of all or 
any part of any dividends or other monies 
payable in respect of the shares from a 
person with a 0.25% interest (as defined in 
the Articles) if such person has been 
served with a restriction notice (as defined 
in the Articles) after failure to provide the 
Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be 
provided under the Articles.
Shire has put in place income access 
share arrangements which enable 
shareholders to elect to receive their 
dividends from a Group company resident 
for tax purposes in the UK. Further details 
can be found in Note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
In respect of the six months to December 
31, 2013 the Board resolved to pay an 
interim dividend of 16.93 US cents (2012: 
14.60 US cents) per Ordinary Share. 
Together with the first interim dividend 
payment of 3.00 US cents (2012: 2.73 US 
cents) per Ordinary Share, this represents 
total dividends of 19.93 US cents (2012: 
17 .33 US cents) per Ordinary Share for the 
year ended December 31, 2013. 
ACS HR Solutions Share Plan Services 
(Guernsey) Limited (the “Trustee”), trustee 
of the Shire Employee Benefit Trust (the 
“Trust”), has waived its entitlement to any 
dividends which become due and payable 
from time-to-time in respect of shares or 
other securities which are registered in the 
name of the trustee or its nominee(s). Total 
dividends waived by the Trustee during the 
year amounted to £344,066.29.
Shares
Share capital
As at the year ended December 31, 2013, 
the Company’s issued share capital 
comprised 597 ,542,344 Ordinary Shares of 
5 pence each of which 9,823,536 Ordinary 
Shares were held in treasury. 
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Ordinary Shares are set out in the Articles 
which are available on the Company’s 
website. The Articles may only be 
amended by special resolution of the 
members of the Company.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Act, rights 
attached to any class of shares may be 
varied with written consent of the holders 
of not less than two thirds in nominal value 
of the issued shares of that class 
(calculated excluding any shares held in 
treasury) or with the sanction of a special 
resolution passed at a separate meeting 
of the holders of those shares. At each 
such separate general meeting, except 
an adjourned meeting, the quorum shall 
be two persons holding or representing 
by proxy not less than one third in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class 
(calculated excluding any shares held 
in treasury).

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Issuance of shares
Subject to applicable statutes and subject 
to and without prejudice to any rights 
attached to existing shares, shares may be 
issued with such rights and restrictions as 
the Company may by special resolution 
decide or, if no such resolution has been 
passed or so far as the resolution does not 
make specific provision, as the Board may 
decide. Subject to the Articles, the 
Companies Act and other shareholders’ 
rights, unissued shares are at the disposal 
of the Board.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of shares in the Company, except: (i) that 
certain restrictions may from time-to-time

Financial Conduct Authority whereby 
certain Directors and employees of the 
Company require the approval of the 
Company to deal in the Company’s

Voting 
It is the Company’s practice to hold a poll 
on every resolution at general meetings. 
Every member present in person or by 
proxy has, upon a poll, one vote for every 
share held by him. In the case of joint 
holders of a share the vote of the senior 
who tenders a vote, whether in person or 
by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion 
of the votes of the other joint holders and, 
for this purpose, seniority shall be 
determined by the order in which the 
names stand in the register of members in 
respect of the joint holding.
Restrictions on voting 
No member shall, unless the Board 
otherwise decides, be entitled to attend or 
vote at any general or class meeting in 
respect of any shares held if any call or 
other sum payable by that member 
remains unpaid. Also, a member may not 
be entitled to attend or vote if served with a 
restriction notice (as defined in the Articles).
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of 
securities that may result in restrictions 
on voting rights.
The Company maintains an American 
Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) program in 
the US. Each American Depositary Share 
(“ADS”) represents three Ordinary Shares. 
An ADS is evidenced by an ADR issued by 
Citibank, N.A. as Depositary, and is listed 
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 
Each ADS holder is entitled to the financial 
rights attached to such shares although 
the ADR Depositary is the registered 
holder of the underlying Ordinary Shares.
As at December 31, 2013, the Trust held 
0.75% of the issued share capital of the 
Company on trust for the benefit of 
participants in the Company’s employee 
share plans. The voting rights in relation to 
these shares are exercised by the Trustee. 
The Trustee may vote or abstain from 
voting in any way it thinks fit and in doing 
so may take into account both financial 
and non-financial interests of the 
beneficiaries of the Trust or  
their dependants. Historically the Trustee 
has not exercised its right to vote.
Purchase of own shares
At its AGM held on April 30, 2013 the 
Company was authorized, until the earlier 
of July 29, 2014 or the conclusion of the 
2014 AGM, to make market purchases 
of up to 55,741,587 of its own Ordinary 
Shares. Further details regarding 
purchases by the Company of its own 
shares can be found in Note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Substantial shareholdings
As at the date of this report, the Company 
had been notified of the following holdings 
of 3% or more in the issued Ordinary 
Share capital of the Company:
Number of 
Ordinary  
Shares
Percentage of 
issued share 
capital
(1)
BlackRock, Inc. 55,345,849 9.99%
FMR LLC 27,861,459 4.95%

Significant agreements
The following significant agreements 
contain provisions entitling counterparties 
to exercise the following rights in the event 
of a change of control of the Company:
• Under the $1,200 million credit facility 
agreement dated November 23, 2010 
between, amongst others, the Company 
and a number of its subsidiaries, 
Barclays Bank plc (as the facility agent) 
and the banks and financial institutions 
named therein as lenders, upon a 
change of control any lender may, 
following not less than 30 days’ notice, 
cancel its commitments and require 
prepayment of its participation in any 
outstanding loans. For these purposes, a 
change of control occurs if any person or 
group of persons acting in concert gains 
the ability to control more than half the 
votes at a general meeting of the 
Company or holds more than half the 
equity share capital of the Company. 
A waiver of the mandatory prepayment 
provision would require the consent of 
each lender under the agreement. As 
at February 24, 2014, $150 million was 
outstanding under the agreement.
• Under the $2,600 million term loan 
agreement dated November 11, 2013 
between, amongst others, the Company 
and a number of its subsidiaries, Morgan 
Stanley Bank International Limited (as the 
facility agent) and the banks and financial 
institutions named therein as lenders, 
upon a change of control any lender 
may, following not less than 30 days’ 
notice, cancel its commitments and 
require prepayment of its participation in 
any outstanding loans. For these 
purposes, a change of control occurs if 
any person or group of persons acting in 
concert gains the ability to control more 
than half the votes at a general meeting 
of the Company or holds more than half 
the equity share capital of the Company. 
A waiver of the mandatory prepayment 
provision would require the consent of 
each lender under the agreement. As at 
February 24, 2014, $1,200 million was 
outstanding under the agreement.

94 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Opinion on financial statements of Shire plc
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements of Shire plc and subsidiaries (together the “Group”):
•  Present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2013 and the results of its operations 
and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America; and
• have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
The financial statements comprise consolidated balance sheet, the related consolidated statements of income, equity and 
comprehensive income and cash flows and the related notes 1 to 31. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement on page 93 that the company is a going concern. 
We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements 
is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
The acquisition of SARcode BioSciences Inc 
(“SARcode”)
The risk that the acquisition accounting, including the 
valuation of acquired intangible assets and contingent 
consideration, in respect of the Group’s acquisition of 
SARcode is not performed correctly.
The Directors determination of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of SARcode is included 
at note 4.
We have challenged the key assumptions made by the Directors in determining the fair value of the 
consideration and the allocation of the purchase price including:
• The level of post-launch cash flows and potential market size
•  The probability that certain key milestones (such as the outcome of pharmaceutical trials) will be 
achieved
• Valuation assumptions such as the discount rate and tax rate
In doing so we have utilised experts in the areas of valuations and taxation and have considered the 
judgments in light of external data such as analyst expectations, market size and comparator 
companies as well as considering the appropriateness of the process and controls adopted by 
management in determining the acquisition accounting. 
Carrying value of In Process Research and 
Development Intangible Assets
There is a risk that in their formal annual and ongoing 
assessment of the carrying value of Intangible Assets, 
the Directors make inappropriate judgments in their 
impairment analysis.
We have considered management’s impairment analysis, understood and challenged the key 
judgments and sensitivities and the impact that each of these have in determining whether an 
impairment exists.
In particular we focussed on the carrying value of In-Process Research and Development intangible 
assets and in doing so challenged Management’s assessment of the probability of success of 
ongoing clinical trials and the launch of new products in the market.
In doing so we have consulted with our own experts in valuations and have considered the 
judgments in light of external data.
Rebates and sales deductions
The Directors are required to make judgments in 
respect of the level of rebates and other sales 
deductions that will be realised against the Group’s 
sales. There is a risk that these judgments are not 
appropriate and as a result rebate liabilities and sales 
deductions are recorded at an incorrect level.
We have considered the Group’s process for making judgments in this area, performed an analysis 
of the historical accuracy of judgments and have understood and challenged the key elements of 
judgments made in the period in light of externally verifiable data and industry practice.
Impact of Complex Group structure on tax 
provisioning
As the Group transacts globally within a complex group 
structure, significant judgment is required in determining 
the level of tax provisions.
We have considered the professional advice obtained by management, reviewed correspondence with 
taxation authorities in key jurisdictions and have utilised taxation experts to both consider and 
challenge the level of provision for individual potential tax exposures.
Independent auditor’s report
WWW.SHIRE.COM ANNUAL REPORT 2013 SHIRE PLC 95
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Governance Financial statements The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 60.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and 
not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect 
to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope 
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the company to be $60 million, which is below 5% of normalised pre-tax profit, and below 2% of equity. 
Pre-tax profit has been normalised by removing the impact of one off items such as impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and 
the derecognition of the group’s contingent consideration liability in respect of SARcode.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $3 million, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment, including internal control, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement. Audit work to respond to the risks of material misstatement was performed directly by the audit 
engagement team.
Our Group audit scope focused on three operating locations subject to a full scope audit for the year ended December 31, 2013, 
including:
• The US operations of the Group (excluding Regenerative Medicine) based in Lexington MA, US and Chesterbrook PA, US
•  UK & Ireland operations of the Group based in Basingstoke, UK and Dublin, Ireland
• Shire Deutschland based in Berlin, Germany
Together with the Group Functions, which were also subject to a full scope audit for the year ended December 31, 2013, these locations 
represent the principal business units of the Group and account for 94% of the Group’s total assets and 82% of the Group’s revenue. 
Audits of these locations are performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of Group materiality appropriate to 
the relative scale of the business concerned. 
The audit procedures in respect of remaining operating locations included discussions with local management, analytical reviews, 
and the consideration of findings from Internal Audit reviews.
In addition, audits are expected to be performed for local statutory purposes at a further 26 locations, which represent a further 11% 
of the Group’s revenue. Audits of these locations are performed at a local materiality level calculated by reference to the scale of the 
business concerned.
The Group audit team follows a programme of planned site visits that is designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor or his 
designate visits each of the full scope locations during the year. In addition to this the group audit team will visit other locations not 
in full scope on a rotational basis over a three year period.
Opinion on other matters 
In our opinion:
• The Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 that would 
have been applied were the Group incorporated in the United Kingdom;
• the information given in the Directors Report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements are prepared is consistent with 
the Financial Statements; and
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 that would have been applied were the Group incorporated in the United Kingdom.

96 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
•  proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or proper returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review certain elements of the Directors Remuneration Report. We have nothing to report 
arising from these matters or our review. 
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the company acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

1. Description of operations
Shire plc and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as either 
“Shire”, or the “Company”) is a leading specialty 
biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and 
marketing innovative specialty medicines that address significant 
unmet patient needs. 
The Company has grown through acquisition, completing a 
series of major transactions that have brought therapeutic, 
geographic and pipeline growth and diversification. The 
Company will continue to evaluate companies, products and 
pipeline opportunities that offer a good strategic fit and have the 
potential to deliver demonstrable value to all of the Company’s 
stakeholders: patients, physicians, policy makers, payors, 
investors and employees.
2. Summary of significant  
accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the 
accounts of Shire plc, all of its subsidiary undertakings and the 
Income Access Share trust, after elimination of intercompany 
accounts and transactions. They have been prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the 
United States of America (“US GAAP”) and US Securities and 
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations for annual reporting.
(b) Use of estimates in consolidated financial statements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in 
conformity with US GAAP and SEC regulations, requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and 
assumptions are primarily made in relation to the valuation of 
intangible assets, sales deductions, income taxes (including 
provisions for uncertain tax positions and the realization of 
deferred tax assets), provisions for litigation and legal 
proceedings, contingent consideration receivable from product 
divestments, contingent consideration payable in respect of 
business combinations and asset purchases and assets held for 
sale. If actual results differ from the Company’s estimates, or to 
the extent these estimates are adjusted in future periods, the 
Company’s results of operations could either benefit from, or be 
adversely affected by, any such change in estimate.
(c) Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following 
conditions are met:
• there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or arrangement;
• delivery of products has occurred or services have 
been rendered;
• the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and
• collectability is reasonably assured.
Where applicable, all revenues are stated net of value added and 
similar taxes, and trade discounts. No revenue is recognized for 
consideration, the value or receipt of which is dependent on 
future events or future performance.
The Company’s principal revenue streams and their respective 
accounting treatments are discussed below:
Product sales
Revenue for the sale of products is recognized when delivery has 
occurred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
have been transferred to the customer. Provisions for rebates, 
product returns and discounts to customers are provided for as 
reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales are 
recorded. The provisions made at the time of revenue recognition 
are based on historical experience and updated for changes in 
facts and circumstances including the impact of new legislation. 
The provisions are recognized as a reduction to revenues.
Royalty income
Royalty income relating to licensed technology is recognized 
when the licensee sells the underlying product, with the amount 
of royalty income recorded based on sales information received 
from the relevant licensee. The Company estimates sales 
amounts and related royalty income based on the historical 
product information for any period that the sales information is 
not available from the relevant licensee.
Licensing revenues
Other revenue includes revenues derived from product out-
licensing arrangements, which typically consist of an initial upfront 
payment on inception of the license and subsequent milestone 
payments contingent on the achievement of certain clinical and 
sales milestones. Product out-licensing arrangements often 
require the Company to provide multiple deliverables to the 
licensee.
Initial license fees received in connection with product out-
licensing agreements entered into prior to January 1, 2011 are 
deferred and recognized over the period in which the Company 
has continuing substantive performance obligations, typically the 
period over which the Company participates in the development 
of the out-licensed product, even where such fees are non-
refundable and not creditable against future royalty payments.
For product out-licensing arrangements entered into, or subject 
to material modification, after January 1, 2011, consideration 
received is allocated between each of the separable elements in 
the arrangement using the relative selling price method. An 
element is considered separable if it has value to the customer on 
a stand-alone basis. The selling price used for each separable 
element will be based on vendor specific objective evidence 
(“VSOE”) if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, 
or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor third party evidence 
is available. Revenue is then recognized as each of the separable 
elements to which the revenue has been allocated is delivered.
Milestone payments which are non-refundable, non creditable 
and contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are 
recognized as revenues either on achievement of such 
milestones if the milestones are considered substantive or over 
the period the Company has continuing substantive performance 
obligations, if the milestones are not considered substantive. If 
milestone payments are creditable against future royalty 
payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the 
period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.
106 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM 2. Summary of significant  
accounting policies continued
(d) Sales deductions 
(i) Rebates
Rebates primarily consist of statutory rebates to state Medicaid 
agencies and contractual rebates with health-maintenance 
organizations. These rebates are based on price differentials 
between a base price and the selling price. As a result, rebates 
generally increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life 
of the product (as prices increase). Provisions for rebates are 
recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the 
related sales are recorded, with the amount of the rebate based 
on the Company’s best estimate if any uncertainty exists over the 
unit rebate amount, and with estimates of future utilization derived 
from historical trends.
(ii) Returns
The Company estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that 
will result in a return, based on historical trends and when 
applicable, specific factors affecting certain products at the 
balance sheet date. The accrual is recorded as a reduction to 
revenue in the same period as the related sales are recorded. 
(iii) Coupons 
The Company uses coupons as a form of sales incentive. An 
accrual is established based on the Company’s expectation of 
the level of coupon redemption, estimated using historical trends. 
The accrual is recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same 
period as the related sales are recorded or the date the coupon is 
offered, if later than the date the related sales are recorded.
(iv) Discounts
The Company offers cash discounts to customers for the early 
payment of receivables which are recorded as reductions to 
revenue and accounts receivable in the same period as the 
related sale is recorded.
(v) Wholesaler chargebacks
The Company has contractual agreements whereby it supplies 
certain products to third parties at predetermined prices. 
Wholesalers acting as intermediaries in these transactions are 
reimbursed by the Company if the predetermined prices are less 
than the prices paid by the wholesaler to the Company. Accruals 
for wholesaler chargebacks, which are based on historical trends, 
are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the 
related sales are recorded.
(e) Collaborative arrangements
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements to develop 
and commercialize drug candidates. These collaborative 
arrangements often require up-front, milestone, royalty or profit 
share payments, or a combination of these, with payments often 
contingent upon the success of the related development and 
commercialization efforts. Collaboration agreements entered into 
by the Company may also include expense reimbursements or 
other such payments to the collaborating partner.
The Company reports costs incurred and revenue generated 
from transactions with third parties as well as payments between 
parties to collaborative arrangements either on a gross or net 
basis, depending on the characteristics of the collaborative 
relationship.
(f) Cost of product sales
Cost of product sales includes the cost of purchasing finished 
product for sale, the cost of raw materials and manufacturing for 
those products that are manufactured by the Company, shipping 
and handling costs, depreciation and amortization of intangible 
assets in respect of favorable manufacturing contracts. Royalties 
payable on products to which the Company does not own the 
rights are also included in Cost of product sales.
(g) Leased assets
The costs of operating leases are charged to operations on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term, even if rental payments are 
not made on such a basis.
Assets acquired under capital leases are included in the 
consolidated balance sheet as property, plant and equipment 
and are depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease or 
their useful lives. The capital element of future lease payments is 
recorded as a liability, while the interest element is charged to 
operations over the period of the lease to produce a level yield on 
the balance of the capital lease obligation.
(h) Advertising expense
The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred. 
Advertising costs amounted to $60.9 million and $85.8 million for 
the years to December 31, 2013 and 2012 respectively and were 
included within Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) 
expenses.
(i) R&D expense
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone 
payments made to third parties for in-licensed products that have 
not yet received marketing approval and for which no alternative 
future use has been identified are also expensed as incurred.
Milestone payments made to third parties on and subsequent to 
regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets, and 
amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product.
(j) Valuation and impairment of long-lived assets other than 
goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets and investments
The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets 
other than goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets and 
investments for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the relevant 
assets may not be recoverable. When such a determination is 
made, management’s estimate of undiscounted cash flows to be 
generated by the use and ultimate disposition of these assets is 
compared to the carrying value of the assets to determine 
whether the carrying value is recoverable. If the carrying value is 
deemed not to be recoverable, the amount of the impairment 
recognized in the consolidated financial statements is determined 
by estimating the fair value of the relevant assets and recording 
an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value 
exceeds the estimated fair value. This fair value is usually 
determined based on estimated discounted cash flows.
(k) Finance costs of debt
Finance costs relating to debt issued are recorded as a deferred 
charge and amortized to the consolidated statements of income 
over the period to the earliest redemption date of the debt, using 
the effective interest rate method. On extinguishment of the 
related debt, any unamortized deferred financing costs are 
written off and charged to interest expense in the consolidated 
statements of income.

2. Summary of significant  
accounting policies continued
(l) Foreign currency
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated 
into the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary in which 
they arise at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant 
functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Transaction gains and losses, other than those 
related to current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, are 
recognized in arriving at income from operations before income 
taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees. 
Transaction gains and losses arising on foreign currency 
denominated current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
included within income taxes in the consolidated statements of 
income.
The results of operations for subsidiaries, whose functional 
currency is not the US dollar, are translated into the US dollar at 
the average rates of exchange during the period, with the 
subsidiaries’ balance sheets translated at the rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. The cumulative effect of exchange rate 
movements is included in a separate component of Other 
comprehensive income.
Foreign currency exchange transaction losses included in 
consolidated statements of income in the years to December 31, 
2013 and 2012 amounted to $8.7 million and $3.5 million 
respectively.
(m) Income taxes
Uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated 
financial statements for positions which are considered more 
likely than not of being sustained, based on the technical merits 
of the position on audit by the tax authorities. The measurement 
of the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial 
statements is based upon the largest amount of tax benefit that, 
in management’s judgment, is greater than 50% likely of being 
realized based on a cumulative probability assessment of the 
possible outcomes. The Company recognizes interest relating to 
unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible 
amounts. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured 
using the enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in 
which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, 
in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some 
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
(n) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is based upon net income attributable 
to Shire plc divided by the weighted average number of Ordinary 
Shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share 
is based upon net income attributable to Shire plc adjusted for 
the impact of interest expense on convertible debt on an 
“if-converted” basis (when the effect is dilutive and prior to the 
actual conversion or redemption of debt) divided by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary Share equivalents outstanding 
during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of all potential 
Ordinary Shares equivalents that were outstanding during the 
year. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect 
would be to increase diluted earnings per share or reduce the 
diluted loss per share. 
(o) Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation represents the cost of share-based 
awards granted to employees. The Company measures share-
based compensation cost for awards classified as equity at the 
grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award. 
Predominantly all of the Company’s awards have service and/or 
performance conditions and the fair values of these awards are 
estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. 
For share-based compensation awards which cliff vest, the 
Company recognizes the cost of the relevant share based 
payment award as an expense on a straight-line basis (net of 
estimated forfeitures) over the employee’s requisite service 
period. For those share-based compensation awards with a 
graded vesting schedule, the Company recognizes the cost of 
the relevant share based payment award as an expense on a 
straight-line basis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the requisite 
service period for the entire award (that is, over the requisite 
service period for the last separately vesting portion of the award). 
The share based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of 
product sales, R&D, and SG&A in the consolidated statements of 
income based on the employees’ respective functions.
The Company records deferred tax assets for awards that result 
in deductions on the Company’s income tax returns, based on 
the amount of compensation cost recognized and the 
Company’s statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which it will 
receive a deduction. Differences between the deferred tax assets 
recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax 
deduction reported on the Company’s income tax return are 
recorded in additional paid-in capital (if the tax deduction 
exceeds the deferred tax asset) or in the consolidated statements 
of income (if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction 
and no additional paid-in capital exists from previous awards).
The Company’s share-based compensation plans are described 
more fully in Note 28.
(p) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as short term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of ninety days or less. 
(q) Financial instruments – derivatives 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its 
exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with intercompany 
financing. These instruments consist of swap and forward foreign 
exchange contracts. The Company does not apply hedge 
accounting for these instruments. The fair values of these 
instruments are included on the balance sheet in current assets/
liabilities, with changes in the fair value recognized in the 
consolidated statements of income. The cash flows relating to 
these instruments are presented within net cash provided by 
operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows, 
unless the derivative instruments are economically hedging 
specific investing or financing activities.
108 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM 2. Summary of significant  
accounting policies continued 
(r) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost 
incurred in bringing each product to its present location and 
condition is based on purchase costs calculated on a first-in, 
first-out basis, including transportation costs.
Inventories include costs relating to both marketed products and, 
for certain products, cost incurred prior to regulatory approval. 
Inventories are capitalized prior to regulatory approval if the 
Company considers that it is probable that the US Food and 
Drug Administration (“FDA”) or another regulatory body will grant 
commercial and manufacturing approval for the relevant product, 
and it is probable that the value of capitalized inventories will be 
recovered through commercial sale.
Inventories are written down for estimated obsolescence or 
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the 
cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon 
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those 
anticipated, inventory adjustments may be required. 
(s) Assets held-for-sale
An asset or asset disposal group is classified as held-for-sale 
when, amongst other things, the Company has committed to a 
plan of disposition, the asset or asset disposal group is available 
for immediate sale, and the plan is not expected to change 
significantly. Assets held-for-sale are carried at the lower of their 
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
The Company does not record depreciation or amortization on 
assets classified as held-for-sale.
(t) Investments
The Company has certain investments in pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies.
Investments are accounted for using the equity method of 
accounting if the investment gives the Company the ability to 
exercise significant influence, but not control over, the investee. 
Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company 
has an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee 
between 20% and 50%, although other factors such as 
representation on the investee’s Board of Directors and the 
nature of commercial arrangements, are considered in 
determining whether the equity method of accounting is 
appropriate. Under the equity method of accounting, the 
Company records its investments in equity-method investees in 
the consolidated balance sheet under Investments and its share 
of the investees’ earnings or losses together with other-than-
temporary impairments in value under equity in earnings of equity 
method investees in the consolidated statements of income.
All other equity investments, which consist of investments for 
which the Company does not have the ability to exercise 
significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method or 
at fair value. Investments in private companies are carried at cost, 
less provisions for other-than-temporary impairment in value. For 
public companies that have readily determinable fair values, the 
Company classifies its equity investments as available-for-sale 
and, accordingly, records these investments at their fair values 
with unrealized holding gains and losses included in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, net of any 
related tax effect. Realized gains and losses, and declines in 
value of available-for-sale securities judged to be other-than-
temporary, are included in other income, net. The cost of 
securities sold is based on the specific identification method. 
Interest on securities classified as available-for-sale are included 
as interest income.
(u) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost reduced for 
impairment losses, net of accumulated depreciation. The cost of 
significant assets includes capitalized interest incurred during the 
construction period. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line 
basis at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated 
residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life as 
follows:
Buildings 15 to 50 years
Office furniture, fittings and 
equipment
3 to 10 years
Warehouse, laboratory and 
manufacturing equipment 3 to 15 years
The cost of land is not depreciated. Assets under the course of 
construction are not depreciated until the relevant assets are 
available and ready for their intended use.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to the 
consolidated statements of income as incurred. The costs of 
major renewals and improvements are capitalized. At the time 
property, plant and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, 
the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the 
asset and accumulated depreciation accounts. The profit or loss 
on such disposition is reflected in operating income.
(v) Goodwill and other intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
In business combinations completed subsequent to January 1, 
2009, goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the 
consideration given and the fair value of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities acquired. For business combinations completed 
prior to January 1, 2009 goodwill represents the excess of the fair 
value of the consideration given over the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is reviewed for impairment, 
at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the 
purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill for 
impairment, goodwill has been allocated to the Company’s 
reporting unit. Events or changes in circumstances which could 
trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to: 
significant underperformance of the reporting unit relative to 
expected historical or projected future operating results; 
significant changes in the manner of the Company’s use of 
acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and 
significant negative industry trends.

2. Summary of significant  
accounting policies continued 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying 
value of the reporting unit’s net assets (including allocated 
goodwill) to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the reporting 
unit’s carrying amount is greater than its fair value, a second step 
is performed whereby the portion of the reporting unit’s fair value 
relating to goodwill is compared to the carrying value of the 
reporting unit’s goodwill. The Company recognizes a goodwill 
impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of 
goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. In the year to December 
31, 2013 the Company has recorded an impairment charge of 
$198.9 million related to the goodwill allocated to the Company’s 
former Regenerative Medicine (“RM”) reporting unit. See Note 12 
for further details.
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets principally comprise intellectual property 
rights for products with a defined revenue stream, acquired 
product technology and IPR&D. Intellectual property rights for 
currently marketed products and acquired product technology 
are recorded at fair value and amortized over the estimated useful 
life of the related product, which ranges from 1 to 20 years 
(weighted average 10.1 years). IPR&D acquired through a 
business combination is capitalized as an indefinite lived 
intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the 
associated R&D efforts. IPR&D is reviewed for impairment using a 
“one-step” approach which compares the fair value of the IPR&D 
asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the 
IPR&D asset. Once the R&D efforts are completed the useful life 
of the relevant assets will be determined, and the IPR&D asset 
amortized over this useful economic life. 
The following factors, where applicable, are considered in 
estimating the useful lives of Other intangible assets:
• expected use of the asset;
• regulatory, legal or contractual provisions, including the 
regulatory approval and review process, patent issues and 
actions by government agencies;
• the effects of obsolescence, changes in demand, competing 
products and other economic factors, including the stability of 
the market, known technological advances, development of 
competing drugs that are more effective clinically or 
economically; 
• actions of competitors, suppliers, regulatory agencies or others 
that may eliminate current competitive advantages; and
• historical experience of renewing or extending similar 
arrangements.
When a number of factors apply to an intangible asset, these 
factors are considered in combination when determining the 
appropriate useful life for the relevant asset.
(w) Non-monetary transactions 
The Company enters into certain non-monetary transactions that 
involve either the granting of a license over the Company’s 
patents or the disposal of an asset or group of assets in 
exchange for a non–monetary asset, usually equity. The 
Company accounts for these transactions at fair value if the 
Company is able to determine the fair value within reasonable 
limits. To the extent the Company concludes that it is unable to 
determine the fair value of a transaction that transaction is 
accounted for at the recorded amounts of the assets exchanged. 
Management is required to exercise its judgment in determining 
whether or not the fair value of the asset received or given up can 
be determined.
(x) New accounting pronouncements adopted during the 
period
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets (Other than Goodwill)  
Impairment Testing
In July 2012 the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) 
issued guidance on the testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets 
for impairment. The guidance permits an entity to first assess 
qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or 
circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than 
not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less 
than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events 
or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than 
not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less 
than its carrying amount, performing the impairment test is 
unnecessary. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as a 
likelihood of more than 50 percent. An entity also has the option 
to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived 
intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing 
the impairment test and may resume performing the qualitative 
assessment in any subsequent period. The guidance has been 
adopted prospectively from January 1, 2013. The adoption of the 
guidance did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows.
Disclosure about offsetting assets and liabilities
In December 2011 the FASB issued guidance on disclosures 
about offsetting assets and liabilities. In January 2013 the FASB 
amended the previous guidance to clarify the scope of guidance 
issued in December 2011. The amended guidance requires 
entities to disclose both gross and net information about 
derivatives including bifurcated embedded derivatives, 
repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, 
and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that 
are either offset in accordance with FASB guidance on topics 
“Balance Sheet” and “Derivatives and Hedging” or subject to an 
enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement; to 
enable users of financial statements to understand the effects or 
potential effects of those arrangements on its financial position. 
The guidance has been adopted prospectively from January 1, 
2013. The adoption of the guidance did not impact the 
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations 
or cash flows. Enhanced disclosure of balance sheet offsetting as 
required by this guidance is included in Note 21.

accounting policies continued 
Amounts reclassified out of Comprehensive Income
In February 2013 the FASB issued guidance on reporting 
amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive 
income. The guidance requires entities to provide information 
about the amount reclassified out of comprehensive income by 
component and presents either on the face of the financial 
statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of 
other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net 
income, but only if the amount reclassified is required under US 
GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same 
reporting period. For other amounts that are not required under 
US GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an 
entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required 
under US GAAP that provide additional detail about those 
amounts. The guidance has been adopted prospectively from 
January 1, 2013. The adoption of the guidance did not impact the 
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations 
or cash flows.
Presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit
In July 2013 the FASB issued guidance on the financial statement 
presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating 
loss carry forward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carry forward 
exists. The guidance requires entities to present an unrecognized 
tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit in the 
financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a 
net operating loss carry forward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit 
carry forward, except as follows: to the extent a net operating 
loss carry forward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carry forward 
is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the 
applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that 
would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law 
of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, 
and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for 
such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented 
in the financial statements as a liability and should not be 
combined with deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether a 
deferred tax asset is available is based on the unrecognized tax 
benefit and deferred tax asset that exist at the reporting date and 
should be made presuming disallowance of the tax position at 
the reporting date. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years, 
and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 
15, 2013, with early adoption permitted. The Company has 
adopted this guidance in the period. The adoption of the 
guidance did not materially impact the Company’s consolidated 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
(y) Statutory accounts
The consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2013 
and 2012, and for each of the two years in the period to 
December 31, 2013 do not comprise statutory accounts within 
the meaning of Section 434 of the UK Companies Act 2006 or 
Article 104 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Statutory accounts of the Company, consisting of the solus 
accounts of Shire plc for the year to December 31, 2013 prepared 
under UK GAAP and in compliance with Jersey law will be 
delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Jersey in 2014. The 
Company further expects to file the consolidated accounts of the 
Company for the year to December 31, 2013, prepared in 
accordance with US GAAP , in fulfillment of the Company’s UKLA 
annual reporting requirements with the UKLA in 2014. 
Statutory accounts of the Company, consisting of the solus 
accounts of Shire plc for the year to December 31, 2012 prepared 
under UK GAAP and in compliance with Jersey law have been 
delivered to the Registrar of Companies for Jersey. The 
consolidated accounts of the Company for the year ended 
December 31, 2012 prepared in accordance with US GAAP , in 
fulfillment of the Company’s United Kingdom Listing Authority 
(“UKLA”) annual reporting requirements were filed with the UKLA. 
The auditor’s reports on these accounts were unqualified.
3. Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States (“US GAAP”) and SEC regulations, requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and 
assumptions are primarily made in relation to the valuation of 
intangible assets, sales deductions, income taxes (including 
provisions for uncertain tax positions and the realization of 
deferred tax assets), provisions for litigation and legal 
proceedings, contingent consideration receivable from product 
divestments,contingent consideration payable in respect of 
business combinations and asset purchases and noncurrent 
assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale. If actual 
results differ from the Company’s estimates, or to the extent 
these estimates are adjusted in future periods, the Company’s 
results of operations could either benefit from, or be adversely 
affected by, any such change in estimate.
(i) Valuation of intangible assets
In accordance with US GAAP the Company classifies intangible 
assets into three categories: (1) finite lived intangible assets, which 
are amortized over their estimated useful lives; (2) intangible 
assets with indefinite lives, which are not subject to amortization; 
and (3) goodwill. 
At December 31, 2013 the carrying value of the Company’s finite 
lived intangible assets was $1,361 million (2012: $2,157 million), 
the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite lived intangible 
assets was $952 million (2012: $231 million), and the carrying 
value of the Company’s goodwill was $625 million (2012: $645 
million). The Company’s indefinite lived intangible assets relate 
solely to IPR&D assets acquired through business combinations.

3. Critical accounting estimates continued
1. Initial valuation of intangible assets acquired through 
business combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations using the 
acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of 
acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the fair 
value of consideration given and the fair value of any 
noncontrolling interest over the fair values of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. The 
determination of estimated fair values of acquired intangible 
assets, as well as the useful economic life ascribed to finite lived 
intangible assets, requires the use of significant judgement. The 
use of different estimates and assumptions to those used by the 
Company could result in a materially different valuation of 
acquired intangible assets, which could have a material effect on 
the Company’s results of operations. 
Initial valuation of finite lived intangible assets
At December 31, 2013 the carrying value of the Company’s finite 
lived intangible assets was $1,361 million primarily representing 
the following products: VYVANSE ($737 million), REPLAGAL 
($220 million), FIRAZYR ($200 million) and RESOLOR 
($121 million). 
The fair values of all finite lived identifiable intangible assets, for 
commercialized products and developed product technologies, 
acquired through business combinations have been determined 
using an income approach on a project-by-project basis using 
the multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period 
excess earnings method starts with a forecast of all expected 
future net cash flows which a market participant could have either 
generated or saved as a result of ownership of the intellectual 
property, customer relationships, product technologies and other 
intangible assets. These cash flows are then adjusted to present 
value by applying a market participant discount rate that reflects 
the risk factors that a market participant would associate with the 
cash flows (to the extent the underlying cash flows have not 
similarly been risk adjusted). Forecasting these future cash flows 
requires various assumptions to be made. These valuations are 
based on information at the time of the acquisition of the 
identifiable intangible assets, and the expectations and 
assumptions that (i) have been deemed reasonable by the 
Company’s management and (ii) are based on information, 
expectations and assumptions that would be available to and 
made by a market participant. No assurance can be given, 
however, that the underlying assumptions or events associated 
with such valuations will occur as projected. For these reasons, 
among others, actual cash flows may differ from these forecasts 
and, dependent on the outcome of future events or 
circumstances, impairment losses (as outlined below) may result. 
The use of different estimates and assumptions to those used by 
the Company could result in a materially different valuation of 
finite lived intangible assets. However, as the valuation process for 
intangible assets involves a number of inter-related assumptions, 
the Company does not consider it meaningful to quantify the 
sensitivity of the valuation of intangible assets to changes in any 
individual assumption. 
Initial valuation of indefinite lived intangible assets (IPR&D)
IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to incomplete 
technologies and development projects that the Company has 
acquired through business combinations which completed after 
January 1, 2009 which, at the time the business combination 
closed, had not reached technological feasibility or which had no 
alternative future use. At December 31, 2013 the carrying value of 
the Company’s indefinite lived intangible assets (IPR&D) was 
$952 million, primarily representing the following pipeline 
programs or products: Lifitegrast (SHP606) for the treatment 
of Dry Eye disease ($412 million); rC7 , for the treatment of DEB 
($177 million); SHP602, an iron chelating agent for the treatment 
of iron overload secondary to chronic transfusion ($166 million); 
and PREMIPLEX (SHP607) for the treatment of Retinopathy of 
Prematurity ($153 million).
The fair value of IPR&D assets is determined using the income 
approach on a project-by-project basis using the multi-period 
excess earnings method. The fair value of the acquired IPR&D 
assets has been based on the present value of probability 
adjusted incremental cash flows which a market participant 
would expect the IPR&D projects to generate after the deduction 
of contributory asset charges for other assets employed in these 
projects. This method incorporates an evaluation of the 
probability of success of each development project, and the 
application of an appropriate market participant discount rate 
commensurate with the project’s stage of completion, the nature 
of the product, the scientific data associated with the technology, 
the current patent situation and market competition. 
The cash flows that will ultimately be generated by IPR&D 
projects are subject to major risks and uncertainties including 
whether the IPR&D projects will be completed in a timely manner, 
if at all, whether the necessary regulatory approvals will be 
obtained and how commercially successful the project will be 
subsequent to commercial launch. The Company is required to 
use estimates and assumptions in relation to these risks and 
uncertainties when valuing IPR&D projects. The use of different 
estimates and assumptions to those used by the Company could 
result in a materially different valuation of the related IPR&D. 
However, as the valuation process for IPR&D involves a number 
of inter-relating assumptions, the Company does not consider it 
meaningful to quantify the sensitivity of the valuation of IPR&D to 
changes in any individual assumption. 
The initial valuation of indefinite lived IPR&D is based on 
information that existed at the time of the acquisition of the 
relevant development project, and utilizes expectations and 
assumptions that (i) have been deemed reasonable by the 
Company’s management, and (ii) are based on information, 
expectations and assumptions that would be available to and 
made by a market participant. However, no assurance can be 
given that the underlying assumptions or estimates associated 
with the valuation of IPR&D will occur as projected. If IPR&D 
projects fail during development, are abandoned, or do not 
receive the relevant regulatory approvals, the Company may not 
realize the future cash flows that it has estimated nor recover the 
value of the R&D investment made subsequent to acquisition of 
the project. If such circumstances occur, the Company’s future 
operating results could be materially adversely impacted.

2. Subsequent measurement of intangible assets
Finite lived intangible assets – estimation of amortization charges 
and impairment losses 
Management’s estimate of the useful life of its finite lived intangible 
assets considers, amongst other things, the following factors:
(i)  the expected use of the finite lived intangible asset by the 
Company;
(ii) any legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit 
or extend the useful life;
(iii) the effects of demand and competition, including the launch 
of generic products; and 
(iv) other general economic and/or industry specific factors (such 
as the stability of the industry, known technological 
advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or 
changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in 
distribution channels).
The Company reviews the useful life of its intangible assets 
subject to amortization at each reporting period, and revises its 
estimate of the useful life if warranted by events or circumstances. 
Any future changes to the useful life of the Company’s finite lived 
intangible assets could result in higher or lower amortization 
charges in future periods, which could materially affect the 
Company’s results from operations.
The Company reviews its finite lived intangible assets for 
impairment using a “two-step” approach, whenever events or 
circumstances suggest that the carrying value of its finite lived 
intangible assets may not be recoverable. Under step one, if the 
undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate 
disposition of the finite lived intangible asset (based on entity 
specific assumptions) are less than its carrying value, the 
intangible asset is considered not to be recoverable. The 
impairment loss is determined under step two as the amount by 
which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair 
value (based on market participant assumptions). 
Events or circumstances that could suggest that the Company’s 
finite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, and which 
would lead to an evaluation of the recoverability of the relevant 
asset, include but are not limited to, the following:
(i) changes to a product’s commercialization strategy;
(ii) the loss of patent protection, regulatory exclusivity or 
challenge or circumvention by competitors of the Company’s 
regulatory exclusivity patents;
(iii) the development and marketing of competitive products, 
including generic entrants into the marketplace;
(iv) changes to the product labels, or other regulatory 
intervention;
(v) sustained government pressure on prices and, specifically, 
competitive pricing; 
(vi) the occurrence of significant adverse events in respect to the 
Company’s products;
(vii) a significant deterioration in a product’s operating 
performance compared to expectations; and
(viii) an expectation that the intangible asset will be divested 
before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
The occurrence of any such events or circumstances may result 
in the Company reducing the estimated future net cash flows to 
be generated by, and the fair value of, its finite lived intangible 
assets and therefore give rise to an impairment loss. 
As a result of divestment of DERMAGRAFT to Organogenesis, 
the Company has reclassified the DERMAGRAFT intangible asset 
(and other assets subject to disposal) as Assets held for sale and 
recorded an impairment charge of $611.4 million, measured at fair 
value less costs to sell, in the year to December 31, 2013. In the 
year to December 31, 2012 the Company recognized impairment 
losses of $126.7 million to write-down its RESOLOR finite lived 
intangible assets to their fair value. 
Dependent on future events or circumstances, the Company’s 
operating results could be materially and adversely affected by 
future impairment losses relating to its finite lived intangible 
assets.
Indefinite lived intangible assets (IPR&D) – estimation  
of impairment losses
The Company reviews its indefinite lived intangible assets (which 
currently only relate to IPR&D assets) for impairment annually or 
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the asset might be impaired. Indefinite lived assets are 
reviewed for impairment by comparing the fair value of the 
indefinite lived asset (based on market participant assumptions) 
with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized to the 
extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of 
the relevant indefinite lived intangible asset. 
Events or circumstances that could suggest that the Company’s 
IPR&D assets may not be recoverable, and which would lead to 
an evaluation of the relevant asset for impairment, include those 
factors considered for finite lived intangible assets (outlined 
above) as well as any adverse changes to the technological or 
commercial viability of the IPR&D projects, which could include 
abandonment of the IPR&D project or a decline in its estimated 
commercial potential. The occurrence of any such events or 
circumstances could result in the Company reducing the 
estimated future net cash flows to be generated by, and the fair 
value of, its indefinite lived intangible assets and therefore give rise 
to an impairment loss.
After the identification of any such events or circumstances, and 
the resultant impairment reviews, the Company recognized 
impairment losses of $19.9 million in the year to December 31, 
2013 (2012: $71.2 million) to write-down its RESOLOR IPR&D 
assets to their fair value (See Note 13, “Other intangible assets, 
net” to the consolidated financial statements set forth in this 
Annual Report for details). Dependent on future events or 
circumstances, the Company’s operating results could be 
materially and adversely affected by future impairment losses 
relating to its indefinite lived intangible assets.

3. Critical accounting estimates continued
Goodwill – estimation of impairment losses
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually, 
or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the 
carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment by firstly 
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. 
If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then 
the goodwill is considered recoverable and no further testing is 
performed. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than 
its fair value, then goodwill is considered impaired and a further 
test is performed to determine the amount by which the carrying 
value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value, with an 
impairment loss recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit (and if 
required the fair value of its goodwill) through a present value 
technique, principally using the income approach. The 
determination of fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of 
significant judgment and assumptions, which include, amongst 
other things, the estimation of future forecast cash flows and an 
appropriate discount rate used to determine the fair value.
In the first quarter of 2013 the Company identified circumstances 
which indicated that the carrying value of goodwill in the RM 
reporting unit may not be recoverable, which triggered an 
impairment test in advance of the annual testing date. The results 
of the Company’s March 31, 2013 impairment test showed that 
the carrying amount of the RM reporting unit exceeded its fair 
value and the implied value of the goodwill was $nil. As a result 
the Company recorded an impairment charge of $198.9 million 
related to the goodwill allocated to the RM reporting unit of which 
$191.8 million was subsequently presented within discontinued 
operations (See Note 12, “Goodwill” to the consolidated financial 
statements set forth in this Annual Report for details).
The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment review 
at October 1, 2013, which indicated that the Company’s goodwill 
was recoverable and was not deemed to be at risk of failing the 
first step in testing for impairment. 
(ii) Sales Deductions 
Sales deductions consist primarily of statutory rebates to State 
Medicaid and other government agencies, Medicare Part D 
rebates, contractual rebates with Managed Care Organizations 
(“MCOs”), product returns, sales discounts (including trade 
discounts), distribution service fees, wholesaler chargebacks, and 
allowances for coupon and patient assistance programs. These 
deductions are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same 
period as the related sales. Estimates of future obligations are 
derived from historical experience adjusted to reflect known 
changes in the factors that impact such reserves. On the balance 
sheet the Company records wholesaler chargebacks and trade 
discounts as a reserve against accounts receivable, whereas all 
other sales deductions are recorded within current liabilities.
The Company has the following significant categories of sales 
deductions, all of which involve estimates and judgments which 
the Company considers to be critical accounting estimates, and 
require the Company to use information from external sources:
Medicaid and Managed Care Rebates
Statutory and any supplemental rebates to State Medicaid 
agencies and contractual rebates to MCOs under managed care 
programs are based on statutory or negotiated discounts to the 
selling price. Medicaid rebates generally increase as a percentage 
of the selling price over the life of the product (if prices increase 
faster than general inflation).
As it can take up to six months for information to reach the 
Company on actual usage of the Company’s products in 
managed care and Medicaid programs and on the total rebates 
to be reimbursed, the Company estimates the reserves required 
for amounts payable under these programs relating to sold 
products.
The amount of these reserves is based on historical experience of 
rebates, the timing of payments, the level of reimbursement 
claims, changes in prices (both normal selling prices and 
statutory or negotiated prices), changes in prescription demand 
patterns, projected product returns and the levels of inventory in 
the distribution channel. Adjustments are made for known 
changes in these factors.
Shire’s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution 
channel are derived from product-by-product inventory data 
provided by wholesalers and results of independently 
commissioned retail inventory surveys. 
Revisions or clarification of guidelines from the CMS related to 
State Medicaid and other government program reimbursement 
practices with retroactive application can result in changes to 
management’s estimates of the rebates reported in prior periods.
The accrual estimation process for Medicaid and managed care 
rebates involves in each case a number of interrelating 
assumptions, which vary for each combination of product and 
Medicaid agency or MCO. Accordingly, it would not be 
meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual 
assumption or uncertainty. However, Shire does not believe that 
the effect of these uncertainties, taken as a whole, significantly 
impacts the Company’s financial condition or results of 
operations. 
Aggregate accruals for Medicaid and MCO rebates at December 
31, 2013 and 2012 were $807 .2 million and $640.5 million or 17% 
and 15%, respectively of net product sales. Historically, actual 
rebates have not varied significantly from the reserves provided.
Product Returns
The Company typically accepts customer product returns in the 
following circumstances: (a) expiration of shelf life; (b) product 
damaged while in the Company’s possession; (c) under sales 
terms that allow for unconditional return (guaranteed sales); or (d) 
following product recalls or product withdrawals. Generally, 
returns for expired product are accepted up to one year after 
expiration date of the relevant product and the returned product 
is destroyed. Depending on the product and the Company’s 
return policy with respect to that product, the Company may 
either refund the sales price paid by the customer by issuance of 
a credit, or exchange the returned product with replacement 
inventory. The Company typically does not provide cash refunds. 
114 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM 3. Critical accounting estimates continued
The Company estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that 
will result in a return by considering relevant factors, including:
(i) past product returns activity;
(ii) the duration of time taken for products to be returned;
(iii) the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel;
(iv) product recalls and discontinuances;
(v) the shelf life of products;
(vi) the launch of new drugs or new formulations; and
(vii) the loss of patent protection or new competition.
The Company’s estimates of the level of inventory in the 
distribution channel are based on product-by-product inventory 
data provided by wholesalers and results of independently 
commissioned third party retail inventory surveys.
Returns reserves for new products and for those products with 
generic competition generally require a higher level of estimation 
than those for established products without generic competition. 
For shipments made to support the commercial launch of a new 
product (which can include guaranteed sales), the Company’s 
policy is to defer recognition of the sales revenue until there is 
evidence of end-patient acceptance of the new product (primarily 
through third-party prescription data). For shipments after launch 
under standard terms (i.e. not guaranteed sales), the Company’s 
initial estimates of sales return accruals are primarily based on the 
historical sales returns experience of similar products shortly after 
launch. Once sufficient historical data on actual returns of the 
product are available, the returns provision is based on this data 
and any other relevant factors as noted above.
The Company estimates returns reserves for products with 
generic competition based on historical sales, the estimated level 
of inventory in the distribution channel, product utilization and 
rebate data, which are modified through the use of management 
judgment to take into account many factors, including, but not 
limited to, current market dynamics, changes in contract terms, 
changes in sales trends and product pricing. 
The accrual estimation process for product returns involves, in 
each case, a number of interrelating assumptions, which vary for 
each combination of product and customer. Accordingly, it would 
not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any 
individual assumption or uncertainty. However, Shire does not 
believe that the effect of uncertainties, as a whole, significantly 
impacts the Company’s financial condition or results of 
operations. 
At December 31, 2013 and 2012, provisions for product returns 
were $98.8 million and $90.5 million or 2% and 2% respectively, 
of net product sales. Historically, actual returns have not varied 
significantly from the reserves provided.
(iii) Income Taxes
In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, management is 
required to develop estimates as to whether a tax benefit should 
be recognized in the consolidated financial statements, based on 
whether it is more likely than not that the technical merits of the 
position will be sustained based on audit by the tax authorities. 
The measurement of the tax benefit recognized in the 
consolidated financial statements is based upon the largest 
amount of tax benefit that, in management’s judgment, is greater 
than 50% likely to be realized based on a cumulative probability 
assessment of the possible outcomes. In accounting for income 
tax uncertainties, management is required to make judgments in 
the determination of the unit of account, the evaluation of the 
facts, circumstances and information in respect of the tax 
position taken, together with the estimates of amounts that the 
Company may be required to pay in ultimate settlement with the 
tax authority.
The Company operates in numerous countries where its income 
tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax 
authorities. As the Company operates globally, the nature of the 
uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to 
change and the amounts at issue can be substantial. The 
Company develops its cumulative probability assessment to 
measure uncertain tax positions using internal expertise, 
experience and judgment, together with assistance from 
professional advisors. Original estimates are refined as additional 
information becomes known. For example, in the year to 
December 31, 2013 the Company recognized additional 
provisions for uncertain tax positions of $91.3 million in relation to 
ongoing compliance management for current and prior years. 
Any outcome upon settlement that differs from the recorded 
provision for uncertain tax positions may result in a materially 
higher or lower tax expense in future periods, which could 
significantly impact the Company’s results of operations or 
financial condition. However, the Company does not believe it is 
possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such 
change in assumptions, estimates or judgments and the resultant 
change, if any, in the Company’s provision for uncertain tax 
positions, as any such change is dependent on factors such as 
future changes in tax law or administrative practice, the amount 
and nature of additional taxes which may be asserted by the 
taxation authorities, and the willingness of the relevant tax 
authorities to negotiate a settlement for any such position.
At December 31, 2013 the Company recognized a liability of 
$355.2 million for total unrecognized tax benefits (2012: $278.7 
million) and had accrued $112.2 million (2012: $119.6 million) for 
the payment of interest and penalties. The Company is required 
in certain tax jurisdictions to make advance deposits to tax 
authorities on receipt of a tax assessment. These payments are 
either offset against the income tax liability or establish an income 
tax receivable but do not reduce the provision for unrecognized 
tax benefits.

3. Critical accounting estimates continued
The Company has significant deferred tax assets due to various 
tax attributes, including net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax 
credits (from Research and Development and Investment Tax 
Credits) principally in the Republic of Ireland, the US, Belgium, 
Germany and the UK. At December 31, 2013 the Company had 
gross deferred tax assets of $822 million (2012: $764 million), 
against which the Company had recorded valuation allowances 
of $282 million (2012: $269 million) and deferred tax liabilities of 
$644 million (2012: $740 million). 
The realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent 
on various factors. Management is required to exercise judgment 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that it would 
realize these deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a 
valuation allowance, management weighs all available positive 
and negative evidence including cumulative losses in recent 
years, expectations of future taxable income, carry forward and 
carry back potential under relevant tax law, expiration period of 
tax attributes, taxable temporary differences, and prudent and 
feasible tax-planning strategies. A valuation allowance is 
established where there is an expectation that on the balance of 
probabilities management considers it is more likely than not that 
the relevant deferred tax assets will not be realized. If actual 
events differ from management’s estimates, or to the extent that 
these estimates are adjusted in the future, any changes to the 
valuation allowance could significantly impact the Company’s 
financial condition and results of operations.
(iv) Litigation and legal proceedings
The Company has a number of lawsuits pending. The Company’s 
principal pending legal and other proceedings are disclosed in 
Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in this 
Annual Report. The Company recognizes loss contingency 
provisions for probable losses when management is able to 
reasonably estimate the loss. When the estimated loss lies within 
a range, the Company records a loss contingency provision 
based on its best estimate of the probable loss. If no particular 
amount within that range is a better estimate than any other 
amount, the minimum amount is recorded. Estimates of losses 
may be developed substantially before the ultimate loss is known, 
and are therefore refined each accounting period as additional 
information becomes known. In instances where the Company is 
unable to develop a reasonable estimate of loss, no loss 
contingency provision is recorded at that time. As information 
becomes known a loss contingency provision is recorded when a 
reasonable estimate can be made. These estimates are reviewed 
quarterly and changed when expectations are revised. An 
outcome that deviates from the Company’s estimate may result in 
an additional expense (or credit) in a future accounting period. At 
December 31, 2013 provisions for litigation losses, insurance 
claims and other disputes totaled $72.7 million (December 31, 
2012: $130.5 million).
The outcomes of these proceedings are not always predictable 
and can be affected by various factors. For those legal and other 
proceedings for which it is considered at least reasonably 
possible that a loss has been incurred, the Company discloses 
the possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the 
recorded loss contingency provision, if any, where such excess is 
both material and estimable. The estimation of the likelihood, 
amount and range of any loss arising from these proceedings 
requires significant judgment. Any revisions in the Company’s 
estimates, or outcomes upon settlement that deviate from the 
Company’s best estimate may result in an additional expense (or 
credit) in a future accounting period, which could materially 
impact the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. 
Contingent consideration receivable from product divestments
At December 31, 2013 the Company has contingent 
consideration assets of $36.1 million (2012: $38.3 million), all of 
which relate to the divestment of DAYTRANA to Noven in October 
2010. 
Consideration receivable by the Company on the divestment of 
product rights typically includes up-front receipts and/or 
milestones and royalties which are contingent on the outcome of 
future events (with such milestones and royalties being, for 
example, based upon the future sales performance of the 
divested product). Contingent consideration occasionally 
represents a significant proportion of the economic value 
receivable by the Company for a divested product. In these 
situations the Company initially recognizes this contingent 
consideration as an asset at its divestment date fair value, with 
re-measurement of this asset to its then current fair value at 
subsequent balance sheet dates.
The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration 
receivable using the income approach, based on a discounted 
cash flow method. This discounted cash flow approach uses 
significant unobservable Level 3 inputs (as defined in US GAAP) 
including: the probability weightings applied to different sales 
scenarios and related forecast future royalties receivable under 
scenarios developed by the Company; and the discount rate to 
be applied in calculating the present value of these forecast future 
cash flows. Significant judgment is employed by the Company in 
developing these estimates and assumptions. If actual events 
differ from management’s estimates, or to the extent that these 
estimates are adjusted in the future, the Company’s financial 
condition and results of operations could be affected in the 
period of any such change of estimate. 
(v) Contingent consideration payable
The fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration payable 
at December 31, 2013 was $405.9 million (December 31, 2012: 
$136.4 million).
116 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM 3. Critical accounting estimates continued
Contingent consideration payable represents (i) future milestones 
the Company may be required to pay in conjunction with various 
business combinations and (ii) future royalties payable as a result 
of certain business combinations and licenses. The amounts 
ultimately payable by Shire are dependent upon (i) the successful 
achievement of the relevant milestones and (ii) future net sales of 
the relevant products over the life of the royalty term respectively. 
The Company re-measures its contingent consideration payable 
to fair value at each balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising 
on changes to the fair value of contingent consideration payable 
are recorded within Integration and acquisition costs in the 
Company’s consolidated income statement. 
The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration 
payable using the income approach, based on a discounted cash 
flow method. The discounted cash flow method uses significant 
unobservable Level 3 inputs (as defined under US GAAP), 
including: the probability of, and period in which, the relevant 
milestone event is expected to be achieved; the amount of 
royalties that will be payable based on forecast net sales of the 
relevant products; and the discount rates to be applied in 
calculating the present values of the relevant milestone or royalty. 
Significant judgment is employed by the Company in developing 
these estimates and assumptions. If actual events differ from 
management’s estimates, or to the extent that these estimates 
are adjusted in the future, the Company’s financial condition and 
results of operations could be materially affected in the period of 
any such change of estimate.
(vi) Assets held for sale
Assets held for sale comprise noncurrent assets or disposal 
groups (together with any liabilities), the carrying amounts of 
which will be realized principally through a sale transaction 
expected to conclude within the next twelve months, rather than 
through continued use. 
At December 31, 2013 the Company has presented $31.6 million 
(2012: $nil) of net assets as assets held for sale in the 
consolidated balance sheet. The assets and liabilities within this 
disposal group all relate to the disposal of the DERMAGRAFT 
asset group, which was announced on January 16, 2014.
At the time of their classification as “held for sale,” such assets 
are collectively measured at the lower of their carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell, and depreciation or amortization 
ceases. An impairment charge of $636.9 million was recorded in 
the fourth quarter of 2013 reflecting the adjustment of the 
DERMAGRAFT disposal group’s carrying amount to its fair value 
less cost to sell.
Significant judgment is employed by the Company in assessing: 
at what point all the held for sale presentation conditions are met 
for the disposal group; whether it is necessary to allocate 
goodwill to the disposal group; and estimating both the fair value 
of the disposal group and the incremental costs to transact a sale 
of the disposal group. If actual events differ from management’s 
estimates, or to the extent that estimates of selling price or costs 
to sell are adjusted in the future, the Company’s financial 
condition and results of operations could be affected in the 
period of any such change of estimate.
4. Business combinations
Acquisition of ViroPharma Inc. (“ViroPharma”)
On November 11, 2013, the Company signed a definitive 
agreement to acquire all of the outstanding share capital of 
ViroPharma for $50 per share in cash or approximately $4,200 
million. The transaction was completed on January 24, 2014 at 
which time ViroPharma became a wholly-owned subsidiary. 
ViroPharma is a high growth, rare disease Biopharmaceutical 
Company, whose commercial product CINRYZE (C1 esterase 
inhibitor human), is a leading brand for the prophylactic treatment 
of Hereditary Angioedema (“HAE”). 
The acquisition of ViroPharma will be accounted for as a business 
combination using the acquisition method. The assets acquired 
and the liabilities assumed from ViroPharma will be recorded at 
the date of acquisition, at their fair value. The Company’s 
consolidated financial statements will reflect these fair values at, 
and the results of ViroPharma will be included in the Company’s 
consolidated statement of income from, January 24, 2014. As the 
initial accounting for the business combination has not yet been 
completed, further disclosure relating to this acquisition will be 
included in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the three months 
ended March 31, 2014.
In the year to December 31, 2013 the Company expensed costs 
of $12.8 million (2012: $nil) relating to the acquisition of 
ViroPharma, which have been recorded within integration and 
acquisition costs in the Company’s consolidated income 
statement.
Acquisition of SARcode Bioscience Inc. (“SARcode”)
On April 17 , 2013, Shire completed the acquisition of 100% of the 
outstanding share capital of SARcode. The acquisition date fair 
value of consideration totaled $368 million, comprising cash 
consideration paid on closing of $151 million and the acquisition 
date fair value of contingent consideration payable of $217 million. 
Following top-line Phase 3 study results in December 2013, the 
maximum amount of contingent cash consideration which may 
now be payable by Shire in future periods is $225 million 
dependent upon achievement of certain net sales milestones. 
This acquisition brings the global rights of a new Phase 3 
compound, Lifitegrast, currently under development for the 
treatment of Dry Eye disease, into Shire’s portfolio. Top-line 
results from OPUS-2, a Phase 3 efficacy and safety study of 5.0% 
Lifitegrast ophthalmic solution, were announced on 6 December 
2013. Shire intends to investigate the full data from OPUS-2 and 
is planning further interactions with the FDA in the first half of 
2014 in order to advance this program. 
The acquisition of SARcode has been accounted as a business 
combination using the acquisition method. The assets and 
liabilities assumed from SARcode have been recorded at their 
fair values at the date of acquisition, being April 17 , 2013. The 
Company’s consolidated financial statements and results of 
operations include the results of SARcode from April 17 , 2013. 
In the year to December 31, 2013 the Company’s consolidated 
income statement includes pre-tax losses of $26.0 million in 
relation to the post acquisition results of SARcode.

The purchase price has been allocated to acquired in process 
research and development (“IPR&D”) in respect of Lifitegrast 
($412 million), net current liabilities assumed ($8.2 million), net 
non-current liabilities assumed, including deferred tax liabilities 
($122.4 million) and goodwill ($86.6 million). This acquisition 
resulted in goodwill of $86.6 million, which is not deductible for 
tax purposes. Goodwill includes the value of the assembled 
workforce and the related scientific expertise in ophthalmology 
which allows for potential expansion into a new therapeutic area. 
In the year to December 31, 2013 the Company recorded a net 
credit of $170.7 million (2012: $nil) within Integration and 
acquisition costs relating to the acquisition of SARcode. This 
amount principally comprises a credit of $176.0 million on 
re-measuring the fair value of the contingent consideration 
payable following OPUS-2 trial results. In addition, acquisition and 
integration costs related to SARcode amounted to $15.3 million. 
Acquisition of Premacure AB (“Premacure”)
On March 8, 2013 the Company completed the acquisition of 
100% of the outstanding share capital of Premacure. The 
acquisition date fair value of the consideration totaled $140.2 
million, comprising cash consideration paid on closing of $30.6 
million, and the fair value of contingent consideration payable of 
$109.6 million. The maximum amount of contingent cash 
consideration which may be payable by the Company in future 
periods, dependent upon the successful completion of certain 
development and commercial milestones, is $169 million. The 
Company will also pay royalties on relevant net sales.
Premacure is developing a protein replacement therapy 
(“PREMIPLEX”), currently in Phase 2 development, for the 
prevention of Retinopathy of Prematurity (“ROP”). ROP is a rare 
and potentially blinding eye disorder that primarily affects 
premature infants and is one of the most common causes of 
visual loss in childhood. Together, the acquisitions of SARcode 
and Premacure build the Company’s presence in the 
ophthalmology therapeutic area.
The acquisition of Premacure has been accounted for as a 
business combination using the acquisition method. The assets 
and the liabilities assumed from Premacure have been recorded 
at their fair values at the date of acquisition, being March 8, 2013. 
The Company’s consolidated financial statements and results of 
operations include the results of Premacure from March 8, 2013.
The purchase price has been allocated to acquired IPR&D in 
respect of PREMIPLEX ($151.8 million), net current liabilities 
assumed ($11.7 million), net non-current liabilities assumed, 
including deferred tax liabilities ($29.5 million) and goodwill ($29.6 
million). This acquisition resulted in goodwill of $29.6 million, 
which is not deductible for tax purposes. 
In the year to December 31, 2013 the Company expensed costs 
of $9.5 million (2012: $nil) relating to the acquisition of Premacure 
(including charges related to the change in fair value of contingent 
consideration payable), which have been recorded within 
integration and acquisition costs in the Company’s consolidated 
income statement.
Acquisition of Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc (“Lotus”)
On February 12, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of 
100% of the outstanding share capital of Lotus. The acquisition 
date fair value of consideration totaled $174.2 million, comprising 
cash consideration paid on closing of $49.4 million, and the fair 
value of contingent consideration payable of $124.8 million. The 
maximum amount of contingent cash consideration which may 
be payable by the Company in future periods is $275 million. The 
amount of contingent cash consideration ultimately payable by 
the Company is dependent upon achievement of certain 
pre-clinical and clinical development milestones.
Lotus is developing a proprietary recombinant form of human 
collagen Type VII (“rC7”) as the first and only intravenous protein 
replacement therapy currently being investigated for the 
treatment of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (“DEB”). DEB is a 
devastating orphan disease for which there is no currently 
approved treatment option other than palliative care. The 
acquisition adds to the Company’s pipeline a late stage pre-
clinical product for the treatment of DEB with global rights. 
The acquisition of Lotus has been accounted for as a business

5. Divestment of product rights
On October 1, 2010, the Company completed the divestment of DAYTRANA to Noven (Noven developed and manufactures 
DAYTRANA, and the Company licensed DAYTRANA from Noven in 2003). No consideration was received at the time of divestment, 
however consideration is receivable from Noven dependent on DAYTRANA’s performance in the period subsequent to divestment. 
On divestment the Company recorded the fair value of contingent consideration receivable from Noven within current and non-
current assets. During the year to December 31, 2013 the Company recognized a gain of $15.9 million (2012: gain of $18.1 million) 
due to changes in the fair value of this contingent consideration. At December 31, 2013 the Company has recorded a receivable 
based on the fair value of future contingent consideration totaling $36.1 million (2012: $39.2 million), split between current assets 
$9.6 million (2012: $11.6 million) and non-current assets $26.5 million (2012: $27 .6 million).
120 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM 6. Reorganization costs
Turnhout, Belgium Site Closure
On January 23, 2013 the Company announced that it had decided to proceed with a collective dismissal and business closure at its 
site in Turnhout, Belgium. This decision follows the conclusion of an information and consultation process. The Company will continue 
to sell RESOLOR in Europe and the supply of RESOLOR for patients in Europe who rely on the medicine will not be affected. The 
closure of the Turnhout site was completed during 2013. In the year to December 31, 2013 the Company incurred reorganization 
costs totaling $23.6 million, relating to employee involuntary termination benefits and other reorganization costs. 
One Shire business reorganization
On May 2, 2013, the Company announced that there would be a reorganization of the business to integrate the three divisions into 
a simplified One Shire organization in order to drive future growth and innovation. 
On November 7 , 2013, the Company announced that, as part of the One Shire reorganization, the Company had undertaken a 
review of all of Shire’s pipeline programs to identify those projects that fit with Shire’s new strategic direction and have an acceptable 
likelihood of success. Shire’s pre-clinical investments will now be primarily focused on Rare Diseases, meaning that the majority of 
other pre-clinical projects will not continue. Several clinical programs have also been discontinued. The impact of the prioritization 
and rationalization of the Company’s development portfolio means many of the R&D programs currently run from Basingstoke, 
UK will cease. Taken together with the overall streamlining of the R&D organization, this has resulted in a significant number of R&D 
roles in Basingstoke being eliminated and some positions being re-located. A small number of functional roles that support R&D in 
Basingstoke have also been affected. 
In addition the Company also announced plans to relocate its international commercial hub from Nyon, Switzerland to Zug, 
Switzerland. All Nyon-based employees have been impacted by the One Shire transition and the proposed move to Zug. Shire is 
planning for the new Zug office to be ready for occupancy in summer 2014, and will phase out the Nyon office over a reasonable 
period of time to enable employees and their families to manage their re-locations.
In the year to December 31, 2013, the Company incurred reorganization costs totaling $64.6 million, relating to employee involuntary 
termination benefits and other reorganization costs. The One Shire reorganization is expected to be substantially completed by the 
end of 2014. Currently, the Company estimates that further costs in respect of the One Shire reorganization of approximately 
$150 million will be expensed as incurred during 2014.
The liability for reorganization costs arising on the closure of Company’s site in Turnhout, Belgium and the One Shire business

On January 16, 2014 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with 
Organogenesis Inc. (the “Purchaser” or “Organogenesis”), pursuant to which, on January 16, 2014 the Company sold and transferred 
to the Purchaser certain of the assets (the “Transferred Assets”) relating to the manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of 
DERMAGRAFT (the “Business”), and the Purchaser assumed certain of the liabilities relating to the Business. The Company will 
receive no upfront payment from the Purchaser but is entitled to receive total milestone payments of up to $300 million in cash if the 
Purchaser meets certain annual net sales targets during the five consecutive calendar years ending with the calendar year ending 
December 31, 2018. 
The Transferred Assets include intellectual property relating to DERMAGRAFT, including patents, trademarks and know-how, 
regulatory filings and registrations relating to DERMAGRAFT ($611.4 million), certain manufacturing plant, equipment and materials 
relating to the Business ($29.1 million), and DERMAGRAFT product inventory ($16.2 million) and accounts receivable ($11.8 million). 
The Company is generally retaining liabilities incurred prior to the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement relating to the 
DERMAGRAFT business, including the previously disclosed investigation by the US Department of Justice relating to the sales and 
marketing practices of Advanced Biohealing, Inc. (“ABH”).
The Transferred Assets have been measured at their fair value less costs to sell, amounting to $31.6 million, and are presented within 
“Assets held-for-sale” in the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2013. The fair value of these assets was determined 
using the income approach, which used significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs (see Note 22 for further details).
On October 22, 2013 the Company announced that it had decided to discontinue the construction of its new manufacturing facility in 
San Diego. The Company is currently assessing disposal options for this facility. In the year to December 31, 2013, the Company 
recorded charges of $99.6 million, comprising charges to write down the carrying value of the assets related to this manufacturing 
facility, accruals for non-cancellable contractual costs in relation to the construction, and a provision for the onerous land lease. These 
costs have been presented within discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement.
The operating results associated with the DERMAGRAFT business including the costs of discontinuing the second manufacturing 
facility, have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented.

Goodwill arising on businesses acquired 624.6 644.5 
In the year to December 31, 2013 the Company completed the acquisitions of SARcode, Premacure and Lotus, which resulted in 
goodwill of $86.6 million, $29.6 million and $54.1 million, respectively (see Note 4 for details).
As a result of the re-alignment of the business into a simplified One Shire organization, the Company now comprises one operating 
and one reportable segment (see note 25 for further details).

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually as at October 1 each year. This assessment is also performed whenever there is a 
change in circumstances that indicates the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. 
In the first quarter of 2013 the Company identified circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of goodwill in the Company’s 
former RM reporting unit may not be recoverable, which triggered an impairment test in advance of the annual testing date.
Those circumstances included the results of an independent market research study of the DERMAGRAFT sales potential, 
commissioned by the Company, which was finalized late in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, the recently completed restructuring 
of the RM sales and marketing organization and the implementation of a new commercial model had a more pronounced impact 
than previously expected. As a result of those and other factors forecast future sales were lower than at the time of acquisition.
The results of the Company’s March 31, 2013 impairment test showed that the carrying amount of the former RM reporting unit 
exceeded its fair value and the implied value of the goodwill was $nil. As a result the Company recorded an impairment charge of 
$198.9 million related to the goodwill allocated to the former RM reporting unit. The RM goodwill impairment charge is not deductible 
for tax purposes. Accumulated goodwill impairment as at December 31, 2013 was $198.9 million (December 31, 2012: $nil).
The Company determined the estimated fair value of the RM reporting unit using discounted cash flow analyses, which used 
significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. These unobservable inputs included, among other things, expected cash flows for the 
period from March 31, 2013 to December 31, 2023 and the associated discount rate of 15.1%, which was derived from 
management’s best estimate of the after-tax weighted average cost of capital for the RM reporting unit.
Discounted cash flow analyses are dependent upon a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including estimates of forecasted 
revenue, profitability, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and terminal values. The discount rates applied in 
the discounted cash flow analyses also have an impact on the estimates of fair value, as use of a higher rate will result in a lower 
estimate of fair value.
Following the divestment of DERMAGRAFT (see Note 9) the Company has reclassified the Goodwill and related accumulated 
impairment of $191.8 million (being the portion of the former RM reporting unit goodwill impairment charge that relates to the 
DERMAGRAFT business) to discontinued operations.

acquired with SARcode, Premacure and Lotus (see Note 4 for further details).
In the second quarter of 2013 the Company reviewed certain intangible assets acquired through Movetis N.V. (“Movetis”) for 
impairment and recognized an impairment charge of $19.9 million (2012: $197 .9 million) in the consolidated income statement, to 
write-down these assets to their fair value. The fair values of these assets were determined using the income approach, which used 
significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs (see Note 22 for further details).
Following the divestment of DERMAGRAFT (see Note 9) the Company has reclassified $6114.4 million of intangible assets related to 
the DERMAGRAFT product technology to assets held for sale.
Management estimates that the annual amortization charge in respect of intangible assets held at December 31, 2013 will be 
approximately $127 million for each of the five years to December 31, 2018. Estimated amortization expense can be affected by 
various factors including future acquisitions, disposals of product rights, regulatory approval and subsequent amortization of acquired 
IPR&D projects, foreign exchange movements and the technological advancement and regulatory approval of competitor products.

Term Loan Agreement
On November 11, 2013, the Company entered into a $2.60 billion Facilities Agreement with, among others, Morgan Stanley Bank 
International Limited (acting as lead arranger and agent) (the “Facilities Agreement”). The Facilities Agreement comprises two credit 
facilities: (i) a $1.75 billion term loan facility and (ii) a $0.85 billion term loan facility. 
On December 13, 2013 and on February 21, 2014, the Company cancelled part of the $2.60 billion term loan facility. The revised 
Facilities Agreement of $1.40 billion now comprises two credit facilities: (i) a $0.55 billion term loan facility and (ii) a $0.85 billion term 
loan facility. All other terms and conditions remained unchanged.
The $0.55 billion term loan facility, which matures on November 10, 2014, may be used only to finance the purchase price payable in 
respect of the Company’s proposed acquisition of ViroPharma (including certain related costs) and for the redemption of the 
Company’s Bonds. The Company has the option to extend the maturity of the $0.55 billion term loan facility once by a further 364 
days.
The $0.85 billion term loan facility, which matures on November 11, 2015, may be used only to finance the purchase price payable in 
respect of the Company’s proposed acquisition of ViroPharma (including certain related costs).
Interest on any loans made under the facilities will be payable on the last day of each interest period, which may be one week or one, 
two, three or six months at the election of Shire, or as otherwise agreed with the lenders. The interest rate applicable to the $0.55 
billion term loan facility is LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum and increases by 0.25% per annum on August 11, 2014 and on three-month 
intervals thereafter.
The interest rate applicable to the $0.85 billion term loan facility commenced at LIBOR plus 1.15% per annum until delivery of the 
compliance certificate for the year ending December 31, 2013 and thereafter is subject to change depending upon the prevailing ratio 
of Net Debt to EBITDA of the Group (each as defined in the Facilities Agreement), in respect of the most recently completed financial 
year or financial half year.
The Company shall also pay a commitment fee on the available but unutilized commitments under the $0.55 billion term loan facility 
and the $0.85 billion term loan facility for the availability period applicable to each facility. With effect from first utilization, the 
commitment fee rate will be 35% of the applicable margin. Before first utilization, the commitment fee rate will increase in stages from 
0% to 35% of the applicable margin over a period of three months.
The Facilities Agreement includes customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including requirements 
that the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA of the Group (each as defined in the Facilities Agreement) must not, at any time, exceed 3.5:1 for 
the Relevant Period (as defined in the Facilities Agreement), except that following certain acquisitions, including the Viropharm 
acquisition, the Company may elect to increase the ratio to 4.0:1 in the relevant period in which the acquisition was completed and 
the immediately following relevant period. In addition, for each 12-month period ending December 31 or June 30, the ratio of EBITDA 
of the Group to Net Interest (each as defined in the Facilities Agreement) must not be less than 4.0:1.
The Facilities Agreement restricts (subject to certain covenants) Shire’s ability to incur additional financial indebtedness, grant security 
over its assets or provide or guarantee loans. Further, any lender may require mandatory prepayment of its participation if there is a 
change of control of the Company. In addition, in certain circumstances, the net proceeds of certain shares, undertakings or 
business disposals by the Company must be applied towards the mandatory prepayment of the facilities, subject to certain 
exceptions.
Events of default under the facilities include: (i) non-payment of any amounts due under the facilities, (ii) failure to satisfy any financial 
covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation in any of the finance documents, (iv) failure to pay, or certain other defaults, under other 
financial indebtedness, (v) certain insolvency events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse changes in the business, operations, assets 
or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, (vii) if it becomes unlawful for the Company or any of its subsidiaries that 
are parties to the Facilities Agreement to perform their obligations or (viii) if S the Company or any subsidiary of the Company which is 
a party to the Facilities Agreement repudiates the Facilities Agreement or any other finance document, among others.
The Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.

(c) Collaborative arrangements
Details of significant updates in collaborative arrangements are included below:
In-licensing arrangements
(i) Research Collaboration with Santaris Pharma A/S (“Santaris”) on Locked Nucleic Acid (“LNA”) Drug Platform 
On August 24, 2009, the Company announced that it had entered into a research collaboration with Santaris, to develop its 
proprietary LNA technology in a range of rare diseases. LNA technology has the benefit of shortened target validation and proof of 
concept, potentially increasing the speed and lowering the cost of development. As part of the joint research project Santaris will 
design, develop and deliver pre-clinical LNA oligonucleotides for the Company -selected orphan disease targets, and the Company 
will have the exclusive right to further develop and commercialize these candidate compounds on a worldwide basis.
In the year to December 31, 2013 the Company paid success milestones and other support costs of $1.5 million (2012: $3.0 million) 
and $4.5 million (2012: $8.1 million) to Santaris respectively, which were expensed to R&D. The Company has remaining obligations to 
pay Santaris development and sales milestones up to a maximum of $71.0 million for each current indication. The Company will also 
pay single or double digit tiered royalties on net sales of the product.
The Company and Santaris have formed a joint research committee to monitor R&D activities through preclinical lead candidate 
selection at which point all development and commercialization costs will be the responsibility of the Company.
(iii) Collaboration and license agreement with Sangamo to develop therapeutics for hemophilia
On February 1, 2012 the Company and Sangamo announced that they had entered into a collaboration and license agreement to 
develop therapeutics for hemophilia and other monogenic diseases based on Sangamo’s ZFP technology. Sangamo is responsible 
for all activities through submission of Investigational New Drug Applications and European Clinical Trial Applications for each product 
and the Company will reimburse Sangamo for its internal and external research program-related costs. The Company is responsible 
for clinical development and commercialization of products arising from the collaboration. 
128 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM 19. Commitments and  
contingencies continued
In the year to December 31, 2012 the Company made an upfront 
payment to Sangamo of $13.0 million, for technology access and 
R&D funding, which was expensed to R&D. 
In the year to December 31, 2013 the Company’s share of R&D 
costs under this collaboration agreement was $15.2 million (2012: 
$8.9 million) which were expensed to R&D. The Company may be 
required to pay research, regulatory, development and 
commercial milestone payments up to a maximum of $213.5 
million and to pay royalties on net sales of the product.
Out-licensing arrangements
The Company has entered into various collaborative 
arrangements under which the Company has out-licensed 
certain product or intellectual property rights for consideration 
such as up-front payments, development milestones, sales 
milestones and/or royalty payments. In some of these 
arrangements the Company and the licensee are both actively 
involved in the development and commercialization of the 
licensed product and have exposure to risks and rewards 
dependent on its commercial success. Under the terms of these 
arrangements, the Company may receive development milestone 
payments up to an aggregate amount of $39.0 million and sales 
milestones up to an aggregate amount of $71.5 million. The 
receipt of these substantive milestones is uncertain and 
contingent on the achievement of certain development 
milestones or the achievement of a specified level of annual net 
sales by the licensee. In the year to December 31, 2013 the 
Company received up-front and milestone payments totaling $3.0 
million (2012: $18.3 million). In the year to December 31, 2013 
Shire recognized milestone income of $5.0 million (2012: $19.4 
million) in other revenues and $58.3 million (2012: $83.8 million) in 
product sales for shipment of product to the relevant licensee.
(d) Commitments
(i) Clinical testing 
At December 31, 2013 the Company had committed to pay 
approximately $346 million (December 31, 2012: $425 million) to 
contract vendors for administering and executing clinical trials. 
The timing of these payments is dependent upon actual services 
performed by the organizations as determined by patient 
enrollment levels and related activities.
(ii) Contract manufacturing
At December 31, 2013 the Company had committed to pay 
approximately $109 million (December 31, 2012: $125 million) in 
respect of contract manufacturing. The Company expects to pay 
$109 million of these commitments in 2014. 
(iii) Other purchasing commitments
At December 31, 2013 the Company had committed to pay 
approximately $128 million (December 31, 2012: $145 million) for 
future purchases of goods and services, predominantly relating to 
active pharmaceutical ingredients sourcing. The Company 
expects to pay $121 million of these commitments in 2014.
(iv) Investment commitments
At December 31, 2013 the Company had outstanding 
commitments to subscribe for interests in companies and 
partnerships for amounts totaling $14 million (December 31, 2012: 
$15 million) which may all be payable in 2014, depending on the 
timing of capital calls. The investment commitments include 
additional funding to Nimbus Neptune, Inc. a variable interest 
entity, of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. 
Under the terms of the agreement Nimbus Neptune, Inc. controls 
and conducts all related research up to achievement of drug 
candidate status at which point Shire will have an exclusive option 
to acquire the program. Shire will then be responsible for all 
clinical development and future commercialization activities. 
Nimbus Neptune Inc. will be eligible to receive further 
consideration contingent upon achievement of certain 
development and commercial milestones. 
(v) Capital commitments
At December 31, 2013 the Company had committed to spend 
$12 million (December 31, 2012: $97 million) on capital projects. 
(e) Legal and other proceedings
The Company expenses legal costs as they are incurred.
The Company recognizes loss contingency provisions for 
probable losses when management is able to reasonably 
estimate the loss. When the estimated loss lies within a range, the 
Company records a loss contingency provision based on its best 
estimate of the probable loss. If no particular amount within that 
range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum 
amount is recorded. Estimates of losses may be developed 
substantially before the ultimate loss is known, and are therefore 
refined each accounting period as additional information 
becomes known. In instances where the Company is unable to 
develop a reasonable estimate of loss, no loss contingency 
provision is recorded at that time. As information becomes known 
a loss contingency provision is recorded when a reasonable 
estimate can be made. The estimates are reviewed quarterly and 
the estimates are changed when expectations are revised. An 
outcome that deviates from the Company’s estimate may result in 
an additional expense or release in a future accounting period. At 
December 31, 2013 provisions for litigation losses, insurance 
claims and other disputes totaled $72.7 million (December 31, 
2012: $130.5 million).
The Company’s principal pending legal and other proceedings 
are disclosed below. The outcomes of these proceedings are not 
always predictable and can be affected by various factors. For 
those legal and other proceedings for which it is considered at 
least reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred, the 
Company discloses the possible loss or range of possible loss in 
excess of the recorded loss contingency provision, if any, where 
such excess is both material and estimable.
VYVANSE
In May and June 2011, the Company was notified that six 
separate Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”) were 
submitted under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to 
market generic versions of all approved strengths of VYVANSE. 
The notices were from Sandoz, Inc. (“Sandoz”); Amneal 
Pharmaceuticals LLC (“Amneal”); Watson Laboratories, Inc.; 
Roxane Laboratories, Inc. (“Roxane”); Mylan Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc.; and Actavis Elizabeth LLC and Actavis Inc. (collectively, 
“Actavis”). Within the requisite 45 day period, the Company filed

the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against each 
of Sandoz, Roxane, Amneal and Actavis; in the US District Court 
for the Central District of California against Watson Laboratories, 
Inc.; and in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New 
York against Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Mylan Inc. 
(collectively “Mylan”). In February 2013, the Company withdrew its 
lawsuit against Watson following Watson’s withdrawal of its 
ANDA. On December 9, 2011, the District Court of New Jersey 
consolidated the Sandoz, Roxane, Amneal and Actavis cases.

The filing of the lawsuits triggered a stay of approval of all six 
ANDAs for up to 30 months from the expiration of the new 
chemical entity exclusivity, which will expire on August 23, 2014. 
In December 2011 and February 2012, the Company received 
additional notifications that Mylan had filed further certifications 
challenging other VYVANSE patents listed in the Orange Book. 
Within the requisite 45 day period, the Company filed a new 
lawsuit against Mylan, Johnson Matthey Pharmaceutical 
Materials and Johnson Matthey Inc. in New Jersey. In May 2012, 
the Mylan case that was filed in the Eastern District of New York 
was transferred and consolidated with the Mylan, Sandoz, 
Roxane, Amneal and Actavis cases in New Jersey. In December 
2012, the parties completed a Markman briefing. A Markman 
hearing took place on August 5, 2013 and a ruling was rendered 
on August 8, 2013. No trial dates have been set. 
INTUNIV 
Between March 2010 and March 2011, the Company was notified 
that seven separate ANDAs had been submitted to the FDA 
under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market 
generic versions of all approved strengths of INTUNIV. The ANDA 
filers were Actavis Inc., Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Anchen, 
Inc., Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Impax Laboratories, Inc., 
Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sandoz, Inc., and certain of their 
respective affiliates. the Company filed lawsuits against each of 
these ANDA filers. All of the lawsuits have now been settled. 
Under the terms of the Actavis settlement, Actavis has a license 
to make and market Actavis’ generic versions of INTUNIV in the 
United States on December 1, 2014. Such sales will require the 
payment of a royalty of 25% of gross profits to the Company 
during the 180 day period of Actavis’ exclusivity. All other parties 
with whom the Company has settled will be able to enter the 
market with their respective ANDA-approved products after 
Actavis’ 180 day exclusivity period has expired. Each of the 
settlements included a consent judgment confirming that the 
proposed ANDA products infringe the patents-in-suit, U.S. 
Patents 6,287 ,599 and 6,811,794, and that those patents are valid 
and enforceable with respect to their respective proposed ANDA 
products. U.S. Patent 5,854,290, which was originally asserted in 
some of the litigations, has been dedicated to the public.
FOSRENOL
Between February 2009 and December 2010 the Company was 
notified that four separate ANDAs had been submitted to the FDA 
under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market 
generic versions of all approved strengths of FOSRENOL. The 
ANDA filers were Barr Laboratories, Inc.; Mylan, Inc.; Natco 
Pharma Limited and Alkem Laboratories Ltd., and certain of their 
respective affiliates. The Company filed lawsuits against each of 
these ANDA filers. In April 2011, the Company and Barr reached a 
settlement and the lawsuit against Barr was dismissed. The 
settlement provides Barr with a license to market its own generic 
version of FOSRENOL upon receiving FDA approval in the US on 
the earlier of the date of entry of another company’s generic 
version of FOSRENOL to the US market, or October 1, 2021. The 
Company’s lawsuits against Mylan, Alkem and Natco have each 
been dismissed, and consequently, each of Mylan, Alkem and 
Natco may enter the US market upon FDA approval of their 
respective ANDA products. 
LIALDA 
In May 2010 the Company was notified that Zydus 
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (“Zydus”) had submitted an ANDA 
under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market a 
generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45 day period, the 
Company filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of 
Delaware against Zydus and Cadila Healthcare Limited, doing 
business as Zydus Cadila. As of February 22, 2013, the case has 
been administratively closed. No further activity will take place

Laboratories Inc.-Florida had submitted an ANDA under the 
Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market a generic 
version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45 day period, the 
Company filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Southern 
District of Florida against Watson Laboratories Inc.-Florida and 
Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The filing of the lawsuit triggered 
a stay of approval of the ANDA for up to 30 months. In August 
2012, the Company filed an amended complaint adding Watson 
Pharma, Inc. and Watson Laboratories, Inc. as defendants. 
A Markman hearing was held on December 20, 2012 and a

Subpoena related to ADDERALL XR, DAYTRANA and VYVANSE 
On September 23, 2009 the Company received a civil subpoena 
from the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of 
Inspector General in coordination with the US Attorney for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking production of documents 
related to the sales and marketing of ADDERALL XR, DAYTRANA 
and VYVANSE. The investigation covered whether the Company 
engaged in off-label promotion and other conduct that may 
implicate the civil False Claims Act.

agreement in principle to resolve this matter. The agreement also 
addresses sales and marketing practices relating to LIALDA and 
PENTASA pursuant to a subsequent voluntary disclosure made 
by the Company. the Company cooperated with the US 
Government throughout the process that led to this agreement in 
principle.
The Company has recorded a $57 .5 million charge comprised of 
the agreement in principle amount, interest and costs, which has 
been charged to SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2012. The 
agreement in principle is subject to change until this matter is 
finally resolved. Discussions between the Company and the US 
Government are ongoing to establish a final resolution to the 
investigation.
Louisiana Complaint related to ADDERALL, ADDERALL XR, 
DAYTRANA, VYVANSE and INTUNIV 
On July 22 and July 23, 2013, the State of Louisiana served 
Shire LLC and Shire US Inc., respectively, with a civil complaint 
filed in the 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East 
Baton Rouge. The complaint alleges that the Company’s sales, 
marketing, and promotion of ADDERALL, ADDERALL XR, 
DAYTRANA, VYVANSE and INTUNIV violated state law. The 
State is seeking monetary relief for its claims of fraud, redhibition, 
and unjust enrichment, as well as violations of Louisiana’s 
Medical Assistance Programs Integrity Law, Unfair Trade 
Practices Act, and anti-trust laws. Shire intends vigorously to 
defend these claims. The Company is not in a position at this 
time to predict the timing, result or outcome of these claims.
Investigation related to DERMAGRAFT
The Company understands that the Department of Justice, 
including the US Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of 
Florida, Tampa Division and the US Attorney’s Office for 
Washington, DC, is conducting civil and criminal investigations 
into the sales and marketing practices of Advanced BioHealing 
Inc. (“ABH”) relating to DERMAGRAFT. Shire is cooperating fully 
with these investigations. The Company is not in a position at 
this time to predict the scope, duration or outcome of these 
investigations.
Civil Investigative Demand for ADDERALL XR, ADDERALL XR 
Authorized Generics and VYVANSE
On April 5, 2012 the Company received a Civil Investigative 
Demand (“CID”) from the United States Federal Trade 
Commission (“FTC”) requesting that the Company provide it with 
certain information regarding the supply and reported shortages 
of ADDERALL XR and its authorized generics and the marketing 
and sale of ADDERALL XR, its authorized generics and 
VYVANSE. The Company believes the CID was triggered by 
reports of product shortages of ADDERALL XR and the 
authorized generic products in 2011. The Company responded 
to the CID in 2012. On August 29, 2013, the FTC informed the 
Company that it was closing the investigation without taking any 
further action.

21. Financial instruments
Treasury policies and organization
The Company’s principal treasury operations are coordinated by its corporate treasury function. All treasury operations are 
conducted within a framework of policies and procedures approved annually by the Board. As a matter of policy, the Company does 
not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its currency or interest rate exposure.
Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its $1,200 million Revolving Credit Facility, its $0.55 billion term loan facility, its $0.85 
billion term loan facility (the “Facilities”), to the extent the Facilities are utilized, restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents and on 
foreign exchange contracts on which interest is at floating rates. This exposure is primarily to US dollar, Pounds sterling, Euro and 
Canadian dollar interest rates. The Company has evaluated the interest rate risk on its debt facilities and considers the floating rate as 
appropriate. As the Company maintains all of its cash, liquid investments and foreign exchange contracts on a short term basis for 
liquidity purposes, this risk is not actively managed. In the year to to December 31, 2013 the average interest rate received on cash 
and liquid investments was less than 1% per annum. The largest proportion of these cash and liquid investments was in US dollar 
money market and liquidity funds. At December 31, 2013 the Facilities were not utilized.
The Company incurred interest at a fixed rate of 2.75% on its $1,100 million in principal amount convertible bonds which was 
converted and redeemed at December 31, 2013. 
No derivative instruments were entered into during the year to December 31, 2013 to manage interest rate exposure. The Company 
continues to review its interest rate risk and the policies in place to manage the risk. 
Credit risk 
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short term cash 
investments, derivative contracts and trade accounts receivable (from product sales and from third parties from which the Company 
receives royalties). Cash is invested in short term money market instruments, including money market and liquidity funds and bank 
term deposits. The money market and liquidity funds in which the Company invests are all triple A rated by both Standard and Poor’s 
and by Moody’s credit rating agencies.
The Company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which it enters into derivative instruments. The Company limits 
this exposure through a system of internal credit limits which vary according to ratings assigned to the counterparties by the major 
rating agencies. The internal credit limits are approved by the Board and exposure against these limits is monitored by the corporate 
treasury function. The counterparties to these derivatives contracts are major international financial institutions. 
The Company’s revenues from product sales in the US are mainly governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical wholesalers 
and relationships with other pharmaceutical distributors and retail pharmacy chains. For the year to December 31, 2013 there were 
three customers in the US that accounted for 52% of the Company’s product sales. However, such customers typically have 
significant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered acceptable. The Company has taken 
positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions and operates clearly defined credit evaluation procedures. 
However, an inability of one or more of these wholesalers to honor their debts to the Company could have an adverse effect on the 
Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
132 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM 21. Financial instruments continued 
A substantial portion of the Company’s accounts receivable in countries outside of the United States is derived from product sales 
to government-owned or government-supported healthcare providers. The Company’s recovery of these accounts receivable is 
therefore dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of the relevant governments. In recent years the 
creditworthiness and general economic condition of a number of Eurozone countries (including Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain 
(the “relevant countries”)) has deteriorated. As a result, in some of these countries the Company is experiencing delays in the 
remittance of receivables due from government-owned or government-supported healthcare providers. The Company continued 
to receive remittances in relation to government-owned or government-supported healthcare providers in all the relevant countries 
in the year to December 31, 2013, including receipts of $116.8 million and $144.7 million in respect of Spanish and Italian receivables, 
respectively.
To date the Company has not incurred significant losses on accounts receivable in the relevant countries, and continues to consider 
that such accounts receivable are recoverable. The Company will continue to evaluate all its accounts receivable for potential 
collection risks and has made provision for amounts where collection is considered to be doubtful. If the financial condition of the 
relevant countries or other Eurozone countries suffer significant deterioration, such that their ability to make payments becomes 
uncertain, or if one or more Eurozone member countries withdraws from the Euro, additional allowances for doubtful accounts may 
be required, and losses may be incurred, in future periods. Any such loss could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial 
condition and results of operations.
Foreign exchange risk
The Company trades in numerous countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposures.
Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. 
The main trading currencies of the Company are the US dollar, Pounds Sterling, Swiss Franc and the Euro. It is the Company’s policy 
that these exposures are minimized to the extent practicable by denominating transactions in the subsidiary’s functional currency. 
Where significant exposures remain, the Company uses foreign exchange contracts (being spot, forward and swap contracts) to 
manage the exposure for balance sheet assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies different to the functional currency of 
the relevant subsidiary. These assets and liabilities relate predominantly to intercompany financing. The foreign exchange contracts 
have not been designated as hedging instruments. Cash flows from derivative instruments are presented within net cash provided by 
operating activities in the consolidated cash flow statement, unless the derivative instruments are economically hedging specific 
investing or financing activities.
Translational foreign exchange exposure arises on the translation into US dollars of the financial statements of non-US dollar 
functional subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2013 the Company had 29 swap and forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding to manage currency risk. 
The swap and forward contracts mature within 90 days. The Company did not have credit risk related contingent features or 
collateral linked to the derivatives. The Company has master netting agreements with a number of counterparties to these foreign 
exchange contracts and on the occurrence of specified events, the Company has the ability to terminate contracts and settle them 
with a net payment by one party to the other. The Company has elected to present derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a 
gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet. As at December 31, 2013 the potential effect of rights of set off associated with the 
foreign exchange contracts would be an offset to both assets and liabilities of $0.7 million, resulting in net derivative assets and 
derivative liabilities of $3.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Further details are included below:

Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown above are not 
necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company’s intent or 
ability to dispose of the financial instrument.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of financial instrument:
• Available-for-sale securities – the fair values of available-for-sale securities are estimated based on quoted market prices for those 
investments. 
• Contingent consideration receivable – the fair value of the contingent consideration receivable has been estimated using the income 
approach (using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method). 
• Foreign exchange contracts – the fair values of the swap and forward foreign exchange contracts have been determined using an 
income approach based on current market expectations about the future cash flows.
• Contingent consideration payable – the fair value of the contingent consideration payable has been estimated using the income 
approach (using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method).

22. Fair value measurement continued
The Company re-measures the CCR (relating to contingent consideration due to the Company following divestment of one of the 
Company’s products) at fair value at each balance sheet date, with the fair value measurement based on forecast cash flows, over a 
number of scenarios which vary depending on the expected performance outcome of the product following divestment. The forecast 
cash flows under each of these differing outcomes have been included in probability weighted estimates used by the Company in 
determining the fair value of the CCR.
Contingent consideration payable represents future milestones the Company may be required to pay in conjunction with various 
business combinations and future royalties payable as a result of certain business combinations and licenses. The amount ultimately 
payable by the Company in relation to business combinations is dependent upon the achievement of specified future milestones, 
such as the achievement of certain future development, regulatory and sales milestones. The Company assesses the probability, and 
estimated timing, of these milestones being achieved and re-measures the related contingent consideration to fair value each balance 
sheet date. The amount of contingent consideration which may ultimately be payable by the Company in relation to future royalties is 
dependent upon future net sales of the relevant products over the life of the royalty term. The Company assesses the present value of 
forecast future net sales of the relevant products and re-measures the related contingent consideration to fair value each balance 
sheet date. 
The fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration receivable and payable could significantly increase or decrease due to 
changes in certain assumptions which underpin the fair value measurements. Each set of assumptions and milestones are specific to 
the individual contingent consideration receivable or payable. The assumptions include, among other things, the probability and 
expected timing of certain milestones being achieved, the forecast future net sales of the relevant products and related future 
royalties payable, the probability weightings applied to different sales scenarios of one of the Company’s divested products and 
forecast future royalties receivable under scenarios developed by the Company, and the discount rates used to determine the present 
value of contingent future cash flows. The Company regularly reviews these assumptions, and makes adjustments to the fair value 
measurements as required by facts and circumstances.
Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in the period using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)
In the second quarter of 2013 the Company reviewed certain IPR&D intangible assets acquired through Movetis for impairment and 
recognized an impairment charge of $19.9 million, recorded within R&D in the consolidated income statement, to write-down these 
assets to their fair value. The fair value of these assets was determined using the income approach, which used significant 
unobservable (Level 3) inputs. These unobservable inputs included, among other things, risk-adjusted forecast future cash flows to 
be generated by these assets and the determination of an appropriate discount rate to be applied in calculating the present value of 
forecast future cash flows. The fair value of these assets, determined at the time of the impairment review, was $20.3 million.
On January 16, 2014, the Company sold and transferred certain of the assets relating to the manufacturing, marketing, sale and 
distribution of DERMAGRAFT to Organogenesis Inc (see Note 9 for details). The Transferred Assets include intellectual property 
relating to DERMAGRAFT, including patents, trademarks and know-how, regulatory filings and registrations relating to 
DERMAGRAFT, certain manufacturing plant, equipment and materials relating to the Business, and DERMAGRAFT product inventory 
and accounts receivable. The Transferred Assets have been measured at their fair value less costs to sell as at December 31, 2013. 
An impairment charge of $636.9 million was recorded within discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement upon 
re-measurement of the divested assets to their fair value less costs to sell. The fair value of these assets was determined using the 
income approach, which used significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. These unobservable inputs included, among other things, 
risk-adjusted forecast future cash flows to be generated by the Company following the divestment of these assets and the 
determination of an appropriate discount rate to be applied in calculating the present value of forecast future cash flows. The fair 
value of these assets at the date the held-for-sale conditions were met amounted to $31.6 million.

Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown above are not 
necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company’s intent or 
ability to dispose of the financial instrument.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of financial instrument:
Building finance obligations – the fair value of building finance obligations are estimated based on the present value of future cash 
flows, and an estimate of the residual value of the underlying property at the end of the lease term, associated with these obligations.
The carrying amounts of other financial assets and liabilities materially approximate to their fair value because of the short term 
maturity of these amounts.
23. Shareholders’ equity
Authorized common stock
The authorized stock of Shire plc as at December 31, 2013 was 1,000,000,000 Ordinary Shares and 2 subscriber Ordinary Shares.
Dividends
Under Jersey law, Shire plc is entitled to make payments of dividends from its accumulated profits and other distributable reserves. 
At December 31, 2013 Shire plc’s distributable reserves were approximately $10.4 billion.
Treasury stock 
The Company records the purchase of its own shares by the EBT and under share buy-back program as a reduction of shareholders’ 
equity based on the price paid for the shares. At December 31, 2013, the EBT held 2.4 million Ordinary Shares (2012: 3.8 million) and 
0.4 million ADSs (2012: 1.1 million) and shares held under share buy-back program were 7 .1 million Ordinary Shares (2012: 2.7 million) 
and 0.9 million ADSs (2012: 0.3 million). During the year to December 31, 2013 a total of 4.2 million (2012: 4.5 million) Ordinary Shares 
and 0.8 million (2012: 0.9 million) ADSs had been purchased for total consideration of $243.8 million (2012: $205.8 million), including 
stamp duty and broker commission. 
Share buy-back program
In 2012 the Company commenced a share buy-back program of up to $500 million through both direct purchases of Ordinary 
Shares and through the purchase of Ordinary Shares underlying ADRs. The purchases have been made through independent third 
parties who have made trading decisions independently of, and uninfluenced by, the Company. The independence of the third parties 
enabled the Company to purchase Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares underlying ADRs) during close periods and other 
prohibited periods, should they arise. The amount, timing or prices of purchases, varied based on market conditions and other 
factors. The shares purchased to date are held as treasury shares.
During the year ending December 31, 2013, the Company made on-market repurchases totaling 6,191,965 Ordinary Shares at a cost 
of $193 million (excluding transaction costs). This represents 1.0% of the issued share capital of the Company as at the end of the 
quarter. Ordinary Shares purchased may be cancelled or be held as treasury shares, in accordance with the authority renewed by 
shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). At its AGM on April 24, 2012 the Company was authorized to make 
market purchases of up to 56,253,208 of its own Ordinary Shares. That authority expired at the AGM held on April 30, 2013 and was 
renewed. Under the new authority, which expires on the earlier of July 29, 2014 or the conclusion of the 2014 AGM, the Company 
was authorized to make market purchases of up to 55,741,587 of its own Ordinary Shares.
On November 11, 2013, contemporaneous with Shire’s announcement of its acquisition of ViroPharma, the Company’s share 
buyback program was terminated. Since the inception of the share buyback program the Company had purchased $300 million of 
Ordinary Shares and Ordinary Shares underlying ADRs.

Conversion of Shire’s 2.75% Convertible Bonds 
On November 26, 2013, the Company issued an optional redemption notice under the Trust Deed dated May 9, 2007 to holders of 
the Company’s Bonds. Consequently, as of December 31, 2013, Bondholders had voluntarily converted the Bonds into 33,806,464 
fully paid Ordinary Shares. See Note 16 for further details.
Income Access Share Arrangements (“IAS Trust”)
The Company has put into place income access arrangements which enable ordinary shareholders, other than ADS holders, to 
choose whether they receive their dividends from the Company, a company tax resident in the Republic of Ireland, or from Shire 
Biopharmaceutical Holdings (“Old Shire”), a Shire group company tax resident in the UK. 
Old Shire has issued one income access share to the Income Access Trust (the “IAS Trust”) which is held by the trustee of the IAS 
Trust (the “Trustee”). The mechanics of the arrangements are as follows:
If a dividend is announced or declared by Shire plc on its Ordinary Shares, an amount is paid by Old Shire by way of a dividend on 
the income access share to the Trustee, and such amount is paid by the Trustee to ordinary shareholders who have elected (or are 
deemed to have elected) to receive dividends under these arrangements. The dividend which would otherwise be payable by Shire 
plc to its ordinary shareholders will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount paid to its ordinary shareholders by the Trustee.
If the dividend paid on the income access share and on-paid by the Trustee to ordinary shareholders is less than the total amount of 
the dividend announced or declared by Shire plc on its Ordinary Shares, Shire plc will be obliged to pay a dividend on the relevant 
Ordinary Shares equivalent to the amount of the shortfall. In such a case, any dividend paid on the Ordinary Shares will generally be 
subject to Irish withholding tax at the rate of 20% or such lower rate as may be applicable under exemptions from withholding tax 
contained in Irish law.
An ordinary shareholder is entitled to make an income access share election such that he/she will receive his/her dividends (which 
would otherwise be payable by Shire plc) under these arrangements from Old Shire.
An ordinary shareholder who holds 25,000 or fewer Ordinary Shares at the first record date after he/she first becomes an ordinary 
shareholder, and who does not make a contrary election, will be deemed to have made an election (pursuant to the Shire plc articles 
of association) such that he/she will receive his/her dividends under these arrangements from Old Shire.
The ADS Depositary has made an election on behalf of all holders of ADSs such that they will receive dividends from Old Shire under 
the income access share arrangements. Dividends paid by Old Shire under the income access share arrangements will not, under 
current legislation, be subject to any UK or Irish withholding taxes. If a holder of ADSs does not wish to receive dividends from Old 
Shire under the income access share arrangements, he/she must withdraw his/her Ordinary Shares from the ADS program prior to 
the dividend record date set by the Depositary and request delivery of the Shire plc Ordinary Shares. This will enable him/her to 
receive dividends from Shire plc (if necessary, by making an election to that effect).
It is the expectation, although there can be no certainty, that Old Shire will distribute dividends on the income access share to the 
Trustee for the benefit of all ordinary shareholders who make (or are deemed to make) an income access share election in an amount 
equal to what would have been such ordinary shareholders’ entitlement to dividends from Shire plc in the absence of the income 
access share election. If any dividend paid on the income access share and or paid to the ordinary shareholders is less than such 
ordinary shareholders’ entitlement to dividends from Shire plc in the absence of the income access share election, the dividend on 
the income access share will be allocated pro rata among the ordinary shareholders and Shire plc will pay the balance to these 
ordinary shareholders by way of dividend. In such circumstances, there will be no grossing up by Shire plc in respect of, and Old 
Shire and Shire plc will not compensate those ordinary shareholders for, any adverse consequences including any Irish withholding 
tax consequences. 
The Company will be able to suspend or terminate these arrangements at any time, in which case the full Shire plc dividend will be 
paid directly by Shire plc to those ordinary shareholders (including the Depositary) who have made (or are deemed to have made) an 
income access share election. In such circumstances, there will be no grossing up by Shire plc in respect of, and Old Shire and Shire 
plc will not compensate those ordinary shareholders for, any adverse consequences including any Irish withholding tax 
consequences.
In the year ended December 31, 2013 Old Shire paid dividends totaling $91.1 million (2012: $81.5 million) on the income access share 
to the Trustee in an amount equal to the dividend Shire ordinary shareholders would have received from Shire.

25. Segmental reporting
Historically the Company had three business units and three reportable segments: Specialty Pharmaceuticals (“SP”), Human Genetic 
Therapies (“HGT”) and Regenerative Medicine (“RM”). 
On May 2, 2013 the Company announced that there would be a reorganization of the Company’s business to integrate the operation 
of these business units into a simplified One Shire organization in order to drive future growth and innovation. Consequently the SP , 
HGT and RM segments no longer exist.
Shire now comprises a single operating and reportable segment, consistent with the One Shire approach that underpins the 
business simplification. This segment is engaged in the research, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and 
sale of innovative specialist medicines to meet significant unmet patient needs. 
This segment is supported by several key functions: a Pipeline group, consisting of R&D and Business Development, will prioritize its 
activities towards late stage development programs across a variety of therapeutic areas, while focusing its pre-clinical development 
activities primarily in rare diseases; a Technical Operations group will be responsible for the Company’s global supply chain; and an 
In-line marketed products group will focus on commercialized products. The In-line marketed products group currently consists of 
four commercial units focused exclusively on commercial delivery to drive optimum performance of currently marketed products. 
The business is also supported by a simplified, centralized corporate function group. None of these functional groups meets all of the 
criteria to be an operating segment
The reorganization to a single operating and reportable segment is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the 
Executive Committee (which is the Company’s chief operating decision maker) for the purposes of evaluating performance, allocating 
resources, and planning and forecasting future periods.

The operating results associated with the DERMAGRAFT business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods 
presented. 
The Group has determined the amount of income tax expense or benefit allocable to continuing operations using the incremental 
approach described in ASC 740-20-45-8 and the relevant examples. As a result $9 million of income tax expense associated with the 
US operations was allocated to income from continuing operations for 2013 based on the primacy of continuing operations, due to 
changes in circumstances that caused a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets in future years, and in 
accordance with the rules prescribed under ASC 740-20-45. 
The amount of Income tax attributed to discontinued operations is disclosed in Note 9.

Provisions for uncertain tax positions
The Company files income tax returns in the Republic of Ireland, the UK, the US (both federal and state) and various other 
jurisdictions (see footnote (1) to the table above for major jurisdictions). With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to 
income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 1999. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions are in the process of auditing 
the Company’s tax returns for fiscal periods from 1999; these tax audits cover a range of issues, including transfer pricing, potential 
restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses, potential taxation of overseas dividends and controlled foreign companies’ rules.
While tax audits remain open, the Company also considers it reasonably possible that issues may be raised by tax authorities 
resulting in increases to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits, however, an estimate of such increase cannot be made.
The Company is required in certain tax jurisdictions to make advance deposits to tax authorities on receipt of tax assessments. 
These payments have been offset against the income tax liability within the balance sheet but have not reduced the provision for 
unrecognized tax benefits.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company considers it reasonably possible that certain audits currently being conducted will be concluded in the next twelve 
months, and as a result the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded at December 31, 2013 could decrease by up to 
approximately $210 million. As at the balance sheet date, the Company believes that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are 
adequate to cover the resolution of these audits. However, the resolution of these audits could have a significant impact on the 
financial statements if the settlement differs from the amount reserved. 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within income taxes. During the years 
ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized $0.4 million and $5.1 million in interest and penalties and the 
Company had a liability of $112.2 million and $119.6 million for the payment of interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2013 
and 2012 respectively.

Excluding $15.0 million of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013 (2012: $6.8 million), related to the net operating losses that result from excess stock based 
compensation and for which any benefit realized will be recorded to stockholders’ equity.
At December 31, 2013, the Company had a valuation allowance of $282.4 million (2012: $268.6 million) to reduce its deferred tax 
assets to estimated realizable value. These valuation allowances related primarily to operating loss, capital loss and tax-credit 
carry-forwards in Ireland (2013: $78.8 million; 2012: $73.9 million); the US (2013: $60.9 million; 2012: $37 .2 million); Germany (2013: 
$30.8 million; 2012: $96.9 million); and other foreign tax jurisdictions (2013: $111.9 million; 2012: $60.6 million).
Management is required to exercise judgement in determining whether deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. A 
valuation allowance is established where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities management considers it is more 
likely than not that the relevant deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management 
weighs all available positive and negative evidence including cumulative losses in recent years, projection of future taxable income, 
carry forward and carry back potential under relevant tax law, expiration period of tax attributes, taxable temporary differences, and 
prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies.
The net increase in valuation allowances of $13.8 million includes (i) increases of $104.5 million primarily in respect of losses and other 
temporary differences in various jurisdictions where management consider that there is insufficient positive evidence in respect of the 
factors described above to overcome cumulative losses and therefore it is more likely than not that the relevant deferred tax assets 
will not be realized in full, and (ii) a decrease of $90.7 million primarily in respect of German tax losses ($67 .4m),, which based on the 
assessment of the factors described above now provides sufficient positive evidence to support that the losses are more likely than 
not to be realized. The release of this valuation allowance has been recorded in the current period due to changes in the financing of 
the German subsidiary.
At December 31, 2013, based upon a consideration of the factors described above management believes it is more likely than not 
that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances. However, the amount of the 
deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if these factors are revised in the future periods.

granted and exercised during the year and Shire plc’s share price. At December 31, 2013 the EBT held 2.4 million Ordinary Shares 
and 0.4 million ADSs.

Valuation methodologies
The Company estimates the fair value of its share-based awards using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used 
to estimate the fair value of share–based awards include the grant price of the award, the expected stock-based award term, volatility 
of the Company’s share price, the risk-free rate and the Company’s dividend yield. The Company believes that the valuation 
technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in estimating the fair values of Shire’s 
stock-based awards. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by 
employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of 
fair value made by the Company under guidance issued by the FASB on share-based payment transactions.
The fair value of share awards granted was estimated using the following assumptions:
Period ended December 31,
2013
 $’M 
2012
$’M
Risk-free interest rate
1
0.1-0.9% 0.2-1%
Expected dividend yield 0.4-0.6% 0-0.6%
Expected life 1-4 years 1-4 years
Volatility 23-26% 24-32%
Forfeiture rate 5-9% 5-7%
1 
Risk free interest rate is
 
for UK and US grants
The following assumptions were used to value share-based awards:
• risk-free interest rate – for awards granted over ADSs, the US Federal Reserve treasury constant maturities rate with a term 
consistent with the expected life of the award is used. For awards granted over Ordinary Shares, the yield on UK government 
bonds with a term consistent with the expected life of the award is used;
• expected dividend yield – measured as the average annualized dividend estimated to be paid by the Company over the expected 
life of the award as a percentage of the share price at the grant date;
• expected life – estimated based on the contractual term of the awards and the effects of employees’ expected exercise and 
post-vesting employment termination behaviour; 
• expected volatility – measured using historical daily price changes of the Company’s share price over the respective expected life of 
the share-based awards at the date of the award; and
• the forfeiture rate is estimated using historical trends of the number of awards forfeited prior to vesting.

Non GAAP Measures
Non GAAP financial measures are used by the Company’s management to make operating decisions because they facilitate internal 
comparisons of the Company’s performance to historical results and to competitors’ results. The Company’s Remuneration 
Committee uses certain key Non GAAP measures when assessing the performance and compensation of employees, including 
Shire’s Executive Directors.
The Non GAAP measures are presented in this Annual Report as the Company’s management believe that they will provide investors 
with a means of evaluating, and an understanding of how Shire’s management evaluates, Shire’s performance and results on a 
comparable basis that is not otherwise apparent on a US GAAP basis, since many non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items that 
Shire’s management believe are not indicative of the core performance of the business may not be excluded when preparing financial 
measures under US GAAP . 
These Non GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared 
in accordance with US GAAP .
Where applicable the following items, including their tax effect, have been excluded from both 2013 and 2012 Non GAAP earnings:
Amortization and asset impairments:
• Intangible asset amortization and impairment charges; and
• Other than temporary impairment of investments.
Acquisitions and integration activities:
• Up-front payments and milestones in respect of in-licensed and acquired products;
• Costs associated with acquisitions, including transaction costs, fair value adjustments on contingent consideration and acquired 
inventory; 
• Costs associated with the integration of companies; and
• Noncontrolling interests in consolidated variable interest entities.
Divestments, reorganizations and discontinued operations:
• Gains and losses on the sale of non-core assets;
• Costs associated with restructuring and reorganization activities;
• Termination costs; and
• Income/(losses) from discontinued operations.
Legal and litigation costs:
• Net legal costs related to the settlement of litigation, government investigations and other disputes (excluding internal legal team 
costs).
Depreciation, which is included in Cost of product sales, R&D and SG&A costs in our US GAAP results, has been separately 
disclosed for the presentation of 2013 and 2012 Non GAAP earnings. 
Cash generation represents net cash provided by operating activities, excluding up-front and milestone payments for in-licensed and 
acquired products, tax and interest payments.
Free cashflow represents net cash provided by operating activities, excluding up-front and milestone payments for in-licensed and 
acquired products, but including capital expenditure in the ordinary course of business.
Non GAAP adjusted ROIC aims to measure true underlying economic performance of the Group, by making a number of 
adjustments to ROIC as derived from Shire’s Non GAAP financial results including:
• Adding back to Non GAAP operating income all R&D expenses and operating lease costs incurred in the period;
• Capitalizing on the Group’s balance sheet historic, cumulative R&D, IPR&D, intangible asset impairment charges and operating lease 
costs which previously have been expensed;
• Deducting from Non GAAP operating income an amortization charge for the above capitalized costs, based on the estimated 
commercial lives of the relevant products; 
• Excluding the income statement and balance sheet impact of non-operating assets (such as surplus cash and non-strategic 
investments); and
• Taxing the resulting adjusted operating income at the underlying Non GAAP tax rate.
Non GAAP EBITDA represents Non GAAP operating income before depreciation.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Shareholder information
E-communications
Shire offers shareholders the ability to access shareholder 
documents, such as its annual reports and notices of AGMs, 
by way of e-communications as an alternative to receiving 
paper copies through the post.
To register for e-communications, simply log onto  
www.shareview.co.uk/myportfolio and follow the online 
instructions. To start, you will require your shareholder reference 
number which you will find on your share certificate or dividend 
tax voucher. Following registration, you will need to alter your 
mailing preference to e-communications and confirm your  
email address.
Shareholders who do not elect to receive documents or 
notifications via e-communications will continue to receive paper 
copies.
Shareholder security
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders 
have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas 
based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them 
what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or 
UK investments.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports. If you receive any unsolicited investment 
advice:
• make sure you get the name of the person and organization;
• check that they are properly authorized by the FSA before 
getting involved by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/register/; and
• report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0845 606 1234 or 
by completing an online form at: www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/
regulated/law/alerts/form.shtml
If you deal with an unauthorized firm, you will not be eligible to 
receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme.
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses 
will be included in Company mailings.
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found 
on the FSA website: www.fsa.gov.uk/consumerinformation/

Dividends
Shareholders are able to choose how they receive their 
dividends:
• directly into their bank account*; or
• by cheque.
* Shire preferred option.
The quickest and most efficient way to receive your dividends 
is to have them paid directly into your bank account. Those 
selecting this payment method receive a tax voucher with each 
payment. To change how you receive your dividends, either log 
on to www.shareview.co.uk/myportfolio or contact Equiniti.
Income Access Share (“IAS”) Arrangements
Shareholders who elect, or are deemed to have elected, to 
receive their dividends via the IAS arrangements will receive their 
dividends from a UK source (rather than directly from the 
Company which is an Irish tax resident company) for UK tax 
purposes.
Shareholders who hold 25,000 or fewer shares at the first 
dividend record date after becoming a shareholder in the 
Company will be deemed to have elected to receive their 
dividends under the IAS arrangements, unless they elect 
otherwise.
Shareholders who hold more than 25,000 shares and who wish 
to receive their dividends from a UK source must make an IAS 
Election. All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked.
Unless shareholders have made an IAS Election, or are deemed 
to have made an IAS Election, dividends will be received from an 
Irish source and will be taxed accordingly.
An IAS dividend election form can be found on Shire’s website at:

Shire’s results could be materially adversely affected. The risks 
and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, that: 
• Shire’s products may not be a commercial success; 
• revenues from ADDERALL XR are subject to generic erosion 
and revenues from INTUNIV will become subject to generic 
competition starting in December 2014; 
• the failure to obtain and maintain reimbursement, or an 
adequate level of reimbursement, by third-party payors in a 
timely manner for Shire’s products may impact future revenues, 
financial condition and results of operations;
• Shire conducts its own manufacturing operations for certain of 
its Rare Diseases products and is reliant on third party 
contractors to manufacture other products and to provide 
goods and services. Some of Shire’s products or ingredients are 
only available from a single approved source for manufacture. 
Any disruption to the supply chain for any of Shire’s products 
may result in Shire being unable to continue marketing or 
developing a product or may result in Shire being unable to do 
so on a commercially viable basis for some period of time;
• the development, approval and manufacturing of Shire’s 
products is subject to extensive oversight by various regulatory 
agencies and regulatory approvals or interventions associated 
with changes to manufacturing sites, ingredients or 
manufacturing processes could lead to significant delays, 
increase in operating costs, lost product sales, an interruption of 
research activities or the delay of new product launches;
• the actions of certain customers could affect Shire’s ability to sell 
or market products profitably. Fluctuations in buying or 
distribution patterns by such customers can adversely impact 
Shire’s revenues, financial conditions or results of operations;
• investigations or enforcement action by regulatory authorities or 
law enforcement agencies relating to Shire’s activities in the 
highly regulated markets in which it operates may result in the 
distraction of senior management, significant legal costs and the 
payment of substantial compensation or fines;
• adverse outcomes in legal matters and other disputes, including 
Shire’s ability to enforce and defend patents and other 
intellectual property rights required for its business, could have a 
material adverse effect on Shire’s revenues, financial condition 
or results of operations;
• Shire faces intense competition for highly qualified personnel 
from other companies, academic institutions, government 
entities and other organizations. Shire is undergoing a corporate 
reorganization and the consequent uncertainty could adversely 
impact Shire’s ability to attract and/or retain the highly skilled 
personnel needed for Shire to meet its strategic objectives;
• failure to achieve Shire’s strategic objectives with respect to the 
acquisition of ViroPharma Incorporated may adversely affect 
Shire’s financial condition and results of operations;
and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in 
Shire’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including those risks outlined in pages 24 to 29.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Directors’ report
The Directors present their annual report and the audited financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.
Principal activity and business review
Shire plc and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as either 
“Shire”, or the “Company”) is a leading specialty 
biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and 
marketing innovative specialty medicines that address significant 
unmet patient needs. 
The Company has grown through acquisition, completing a 
series of major transactions that have brought therapeutic, 
geographic and pipeline growth and diversification. The 
Company will continue to evaluate companies, products and 
pipeline opportunities that offer a good strategic fit and have the 
potential to deliver demonstrable value to all of the Company’s 
stakeholders: patients, physicians, policy makers, payors, 
investors and employees.
The Company unified its business during 2013 by integrating 
the operations of the Specialty Pharmaceuticals (“SP”), Human 
Genetic Therapies (“HGT”) and Regenerative Medicine (“RM”) 
business units into a simplified “One Shire” organization. The 
One Shire model has created a simple structure and a focused, 
efficient organization that is scalable for growth. 
The principal legislation under which the Company operates is 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and regulations made thereunder. 
The Ordinary Shares of the Company are listed on the London 
Stock Exchange in the UK, and American Depositary Shares 
(‘ADS’), representing three Ordinary Shares of the Company, 
(evidenced by an American Depositary Receipt issued by Shire’s 
Depositary, Citibank, N.A.) are listed on the NASDAQ Global 
Select Market in the USA.
Business review
The Business review of the Group can be found in the 
consolidated financial statements and Annual Report and 
Accounts of the Company for the year to December 31, 2013, 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Listing Authority 
requirements (the ‘Shire Annual Report’); in the Chairman’s 
review on pages 04 and 05; the Chief Executive Officer’s review 
on pages 06 to 09 and the Review of our business on pages 
34 to 49. The Shire Annual Report also provides a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company and 
the Group as well as the Group’s risk management objectives 
and policies that are in place to assist in mitigating the potential 
impact. Details of the Company’s financial risks can be found 
in Note N on page 184 to these financial statements.
During the year the Company continued in its capacity as 
the parent company for the Group in the management of its 
subsidiaries.
The Company is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland.
Key performance indicators 
The Company’s key performance indicators are the same as the 
Group’s. For details of the Group’s key performance indicators 
see page 30 in the Shire Annual Report.
Income Access Share arrangements
In 2008 Shire put in place and continues to operate Income 
Access Share (‘IAS’) arrangements enabling shareholders to 
choose whether they receive their dividends from a company tax 
resident in the Republic of Ireland or from a company tax resident 
in the UK. Further details in respect of the IAS arrangements can 
be found in the Shire Annual Report.
Results and dividends
A loss on ordinary activities before taxation of $69.9 million was 
recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended 
December 31, 2012: $74.1 million).
The net assets of the Company increased from $9,548.4 million 
for the year ended December 31, 2012 to $10,474.1 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the 
Company’s 2.75% Convertible Bonds converting in the year.
Dividends paid and dividend policy
The Company paid dividends amounting to $5.7 million in the 
year (2012: $4.8 million). In accordance with IAS arrangements, 
the Company directed Shire Biopharmaceuticals Holdings to 
pay dividends totalling $91.1 million (2012: $81.5 million) to 
those shareholders who choose to receive their dividends 
from a company tax resident in the UK.
A first interim dividend for the six months to June 30, 2013 
of 3.00 cents (1.95 pence) per Ordinary Share, equivalent to 
9.00 cents per ADS, was paid in October 2013. The Board 
has resolved to pay a second interim dividend of 16.93 cents 
(10.21 pence) per Ordinary Share equivalent to 50.79 cents 
per ADS for the six months to December 31, 2013.
This is consistent with Shire’s stated policy of paying a dividend 
semi-annually, set in US cents per Ordinary Share. Typically, the 
first interim payment each year will be higher than the previous 
year’s first interim USD dividend. Dividend growth for the full year 
will be reviewed by the Board when the second interim dividend 
is determined. However there is no guarantee that dividends will 
be declared for any period.
Liquidity, cash flow and going concern
The Company and the Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future development, performance 
and position are set out in the Shire Annual Report in the 
Chairman’s review, Chief Executive Officer’s review and Review 
of our business. The financial position of the Company and the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in the Liquidity and capital resources section of the 
Review of our business of the Shire Annual Report. The Review 
of our business also includes information in respect of the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital; 
its financial risk management objectives; details of its hedging 
activity; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. Details 
of the Company’s financial instruments are disclosed in Note N 
on page 184 to these financial statements.
170 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Shire 2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014 
On November 26, 2013, Shire issued an optional redemption 
notice under the Trust Deed dated May 9, 2007 (the “Trust Deed”) 
to holders (the “Holders”) of the Company’s 2.75% Convertible 
Bonds due 2014 (the “Bonds”). The aggregate outstanding 
principal amount of Bonds on November 25, 2013, the last 
practicable date prior to the date of the optional redemption 
notice, was $1,075,070,000. The last day on which bondholders 
were able to exercise their conversion rights was December 13, 
2013. Those Bonds which were not voluntarily converted were 
redeemed by the Company on December 27 , 2013 at par 
together with interest accrued to that date. As of December 31, 
2013, Bonds in an aggregate principal amount of the 
$1,099,050,000 had been voluntarily converted into 33,806,464 
fully paid Ordinary Shares at a conversion price of US$32.51 per 
Ordinary Share, in the capital of the Company, with par value of 
£0.05 each. The remaining outstanding Bonds in an aggregate 
principle amount of $950,000 were redeemed pursuant to the 
Optional Redemption Notice issued on November 26, 2013. 
Following the redemption of all the outstanding Bonds, the 
Company cancelled the listing of the Bonds on the Official List 
maintained by the UK Listing Authority and the admission to 
trading of the Bonds on the Professional Securities Market of the 
London Stock Exchange.
Term Loan Agreement
On November 11, 2013, Shire entered into a $2.60 billion Facilities 
Agreement with, among others, Morgan Stanley Bank 
International Limited (acting as lead arranger and agent) (the 
“Facilities Agreement”). The Facilities Agreement comprises two 
credit facilities: (i) a $1.75 billion term loan facility and (ii) a $0.85 
billion term loan facility. 
On December 13, 2013 and on February 21, 2014, the Company 
cancelled part of the $2.60 billion term loan facility. The revised 
Facilities Agreement of $1.75 billion now comprises two credit 
facilities: (i) a $0.55 billion term loan facility and (ii) a $0.85 billion 
term loan facility. All other terms and conditions remain 
unchanged.
The $0.55 billion term loan facility, which matures on November 
10, 2014, may be used only to finance the purchase price payable 
in respect of Shire’s acquisition of ViroPharma (including certain 
related costs) and for the redemption of Shire’s Bonds. Shire has 
the option to extend the maturity of the $0.55 billion term loan 
facility once by a further 364 days.
The $0.85 billion term loan facility, which matures on November 
11, 2015, may be used only to finance the purchase price payable 
in respect of Shire’s acquisition of ViroPharma (including certain 
related costs).
Interest on any loans made under the facilities will be payable on 
the last day of each interest period, which may be one week or 
one, two, three or six months at the election of Shire, or as 
otherwise agreed with the lenders. The interest rate applicable to 
the $0.55 billion term loan facility is LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum 
and increases by 0.25% per annum on August 11, 2014 and on 
three-month intervals thereafter.
The interest rate applicable to the $0.85 billion term loan facility 
commenced at LIBOR plus 1.15% per annum until delivery of the 
compliance certificate for the year ending December 31, 2013 
and thereafter is subject to change depending upon the prevailing 
ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA of the Group (each as defined in the 
Facilities Agreement), in respect of the most recently completed 
financial year or financial half year.
Shire shall also pay a commitment fee on the available but 
unutilized commitments under the $0.55 billion term loan facility 
and the $0.85 billion term loan facility for the availability period 
applicable to each facility. With effect from first utilization, the 
commitment fee rate will be 35% of the applicable margin.  
Before first utilization, the commitment fee rate will increase in 
stages from 0% to 35% of the applicable margin over a period  
of three months.
The Facilities Agreement includes customary representations and 
warranties, covenants and events of default, including 
requirements that the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA of the Group 
(each as defined in the Facilities Agreement) must not, at any 
time, exceed 3.5:1 for the Relevant Period (as defined in the 
Facilities Agreement), except that following certain acquisitions, 
including the ViroPharma acquisition, Shire may elect to increase 
the ratio to 4.0:1 in the relevant period in which the acquisition 
was completed and the immediately following relevant period. In 
addition, for each 12-month period ending December 31 or June 
30, the ratio of EBITDA of the Group to Net Interest (each as 
defined in the Facilities Agreement) must not be less than 4.0:1.
The Facilities Agreement restricts (subject to certain covenants) 
Shire’s ability to incur additional financial indebtedness, grant 
security over its assets or provide or guarantee loans. 
Furthermore, any lender may require mandatory prepayment of 
its participation if there is a change of control of Shire. In addition, 
in certain circumstances, the net proceeds of certain shares, 
undertakings or business disposals by Shire must be applied 
towards the mandatory prepayment of the facilities, subject to 
certain exceptions.
Events of default under the facilities include: (i) non-payment of 
any amounts due under the facilities, (ii) failure to satisfy any 
financial covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation in any of the 
finance documents, (iv) failure to pay, or certain other defaults, 
under other financial indebtedness, (v) certain insolvency events 
or proceedings, (vi) material adverse changes in the business, 
operations, assets or financial condition of Shire and its 
subsidiaries, (vii) if it becomes unlawful for Shire or any of its 
subsidiaries that are parties to the Facilities Agreement to perform 
their obligations or (viii) if Shire or any subsidiary of Shire which is 
a party to the Facilities Agreement repudiates the Facilities 
Agreement or any other finance document, among others. The 
Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement
In addition, the Group has committed multi-currency revolving 
and swingline facilities of $1,200 million which mature in 2015 (the 
“RCF”). The RCF, which includes a $250 million swingline facility, 
may be used for general corporate purposes and matures on 
November 23, 2015.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements. Further details regarding the 
adoption of the going concern basis can be found in the 
accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements.

Purchase of own shares
During the year to December 31, 2012 the Company commenced 
a share buyback program, for the purpose of returning funds to 
shareholders, of up to $500 million through both direct purchases 
of Ordinary Shares and through the purchase of Ordinary Shares 
underlying ADRs.
During the year ended December 31, 2013 the Company made 
on-market repurchases totaling 6,191,965 Ordinary Shares at a 
cost of $193 million (excluding transaction costs). The program 
covers purchases of Ordinary Shares for cancellation or to be 
held as treasury shares, in accordance with the authority 
renewed by shareholders at the Company’s AGM on April 30, 
2013 when the Company was authorized to make market 
purchases of up to 55,741,587 of its own Ordinary Shares. 
On November 11, 2013, contemporaneous with Shire’s 
announcement of its acquisition of ViroPharma, the Company’s 
share buyback program was terminated. Since the inception of 
the share buyback program the Company had purchased $300 
million of Ordinary Shares and Ordinary Shares underlying ADRs.
Payment of creditors
The Company is non-trading and accordingly has no trade 
creditors.
Directors’ liability insurance and indemnification
In the year under review, the Group maintained an insurance 
policy for its Directors and Officers in respect of liabilities arising 
out of any act, error or omission whilst acting in their capacity as 
Directors or Officers. Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
were also in place during the year under review for the benefit of 
Directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may 
potentially incur to third-parties in the course of their duties. 
These remain in force at the date of this report.
Subsequent events
On January 16, 2014, Shire announced that it had sold its 
DERMAGRAFT assets to Organogenesis comprising the key 
operating assets relating to the development, manufacture and 
sale of the DERMAGRAFT product. These assets include 
intellectual property relating to DERMAGRAFT including patents, 
trademarks and know-how; regulatory filings and registrations 
relating to DERMAGRAFT; certain manufacturing plant, 
equipment and materials; DERMAGRAFT product inventory and 
accounts receivable.
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of 
this report confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office 
as auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ report
(continued)
172 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Independent Auditor’s report to the members of Shire plc 
Opinion on financial statements of Shire plc
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of its loss for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
The financial statements comprise the profit and loss account, balance sheet and the related notes A to P . The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement that the Company is a going concern. We confirm that we 
have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements 
is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Investment in subsidiaries
There is a risk that the 
Company’s investment in Shire 
Pharmaceutical Holdings Ireland 
Limited may be impaired.
We have challenged the Directors’ impairment analysis and have considered the valuation of the Company’s subsidiary 
against other indicators of value such as the overall market capitalisation of the Shire group.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and 
not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect 
to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Company to be $60 million, based on the net assets of the Company and then capped at 
materiality established for the Shire plc group financial statements.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $3m, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
174 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM An overview of the scope of our audit 
• Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment, including internal control, and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement. Audit work to respond to the risks of material misstatement was performed directly by the audit 
engagement team.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
•  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Company acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

176 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 WWW.SHIRE.COM A. Presentation of the financial statements
Preparation of financial statements
These separate financial statements of the Company are 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’) as at December 31, 
2013 and in accordance with the requirements of Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. They have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments at fair value as permitted by the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991 and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
accounting standards.
Consolidated accounts prepared in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (‘US 
GAAP’), in which the financial results and cash flow statement of 
the Company and its subsidiaries are included, can be found in 
the Shire Annual Report.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the Company’s accounting policies described below, which 
have been applied consistently throughout the current and 
preceding year and have been approved by the Board.
B. Accounting policies
Going Liquidity, cash flow and going concern
The Group’s balance sheet includes $2,239.4 million of cash and 
cash equivalents at December 31, 2013. The Group has 
committed multi-currency revolving and swingline facilities of 
$1.20 billion, which mature in 2015, and a $1.75 billion Facilities 
Agreement.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the report and financial statements.
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at historic cost less 
any provision for impairment.
Dividends paid and received
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are 
recognized as a liability in the Company’s financial statements  
in the period in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment 
is established. Dividend income is recognized in the profit and 
loss account on the date the Company’s right to receive payment 
is established.
Expenditure
Expenditure is recognized in respect of goods and services 
received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms. 
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in 
respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation 
can be reliably estimated.
Local currency and currency translation
The financial statements have been presented in local currency, 
US dollar. The local currency is defined as the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance 
sheet dates are reported at the rate of exchange prevailing at that 
date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in 
a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Share-based compensation
The Company operates equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of the options has been valued 
using option-pricing models. Options and performance share 
awards granted without market conditions are valued using the 
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Options and performance 
share awards granted with market conditions are valued using a 
binomial model. In accordance with FRS 20 ‘Share-based 
payment’, the resulting cost for the Company’s employees is 
recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period of the awards. The value of the charge is adjusted to 
reflect expected and actual levels of vesting. The cost for awards 
granted to the Company’s subsidiaries’ employees represents 
additional capital contributions by the Company in its 
subsidiaries. An additional investment in subsidiaries has been 
recorded in respect of those awards granted to the Company’s 
subsidiaries’ employees, with a corresponding increase in the 
Company’s shareholders’ equity. The additional capital 
contribution is based on the fair value at the grant date of the 
awards issued. This accounting treatment applies as the parent 
has granted the share option rather than being subsidiary 
granting an option in the parent’s equity. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified  
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting 
all of its liabilities.

B. Accounting policies (continued)
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or 
recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences that 
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax 
in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred 
at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences 
between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated 
in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains 
and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in 
which they are recognized in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore 
recognized only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it 
can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying 
timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply 
in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax 
balances are not discounted.
Related party transactions
Under the provisions of FRS 8 ‘Related party disclosures’, as the 
consolidated financial statements in which the Company’s results 
are included have been made available to the public, the 
Company is not required to separately disclose details of related 
party transactions with relation to wholly owned subsidiaries. 
Pensions
The Company contributes to personal defined contribution 
pension plans of employees. Contributions are charged to the 
profit and loss account as they become payable. Differences 
between contributions payable in the year and contributions 
actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the 
balance sheet.
Convertible bonds
On issuance, or substitution from other Shire Group companies, 
of convertible bonds the Company bifurcates these convertible 
bonds into their debt and equity components. The fair value of 
the debt component is estimated using the market interest rate 
for an equivalent non-convertible bond. If the fair value of an 
equivalent non-convertible bond is greater than the carrying value 
of convertible bond, then the limit of the carrying value of 
convertible bond allocated to the liabilities is that carrying value. 
The amount allocated to the debt component is classified as a 
liability and subsequently measured on an amortized cost basis 
until extinguished on conversion or redemption of the bonds. The 
remainder of the proceeds from the issuance, or the fair value on 
substitution from other Shire Group companies, of convertible 
bonds is allocated to the equity component, (which represents 
the embedded conversion option), and is classified in 
shareholders’ equity, net of any income tax effects. The carrying 
amount of the equity component is not re-measured in 
subsequent periods. On conversion the equity component has 
been reclassified to Other Reserves in line with the requirements 
of FRS25 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’.
Treasury shares
Where the Company purchases the Company’s own share 
capital, the consideration paid is deducted from the total 
shareholders’ funds and classified as treasury shares until they 
are cancelled. Where such shares are subsequently sold or 
re-issued, any consideration received is included in total 
shareholders funds. 
Where the Company enters a financial close or other prohibited 
period and broker contracts cannot be cancelled in this period, a 
liability equivalent to the present value of the maximum number of 
shares available to purchase is debited against total equity. 
Accretion of the discount is recorded in the profit and loss during 
the close period. Shares purchased in the close period are 
deducted from the liability and are recorded as treasury shares 
with any remaining liability on leaving the close period is reversed 
with a corresponding credit in shareholder equity.

Shire 2.75% convertible bonds 
The Bonds bore interest at 2.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on November 9 and May 9. The Bonds constituted 
direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Company, and rank pari passu and ratably, without any 
preference amongst themselves, and equally with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the 
Company.
The Bonds were redeemable at the option of the Company, at their principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest if: (i) 
at any time after May 23, 2012 if on no less than 20 dealing days in any period of 30 consecutive dealing days the value of Shire’s 
Ordinary Shares underlying each Bond in the principal amount of $100,000 would exceed $130,000; or (ii) at any time conversion 
rights have been exercised, and/or purchases and corresponding cancellations, and/or redemptions effected in respect of 85% or 
more in principal amount of Bonds originally issued. The Bonds were repayable in US dollars, but also contain provisions entitling the 
Company to settle redemption amounts in Pounds sterling, or in the case of the Final Maturity Date and or any change of control 
Shire, by delivery of the underlying Ordinary Shares and a cash top-up amount. 
The Bonds were convertible into Ordinary Shares during the conversion period, being the period from June 18, 2007 until the earlier 
of: (i) the close of business on the date falling fourteen days prior to the Final Maturity Date; (ii) if the Bonds have been called for 
redemption by the Company, the close of business fourteen days before the date fixed for redemption; (iii) the close of business on 
the day prior to a Bond holder giving notice of redemption in accordance with the conditions; and (iv) the giving of notice by the 
trustee that the Bonds are accelerated by reason of the occurrence of an event of default.
Upon conversion, the Bond holder is entitled to receive Ordinary Shares at the conversion price of $32.83 per Ordinary Share, 
(subject to adjustment as outlined below).
The conversion price is subject to adjustment in respect of (i) any dividend or distribution by the Company, (ii) a change of control and 
(iii) customary anti-dilution adjustments for, inter alia, share consolidations, share splits, spin-off events, rights issues, bonus issues 
and reorganizations. The initial conversion price of $33.5879 was adjusted to $33.17 with effect from March 11, 2009 as a result of 
cumulative dividend payments during the period from October 2007 to April 2009 inclusive, and was further adjusted to $32.83 with 
effect from March 11, 2011 as a result of cumulative dividend payments during the period April 2009 to April 2011 inclusive. The 
Ordinary Shares issued on conversion will be delivered credited as fully paid, and will rank pari passu in all respects with all fully paid 
Ordinary Shares in issue on the relevant conversion date.

M. T reasury shares
The treasury shares reserve represents the cost of shares in the Company purchased in the market and held by the Company for the 
purpose of returning funds to shareholders. The number of Ordinary Shares held by the Company as at 31 December 2013 was 
9,823,536 with a purchase value of $300.1 million (including transaction costs) (2012: 3,631,571 with a purchase value of $106.5 
million).
The Company instructed independent third parties to purchase the shares of the Company up to a maximum value of $500m. These 
contracts could be cancelled at any time other than when the Company was in a financial close or other prohibited period. As the 
contracts cannot be cancelled in a close or other prohibited period, the Company is obliged to recognise a liability equivalent to the 
present value of the maximum number of shares still available to purchase which is debited against total equity. Accretion of the 
discount is recorded in the profit and loss during the close or other prohibited period. Shares purchased in the close period or other 
prohibited were deducted from the liability and recorded as treasury shares with any remaining liability on leaving the close or other 
prohibited period is reversed with a credit recognised in shareholder equity. On November 11, 2013, contemporaneous with Shire’s 
announcement of its acquisition of ViroPharma, the Company’s share buyback program was terminated. Since the inception of the 
share buyback program the Company had purchased $300 million of Ordinary Shares and Ordinary Shares underlying ADRs.
N. Risk management and financial instruments
Financial risk factors
The Company’s risks are managed on a Group basis.
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk; liquidity risk; and market risk (including foreign currency 
exchange risk, price risk and interest rate risk).
The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk 
exposures.
The Group’s financial risk management is carried out by a corporate treasury function conducted within a framework of policies and 
procedures approved annually by the Company’s Board of Directors. The corporate treasury function identifies, evaluates and 
hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. As a matter of policy, the Group does not undertake 
speculative transactions that would increase currency or interest rate exposure.
Further information in respect of the financial risk management of the Group can be obtained from the Shire Annual Report in the 
consolidated accounts for the year ending December 31, 2013.
Credit risk
As at December 31, 2013 the Company had amounts due from Group undertakings and other debtors which in the aggregate 
totalled $53.2 million. The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk from these amounts is $53.2 million. 
Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of funding through an 
adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
The Company finances its activities through debt securities and committed bank facilities, borrowings and the repayment of loans 
from Group companies and the proceeds of asset or investment disposals and cash generated from private and public offerings of 
equity.
The Company anticipates that its funding sources will be sufficient to meet its anticipated future administrative expenses, debt 
principal, dividend obligations and service costs as they become due over the next twelve months.

bearing. The Company had short-term borrowings of $620.5 million from another Group company, which are repayable on demand 
and bear interest at floating rates. Interest on these borrowings in the period amounted to $6.9 million and the Directors do not 
perceive that servicing this debt poses any significant risk to the Company given its size in relation to the Company’s net assets. 
Market risk sensitivity analysis
FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires a market risk sensitivity analysis illustrating the fair value of the Company’s 
financial instruments and the impact on the Company’s profit and loss account and shareholders’ equity of reasonably possible 
changes in selected market risks. The Company has no financial assets or liabilities that expose it to market risk, other than amounts 
owed to Group undertakings of $620.5 million. The Directors do not believe that a 1% movement in interest rates will have a material 
impact on the Company’s profit and loss account or shareholders’ equity.
Financial instruments
The table below sets out the Company’s accounting classification of each class of financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair 
values at December 31, 2013.

(i)
 The carrying amount of amounts due to and from Group undertakings and other debtors is at approximate fair value because of the short term maturity of the amounts.
(ii)
 The fair value of the Company’s convertible bonds is based on the quoted market price of the bonds at the balance sheet date – as such the fair value quoted above 
represents the composite fair value for both the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds, whereas the carrying amount represents only the liability 
component.
Capital risk management
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt, which includes borrowings disclosed in Note I, issued capital, reserves and 
retained earnings as disclosed in Note L. The Company manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to 
continue as a going concern and to ensure the Group has sufficient capital available to meet future funding requirements. The Group 
had net cash, as determined under US GAAP , of $2,230.5 million at December 31, 2013 (2012 net cash: $372.9 million), which is low 
relative to its market capitalization, and positions the Group to take advantage of any opportunities that might arise to develop the 
business. Details of funding requirements are explained in the Liquidity and capital resources section of the Review of our business in 
the Shire Annual Report in the consolidated accounts for the year ending December 31, 2013.
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

O. Commitments
Capital commitments
There are no significant capital commitments relating to the Company.
Guarantees
The Company has guaranteed external lease commitments, overdrafts, trade facility lines and other banking obligations of various 
subsidiaries, amounting to $130.7 million (2012: $126.4 million).
Revolving credit facilities agreement
On November 23, 2010 the Company entered into the RCF. The RCF is for an aggregate amount of $1,200 million and canceled the 
Company’s then existing committed revolving credit facility. The RCF, which includes a $250 million swingline facility, may be used for 
general corporate purposes and matures on November 23, 2015. 
The interest rate on each loan drawn under the RCF for each interest period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate 
of the applicable margin (ranging from 0.90 to 2.25 per cent per annum) and LIBOR for the applicable currency and interest period. 
Shire also pays a commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 35 per cent per annum of the applicable margin.
Under the RCF it is required that (i) Shire’s ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA (as defined within the RCF agreement) does not exceed 3.5 to 
1 for either the 12 month period ending December 31 or June 30 unless Shire has exercised its option (which is subject to certain 
conditions) to increase it to 4.0 to 1 for two consecutive testing dates; (ii) the ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest (as defined in the RCF 
agreement) must not be less than 4.0 to 1, for either the 12 month period ending December 31 or June 30, and (iii) additional 
limitations on the creation of liens, disposal of assets, incurrence of indebtedness, making of loans, giving of guarantees and granting 
security over assets. These financial and operating covenants have not had, and are not expected to have, an effect on the 
Company’s financial position and liquidity.
On entering into the RCF in November 2010 the Company paid arrangement costs of $8.0 million, which have been recorded as 
deferred charges, with amortization of these costs to the Company’s income statement over the contractual term of the RCF. 
The availability of loans under the new RCF is subject to customary conditions.
Fees for the arrangement of the RCF and ongoing commitment fees are borne by another Group company.
Term Loan Agreement
See the Director’s report for details of the Term Loan Agreement entered into on November 11, 2013.

Arden has performed satisfactorily despite poor markets. We 
continue to capitalise on and expand our relationship broking 
model, aiming to grow further from our already strong base. 
We have generated cash as well as making a profit such that 
our cash at the year end was £9.5 million, putting Arden in 
a strong position to grow our franchise at an opportunistic 
time. 
Earnings for the year to October 2008 are, as with other 
UK brokers, below earnings in 2007. Current conditions do 
however present opportunities for our business to grow its 
franchise. The withdrawal of many investment banks from the 
small and mid cap markets is no doubt an opportunity for 
Arden, which has both the people and the capacity to reap 
benefits from the downturn. 
We are now able to hire high-calibre staff at considerably 
lower cost than was the case twelve months ago. To this 
end we have during the course of the year hired eleven 
senior staff, with a further five joining in the two months 
since our October year end. In 2008 we also expanded our 
sector coverage, adding financials, electronics and electrical 
equipment, and healthcare.
It is the Board’s view that the current markets must represent 
an opportunity rather than a threat, given the strength of our 
balance sheet.
Trading since October has remained difficult but we are on a 
sound footing with a strong balance sheet and a pipeline of 
new business that is creditable given difficult markets. The 
Board has decided to retain cash for building the platform, 
and has therefore not declared a final dividend.
Finally, I would like to thank all concerned for their contribution 
in these very challenging times.

Introduction
Arden’s performance in the year to 31 October has been 
satisfactory, given weak markets. The FTSE All Share index 
was down 37% over the year while revenue in our equities 
division was down 12%. Arden completed twelve corporate 
finance transactions, despite the scarcity of finance available 
for deals. 
Financial Review
Revenue in the year ended 31 October 2008 was down 
by 32% to £11.4 million (2007: £16.8 million). Underlying 
profit before tax declined by 62% to £2.1 million (2007: £5.5 
million). Profit before tax — after share-based payments and 
one-off costs from adviser fees related to aborted bid talks 
— was down by 73% to £1.4 million (2007: £5.2 million). 
Cash generation was strong with balances up 20% to £9.5 
million (2007: £7.9 million). Net cash is some 430% of our 
£2.2 million regulatory capital requirements.
Underlying basic earnings per share (before aborted bid costs 
and share-based payments) fell to 5.9p from 15.5p with 
underlying diluted earnings per share down to 5.4p from 
14.4p. Basic earnings per share fell to 3.0p from 14.1p while 
diluted earnings per share declined to 2.7p from 13.1p.
Equities Division
Our equities business is proving to be very defensive with 
revenue down 12% to £6.5 million (2007: £7.4 million) 
against a decline of 37% in the FTSE All Share index over 
the same period. Since the year end, commission revenue has 
continued to be challenging, as negative sentiment magnified 
the usual seasonal decline in volumes
Corporate Finance
During the year we completed twelve corporate finance 
transactions including eight M&A and pre-IPO deals, two 
IPOs and two secondary fundraisings, raising £75 million for 
our clients, compared with £205 million in 2007. Corporate 
finance activity is weak compared with recent years. I believe, 
though, that corporate finance will drive any sustained 
recovery in the wider market and our strong team will seize 
the opportunities. 
Dividend
The Board is not proposing a final dividend for the year ended 
31 October 2008 (2007: 4.5p). Arden paid an interim dividend 
of 2.2p (2007: 2.2p) per ordinary share on 3 October 2008.
Outlook
We remain focussed on growing our business, by taking 
advantage of opportunities arising from the market downturn. 
Equities revenue remains challenging since the year end. The 
corporate finance pipeline is creditable, although as ever the 
timing of deals is uncertain.
The number of high-quality staff available to recruit continues 
to rise, and it is our intention to take full advantage of all 
opportunities arising from the market conditions.

Introduction
Whilst the Group is not obliged to comply with the Combined 
Code, the Directors have agreed to adopt the ethos of those 
regulations and to disclose information relating to corporate 
governance.

and four Non-Executives. The current composition is as 
follows:
Sir David Rowe-Ham* Chairman
Jonathan Keeling Chief Executive Officer
Trevor Norris Group Finance Director and 
 Company Secretary
Tony Bartlett Non-Executive
Philip Dayer* Non-Executive
Grahame Whateley Non-Executive
(* denotes Independent Non-Executive Director)
Biographical details of all the Directors are set out on page 6.
The Board currently meets monthly and at other times as 
necessary. The Board is responsible for strategic and major 
operational issues affecting the Group. It reviews financial 
performance, monitors regulatory compliance, monitors key 
performance indicators and will consider ad hoc any matters 
of significance to the Group including corporate activity.

Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles, and to ensure 
compliance with the Combined Code, certain of the Directors 
are required to be re-elected at each Annual General Meeting 
of the Company. Sir David Rowe-Ham and Philip Dayer have 
agreed to retire by rotation at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. 
The Board supports their reappointment having assessed their 
performance and value to the Board.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, which comprises the 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, is chaired by Sir 
David Rowe-Ham and has responsibility for determining 
remuneration aspects of Executive Directors. It makes its 
decisions in consultation with the CEO. No Director plays 
a part in any decision about their own remuneration. This 
Committee also reviews bonus and equity arrangements 
for the Group’s other senior employees and in addition has 
responsibility for supervising the Arden Partners Share Option 
Scheme and the grant of options under its terms.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is fixed by the 
Board.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, which comprises the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, is chaired by Philip Dayer and has 
responsibilities including the monitoring and review of:
l the Group’s internal control environment;
l financial risks (including market risk in relation to the 
Group’s market making activities);
l Financial Statements, reports and announcements;
l ensuring the Company has a policy which allows any 
member of staff to raise, in confidence, any concern about 
possible impropriety in matters of financial reporting or 
other matters, and to ensure that suitable arrangements 
are in place for a proportionate independent investigation 
of such matters including any follow-up action required.
Nominations Committee
The Board is currently of the opinion that, given the present 
size of the Group, it is inappropriate to have an independent 
Nominations Committee but will keep this matter under 
review.
Operations Board
The day-to-day business is managed by Jonathan Keeling, the 
CEO, in conjunction with the Heads of Department as follows:
l Richard Day — Corporate Finance
l David Larkam — Research
l James Reed-Daunter — Sales
l Stephen Cooper — Compliance
l Trevor Norris — Finance
Risk
The Operations Board also serves as the Operational Risk 
Committee (“the ORC”) and is charged with monitoring the 
various risk exposures including those which arise through 
trading and holding financial instruments. The ORC largely 
provides the resource for the vetting of prospective clients and 
proposed transactions.
Corporate Governance

16310 11/03/2009 Proof 7
Corporate Governance continued
In response to difficult market conditions and the 
heightened threat of counterparty failure, the ORC formed 
a Risk Committee tasked specifically with monitoring market 
conditions and the potential impact on the business. Under 
the chairmanship of the Compliance Officer, this committee 
comprises senior members of the sales, trading and market 
making teams and initially met on a daily basis to review 
risk management information. Following a review of market 
conditions this committee now meets on a weekly basis but 
still receives key reports on a daily basis.
A further explanation of these risks, and other risks which 
are faced by the Group, is set out in note 24 to the Financial 
Statements.
Internal Control
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Group, which complies with the guidance 
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code”. This has been in place throughout the year and up to 
the date of approval of the Financial Statements. The process 
is regularly reviewed by the Board.
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. However, 
such a system can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Financial Statements.

The Directors present their Annual Report and audited 
Financial Statements for the financial year ended 31 October 
2008.
Principal Activities
The principal activity is that of an institutional stockbroking 
firm. Arden Partners offers institutional agency broking, 
market making services and research in small and mid cap 
stocks together with extensive corporate finance advice to 
this sector of the stock market.
Business Review and Future Developments
A review of the Group’s operations and performance during 
the financial year, setting out the position at the year end, 
significant changes during the year and providing an 
indication of the outlook for the future, is contained in the 
Chief Executive’s Statement.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
By far the major risk the business faces is stock market 
conditions. Adverse market conditions may have a significant 
negative effect on revenues and profitability. The Group 
mitigates some of this risk by targeting revenues across a 
number of sectors of the market and by careful control of 
overheads.
Other risks include credit risk and liquidity risk and an 
explanation of these is set out in note 24 on page 35.
Results and Dividends
The Consolidated Income Statement for the year is set out on 
page 13.
The Directors are not proposing to pay a final ordinary dividend 
(2007: 4.5p). This, when taken with the interim dividend 
of 2.2p per ordinary share (2007: 2.2p) which was paid on 
3 October 2008, gives a total dividend of 2.2p per share in 
respect of the year ended 31 October 2008 (2007: 6.7p).

report.
Financial Instruments
Details of the use of financial instruments by the Group and 
Company and its subsidiary undertakings are contained in 
note 24 to the Financial Statements.
Auditors
All of the current Directors have taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of

purposes of their audit and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of that information. The Directors are not aware of any 
relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware.
The Audit Committee reviews and approves the appointment 
of external auditors and monitors their independence. BDO 
Stoy Hayward LLP have expressed their willingness to continue 
in office and an ordinary resolution reappointing them as 
auditors and authorising the Directors to determine their 
remuneration will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.

Introduction
Whilst the Group is not obliged to comply with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the Directors have 
agreed to adopt the ethos of those regulations and to 
disclose information relating to the current Directors. The 
Directors are not intending to comply fully with Schedule VIIA 
to the Companies Act 1985, but are providing the following 
disclosures on a voluntary basis. The Report also describes 
how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance 
relating to Directors’ remuneration. This Report is not subject 
to audit and a resolution to approve it will be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the 
Financial Statements are to be approved.
Remuneration Policy
Arden Partners has a policy to attract, motivate and reward 
individuals of the highest calibre who are committed to 
grow the value of the business and to maximise returns to 
shareholders.
This policy is as relevant to Executive Directors as it is to 
employees and the rewards of Executive Directors are aligned 
with those of shareholders in reflecting the performance of 
the Group. 
The Group operates in the investment banking and equities 
arena where it is common practice to pay bonuses. This 
compensates for basic salaries which are capped and for 
the risk of little or no bonus in the event of difficult market 
conditions.
For the year ended 31 October 2008, the incentive accrual 
for Directors and staff was reduced to £666,000 (2007: 
£2,677,000).
Directors’ Service Contracts
No Director has a service contract for longer than twelve 
months and no contract contains provisions for sums to be 
paid on termination. Copies of Directors’ service contracts will 
be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Pension Arrangements
The Group does not operate a final salary pension scheme. 
Executive Directors who are entitled to receive pension 
contributions may nominate a defined contribution pension 
scheme into which the Company makes payments on their 
behalf.
Share Options
Details of the Arden Partners plc Share Option Scheme are 
given in note 19 to the Financial Statements. The Remuneration 
Committee has responsibility for supervising the scheme and 
the grant of options under its terms.
The Company’s policy is to use the Share Option Scheme to 
attract and retain key senior employees including the Executive 
Directors. Any grant of options is at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee and will take into account individual 
performance and responsibilities. Where appropriate, a grant 
of options may incorporate performance criteria.

Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets of the Company, for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a Directors’ Report which complies with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985. The Directors are also required to prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs) and the rules of the London Stock Exchange for 
companies trading securities on the Alternative Investment Market. The Directors have chosen to prepare financial statements 
for the Company in accordance with IFRSs.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation of 
financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. 
A fair presentation also requires the Directors to:
l consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies;
l present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and
l provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance. 
Financial statements are published on the Group’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Group’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the 
ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

Report and the Financial Statements

We have audited the Group and parent Company financial statements (the ‘’financial statements’’) of Arden Partners plc for 
the year ended 31 October 2008 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and Company balance 
sheets, the consolidated and Company cash flow statements, the consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity 
and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and whether the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with 
those financial statements. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding 
Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. This other information comprises only the Highlights, the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief 
Executive’s Statement, the Corporate Governance Statement, the Directors’ Biographies and the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. No person 
is entitled to rely on this report unless such a person is a person entitled to rely upon this report by virtue of and for the purpose 
of the Companies Act 1985 or has been expressly authorised to do so by our prior written consent. Save as above, we do not 
accept responsibility for this report to any other person or for any other purpose and we hereby expressly disclaim any and all 
such liability.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
l the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of 
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 October 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
l the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 October 2008;
l the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
l the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

Company Statement of Changes in Equity

1) Accounting policies
Arden Partners plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The 
address of the Company’s registered office is set out on page 44. 
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Financial Statements are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to the Group and the Company and to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
These policies are in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and 
Interpretations (collectively, “IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as endorsed for use in the 
European Union. These Financial Statements have also been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies 
Act 1985 that are applicable to companies preparing their financial statements in accordance with IFRS. 
The date of transition to IFRS was 1 November 2006. This is the first year the Group and Company have prepared their 
Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS, having previously prepared their financial statements in accordance with UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“UK GAAP”). The information for the year ended 31 October 2007 has been 
restated as necessary for the adoption of IFRS. A reconciliation of the restated financial information for the year ended 
31 October 2007 under IFRS with the originally reported results under UK GAAP is included as note 26. 
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another 
entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated Financial 
Statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as if they formed a single entity. 
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full. 
The Company has taken advantage of Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, and the income statement of the parent 
Company is not presented. The parent Company’s profit after taxation for the financial year amounted to £747,000 (2007: 
£3,489,000).
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards not yet effective
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for 
the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 November 2008 or later periods and which the Group has decided 
not to adopt early. These are:
— IFRS 8, Operating segments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). This standard 
sets out requirements for the disclosure of information about an entity’s operating segments and also about the 
entity’s products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates, and its major customers. It replaces IAS 14, 
Segmental Reporting. The Group expects to apply this standard in the period beginning on 1 November 2009. As this 
is a disclosure standard, it will not have any effect on the results or net assets of the Group.
—  IFRS 3, Business combinations and complementary amendments to IAS 27, Consolidated and separate 
financial statements (Both effective for accounting periods on or after 1 July 2009). This revised standard and 
amendments are still to be endorsed by the EU. The revised IFRS 3 and amendments to IAS 27 arise from a joint 
project with the Financial Accounting standards Board (FASB), the US standards setter, and result in IFRS being largely 
converged with the related, recently issued, US requirements. There are very significant changes to the requirements 
of IFRS, and options available, if accounting for business combinations. The Board will assess the impact of the revised 
IFRS 3 and amendments to IAS 27 on the financial statements if it becomes relevant in the future. 
— IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements — a revised approach (effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2009). As this is a disclosure standard, it will not have any effect on the results or net assets of 
the Group. It will affect the presentation and format of the primary statements and notes and these disclosures will be 
revised accordingly in the 2010 financial statements.
— Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payments: Vesting conditions and cancellations (effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). The amendment deals with two matters. It clarifies that vesting 
conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. Other features of a share-based payment are not 
vesting conditions. It also specifies that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the 
same accounting treatment. The Board is assessing the impact of this amendment on the Group; this is not expected 
to be significant.

The following are also standards, interpretations and amendments to published statements not yet effective, but which are 
not considered to be relevant to the Group:
—  IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items (effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009).
 
—  IAS 23, Borrowing costs (Revised) (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).
—  IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008).
—  IFRIC 13, Customer Loyalty Programmes (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008).
—  IFRIC 14 and IAS 9, The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their 
Interaction (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008).
— IFRIC 15, Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate (effective for periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009).
—  IFRIC 16, Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation (effective for periods beginning on or after 
1 October 2008).
— IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009).
—  Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27, Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate 
(Effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).
—  Amendments to IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (effective for periods beginning on or 
after 1 July 2009).
—  Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1, Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation 
(effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).
—  Amendment to IFRS 1, First time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (effective for periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009).
Revenue
Revenue comprises the net trading gains or losses of shares traded on a principal basis, commissions and fees earned 
from trading shares on an agency basis, together with fees derived from corporate finance activities, broking services and 
retainers.
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration receivable, to the extent that it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Where consideration includes financial instruments or other 
non-cash items, revenue is measured at fair value using an appropriate valuation method. 
Corporate Finance Division
The Group recognises revenue at the point of completing an assignment to the extent that it has obtained the right to 
consideration through performance of its services to clients.
Deal fees and placing commissions are only recognised once there is an absolute contractual entitlement for the Group to 
receive them.
Corporate retainers are recognised on an accruals basis.
Equities Division
Institutional commissions are recognised on trade dates. Net trading gains or losses are the realised and unrealised profits 
and losses from market making long and short positions on a trade date basis.

Interest receivable
Financial income, which comprises principally interest received, is recognised using the effective interest method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets evenly over their 
expected useful lives. It is calculated at the following rates:
Improvements to leasehold buildings — 33.33% per annum
Fixtures, fittings and equipment — 33.33% per annum
Computer equipment — 33.33% per annum 
Financial assets
Financial assets comprise assets held for trading, available for sale investments, trade receivables, other receivables, and 
cash and cash equivalents. The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending 
on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:
l Held for trading: Held for trading investments represent long market making positions and other investments held 
for resale in the near term and are stated at fair value. Gains and losses from changes in fair value are taken to the 
income statement.
 For trading investments which are quoted in active markets, fair values are determined by reference to the current 
quoted bid price. 
l Loans and receivables: These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. 
trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair 
value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. 
 Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on 
the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of 
the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net 
carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For 
trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss 
being recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable 
will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
 The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the 
balance sheet.
l Available for sale: Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available for 
sale and comprise principally the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates 
or jointly controlled entities as well as corporate bonds. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognised directly in a separate component of equity (available for sale reserve) other than exchange differences on 
corporate bonds denominated in foreign currency, which are recognised in profit or loss. Where there is a significant 
or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available for sale financial asset (which constitutes objective evidence of 
impairment), the full amount of the impairment, including any amount previously charged to equity, is recognised in 
the income statement. Purchases and sales of available for sale financial assets are recognised on contract date with 
any change in fair value between trade date and the balance sheet date being recognised in the available for sale 
reserve. On sale, the amount held in the available for sale reserve associated with that asset is removed from equity 
and recognised in the income statement.

16310 11/03/2009 Proof 7
l Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, bank balances and call deposits that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are not subject to a significant risk of changes in value. Cash 
and cash equivalents all have original dates to maturity of three months or less.
Financial liabilities 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which 
the liability was acquired. The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:
l Held for trading: Held for trading liabilities represent short market making positions and are stated at fair value. 
Gains and losses from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
 For trading liabilities which are quoted in active markets, fair values are determined by reference to the current quoted 
offer price. 
 
l Fair value through profit or loss: The Group does not have any financial liabilities designated as being at fair value 
through profit or loss. 
l Other financial liabilities: These comprise market payables, trade payables, other payables and accruals. They are 
initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
 
Pledged assets
The Group may enter into stock borrowing arrangements with certain institutions which are entered into on a collateralised 
basis with securities or cash advances received as collateral.
Under such arrangements a security is purchased with a commitment to return it at a future date at a future agreed price. 
The securities purchased are not recognised on the balance sheet and the transaction is treated as a secured loan made 
for the purchase price.
Where cash has been used to effect the purchase, the cash collateral amount is recorded as a pledged asset on the balance 
sheet.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at 
the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in 
the income statement.
Taxation
Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in 
the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised 
directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount 
of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related 
tax benefit will be realised.

Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid. 
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by shareholders at an Annual General Meeting. Dividends unpaid at 
the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised 
and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. 
Leased assets
Assets acquired under finance leases where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are 
capitalised. The outstanding future lease obligations are shown in creditors. Operating lease rentals are charged to the 
income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. 
Pension costs
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they 
become payable.
Employee Benefit Trust
Arden Partners EBT Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and its sole activity is as corporate trustee for the 
Arden Partners Employee Benefit Trust. Its assets and liabilities are fully consolidated in the Group financial statements, and 
holdings of Arden Partners plc shares by Arden Partners EBT Limited are shown as a deduction from consolidated equity 
under the heading “Employee Benefit Trust reserve”.
Share-based payments — equity-settled
All options granted are recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is 
measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the 
options. The fair value is measured using the Black–Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the options were granted.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at 
each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the 
number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. 
As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market conditions are 
satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those amounts. 
Judgements made by management that may have a significant effect on the financial statements relate principally 
to the Group’s equity-settled share-based remuneration schemes for employees. Employee services received, and the 
corresponding increase in equity, are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant. 
The fair value of share options is estimated by using valuation models, such as Black–Scholes, on the date of grant based 
on certain assumptions. Those assumptions are described in note 19 and include, among others, the dividend growth rate 
and expected volatility.

The United Kingdom Government has enacted provisions reducing the standard rate of corporation tax from 30% to 
28% with effect from 1 April 2008. The standard rate of tax applicable to the Group is therefore 28.8% in the year ended 
31 October 2008 (2007: 30%) and will be 28% in future years.

Share-based payments
The share options granted during the year under the Arden Partners Share Plan 2007 are equity-settled options. The vesting 
condition for all options requires the option holders to still be in the employment of the Company at the exercise date; 
for certain options, performance conditions must also be satisfied. These include both market and non-market conditions.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share 
options granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black–Scholes model. The 
contractual life is the life of the option in question and growth in dividend yield is based on the best current estimate of 
future yields over the contractual period.

year amounted to £349,000 (2007: £631,000). Contributions amounting to £61,000 (2007: £161,000) were payable to

23) Post-balance sheet events
There have been no significant events between the end of the year and the date the Financial Statements were approved.
24) Financial Instruments and risk profile
The Group and Company’s financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, trading positions, available for sale 
investments, trade receivables and trade payables arising from operations. The Group and Company have recognised the 
following risks arising from these financial instruments:
l Equity price risk l Liquidity risk 
l Credit risk l Operational risk
24.1 Equity price risk
The Group and Company face risk arising from holding available for sale investments and market making positions 
in markets that fluctuate. The Group and Company manage equity price risk by establishing individual stock limits 
and overall investment criteria, and management reports are prepared daily in support of a review regime. The Board 
reviews available for sale investments on a monthly basis.
24.2 Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and Company are unable to raise sufficient funding to enable them to meet 
their obligations and is managed as follows:
l maintaining a strong capital base
l forecasting future cash flow requirements
l monitoring of cash positions on a daily basis
l control over timely settlement of trade debtors
l control over timely settlement of market debtors and creditors
Capital management
The Group and Company’s policy in respect of capital adequacy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to retain 
investor, creditor and market confidence. During the years ended 31 October 2007 and 2008 capital has been 
maintained at a level above minimum FSA requirements. Such levels have been established by reference to an 
internal ICAAP assessment. The Group and Company’s capital resources consist of Tier 1 equity capital and Tier 3 
retained earnings.
The Group and Company hold their cash with a number of reputable financial institutions. All cash and cash 
equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.

24) Financial Instruments and risk profile (continued)
24.3 Credit risk
Credit risk represents the possibility that the Group or Company will suffer a loss from a counterparty failing to meet 
its obligations. Credit risk is managed as follows:
l robust client account opening and vetting procedures
l general policy to deal only with FSA registered counterparties
l general policy on limiting exposure to concentration risk
l control over timely settlement of market debtors
l review of daily settlement reports by the Risk Committee
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying value of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk 
at the reporting date was:

24) Financial Instruments and risk profile (continued)
24.4 Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, staff or systems, or from 
external causes whether deliberate, accidental or natural. This would also include risk from changes in legislation, 
regulation, currency or interest rate risk.
Operational risk is managed by an Operations Board with day-to-day control exercised by the Operations Director. The 
Group and Company also has in place contingency plans to cover loss of systems, property and other eventualities.
The Group and Company had an aggregate currency exposure at 31 October 2008 in respect of US$1,286,000 
(£808,000). There was no currency exposure for the Group or the Company at 31 October 2007. The effect of a 
10% movement in the US$/£ exchange rate from the rate ruling at the balance sheet date would be to impact profit 
and net assets by approximately £80,000.
Fixed rate cash financial assets of £5,841,000 (2007: £4,555,000) comprise sterling cash deposits on money markets 
at an average rate of 3.0% (2007: 5.55%). Remaining cash was held on current accounts attracting interest based 
on LIBID. Other financial assets do not have maturity dates and do not currently attract interest. 
If the average level of interest received on cash deposits had been 1% higher or lower than the level actually 
received in the year ended 31 October 2008, the profit before taxation would have been increased or reduced by 
approximately £85,000.
25) Transition to IFRS
The financial information for the year ended 31 October 2007 and the opening balance sheet at 1 November 2006 have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS for the first time.
The Group’s transition date to IFRS is 1 November 2006. The rules for first-time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1 ‘First 
time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’. In preparing the IFRS financial information, these transition 
rules have been applied to the amounts reported previously under generally accepted accounting principles in the United 
Kingdom (‘UK GAAP’). IFRS 1 generally requires full retrospective application of the Standards and Interpretations in force 
at the first reporting date. 
However, IFRS 1 allows certain exemptions in the application of particular Standards to prior periods in order to assist 
companies with the transition process.
The Group has elected to make use of the exemptions available in IFRS 1 as follows:
l IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were 
unvested at 1 November 2006.
The adoption of IFRS has had no impact on the cash flows of the Group. The changes in the Group cash flow statement 
prepared under IFRS and the statement previously prepared under UK GAAP are presentational. In accordance with IFRS, 
the Company has been required to present its own cash flow statement, whereas such a statement was not required 
previously under UK GAAP .

26) Reconciliation of UK GAAP to IFRS
For the year ended 31 October 2007 there are differences between the income statement and balance sheet amounts 
reported under UK GAAP and IFRS as noted on pages 39 to 43. There are also differences under UK GAAP and IFRS for the 
opening balance sheet on transition (as at 1 November 2006). 
The IFRS transition has given rise to four types of adjustments in the consolidated accounts, which are as follows:
a) Fair value adjustments for financial assets that are classified as held for trading, with movements in the fair value going 
to the income statement.
b)  Fair value adjustments for financial assets that are classified as available for sale with movements in the fair value going 
through equity.
c) Deferred tax relating to (1) fair value adjustments in respect of (a) and (b) above and (2) the intrinsic value of the 
outstanding share options at the balance sheet date.
d) Reclassification of deferred tax asset from current assets to non-current assets.
A further adjustment has arisen in the Company’s accounts as follows:
e) Adjustments to intercompany balances and cash arising from a change to the accounting treatment of Arden Partners 
EBT Limited, the trustee of the Group’s employee benefit trust. Under UK GAAP , the assets of the EBT were included in 
the Company’s balance sheet and intercompany balances were eliminated; under the treatment now being adopted, 
the assets of the EBT are excluded from the Company’s balance sheet and intercompany balances are reinstated.

Notes
1.  Under Article 94 of the Company’s Articles of Association, a member can nominate someone else to exercise the right to 
appoint a proxy. Please confirm whether you are the member or a person nominated by a member. If you are a member 
who has nominated someone else to exercise the right to appoint a proxy you should not complete this form. Any forms 
returned by such persons will be ineffective.
2.  Any member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM is entitled (unless they have, pursuant to article 94 of the Company’s 
Articles of Association, nominated someone else to enjoy such a right, in which case only the person so nominated may 
exercise the right) to appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a member of the Company) to attend and to vote 
instead of the member. Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting 
at the Meeting in person, should he subsequently decide to do so.
3.  If you wish to appoint some other person as your proxy please insert his/her name and address, initial and strike out the 
words “the Chairman of the Meeting”. If you do this and you, or your proxy, do not go to the Meeting, your vote cannot 
be counted. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
4.  To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy this form. Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and the number of 
shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number 
of shares held by you). If the total number of shares exceeds the total held by the member, all appointments may be held 
invalid. Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and 
should be returned together in the same envelope.
5.  Please indicate with an “X” in the appropriate box how you wish your votes to be cast. Unless otherwise instructed the 
proxy will exercise his/her discretion as to whether, and if so how, he/she will vote. The “Withheld” option is provided to 
enable you to abstain on any particular resolution. However, a vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not be counted 
in the calculation of the proportion of votes “For” and “Against” a resolution.
6.  This Form of Proxy must, in the case of an individual, be signed by the appointer or his/her attorney or, in the case of a 
corporation must be executed under its common seal or under the hand of an officer or attorney duly authorised in writing. 
Where a duly authorised officer signs this form, the signatory should state his/her office on the form.
7.  In the case of joint holders of a share the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be 
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the 
order in which the names stand in the register of members in respect of the share.

8.  Any alteration in this Form of Proxy must be initialled by the person in whose hand it is signed or executed.
9.  In order to be valid, any Form of Proxy and power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially 
certified or office copy of such power of authority, must reach the Company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars, The Proxy 
Department, PO Box 25, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4BR, not less than 48 hours (excluding any part of a day which is a non-
working day) before the time of the Meeting or of any adjournment of the Meeting.
10. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, only those shareholders registered in the 
register of members of the Company at 11.00 a.m. on 20 April 2009 or, if the Meeting is adjourned, shareholders on the 
Company’s register of members not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned Meeting, shall be entitled 
to attend and vote at the Meeting.
11.  All members are entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting, whether or not they have returned a form of proxy.
12.  The Directors have no present intention of exercising (i) the allotment authority under resolution 5, (ii) the disapplication of 
pre-emption rights authority under resolution 6, or (iii) the authority to make market purchases under resolution 8.
13.  A copy of the Company’s existing Articles of Association (the “Existing Articles”) and a copy marked to show the differences 
between the Existing Articles and those proposed to be adopted pursuant to resolution 7 (the “Proposed Articles”) will be 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during usual business hours from the date of this notice until 
the date of the Annual General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General Meeting from at least 15 minutes prior to 
and until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting. The Proposed Articles have been updated to reflect in particular 
the following and other consequential changes arising as a result of the Companies Act 2006 (the “New Act”): 
(a)  The New Act provision which came into force in October 2008 in respect of Directors’ duty to avoid conflicts of interest
 The Proposed Articles have been amended to reflect the new Directors’ duty to avoid conflicts of interest (section 
175 of the New Act) which came into force on 1 October 2008. A new article (Article 104) has been added to give 
the Board the power to authorise conflicts of other Directors and resultant changes have been made to Articles 
102 to 106.
(b)  Multiple corporate representatives — ICSA guidance on proxies and corporate representatives at general meetings
 Various amendments have been made to the Proposed Articles to reflect the ICSA recommendations and guidance 
referred to above.
 In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the Meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the Meeting 
so that (i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the Meeting as its corporate representative with 
instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that 
shareholder at the Meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman 
and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) 
if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the Meeting but the corporate 
shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the Meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate 
representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other 
corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. Corporate shareholders 
are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate 
representatives — www.icsa.org.uk — for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of 
representation letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.

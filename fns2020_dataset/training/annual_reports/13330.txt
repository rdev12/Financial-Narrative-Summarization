Highlights of 2004
2001 2002 2003 2004 I am pleased to announce our results for the financial 
year, which show further improvement in performance.
Turnover for 2004 has increased by 36% to £2.67 million
(2003: £1.97 million) and profit after tax has been
improved to £278,163 (2003: £135,313).  
Our strategy of providing claims handling, consultancy and
website facilities to the insurance industry continues to be
well received, combined with our use of leading edge
technology with a unique web-based claims notification
and monitoring system.
Overall, we had a very busy year with a particularly
buoyant summer period when claims volumes were 
significantly higher than the corresponding period in 2003.
We continued to add to our client list and most significantly secured a two year primary-
adjuster contract with Rubicon Insurance Services. In addition to this, 2004 saw our first
consultancy income stream for providing client support services and we are confident
that this could well become a more regular contributor to our operating revenues.  
Costs and cashflow continue to be monitored very carefully and additional margin gains
are achievable as our level of activity increases.  
The current financial year, commencing 1st January has seen increased volumes from
the flood conditions in that month and the receipt of a number of large commercial
claims that will enhance 2005 income.
Chairman’s Statement
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 2 We continue to invest in our IT infrastructure and since the year end completed the
latest phase of our claims system enhancement which was funded by a issue of shares
to The Innovation Group plc.
2004 was a year which saw a concentration on organic growth but we are seeking to
achieve further earnings enhancing acquisitions in 2005 and we are actively pursuing
opportunities in this regard.
Finally I wish to thank our loyal employees and our shareholders for their support.  
JOHN FRENCH
Chairman
8 March 2005
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 3 Overall, 2004 has been a gratifying year for the Claims
People during which the Company’s progress was
undoubtedly maintained.
Operations 
The Company again experienced growth and Claims
People were particularly delighted, as reported in the
Chairman’s Statement, to add Rubicon Insurance Services
and other clients to our client base.
During the early part of 2004, we were joined by an
executive team from Concept Claims Management, which
made a valuable contribution to our resources. Later in the
year, we were also pleased to extend our Claims Analyst
operations into the “implant” consultancy arena and we hope to continue this progress
in the future.
From a pure claims perspective, the loss adjusting business benefited from a significant
increase in volumes during the late summer period and despite further consolidation in
both the insurance and broking sectors, demand for claims adjustment services
remained strong. Whilst the bulk of our business was of a volume Personal Lines nature,
we were also gratified to be instructed on a number of high-value corporate company
claims, demonstrating the breadth of expertise we possess. The winter period of
2004/2005 was also busy from an operational standpoint and as we emerge from this
period we shall be intensifying our marketing activities. 
Industry Perspective
As I commented in the 2003 Report, the claims industry has continued to experience
rapid change.  
Throughout the year, a number of “virtual insurers” emerged as increasingly powerful
forces in the market and it is to be anticipated that this trend will continue. Such
companies generally provide back-office services and represent a potentially new 
market for Claims People.
Chief Executive’s Report
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 4 The Verify motor inspection service remained well supported throughout 2004 and the
Company remains convinced that further opportunities exist for this product.
One material consequence of the changing market conditions is the scale of opportunities
for acquisition that now exist. Claims People intend to take advantage of any appropriate
opportunities during 2005 and whilst the Company will not pursue an indiscriminate
acquisition policy, careful examination of potential prospects should enable us to identify
appropriate companies that would benefit from the application of the Claims People’s
business model.  
Conclusion
Once again, we can report that solid progress is being achieved. We are continuing to
enhance our IT capabilities and the Board intends to ensure that the Company’s
competitive edge is maintained. As previously stated, we are actively seeking to explore
merger and acquisition possibilities and we are satisfied that the year ahead contains
many opportunities for Claims People.

Secretary

Directors’ Report continued
For the year ended 31 December 2004
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 10 Financial aspects of corporate governance
The Company is committed to achieving high standards of corporate governance. 
The Company aims to comply with the Combined Code (“the Code”) which is appended
to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and has adopted a framework for corporate
governance which it believes is suitable for a company of its size.
The Board is accountable to shareholders for the governance of the Company’s affairs.
The Directors have reviewed the principles outlined in the Code and believe that, insofar
as they are relevant to a company of its size, they have complied with the provisions of
the Code.
Directors’ Statement of Compliance with the revised Combined
Code on Corporate Governance
In July 2003, a revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the revised Code)
was published by the Financial Reporting Council, which came into effect for accounting
periods commencing on or after 1 November 2003. The Directors have reviewed the
detailed principles and recommendations outlined in the revised Code and believe that,
to the extent that they are relevant to the Company’s business, they have complied with
the provisions of the Code during the year ended 31 December 2004 and that the
Company’s current practice is in all material respects consistent with the principles of
the revised Code.
The Board also confirms that, to the best of its knowledge and understanding,
procedures were in place to meet the requirements of the revised Code relating to
internal controls throughout the year under review. This statement describes how the
principles of the revised Code have been applied in the affairs of the Company.
The Board
The Board currently consists of five members, two of whom are Non-Executive
Directors. Given the size of the Board it is not considered appropriate to have a 
Senior Independent Director.
The Board met on eight occasions throughout the year and all directors were present
with the exception of Mr G Cole who was unable to attend one meeting. All major
decisions as to the direction and control of the Company are taken by the full Board. 
No one Director has unfettered powers of decision. The Group’s day to day operations
are managed by the Executive Directors. All Directors have access to the Company
Secretary and any Director needing independent professional advice in the furtherance
of his duties may obtain this advice at the expense of the Company. The Executive
Directors have a one-year rolling service agreement with the Company.
Corporate Governance Report
For the year ended 31 December 2004
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 11 The revised Code requires that this report should identify each non-executive director
the Board considers to be independent in character and judgement and whether there
are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect,
the director’s judgement, stating its reasons if it determines that a director is independent
notwithstanding the existence of relationships or circumstances which may appear to be
relevant to its determination. In the Board’s opinion both Messrs French and Cole are
considered to be independent in both character and judgement. Accordingly two of the
five Board members are independent.
Under the Articles of Association, all Directors are subject to periodic retirement and 
re-election by shareholders. In order to comply with the revised Code and the Articles 
of Association, the Directors have adopted a policy providing for all directors to submit
themselves for re-election at least every three years.
Accordingly Mr Cole shall retire, and, being eligible, shall offer himself for re-election. 
A resolution to re-elect Mr Cole is contained with the Notice of the Annual General
Meeting on page 34.
Mr Cole has actively contributed in meetings throughout the year. Following a formal
performance evaluation, the other Board members recommend that shareholders vote
for the re-election of Mr Cole as they believe that his skills, knowledge and overall
performance is of continued benefit to the Company.  
Corporate Governance Committees
The Board has established two Committees comprising the Non-Executive Directors
and one Executive Director. The members are:
Audit Remuneration
John French John French
Graham Cole Graham Cole
Peter Morgan
Peter Morgan is invited to attend the audit committee meetings.
The Board does not consider it necessary to have a Nomination Committee.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee which is chaired by Mr Cole, met twice last year to review the
audit process and the published financial information, the effectiveness of external audit
and internal controls.
The primary responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to review the effectiveness of 
the internal control environment of the Company and to monitor adherence to best
practice in corporate governance; to make recommendations to the board in relation to
the re-appointment of the Auditors and to approve their remuneration and terms of
engagement; and to review and monitor the Auditors’ independence and objectivity and
the effectiveness of the audit process and provide a forum through which the Company’s
Auditors report to the Board. The Audit Committee also has responsibility for monitoring
the integrity of the financial statements and accounting policies of the Company.
Corporate Governance Report continued
For the year ended 31 December 2004
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 12 Committee members consider that individually and collectively they are appropriately
experienced to fulfil the role required.
Saffery Champness, the company’s Auditors, attend the meeting of the Audit
Committee to approve the financial statements and Annual Report and have direct
access to Committee members. The chairman of the Audit Committee will be present at
the Annual General meeting to deal with any questions relating to the accounts.
In addition, the Audit Committee has considered the requirement for an internal audit
function and has concluded that given the current state of operations no internal audit
department is required.
Remuneration Committee
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee which is chaired by Mr French are:
● recommend to the Board a framework for rewarding senior management, including
Executive Directors, bearing in mind the need to attract and retain individuals of the
highest calibre and with the appropriate experience to make a significant contribution
to the Group; and
● ensure that the elements of the remuneration package are competitive and help in
underpinning the performance-driven culture of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee did not meet in the year although the remuneration of the
Executive directors has increased following an improvement in the Company’s trading.
It should be noted however, that the remuneration paid is in line with that outlined in the
company’s AIM Admission Document.
Internal Control
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control
and for reviewing its effectiveness. This is an ongoing process designed to ensure
adherence to the Group’s policies whilst safeguarding the assets of the Group, in addition
to ensuring the management of the risks faced by the Group. This process has been in
place throughout the period and up to the date of signing this report. Responsibility for
implementing a system of internal controls is delegated to the Finance Director.
An ongoing process, in accordance with the Turnbull Committee on internal control, is
established for identifying, evaluating and managing risks faced by the Group. A formal
risk identification and analysis was conducted in the current financial year.
The risk management process and systems of internal control are designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s objectives. It should be
recognised that such systems can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
In accordance with guidance issued to directors of listed companies, the Directors have
carried out a review of the effectiveness of internal controls as they have operated
during the year.
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 13 Internal Control Assessment Process
Risk assessment and the review of internal controls are undertaken by the Board in the
context of the Group’s overall strategy. The review covers the key business, operational,
compliance and financial risks facing the Group. In arriving at its judgement of what risks
the Group faces, the Board has considered the Group’s operations in the light of the
following factors:
● The nature and extent of risks which it regards as acceptable for the Group to bear
within its overall business objective;
● The threat of such risks becoming a reality;
● The Group’s ability to reduce the incidence and impact of risk on its performance; and
● The cost and benefits to the Group of operating the relevant controls.
Against this background, the Board has split its review into the following areas:
● Corporate strategy;
● Published information, compliance with laws and regulations; and
● Relationships with service providers.
Internal control
The key procedures established with a view to providing effective internal control are 
as follows:
● Strategic business planning Detailed financial projections for the current
financial year are prepared and subject to formal review at least twice a year.
● Performance review The Directors aim to monitor the Group’s performance
through the preparation of monthly management accounts and regular reviews of
work in progress, cash flow projections and the pipeline of future work.
● Review of internal control Compliance with operating control procedures is
covered by the Group’s external auditors to the extent necessary to form their
opinion as to the truth and fairness of the financial statements.
Relations with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given a high priority by the Board and the Directors
are available to enter into dialogue with shareholders. All shareholders are encouraged
to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting during which the Board is available to
discuss issues affecting the Company. In addition the company maintains a website
(www.theclaimspeople.com) containing information on the Company of interest to
corporate and private shareholders.
Going Concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Corporate Governance Report continued
For the year ended 31 December 2004
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 14 Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial
year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
● make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
● prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate
to presume that the Company will continue in business; and
● state whether applicable accounting policies have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, which disclose
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and Group
and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 1985. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Directors’ Report and
other information included in the Annual Report is prepared in accordance with
Company Law in the United Kingdom and for ensuring that the Annual Report includes
information required by the AIM Rules. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
For the year ended 31 December 2004
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 15 We have audited the financial statements of The Claims People Group plc for the year
ended 31 December 2004 on pages 18 to 33 which have been prepared under the
historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out on pages 22 and 23.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that
we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the
opinions we have formed.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair
view and are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company
is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited financial statements. This other information comprises only
the Directors’ report, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s report and the
corporate governance report. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. We are not
required to consider whether the Board's statements on internal control cover all risks
and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members
Year ended 31 December 2004
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 16 Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations
which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2004 and of the profit of the Group for
the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
For the year ended 31 December 2004
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 21
The notes on pages 24 to 33 form part of these financial statements. Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
applicable accounting standards. The most significant accounting policies are described below. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings
as if they were a single entity. Subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date of acquisition using the
acquisition method of accounting.
Turnover
Turnover represents the invoiced amount of services provided in the period and is stated net of VAT.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for depreciation. Depreciation is provided on all tangible
fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset less its estimated residual value evenly over its
estimated useful life, as follows:
Claims software over five years
Office equipment and fittings over three to five years
Website development over three years
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less provision for amortisation. Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of goodwill
over fifteen years on a straight line basis.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for diminution in value.
Work in progress
Work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Leasing and finance lease commitments
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet and
depreciated over their useful economic lives. The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the profit
and loss account over the period of the contract and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital
payments outstanding. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a
straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Accounting Policies
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 22 Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay
less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the
Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains
and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial
statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which
the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the
periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse.
Pension costs
The Group contributes to two Group Personal Pension Schemes for Directors and senior employees. Pension
contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they are incurred.
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 23 1. Turnover
The total turnover of the Group for the period has been derived from its principal activity wholly undertaken in the 
United Kingdom.

8. Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own
profit and loss account. As the Company has no active subsidiaries, the profit dealt within the financial statements of the
Company is the same as the consolidated profit being £278,163 (2003: £135,313).
9. Earnings per share
The calculation of the basic and fully diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year after tax of £278,163 
(2003: £135,313) and on 100,000,000 ordinary shares, (2003: 83,920,460) being the weighted average number of ordinary
shares in issue during the year. In calculating fully diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue
was 100,037,736 (2003: 84,320,460) ordinary shares. The issue of shares after the year end does not have a material effect
on the calculation of earnings per share.

Notes:
1. To be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting (and for the purposes of the determination by the Company of the
number of votes they may cast) members must be entered on the Company’s register of members not later than 48 hours before the
time of the meeting. If the Annual General Meeting is adjourned to a time not more than 48 hours after the specified time applicable to
the original meeting, that time will also apply for the purpose of discerning the entitlement to members to attend and vote (and for the
purposes of determining the number of votes they may cast) at the adjourned Annual General Meeting. If, however, the Annual General
Meeting is adjourned for a longer period, then, to be so entitled, members must be entered on the Company’s register of members at
the time which is 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned meeting or, if the Company gives notice of the adjourned Annual
General Meeting, at the time specified in that notice
2. A member entitled to vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, to vote
instead of the member. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
3. A form of proxy for the use of members is enclosed with the notice. To be effective the form of proxy must be deposited, duly
completed and signed, at the Company’s registrar no less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the Annual
General Meeting.

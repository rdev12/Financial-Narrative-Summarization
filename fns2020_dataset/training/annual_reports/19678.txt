OUR FIGURES STRATEGIC REPORT
OUR GROUP TODAY 
St Ives is an international marketing services 
group comprised of 15 successful and dynamic 
marketing and print services businesses. We 
operate not as a single entity but as a group  
of market leading businesses, each with its own 
unique value proposition. Our businesses offer 
complementary services and collaborate closely 
with each other when this adds value to clients. 
WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS  
IN THREE DISTINCT SEGMENTS 
 
Our industry leading Strategic Marketing 
businesses have strong capabilities across 
three specialist high growth areas: data, 
digital and consulting. Our Marketing 
Activation businesses, which deliver marketing 
communications through a combination 
of print and in-store marketing services 
complement this offering, whilst our  
market leading Books business represents  
an additional source of profit and cash 
generation as we continue to grow.
Lift flap for the full Group overview.
Strong financial performance for the year, reflecting further  
growth in the Group’s Strategic Marketing segment which  
contributed 46% (2014 – 37%) of underlying operating profit.
Important strategic progress across all three growth drivers:
– further increase in collaboration, with over 100 clients using 
services of more than one Group business (2014 – 82), including 
Johnson & Johnson, Carlsberg, Royal Mail and Pizza Express; 
– continued international growth, with Incite opening an office in 
Shanghai and Amaze winning its first major e-commerce project 
from its new Chicago office; over 30% of Strategic Marketing 
revenue is now generated from clients based outside UK; and
– further carefully screened acquisitions: Chicago-based Solstice,  
a mobile-first marketing & technology business, acquired in  
March 2015 and integrating well; and Fripp, Sandeman and 
Partners (‘FSP’), a specialist retail property consultancy,  
acquired since year-end.

Another important strand of our 
strategy is our commitment to 
investing in our businesses to build 
upon our innovative and market 
leading offering. Our approach 
is client-led and we have proven 
success in supporting and enabling 
expansion, and have helped 
our businesses move into new 
growth markets where client-led 
opportunities exist in North America, 
China and Singapore, as well as 
adding to our headquarters in 
London.
When we meet a potential 
acquisition target, our interest is 
driven by the services it delivers  
and by its growth potential but also, 
very importantly, by the ethos of  
its management team. This begins 
with a commonality of values: the 
low-ego, high-integrity mind-set  
that has successfully transformed  
St Ives into an international 
marketing services business.
 
The businesses that we buy 
are run by talented people with 
entrepreneurial drive and vision.  
As part of their integration into  
St Ives, they remain in place for 
several years to continue building 
their companies as individual 
businesses while collaborating  
with others across the Group.
International growth through 
both organic expansion and 
further acquisition remains high 
on our agenda. Incite, part of our 
consultancy division, plans to open 
a San Francisco ofﬁce during the 
current ﬁnancial year, adding to  
our US presence in Chicago  
and New York. 
Governance
The Board regularly scrutinises  
our strategy to ensure we stay  
on the right path in view of shifting 
market forces. The last six years  
have been an intense period 
of change for the Group and 
international expansion brings its 
own challenges, with values as  
well as services to be exported.
Our approach
It has been a positive year 
for St Ives. The Group has 
delivered another strong ﬁnancial 
performance while continuing 
the successful execution of our 
business strategy.
Our reorganisation during the year 
into three segments – Strategic 
Marketing, Marketing Activation  
and Books – more closely aligns  
our proposition with the business 
needs of our clients.
Our acquisition of Solstice 
strengthens our foothold in North 
America and supports our drive 
to expand internationally whilst 
also adding to our offering in the 
growing area of digital and mobile 
marketing. Additionally, we have 
boosted our consulting capabilities, 
completing the acquisition of Fripp, 
Sandeman and Partners (‘FSP’), a 
UK-based retail property consultancy 
business, just after the year-end. 
FSP will work closely with, and add 
complementary skills to Pragma, our 
existing retail consulting business.
Our CEO, Matt Armitage and our 
CFO, Brad Gray had impressive ﬁrst 
full years in their respective roles. 
St Ives’ strong performance has 
continued under their guidance and 
they are instrumental in identifying 
and ﬁnalising acquisitions. My fellow 
Directors and I look forward to 
working with them to deliver  
further growth for the Group.
We will also be seeking to appoint  
an experienced Non-Executive 
Director to the Board who would  
add to the knowledge and capabilities 
of the existing Board members 
and inject fresh ideas to help our 
businesses grow.
Our employees – their 
development and health 
and safety
As a result of our transformation 
over recent years, St Ives is  
– more than ever – a people 
business. We employ over  
3,000 people across the Group,  
in multiple locations and across  
ﬁve countries. The development and 
wellbeing of our people is therefore 
a key strategic consideration for  
the Board.
As we get bigger it is vital that  
we attract, retain and develop the 
best talent. As such, we recognise 
the importance of demonstrating 
and communicating the beneﬁts 
that our ﬁnancial strength, 
successful business model and 
growth-orientated culture bring  
to our people.
It is also important that we continue 
our ethos of collaboration, to ensure 
that we make the most of the wide 
range of capabilities within St Ives. 
This, in turn, will give our people the 
opportunity to develop by broadening 
their experience and skills. 
Health and Safety remains an 
absolute priority. We continuously 
scrutinise all facets of our operations, 
from our ﬂeet of vehicles to each  
of our sites, to maintain the highest 
standards for staff and visitors alike.

SUCCESSFUL YEAR  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

CASE STUDY
Realise has been working with 
Greyhound in the US to lead 
a full digital transformation 
programme. The business is 
looking to achieve signiﬁcant 
growth ambitions, undertaking a 
comprehensive and far-reaching 
programme of work designed 
to boost travel frequency 
of existing passengers and 
increase the number of new 
customers.
 
At the heart of this is an 
understanding of the need for 
holistic business transformation 
which will touch every aspect 
of Greyhound operations, with 
digital playing a pivotal role in 
changing brand perception  
and customer experience.
Realise has therefore spent the 
past year delivering a broad 
digital programme to support 
business change. The company 
has followed a robust user-
centred design approach with 
the ﬁrst phase resulting in the 
delivery of a new web platform 
for marketing and ticketing. 
The process has been driven 
by insight gathering and user 
validation, essential to support 
and secure the eCommerce  
goals that are a key measure  
of success in this project.
 
Collaboration between the client, 
agency and third parties has been 
critical to delivering the work on 
time and on budget. Realise’s 
relationship with Greyhound 
continues to evolve, with planning 
already under way for future 
campaign work, mobile application 
and physical service design.
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION  
IN TRANSPORT
Greyhound
Outlook
I believe the Group occupies  
a unique space in the market.  
We have successfully reshaped 
the business, modernising through 
acquisitions in the high-growth 
areas of data, digital and consulting 
services while continuing to invest in 
our existing operations. As a whole,  
that gives us an unrivalled suite  
of services for clients and a  
strong proposition for investors.
I would like to thank all of our 
employees for their continuing 
dedication, and the Board members 
for their commitment to growing  
the Group. I look forward to another 
busy and prosperous year ahead.

Business model
St Ives is an international  
Marketing Services Group.  
We operate not as a single entity 
but as a group of market-leading 
businesses, each with its own 
unique value proposition. Our 
companies offer complementary 
services and collaborate closely 
with each other when this adds 
value to clients.
We have built strong capabilities  
in our Strategic Marketing 
businesses and speciﬁcally  
in the high-growth segments 
of data, digital and consulting. 
Our complementary Marketing 
Activation capability delivers our 
clients’ marketing communications 
through a combination of print and 
in-store marketing services.
Our strategic focus is on investing
in further Strategic Marketing
businesses that will continue to
ﬂourish as a part of St Ives and
that will, in turn, help to support
further growth. Our Marketing 
Activation businesses and separate,
longstanding and market-leading
Books business, represent an
additional source of proﬁt and
cash generation as we pursue
this growth strategy.
STRATEGIC REPORT  
OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY
AN INDUSTRY  
LEADING  
APPROACH
We ensure that all of our  
businesses are able to provide 
intellectual rigour and creative 
thinking, combined with the 
ability to execute complex and 
sophisticated solutions. We believe 
the combination of these attributes 
creates a set of services which 
add value that is both tangible 
and measurable. This helps to 
deliver enduring client relationships 
out of which the Group can build 
long-term market strength and 
shareholder value.
We put great emphasis on creating 
and nurturing the right corporate 
culture. We look for businesses  
run by straightforward individuals  
or teams who demonstrate high 
levels of passion and integrity in 
their leadership. We deliberately 
operate a ﬂat corporate structure 
that gives autonomy to individual 
management teams whilst 
encouraging and facilitating 
collaboration.
A fundamental aspect of our 
business model is that all our 
companies operate as separate 
brands and businesses. This gives 
them freedom to develop their own 
intellectual property and to become 
leading players within their markets. 
The Group’s role is to support the 
businesses with investment to 
accelerate growth and to facilitate 
collaboration so that our combined 
offering creates maximum synergy 
and value for our clients.
Group Businesses:
Operate as individual brands
Offer complementary services
Share common attributes  
– culture, business ethos  
and growth potential
St Ives:
Provides investment  
to accelerate growth
Supports and facilitates 
collaboration
Offers autonomy

STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
INTERNATIONALISATION
International operations have made a growing contribution to Group revenues 
during the past twelve months – over 30% of our Strategic Marketing revenue 
now comes from clients based outside the UK. Seven of our businesses – 
Incite, Pragma, Hive, Amaze, Realise, Branded3 and Solstice – now deliver 
international solutions for clients and we plan to open additional overseas 
ofﬁces where we identify client-led opportunities. We believe that this provides 
a ﬁrm foundation for continued overseas expansion.
ACQUISITION
An important strength going forward will be our ability to acquire further 
complementary Marketing Services businesses which operate in the growth 
areas we have identiﬁed and can add value to our existing portfolio. We aim  
to acquire non-competing companies that support our business model.  
In line with our strategy, during the year we acquired Chicago-based Solstice,  
a leading mobile-ﬁrst marketing and technology business. Following the  
year-end we also acquired FSP , a specialist retail property consultancy,  
which will work closely with our Pragma Consulting business. 
COLLABORATION
Facilitating and supporting collaboration is a key strand of our organic  
growth strategy. We believe that a culture of collaboration is most successful 
when it is driven from within our businesses rather than imposed by the  
Group. Over 100 of our clients now work with more than one business across 
the Group, compared to 82 in the previous year. During the last twelve months, 
we’ve also made investments in joint propositions between our businesses  
– a collaboration between Amaze and Occam resulted in the launch of the 
digitally led customer relationship marketing offering Amaze One.

OUR STRATEGY FOR FURTHER GROWTH IS CENTRED AROUND THREE KEY PRIORITIES 06 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Performance highlights
The Group has again delivered  
a strong ﬁnancial performance  
for the year.
Underlying Group revenue of 
£344.6 million was 5% higher than 
the previous year. The growth was 
driven by our Strategic Marketing 
segment, which delivered growth  
of 4% on an organic basis along 
with acquisitive growth of 24%. 
This was partially offset by a 4% 
decline in our Marketing Activation 
segment, due to pressure within  
the grocery retail sector. Revenue 
within our Books segment was 
broadly in line with the prior year. 
Group underlying proﬁt before tax 
grew to £33.0 million (2014 – £29.9 
million) and underlying basic earnings 
per share increasing by 9% to  
20.32 pence (2014 – 18.70 pence).
These improvements reﬂect further 
growth in our Strategic Marketing 
segment, which contributed 46% 
(2014 – 37%) of the Group’s 
underlying operating proﬁt during 
the ﬁnancial year.
The Board is recommending a ﬁnal 
dividend of 5.55 pence, making 
a full year dividend of 7.80 pence 
(2014 – 7.15 pence), an increase 
of 9%, reﬂecting the Board’s 
conﬁdence in the Group’s ability to 
make further strategic and ﬁnancial 
progress during the year ahead. 
Once again there was clear evidence 
of our ability to collaborate across 
our individual businesses to the 
beneﬁt of our clients, with the  
level and quality of internal referrals 
increasing further during the year. In 
2015 more than 100 (2014 – 82) of 
our clients used the services of more 
than one business within the Group.
In line with our strategy, during  
the year we acquired Chicago-
based Solstice, a leading mobile-
ﬁrst marketing and technology 
business which is integrating 
well into the Group. Following 
the year-end we also acquired 
Fripp, Sandeman and Partners 
(‘FSP’), a specialist retail property 
consultancy, which will work 
closely with our Pragma Consulting 
business, particularly in the airport, 
travel and commercial space 
sectors. 
The past year also saw continued 
growth from our international 
operations. Our market research 
consultancy, Incite, opened an ofﬁce 
in Shanghai, to complement the 
ofﬁces we have opened in New York 
and Singapore, with the business 
winning its ﬁrst new client mandates 
in the region at the end of the 
ﬁnancial year. In addition, Amaze, 
one of our digital businesses, won 
its ﬁrst major e-commerce systems 
integration project from our newly 
opened Chicago ofﬁce.
Our strategy for further growth is 
centred around three key priorities:
• organic growth through 
collaboration and investment in 
our existing marketing services 
businesses; 
• internationalisation, primarily 
client-led, into large and high 
growth markets; combined with 
• further acquisitions of 
complementary, ambitious and 
growing Strategic Marketing 
businesses, which share our 
common attributes and ethos. 
We have continued to make 
progress across all three strategic 
objectives in the year:
Collaboration:  
Our approach is based on cross-
thinking as opposed to cross-selling 
and where collaboration is facilitated 
and supported rather than forced. 
Over 100 of our clients currently 
work with more than one business 
across the Group, compared to 
approximately 80 in the previous 
ﬁnancial year, collaborating on 
projects for clients including 
Johnson & Johnson, Carlsberg, 
Royal Mail and Pizza Express.  
In the year, we also extended 
our remit with HSBC, which now 
engages with six businesses across 
the Group. In addition, investments 
have been made in our Occam 
and Amaze businesses, which 
culminated with the launch of our 
digitally-led Customer Relationship 
Management (‘CRM’) offering 
Amaze One.
Once again there was clear 
evidence of our ability to 
collaborate across our individual 
businesses to the beneﬁt  
of our clients, with the  
level and quality of internal 
referrals increasing further  
during the year.
A SOLID STRUCTURE  
FOR GROWTH
STRATEGIC REPORT  
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S PERFORMANCE REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 07
STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
Internationalisation: 
Many of our businesses deliver 
international solutions for clients 
and we plan to open additional 
overseas ofﬁces where we can 
identify client-led opportunities. 
These opportunities must be in 
large markets or in markets with 
the potential for signiﬁcant and 
sustainable growth. During the 
year we continued to expand our 
headcount in both the US and Asia 
to meet client demand. We also 
opened an ofﬁce in Shanghai for 
Incite, our consumer and market 
research consultancy. Over 30%  
of our Strategic Marketing revenue 
now comes from clients based 
outside of the UK, compared with 
27% in 2014 and 15% in 2013.  
Seven of our Group businesses, 
Incite, Pragma, Hive, Amaze, 
Realise, Branded3 and Solstice, 
now service clients on an 
international basis. 
Acquisitions: 
An important element of our growth 
strategy going forward is our 
continued ability to acquire further 
complementary marketing services 
businesses which add value to our 
existing portfolio and operate in the 
growth areas we have identiﬁed of 
data, digital and consulting services. 
Our acquisition strategy adopts very 
stringent quantitative, qualitative and 
ﬁnancial criteria. We aim to acquire 
non-competing businesses that 
support our business model. In 
addition, any companies we acquire 
must already enjoy reasonable 
scale and have management teams 
looking to execute the next phase 
of growth, as well as encouraging 
an entrepreneurial and collaborative 
culture that ﬁts well with our own. 
Once acquired, we transition each 
business into the Group using our 
well-established and successful 
integration process. We then work 
with the management teams to 
identify and implement the most 
appropriate initiatives for driving 
organic growth within the business. 
This model makes it imperative  
that there is a clear sharing of  
values between the Group and  
any acquired company.
HSBC has worked with St Ives 
Group for more than four years. 
The global ﬁnancial services 
company initially became a 
client of SIMS for marketing 
communications and print 
management.
SIMS manages HSBC’s direct 
mail, generating over 60 million 
mailing packs for customer 
acquisition, customer retention 
and mandatory communications. 
It has also implemented an asset 
management system, housing 
and printing on demand a full 
range of training materials 
to centralise learning and 
development collateral in  
a cost-efﬁcient solution.
Through the solid relationships 
that SIMS has cultivated, further 
services are being procured from 
other areas of St Ives Group. 
SP Group produces in-branch 
marketing communications for 
1,400 high-street premises, 
including ﬂyers and Point-of-Sale. 
Meanwhile, Service Graphics 
produced signage and graphics 
as part of the bank’s sponsorship 
of the Leeds First Direct Arena.
Response One manages 
customer data for HSBC, as well 
as a training asset programme 
which has been rolled out in the 
UK and is now planned to be 
implemented globally.
Digital services are also being 
deployed. Realise is converting 
traditional printed materials 
into digital experiences that 
prompt customer conversations 
with branch staff. Additionally, 
Branded3 has overhauled  
HSBC-owned First Direct’s  
search marketing.
In total, HSBC currently engages 
with six St Ives businesses, and 
is seeing clear beneﬁts from the 
collaboration of different Group 
companies offering extensive 
complementary services.
DELIVERING A JOINED UP STRATEGY 
HSBC
In 2015 we acquired mobile-ﬁrst 
marketing & technology business 
Solstice, which has integrated 
successfully into St Ives and is 
performing well, beneﬁtting from 
and contributing to collaboration 
opportunities within the Group. 
Following the year-end, we also 
acquired FSP , a specialist retail 
property consultancy, which will  
work closely with our Pragma 
Consulting business.
While the Group’s strategic focus 
is on expanding our Strategic 
Marketing offering, management  
also recognises the importance  
of continued investment and 
innovation in our complementary 
Marketing Activation segment  
and separate, long-standing and 
market-leading Books segment. 
These separate divisions not  
only support growth for the Group  
as a whole through collaboration,  
but also represent an additional 
source of proﬁt and cash generation 
as we pursue our growth strategy. 
 
CASE STUDY 08 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Our Strategic Marketing 
operations, which represent  
32% of Group underlying  
revenue (2014 – 26%), are 
organised around three high-
growth sectors: Data, Digital  
and Consulting. 
Data
Our Data businesses – Occam and 
Response One – represented 30% 
of Strategic Marketing revenue at 
£33.2 million (2014 – £35.5 million).
As reported at the half year, revenue 
within our Data division reduced 
compared with the previous year  
due to two factors: a significant  
one-off software sale within Occam 
in the previous year and a change 
in work mix in Response One. While 
these factors have led to a decrease 
in revenue in this financial year,  
they have also led to an increase  
in margin during the period. 
Over the course of the year, 
Response One has introduced 
a new analytics proposition and 
improved its digital capabilities.
In addition, Occam has significantly 
expanded its remit within Jaguar 
Land Rover and we are now 
delivering services into them through 
both Occam and Amaze One. 
Occam has also secured a number 
of new wins, including Car Giant, 
Healthspan, Sainsbury’s Retail 
Technology Services and the RAC.
Digital
This division, which comprises 
Amaze, Branded3, Realise and 
Solstice had a good year and 
contributed £45.5 million (2014 
– £27.8 million); 41% of Strategic 
Marketing revenue.
Amaze has continued to extend 
its commerce capabilities with a 
number of significant new client 
wins throughout the year. It has 
established a core strength in 
advising manufacturers who are 
transacting directly with their 
consumers for the first time and 
in the delivery of B2B commerce 
solutions. Both areas are currently 
experiencing significant market 
growth.
Following the launch of Amaze One, 
the CRM collaboration between 
Amaze and Occam, highlighted 
above, the business has progressed 
well, winning projects for the 
Arcadia Group and Royal Mail while 
also extending its CRM remit with 
Northern Rail. 
Branded3 has achieved a number 
of new business wins throughout 
the year, securing the search engine 
optimisation account for First Direct, 
which further extends our remit 
within HSBC, as well as winning 
contracts for Halfords, Chelsea FC 
and Durham University.
Realise has continued to build 
its business both within the UK 
and internationally. Highlights 
included a digital transformation 
project for Greyhound in the US 
and international digital marketing 
campaigns for Disneyland Parks 
and Expedia. In addition, Realise 
has had a number of significant  
new business wins including Nikon 
in Europe and Hewlett Packard  
& Sutter Health in the US. 
The acquisition of Solstice in  
March 2015 broadened the  
Group’s digital capabilities and 
enhanced our international 
credentials. Solstice’s offering  
of mobile product design and 
engineering services complements 
St Ives’ existing digital businesses 
and creates significant opportunities 
for increased collaboration at an 
international level. 
 
Moving forward, it is our intention  
to bring our digital businesses closer 
together in order to collaborate on 
large scale multi-discipline, multi-
territory digital client mandates.
Consulting
Our Consulting businesses – Incite, 
Pragma and Hive – represented 29% 
of Strategic Marketing revenue at 
£32.0 million (2014 – £22.9 million).
Incite continues to grow 
internationally, in response to client 
demand. It has seen strong growth 
in New York and Singapore having 
opened offices in both markets 
during 2013, and has secured a 
number of significant new business 
wins. Following this successful 
expansion, the business opened 
an operation in Shanghai this year, 
winning its first new client mandates 
in the region at the end of the 
financial year.
Pragma has also seen an increase 
in demand for overseas projects. 
Airports and commercial spaces  
in particular are high-growth areas, 
with the business advising on the 
commercial strategy of New Mexico 
City International Airport; one of this 
year’s most high profile projects. 
Hive, the heathcare communications 
consultancy we acquired in May 
2014, has integrated well into 
the Group and continues to add 
new clients to its roster, with 
substantial wins from three top 
20 pharmaceutical companies. Its 
patient journey mapping proposition 
is a strong growth driver for the 
business, with recent new project 
wins from Bayer, Novartis and 
AbbVie. This area is expected to see 
continued momentum into 2016.

Our Marketing Activation 
segment represented 48%  
(2014 – 53%) of Group underlying 
revenue for the year. 
Our Marketing Activation segment 
comprises our Exhibitions and Events 
business, Service Graphics; our 
Point-of-Sale specialist, SP Group; 
our Print Management business,  
St Ives Management Services (SIMS); 
and our Field Marketing business, 
Tactical Solutions.
Trading conditions within Marketing 
Activation were mixed, with growth in 
Service Graphics and SIMS offset by 
a reduction in Point-of-Sale revenue 
caused by ongoing pressures within 
the UK grocery retail sector. Despite 
the overall reduction in revenue  
we have maintained margins  
through improved efficiencies  
and cost reductions.

Our market-leading Books 
business, Clays, represented 
20% (2014 – 21%) of Group 
underlying revenue for the year. 
Revenue in Clays was broadly  
in line with the prior year at  
£66.9 million (2014 – £67.4 million), 
with a slight decrease in margins. 
Clays is the market leader in UK 
trade monochrome book production 
services and continues to extend  
its range of value-added services to 
the publishing market through digital 
and supply chain-related investment. 
This has included the introduction  
of a new self-publishing service  
that is seeing rapid volume growth.
As reported at the half year, sentiment 
within the physical book market has 
improved, with eReader penetration 
appearing to have levelled off within 
the UK and the US and with physical 
book volumes stable for the first  
time in a number of years.
During the year we reached 
agreement with Penguin Random 
House, the UK’s largest trade 
publisher, to provide 100% of their 
UK monochrome book production 
under a new multi-year contract. 
This represents a significant market 
share gain for the business and, 
along with a number of other recent 
contract wins and extensions, 
secures approximately 80% of  
Clays’ workload for the next  
three to six years.

The new financial year has started 
in line with our expectations. 
We continue to encourage and 
facilitate significant opportunities for 
collaboration across our individual 
businesses and there is further scope 
to expand our higher margin Strategic 
Marketing activities both organically 
and through acquisition over the 
coming year. We will continue to 
invest in our growing operations and 
client offering in the US and Asia, as 
well as in our recent acquisitions, 
Solstice and FSP .
The outlook for our Marketing 
Activation businesses remains 
challenging, impacted by the 
Outlook
competitive trading conditions  
in the UK grocery retail sector,  
which are expected to continue 
this year. However, this business 
segment remains profitable and  
cash generative for the Group,  
as does our market-leading Books 
business. Both segments have 
recently benefitted from a number  
of contract wins or extensions which 
help to provide an enhanced level 
of stability. This, together with our 
strong balance sheet, leaves St Ives 
well positioned to pursue further 
acquisitions of complementary, 
ambitious and growing Strategic 
Marketing businesses which share 
our common attributes and ethos.
Within Service Graphics we won 
new clients during the year such as 
the Ministry of Defence, Moorfields 
Eye Hospital and Rolls Royce. Within 
SIMS we delivered significant growth 
due to new client wins including 
Adidas and Pernod Ricard as well  
as securing organic growth from  
our existing client base.
Despite a difficult year, due to 
increased competitive pressures 
within the grocery retail market, 
Tactical Solutions has also had 
a number of new business wins 
over the year, including Revlon and 
Quorn. We continue to invest in new 
data and technology capabilities and 
have recently launched a bespoke 
data tool, TSeye, to continue  
to differentiate the business in  
a crowded market place. 
We have also significantly developed 
our creative marketing and design 
offering, The Shop, which sits within 
our SP operation and which has 
extended our European remit with 
international client engagements  
such as Adidas. 
In addition, since the end of 
last year we have re-signed and 
extended contracts with many of 
our leading clients. These contract 
extensions provide an increased level 
of visibility and a stable foundation  
for market share growth over the  
next two to three years.
As a Group, we are clear on our 
growth priorities and are confident 
that, assuming current market 
conditions continue, St Ives will 
make further strategic and financial 
progress during the year ahead.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
COLLABORATION
We are expanding our footprint with 
existing clients in a way that wouldn’t 
have been possible for Occam or Amaze 
as standalone agencies. That means 
a more secure client base as well as 
increasing and opening up new revenue 
channels for St Ives.
Neil Evans 
Managing Director – Amaze One & Occam
Amaze One is a great example  
of the Group’s wider strategy  
of collaboration. The Customer 
Relationship Management (‘CRM’) 
agency was launched in November 
2014 when Managing Director,  
Neil Evans, identiﬁed a gap in  
the market. Neil, who also runs  
St Ives’ data-driven marketing 
agency Occam, spotted a 
weakness among rival agencies 
claiming to deliver strategic 
communications for clients, when 
in reality they were not making full 
use of data and creative together. 
The concept of Amaze One became 
reality when Neil blended elements 
of Occam’s technical and data 
expertise with the specialist creative 
skills of digital agency Amaze, 
headed by CEO, Natalie Gross.
Neil explains: “the collaboration 
came about because Occam 
knew its clients needed a way 
to bridge the gap between data 
and technology, and customer 
experiences. This was particularly 
true in the creative and content 
space, which is where Amaze 
comes in. It’s what we call a 
combination of rigour and magic,  
a challenger business born out  
of two established companies.”
Clients were seeking a more 
coherent and successful blend  
of strategy and creative, he says: 
“we believe you need to tell clients 
the truth about what has to happen 
and then execute the idea – in other 
words, be as practical as you are 
strategic. We knew there was a way 
to add rigour to the creative process 
and deliver something out of the 
ordinary.”
Amaze One’s experienced 
management team reﬂects the 
Group’s high-integrity, low-ego 
approach and they collaborated 
from day one to make a quick 
impact in the market. The agency 
posted a strong ﬁrst nine months  
of operations, vindicating St Ives’ 
CEO, Matt Armitage’s, decision  
to back the venture. “Matt bought  
into Amaze One straight away.  
Of course there were concerns 
about several people doing two 
roles at once but those have been 
allayed and we’ve proved it can 
work,” comments Neil.
Much of Amaze One’s growth  
has come from incremental 
revenues by cross-selling services 
to Occam and Amaze’s existing 
clients. “We aim to accelerate 
their ambition,” Neil says. “We met 
Northern Rail and in a short time 
we were bringing our thinking to 
life. We’ve also completed a project 
for Arcadia across its high-street 
fashion brands.”
He continues: “we are expanding 
our footprint with existing clients 
in a way that wouldn’t have been 
possible for Occam or Amaze as 
standalone agencies. That means 
a more secure client base as well 
as increasing and opening up new 
revenue channels for St Ives. Now 
we are having conversations with 
the other businesses to implement 
the model more widely. Our aim 
is to weave CRM into the Group’s 
DNA, across Strategic Marketing 
and Marketing Activation.” 
This strategy is already paying 
dividends, with Amaze One joining 
SIMS as a potential supplier to 
Royal Mail. 
A combination of growing existing 
clients and winning new accounts 
has allowed Amaze One to increase 
its headcount, in many areas adding 
talent from outside St Ives. A key 
objective for the year ahead is  
the creation of a data asset.  
Neil explains: “we are keen on 
product development to add to 
the services we can offer clients. 
Owning our own data makes sense 
as it is licensable revenue.”
He believes the agency’s ambition 
proves that St Ives thrives on 
entrepreneurial spirit: “it shows  
that if someone has a good idea 
that can add revenue, St Ives  
will match their talent and vision. 
Even though it’s a big, listed 
company, its thinking and actions 
are ﬂeet of foot. This is deﬁnitely  
a place you can do business.”

Over the last decade, St Ives  
has built a strong relationship 
with Royal Mail. St Ives 
Management Services (‘SIMS’) 
was the ﬁrst Group company  
to work with the postal operator, 
supplying materials for marketing 
services and operations.
SIMS implemented a supply 
chain management and  
print procurement process, 
resulting in signiﬁcant cost 
savings, internal and external 
communication improvements, 
ﬁnancial beneﬁts and better 
client service across Royal Mail 
and Parcelforce.
After Royal Mail was privatised, 
SIMS liaised with stakeholders 
to reduce operating costs and 
boost market effectiveness by 
promoting the use of mail.
Through its work, SIMS identiﬁed 
further opportunities to introduce 
other parts of St Ives where the 
Group’s services could add value.
Amaze One is now working with 
Royal Mail division Market Reach 
to assess the impact and value 
of mail through research, insight 
and customer experience. The 
programme includes analytics 
and media mix modelling for 
Royal Mail’s clients that use 
mail as part of a multichannel 
strategy. The ultimate goal is 
to understand the complex 
relationships between consumers 
and channels and promote 
the role of mail in the modern 
marketing mix.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
INTERNATIONALISATION
Incite, the strategic research 
consultancy acquired by St Ives 
Group in 2012, continues to grow 
beyond the UK in response to 
increasing client demand. The 
business followed the opening  
of its US and Singapore ofﬁces  
in 2013 with a new base in 
Shanghai this year.
Matthew Froggatt, Group MD 
of Incite, says the international 
expansion strategy – also a key 
part of St Ives Group’s own growth 
plans – is already reaping rewards: 
“the US and Singapore operations 
took a few months to ﬁnd their feet, 
of course,” he explains, “but they 
have grown very strongly during  
the ﬁrst two years and have won 
lots of new clients.”
Matthew believes there are  
clear reasons for this momentum. 
He points to a service offer that 
resonates in all markets but was 
absent for clients before Incite 
began to export its model. “We 
have smart people solving tough 
problems with pragmatic tools 
and approaches,” he says. “That 
sweet spot is underserved in the 
US particularly, but elsewhere 
too. We are hiring intelligent local 
leaders who want to spend their 
time with clients rather than doing 
management tasks, and they are 
hiring like-minded people.”
The agency acts as the voice  
of the consumer for clients, 
uncovering and interpreting local 
needs and cultural nuances. But 
beyond simple description, Incite’s 
strength is in advising organisations 
how to plan and deploy marketing 
resources. Segmentation, market 
landscaping and strategic 
qualitative work are particularly 
popular in new markets for both 
local players and new entrants.
Working with new clients, 
particularly those with international 
scope, requires understanding 
of business structures and how 
their different departments interact. 
Matthew adds: “we often need to 
navigate the complexities of client 
organisations, including tensions 
and misalignments between central 
insight functions and local teams.” 
The key is to recognise roadblocks 
and build relationships with many 
different points of contact, for 
example in research, marketing  
and strategic planning teams.  
Then it’s a case of integrating 
qualitative and quantitative work, 
revealing the details of consumers’ 
lives through quotes and videos. 
“We aim to bring the reality of life 
in emerging markets into sharp 
focus in the boardroom, to support 
effective decision-making,”  
Matthew says.
We’re where our clients  
want us to be. We don’t just 
head for places because  
they’re on the map.

Group MD – Incite
GEARING UP FOR 
INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES
Incite
The Chinese market research  
sector is unique and Incite 
has faced speciﬁc challenges 
establishing the Shanghai ofﬁce. 
Bureaucratic compliance, a slowing 
economy and growing competition 
all add complexity. “Managing a 
business in China can be tough and 
so is the work,” Matthew attests. 
He continues: “client organisations 
come in different shapes and sizes. 
Some are local ‘tigers’ who have 
international aspirations actively 
encouraged by government, 
but they also need to meet the 
expectations of increasingly 
sophisticated Chinese consumers. 
Others are multinationals that need 
to adapt their product offer and 
marketing approaches to local 
needs and nuances. The research 
and insight industry is only a 
decade old there, so the experience 
of our people is a real competitive 
advantage.” Incite is taking an 
open-minded and ﬂexible approach 
to applying its business model in 
the country, but Matthew envisages 
a “high-value, consulting operation 
with hands-on, practical problem 
solvers.”
Elsewhere, the consultancy will 
continue to respond strategically  
to international demand. “We’re 
where our clients want us to be.  
We don’t just head for places 
because they’re on the map,”  
says Matthew, “further expansion  
is deﬁnitely on the agenda but  
our main focus is on building  
our existing markets.”

As part of St Ives’ Strategic 
Marketing segment, the business 
is a key player in the Group’s 
international expansion strategy. 
Although it has yet to open ofﬁces 
overseas – instead providing high-
quality services using its London 
base as a global hub – its experts 
deliver services around the world.
Tom Holt, Pragma’s Chief Executive, 
says: “for us it’s about knowledge, 
not about boots on the ground. 
During the last year we have 
worked in countries as far apart  
as South Africa, Mexico, the US, 
China and Germany.
“Our international work is expanding 
quickly. Airports, Travel and 
Commercial Spaces are high-
growth areas, especially in Asia. 
Due diligence projects – advising 
private equity ﬁrms on businesses 
they’d like to buy – are substantial 
assignments and often include 
an assessment of international 
performance. Meanwhile, many  
of the retailers we work for in the 
UK want to explore other countries, 
or vice versa.”
Airport growth is based on the 
perpetual increase in global travel, 
meaning commercial development 
can generate vast revenues for 
terminals and their tenants. Pragma 
has worked on passenger research 
and retail development projects 
in over 50 major cities worldwide. 
Tom explains: “it’s a unique and 
expanding market. We do well 
working with airport owners on 
commercial space plans. This 
extends from North America to 
South East Asia and we believe  
we will continue to see huge growth 
in this area of our business.”

The nature of Pragma’s clients 
makes the consultancy ripe  
for international expansion.  
It is structured around three  
divisions – Investor Services,  
Retail Strategy and Airports,  
Travel & Commercial Spaces.  
Each division has established 
credentials in markets outside the 
UK, with over 40% of total revenues 
now coming from overseas.
Pragma, which currently has  
32 full-time employees, is also  
a leading member of the Ebeltoft 
Group, a global alliance of 
consulting companies in over 
20 countries. The alliance gives 
Pragma rapid access to a ready-
made font of local knowledge when 
clients wish to enter new markets.

identifying the most attractive route 
for Phase Eight. Pragma’s strategy 
has led to Phase Eight launching in

over 130 international Points-of-Sale.
Pragma will continue to look

path to growth. Tom concludes:

ACQUISITION
The acquisition has created energy 
behind the Solstice brand, our mission 
and vision for the future. The company 
will continue to evolve as it always 
has, embracing new technologies and 
bringing them to customers in value-
added ways. The secret to our success 
is our people and our culture. This 
philosophy has created a tight-knit 
group of innovators, creators and 
relentless embracers of change.
J Schwan 
CEO – Solstice
Buying Solstice, the mobile-ﬁrst 
marketing and technology business, 
allows St Ives to extend the breadth 
and depth of its digital capabilities  
into another high-growth area  
of customer engagement.
The deal supported the expansion 
of St Ives’ Strategic Marketing 
segment. As the Group’s maiden 
overseas acquisition, Chicago-
based Solstice also provides 
presence and capabilities in 
the Americas, further bolstering 
international client service.
Solstice was launched in 2001, 
advising Fortune 1000 businesses 
on how to boost revenues through 
better engagement with customers, 
partners and employees, powered 
by emerging technologies. The 
consultancy also has ofﬁces in  
New York and Buenos Aires.
CEO J Schwan – an expert 
in computer engineering who 
launched several start-ups 
at Andersen Consulting (now 
Accenture) during the original  
dot-com boom – says the deal  
was an important evolution for  
his business. “Culturally, the St Ives 
and Solstice principles are very 
similar,” he explains. “We believe 
in empowering our people, giving 
them autonomy while offering 
ﬁnancial and operational support. 
We thought this ethos was unique 
until we met the management  
of St Ives.
“We also believe strongly in  
St Ives’ investment strategy and 
business model, and the quality  
of the companies under its umbrella. 
While Solstice empowers the digital 
customer experience, many of the 
Group’s companies drive the digital 
acquisition experience, turning 
prospects into customers. Together, 
it’s an amazing value proposition  
for our international client base.”
Solstice’s relationship with St Ives 
may be new, but J feels momentum 
is already building: “the acquisition 
has created energy behind the 
Solstice brand, our mission and 
vision for the future. The company 
will continue to evolve as it always 
has, embracing new technologies 
and bringing them to customers  
in value-added ways. The secret  
to our success is our people 
and our culture. This philosophy 
has created a tight-knit group of 
innovators, creators and relentless 
embracers of change.”
J points to the opportunity to  
work alongside the Group’s 
Strategic Marketing businesses  
to marry its digital product 
engineering capabilities with  
their broader digital expertise.  
He also aims to build opportunities 
alongside the Marketing Activation 
companies to boost physical  
in-store experiences. He adds: 
“most of the digital companies 
focus on the front half of the digital 
journey. Solstice focuses on the 
back half, turning those customers

into promoters and life-long 
enthusiasts for the brand.”
The acquisition offers the symbiotic 
value of St Ives helping Solstice 
launch its proposition into the UK, 
and the consultancy strengthening 
the Group’s international footprint. 
J is convinced mobile will prove 
to be “the future of computing” 
as well as a powerful customer 
engagement channel. He explains: 
“mobile is computing in the context 
of the user’s environment, the 
intersection of the physical and 
digital worlds from any location, 
on any screen, in any situation. It 
combines the capabilities of natural 
user interfaces – touch, motion, 
voice and voice recorder – with 
prescriptive analytics and artiﬁcial 
intelligence to create an entirely new 
type of human-computer interaction.”
Moreover, he believes technology’s 
evolution promises a “utopian 
intersection between analogue  
and digital,” affording consumers 
more personalised, intimate 
experiences when they interact  
with brands. He hopes Solstice  
and St Ives can quicken the  
pace of mobile adoption in the 
market, concluding: “we provide 
full-lifecycle digital product 
innovation; from business strategy 
and ideation, to people-centred 
hardware and software design, to 
product development and rollout. 
Very few innovation agencies 
bring that end-to-end service at 
scale, and we’ve yet to meet a 
UK ﬁrm with similar capabilities 
and experience. We build digital 
products that delight users and 
employees, turning traditional points 
of friction into points of delight.”

CONFIGURATION
Rockwell Automation 16 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Overview
The Group has delivered a strong 
ﬁnancial performance for the full 
year, with growth in both underlying 
revenue and underlying proﬁt, and 
with recent acquisitions making 
a signiﬁcant contribution to the 
Group’s results.
The Group’s total revenue for the 
period increased by 4% from £330.7 
million to £344.6 million. Reported 
proﬁt before tax decreased from 
£11.9 million to £8.7 million with 
reported basic earnings per share 
decreasing from 8.60 pence to 4.35 
pence. This decrease in reported 
results is the result of an increase  
in non-underlying items, largely 
driven by the acquisitions made 
during the year.
 
The following Financial Review 
focuses on the underlying results of 
the Group which, in management’s 
view, best reﬂect how the business is 
managed and show the performance 
in a consistent manner. The 
underlying results remove the impact 
of non-underlying items which include 
acquisition costs, restructuring 
costs, provision releases, 
operating results of non-continuing 
sites, net proﬁt on disposal of 
property, plant and equipment, 
proﬁt on disposal of subsidiary, 
consideration required to be treated 
as remuneration, amortisation or 
impairment of acquired intangibles, 
remeasurement of deferred 
consideration, costs related to 
St Ives deﬁned beneﬁts pension 
scheme and other one-off items.
As a result of the reallocation  
of resources and a change in  
the Group’s internal reporting,  
we have redeﬁned our segments 
as Strategic Marketing, Marketing 
Activation and Books. Comparatives 
have been restated to reﬂect the 
reclassiﬁcation of reporting segments 
for the 52 weeks to 1 August 2014. 
A full explanation of our segmental 
reporting disclosures can be  
found in note 4.
Prior year ﬁgures have been restated 
to classify the costs related to St Ives 
deﬁned beneﬁts pension scheme  
as non-underlying items (note 8).
Revenue
Underlying revenue increased 
by £17.0 million (5%) to £344.6 
million. After equalising the effect 
of acquisitions made, during the 
current and prior year, growth from 
acquisitions was 6% offset by a 1% 
organic decline. The organic growth 
within our Strategic Marketing 
segment has been offset by a 
decline in the Marketing Activation 
segment and, to a lesser extent,  
the Books segment. 
 
Underlying revenue from our 
Strategic Marketing segment 
increased from £86.2 million to 
£110.7 million, an increase of 28%, 
as a result of recent acquisitions  
and organic growth. The growth  
was split between organic growth  
of 4% and acquisition growth of 
24%. Organic growth in the current 
year was adversely impacted by 
a one-off software licence sale 
recorded within our Data division  
in the prior year of £2.4 million.
Underlying revenue from our 
Marketing Activation segment 
decreased by 4% from £174.0 
million to £167.0 million, primarily 
due to the structural changes 
and pressures in the retail grocery 
market. This has impacted our  
Point-of-Sale business, SP Group 
and our Field Marketing business, 
Tactical Solutions.
Revenue from our Books  
segment was broadly in line  
with the prior year at £66.9 million  
(2014 – £67.4 million).
Gross proﬁt margin and 
underlying proﬁtability
The Group’s underlying gross proﬁt 
margin improved from 31% to 33% 
primarily as a result of the increased 
mix from our Strategic Marketing 
segment, which carries a higher 
gross proﬁt margin.
Underlying proﬁt from operations 
increased by 12% from £31.5 
million to £35.4 million remaining  
at 10% of revenue.
The Group has delivered a  
strong ﬁnancial performance  
for the full year, with growth  
in both underlying revenue and 
underlying proﬁt, and with recent 
acquisitions making a signiﬁcant 
contribution to the Group’s 
results.

Debt
The Group negotiated a new 
revolving credit facility with its 
existing two banks for a term of four 
years expiring on 23 March 2019 
and with the ability to extend the 
term for a further year. The facility 
was increased from £90.0 million 
to £115.0 million.
 
Net debt increased during the year 
from £42.7 million to £62.8 million. 
At 31 July 2015, St Ives had drawn 
£79.2 million on its bank credit facility, 
leaving an unutilised commitment  
of £35.8 million. The Group had  
cash in hand of £16.4 million.
Our policy is to maintain prudent 
leverage ratios. At 31 July 2015 the 
ratio of net debt to EBITDA, before 
non-underlying items, was 1.4 times 
as shown below:

funding contributions of £2.0 million 
per annum and a contribution of 
£0.4 million per annum (2014 –  
£0.4 million) towards the costs  
of administration.
The IAS 19 (Employee Beneﬁts) 
accounting deﬁcit of the Scheme 
at 31 July 2015 was £27.6 million 
(2014 – £9.8 million). The deﬁcit  
has increased as a result of an 
increase in the liabilities of the 
scheme caused by a decrease  
in the discount rate used to value 
the liabilities and an increase in  
the inﬂation rate.
In line with legislation that came 
into effect on 1 October 2012, the 
Group is continuing the process  
of automatically enrolling eligible  
UK employees into a qualifying 
pension scheme. The charge for 
the year for the Group’s deﬁned 
contribution schemes was  
£3.8 million (2014 – £2.8 million).
Cashﬂow
Cash generated from operations was 
£35.5 million (2014 – £31.2 million). 
Total capital expenditure was £6.1 
million (2014 – £11.7 million) and 
included new capital of £3.5 million 
in the Books segment to meet the 
additional volume generated by the 
Penguin Random House contract;  
a further £1.1 million of maintenance 
capital and the development of 
Tactical Solutions’ data offering in 
Marketing Activation; and other 
expenditure of £1.5 million in 
Strategic Marketing and St Ives plc.
consideration of £24.7 million was 
payable in the form of cash and  
St Ives plc shares.
In August 2015 the Group acquired 
FSP , a specialist retail property 
consultancy. The consideration  
was payable in the form of cash  
and St Ives plc shares.
The deferred consideration paid in 
the year for acquisitions made in 
prior years totalled £15.6 million 
(2014 – £4.8 million).
The Group, where possible, has 
issued shares from Treasury to 
satisfy the share element of initial 
and deferred consideration.
Tax
The Group’s tax rate on the 
underlying proﬁt before tax was 
21.3% (2014 – 23.4%). A signiﬁcant 
proportion of the Group’s proﬁt is 
generated and taxed in the UK and 
the UK Corporation tax rate fell from 
21% to 20% this year. The total 
underlying tax charge is £7.0 million 
(2014 – £7.1 million).
Corporation tax of £6.6 million 
(2014 – £3.7 million) was paid in  
the UK. 
 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a ﬁnal 
dividend of 5.55 pence per ordinary 
share (2014 – 5.00 pence) giving 
a full year dividend of 7.80 pence 
(2014 – 7.15 pence), an increase 
of 9% on 2014. The dividend is 
covered 2.6 times by underlying 
earnings and will be paid on 22 
December 2015 to shareholders  
on the register at 27 November 
2015, with an ex-dividend date  
of 26 November 2015.
Pensions
The Trustees of the Group’s 
deﬁned beneﬁts pension scheme 
completed an actuarial valuation of 
the Scheme as at 30 April 2013 that 
was updated to 31 July 2015. The 
Group will continue to make deﬁcit 
Underlying proﬁt from operations  
in our Strategic Marketing segment 
increased by 38% from £11.8 million 
to £16.3 million with an operating 
margin of 15% (2014 – 14%). This 
includes full year contributions from 
Realise Limited and The Health Hive 
Group Limited, which were acquired 
in the prior year and a contribution 
from Solstice which was acquired 
in March 2015. The improvement 
in operating margin has been as a 
result of the acquisition of higher 
margin businesses and the change 
of mix within our Data businesses 
where although the revenue has 
decreased, underlying operating 
proﬁt has been maintained.
Underlying proﬁt from operations  
in our Marketing Activation segment 
has decreased by 4% from  
£11.4 million to £10.9 million with 
an operating margin of 7% (2014 
– 7%). Despite the fall in revenue 
the Group was able to maintain 
its operating margin through a 
combination of further rationalisation 
and improved efﬁciency. During the 
period the Group closed its print 
operation at its Burnley site and to 
improve efﬁciency transferred some 
operations and equipment to other 
Group sites to improve efﬁciency. 
The cost of £1,297,000 is recorded 
as a non-underlying item (note 8).
Underlying proﬁt from operations 
in our Books segment decreased 
by 4% from £8.4 million to £8.1 
million with an operating margin of 
12% (2014 – 13%). In March 2015 
the Book business entered into a 
multi-year contract with Penguin 
Random House to produce all of its 
UK monochrome books. The transfer 
of production from the previous 
supplier is split into two tranches; 
the ﬁrst took place in January 
2015; and the ﬁnal tranche will be 
transferred in January 2016. As a 
result of this increased business, we 
have invested in additional equipment 
and people to fulﬁl the contract.

FOR CLIENTS
Marketing Activation houses  
Service Graphics, SP Group 
(including The Shop), SIMS and 
Tactical Solutions. It is overseen by 
Group MD – Marketing Activation, 
Nick Cole, who was a graduate 
trainee in his ﬁrst stint at St Ives, 
later returning to lead all of its non-
books print businesses. He says: 
“the companies were having more 
and more opportunities to work 
closer together. From a Group and 
client perspective it made sense 
to pull them into one place to offer 
limitless capacity, at the right price. 
Print has been commoditised, so 
we need to provide end-to-end 
marketing activation solutions, 
throughout and across the supply 
chain.” Clients such as HSBC, 
Adidas and Holland & Barrett are 
seeing greater efﬁciencies and 
return on investment through 
this tailored approach.
Nick believes that the market  
is demanding changes to traditional 
print manufacturing operations, 
seeking strategic partners rather 
than print managers. He adds: 
“clients have begun to organise 
around a less siloed approach,  
with job roles arranged at a 
campaign level. So, if someone  
is responsible for delivering 
campaigns through direct mail, 
in-store or digital media, they 
would prefer to have a one-stop 
shop to help manage their budget. 
If you can do everything in one 
place it saves time and money 
in comparison to using several 
suppliers. We can effectively 
manage integrated solutions to 
make campaigns more efﬁcient  
and cohesive.”
Marketing Activation is a cash-
generative, proﬁt-making part  
of the Group. A senior leadership 
team of Managing Directors and 
cross-divisional specialists is 
in place with joint responsibility 
St Ives remains one of the leading 
marketing communications 
agencies providing high-volume,  
in-store Point-of-Sale and large 
format print; mass and tailored  
one-to-one direct mail; ﬁeld 
marketing expertise; and asset  
and procurement management.  
The launch of the Group’s Marketing 
Activation segment gives clients 
the beneﬁt of its print companies 
working closer together to provide  
a market-leading range of solutions.
 
for managing the segment’s 
proposition across all of its 
businesses and focusing  
on growing client revenues. 
Growth is expected from the 
identiﬁcation of opportunities  
to aid exceptional client delivery 
and add value either up, down  
or across the supply chain.  
Nick says: “one business can 
open up other opportunities,  
not just within Marketing 
Activation but for the Strategic 
Marketing businesses too.  
We identify potential solutions 
that add value for the client  
and for the Group.”
Alongside organic growth, 
international client work is 
becoming more important,  
with a number of clients 
providing briefs for several 
European countries. Meanwhile,  
the inception of creative 
department, The Shop, within  
SP Group has proved successful. 
Nick adds: “it has given us a 
solution that can translate the 
client’s creative asset across all 
below-the-line channels. From 
a standing start two years ago 
it’s now generating healthy 
revenues.”
Nick’s vision is to set out  
a single Marketing Activation 
proposition, widely known  
in the market, creating new 
revenue opportunities and 
allowing clients to beneﬁt  
from the model. He concludes: 
“launching a hybrid model  
can be culturally challenging,  
but the results are beginning 
to speak for themselves. In a 
dynamic market it will always  
be vital to continue to focus  
on what the client needs.”
The companies were having more and 
more opportunities to work closer 
together. From a Group and client 
perspective it made sense to pull 
them into one place to offer limitless 
capacity, at the right price. Print 
has been commoditised, so we need 
to provide end-to-end marketing 
activation solutions, throughout and 
across the supply chain.

ADAPTING 
TO CHANGE
Publishing has undergone  
seismic changes in recent years 
and St Ives’ 200-year-old books 
business Clays continues to adapt 
to suit the needs of its clients. 
The company’s evolution is being 
driven by changes in technology, 
processes and, inevitably, culture.
Clays is a UK market-leader  
in book printing, from best- 
selling ﬁction to academic journals. 
It is a core part of St Ives’ portfolio 
of businesses, and represents 
another source of cash generation 
and proﬁt as the Group continues 
to expand. Clays sits separately in 
the Books segment of the Group, 
operating very different processes 
to companies within Marketing 
Activation and Strategic  
Marketing, yet collaborates with 
those businesses as required  
to service clients.
Managing Director Paul Hulley 
oversees the 700-strong workforce 
at Clays’ 90-acre site in Bungay, 
Suffolk. Paul, an experienced leader 
in supply chain operations and 
transformation, has spent almost 
two years in the role, continuing 
to modernise equipment and 
processes. A large part of his 
strategy has been to ensure 
employees who are used to  
very traditional processes become 
more agile in the way they think  
and work. Clays typiﬁes the Group’s 
‘low-ego, high-integrity’ ethos,  
with Paul keen to support staff 
to make these transitions as the 
business writes a new chapter  
in its long and successful history. 
He says: “offering a broader range 
of services, for example printing 
500,000 books in a few weeks 
right down to a single copy for 
one consumer overnight, involves 
adapting the culture and behaviour 
of the people who are using the 
new technology.
“Success is as much about their 
mindset as it is about systems 
and workﬂows. Understanding 
the differing demands of modern 
publishing is a learning curve  
for us all. The culture here has 
always been strong, it just needed 
to adapt. We’re now starting to  
see that strategy bear fruit.” 
Clays has invested heavily in  
digital technology to complement  
its traditional litho platform,  
using scalable inkjet printing  
to ﬁt in short runs alongside 
high-volume orders. The ongoing 
modernisation is helping Clays  
to secure and successfully 
service its customers. This year, 
it celebrated the extension and 
renewal of a major monochrome 
printing contract with Penguin 
Random House (‘PRH’). The  
agility demonstrated through  
new equipment and processes  
was a key element in securing  
the PRH deal. 
Paul is adamant the physical book 
still has a major place in the modern 
world and points to a ﬂattening 
of e-reader and digital book sales 
as evidence Clays can and will 
continue to support the printed 
page, while focusing on clients’ 
speciﬁc requirements. Innovation  
is also key to keeping up with 
industry changes. He observes: 
“lots of different types of content 
are being delivered across an 
omnichannel landscape. Expert 
customer care and delivery are as 
much a critical part of that for the 
physical book as they are for any 
other format.
“We’ve got to stay on top of supply 
chain evolution on behalf of our 
customers. That evolution can  
be hard to predict. If we conﬁdently 
provide the right layers of service  
for the physical books market,  
our clients will also remain conﬁdent. 
We have to take into account 
developments in the publishing 
landscape as well. For instance, 
we’ve recently introduced a self-
publishing service that is seeing 
rapid volume growth.”
In Paul’s view, Clays is a logistics 
business capable of getting small 
batches of books into shops or 
single copies to consumers at high 
speed. He explains: “this minimises 
the need to hold large amounts of 
stock in a warehouse, increasing 
efﬁciency while ensuring availability.” 
He says the company distributes 
half of the books it makes directly  
to retailers, but also consolidates 
runs from overseas printers to 
speed arrival on retail shelf.
Clays aims to extend its logistics 
offering by taking more ownership  
of the decision-making process. 
Paul describes this as “the 
publisher’s reprint management 
transitioning to an inventory 
Offering a broader range of services, 
for example printing 500,000 books 
in a few weeks right down to a single 
copy for one consumer overnight, 
involves adapting the culture and 
behaviour of the people who are  
using the new technology.

Managing Director – Clays
management capability, enabled 
and supported at Clays as 
we understand demand and 
collaborate with our clients  
for smart and timely decisions.” 
Customers are already buying 
into the concept and are keen  
for it to be rolled out.
The next year will see Clays  
hone its skills to become a  
slicker operation as it learns  
from the challenges and 
investment of the last few years. 
To that end, the business has 
employed its ﬁrst performance 
improvement technician to ensure 
processes are robust across  
all levels of service.
Meanwhile, further change 
lies ahead with the proposed 
installation of equipment to enable 
full-colour book printing within the 
next twelve months. Turning over 
a new leaf is not always easy in 
business, but Clays is ready to 
write the next chapter in its story.

OUR RISKS
STRATEGIC REPORT  
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Group’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives 
and implement its business model may be affected  
by a number of risks and uncertainties, some of 
which are beyond its control. The Group’s risk 
management framework is discussed on page 31.
A Group Risk Register is reviewed 
by the Audit Committee and the 
Board twice-yearly. It includes risks 
which are specific to the Group 
and risks escalated from the risk 
registers of individual subsidiaries 
where they might have a material 
affect on the Group as a whole.
In preparation for reporting on 
risk management for 2015/2016 
under the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board 
conducted a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the 
Group and reduced the number 
of risks reported on, below. In so 
doing, the Board has recognised 
that a number of risks reported 
on previously do not represent 
principal risks as defined under 
the new Code that could, 
specifically, inhibit the Group  
in achieving its strategic  
objectives. The principal risks  
in the following table fall into the 
following categories – Strategic, 
External, Organisational, Financial 
and Reputational. The possible 
consequences of each and 
examples of mitigating actions  
are set out below.
During the year, the processes  
put in place to mitigate the  
potential impact of these risks

were effective, and none of them

to, as necessary, refresh and adapt the Group’s strategy for delivering growth. 
Periodic visits by Internal Audit. Meetings held with senior management of the 
subsidiaries to determine cross-selling opportunities.
Organic growth, including overseas expansion, may not be pursued in the right 
sectors or territories which may result in significant incremental costs to the Group.
Regular discussion of strategy at Board meetings and meetings of representatives 
from the businesses to develop the Group’s proposition and growth opportunities 
and collaborative behaviour. Detailed budgets and three year plans are submitted 
to the Board for review.
Issues arising within Marketing Activation and Books may distract or inhibit  
the Board’s focus on growth within the Strategic Marketing segment.
Consolidation of businesses and management within the Marketing Activation 
segment has created greater synergies with a senior management team across  
the segment that oversees each of the subsidiaries. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Occam’s TrekFest is an 
endurance trekking challenge 
organised and run by Global 
Adventure Challenges. Their goal 
is to help individuals to realise their 
ambitions whilst raising money for 
UK charities. After hearing about 
the 2015 TrekFest challenge in the 
Brecon Beacons, Occam fielded 
two teams as employees seized 
the opportunity to stretch their 
legs, test their limits and raise 
money for a good cause. It took 
them no time at all to decide to 
support Cancer Research UK. 
Challenge: 54 miles in 24 hours
“After reaching the high point  
of Pen-Y-Fan, the highest point  
in Snowdonia at 886 metres,  
a tough climb through 30 mph 
winds, the first team got into its 
stride averaging 3.6 mph between 
the 27 and 40-mile markers.
“As darkness fell they soon found  
out that the light of four head 
torches did little to pierce the 
Brecon night but a good rate of 
progress was maintained. The 
torches proved more effective 
at the rest point in helping to 
illuminate the laudable efforts of  
the local Mountain Rescue Team to 
get the feet of all 170 of the 54-mile 
trekkers in good enough shape to 
set off once again.
“After having one team member  
drop out at the 48 mile mark on 
doctor’s orders, the remaining  
three struggled on through the 
dawn to the finish, crossing the 
line at 5.07 am – 20 hrs at a 
respectable average speed of  
2.8 mph – to the rousing cheers 
from a ‘welcoming’ committee.
“The adventure resulted in a failed 
knee, four pairs of very bruised and 
blistered feet, several packs of used 
blister plasters and a few metres of 
strapping tape, but this was more 
than out-weighed by a massive 
sense of achievement. Would the 
team do it again? No comment!”
(Grant Williams – Occam)
Challenge: 13 miles in six hours
“As a team of eight we set off  
on the shorter 13 mile trek after 
cheering on the 54 mile team.  
We initially kept a fairly brisk pace 
as we enjoyed a picturesque stroll 
along the Brecon canals, heading 
towards Talybont and arriving 
at the seven-mile checkpoint 
together and in good spirits.  
After a short stop to refill water 
bottles and consume a few cereal 
bars and sweets, the team split 
into smaller groups to complete 
the return leg.
 
“All eight of us made it back to 
the TrekFest basecamp within 
15 minutes of one another, with 
the first group back after a 
respectable time of four hours and 
30 minutes. We were welcomed 
back with a glass of cold bubbly, 
Welsh cakes and a tasty buffet 
lunch – all very pleased with  
our accomplishment and that 
we’d raised some money for  
a really good cause.”
(Ryan Mazi Thomas – Occam)
St Ives funded entry fees and 
matched generous donations from 
colleagues and friends, raising  
a total in excess of £3,100.
Our relationships  
with stakeholders
The Board recognises that,  
in managing the Group’s activities,  
it has responsibilities to a broad 
range of stakeholders.
In this report we outline how we 
seek to meet these responsibilities 
and measure the Group’s 
performance, now and in the future. 
The Group has had no human rights 
issues and has issued no policies 
that need to be disclosed for an 
understanding of the development, 
performance or position of the 
Group’s business.
FOCUS:  
OCCAM’S TREKFEST CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 27
STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
How we are performing
We measure: gender split, overall, 
within senior management and  
at Board level; voluntary employee 
turnover; sickness absence  
and absence from work due  
to accidents or work-related  
illness. Each subsidiary applies 
appraisal systems relevant to  
their business and identifies  
training needs, as they arise. 
Charitable donations
In addition to focusing on one 
or two themes or projects each 
year, the Group favours making 
donations to a broad range of 
charities. Donations are usually 
made in cash but may include  
the provision of time and materials 
to provide added value services  
for charities.
What we are doing
The Group supports charities  
in four ways: by setting and  
then donating an annual budget  
to charities serving communities  
in which the Group operates  
or to which employees or clients 
have a particular affinity; matching 
the total contribution made by 
the Chairman from foregoing a 
proportion of his fees; supporting 
fun fund-raising events for  
charities nominated by employees, 
and, finally, adopting a particular 
charitable project each year.  
This year we directed 35%  
of the Group’s total donation  
to cancer research, treatment  
and patient support (see below).
How we are performing
During the year the Group donated 
a total of £55,747 (2014 – £54,920)  
to 60 charities. In addition to 
focusing this year on cancer-related 
charities in particular, donations  
of varying sums were made to  
a wide spectrum of other charities 
including: the Alzheimer’s Society; 
Contact the Elderly; DEBRA 
(which supports individuals and 
families affected by Epidermolysis 
Bullosagenetic – a skin condition 
which causes the skin to blister  
and tear at the slightest touch); 
Great Ormond Street Hospital;  
Help the Burmese Delta (completing 
the Group’s three-year commitment 
to funding the building of two 
schools); Special Effect (which  
uses video games and technology 
to enhance the quality of life of 
people with disabilities); and the 
Stroke Association.
Shareholder relations
The Board attaches considerable 
importance to maintaining good 
relationships with shareholders. 
Effective two-way communication 
with institutional shareholders and 
analysts is established through 
regular presentations involving  
the Chief Executive Officer and  
the Chief Financial Officer. 
What we are doing
The Board receives an investor 
relations report at each of its regular 
meetings. The Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer conduct bi-annual analysts’ 
briefings and, where appropriate, 
meet with the Company’s major 
shareholders to further explain  
the Group’s investment proposition.  
A number of major shareholders 
have accepted the opportunities 
to meet with the Non-Executive 
Directors.
How we are performing
The Company’s top 20  
shareholders hold approximately 
67% (2014 – 69%) of the 
Company’s issued share capital. 
Those which have an obligation to 
notify the Company of their voting 
interests are shown on page 55. 
The Annual General Meeting 
is regarded as an opportunity 
to communicate directly with 
shareholders and the Chair 
of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees will  
each be available at the meeting  
to answer shareholders’ questions.
Employees
The Group is an Equal Opportunities 
Employer and no job applicant or 
employee receives less favourable 
treatment on the grounds of age, 
sex, marital status, race, colour, 
religion or belief. Individuals with 
disabilities, whether registered 
disabled or not, receive full and  
fair consideration for all job 
vacancies for which they are 
suitable applicants. Employees  
who become disabled during  
their working life will be retained  
in employment wherever possible 
and will be given help with 
necessary rehabilitation and 
retraining. Wherever practicable  
the Group will modify procedures  
or equipment so that full use can  
be made of an individual’s ability.
What we are doing
The Group seeks to pay 
its employees competitive 
remuneration packages and 
incentives. We operate a Dignity 
at Work Policy to ensure that 
the Group provides a working 
environment free from harassment 
and bullying and in which 
employees do not behave  
in a manner which may be  
offensive to others. 
By gender, the Group’s employees 
are 69% male (2014 – 70%) and 
31% female (2014 – 30%); its  
senior management is 63% male 
(2014 – 66%) and 37% female 
(2014 – 34%); and the Board is 
made up of 83% male and 17% 
female (unchanged since 2014). 
Employees are regularly consulted 
by local managers and kept 
informed of matters affecting them 
and the overall development of 
the Group. This is supplemented 
by regular emails and other 
communications from the CEO on 
how the Group is performing, plans 
for the future and how individuals 
can contribute to achieving the 
Group’s aims. Details of the Group’s 
pension schemes are set out in  
note 28 to the financial statements.
Clients and suppliers
In its dealings with clients and 
suppliers, the Group adheres  
to an Ethical Trading Policy. 
What we are doing
All subsidiaries report on how  
they manage their relationships  
with key clients. Their CEO or 
Managing Director, as the case  
may be, has signed up to the 
Group’s Anti-corruption and Bribery 
Policy which, together with the 
Ethical Trading Policy, is publicised 
to all employees.
The Group deals with its clients 
and suppliers on an arm’s length 
commercial basis, delivering 
consistency and reliability of service 
and quality. No client is tied in 
to an agreement that cannot be 
terminated in the event of under-
performance. 
Payment terms granted to clients 
are negotiated according to the 
amount at risk and the financial 
strength of the client concerned. 
It is the Group’s practice to 
agree payment terms with all 
suppliers, which will be adhered 
to, provided that they perform in 
accordance with the agreed terms. 
It is a disciplinary offence for any 
employee to breach the Group’s 
Anti-corruption and Bribery Policy. 
How we are performing
The average creditor days 
outstanding at 31 July 2015  
for the Group was 76 days  
(2014 – 73 days). The Company 
Secretary maintains a Bribery  
Risk Register which is refreshed 
annually and then reviewed by the 
Board together with a report from 
the Head of Internal Audit and  
the Company Secretary on how  
the Group’s Anti-corruption and 
Bribery Policy has been applied 
during the year. 28 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
How we are performing
The charts show the Group’s  
Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO
2
e 
emissions and our CO
2
e intensity 
measure (which is grams of CO
2
e 
per £ of revenue). The CO
2
e 
emissions performance of each 
reporting segment – Strategic 
Marketing, Marketing Activation  
and Books – are also disclosed.
The Group chart shows 
improvement, year on year,  
which is driven by an improved 
performance in the Marketing 
Activation segment. This is due  
to the exclusion of the Bradford  
site (two months’ production 
consumption having been  
included in the performance  
for 2013/2014) and the closure  
of the Burnley production  
facility during 2014/2015.
The other two segments have 
shown a year on year increase in 
emissions. The Books segment 
shows an increase following 
a correction to one of the fuel 
conversion factors used. Applying 
the prior year factor would, 
however, have shown Books’ 
emissions to be lower than last 
year, at 8.6 thousand tonnes’ CO
2
e. 
The rise in Strategic Marketing’s 
emissions follows the inclusion of 
Hive and Realise for the first time, 
having been acquired last year.  
This segment represents only 3%  
of the Group’s overall emissions.
Two further charts show that the 
Group’s waste sent to landfill has 
continued to fall and is approaching 
a level of relative immateriality 
which will prompt a review of 
how we measure and report on 
waste in future. The Group’s water 
consumption continues to follow  
a downward trend.
The Group’s Environmental  
Policy and further information 
about the Group’s environmental 
performance during 2014/2015  
can be viewed on the Group’s 
website from 30 October 2015.
Environment
St Ives is committed to continuous 
improvement in its environmental 
performance and accepts that 
its responsibilities with regard to 
environmental protection rank 
equally in importance with other key 
business objectives. The Board is 
responsible for setting the Group’s 
Environmental Policy.
What we are doing
We continually monitor and  
work to reduce the Group’s  
carbon emissions, waste sent to 
landfill and water consumption.
What we report
We report our CO
2
e emissions in 
line with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013. In doing so 
we have adopted the following 
methodology:
a) An operational boundary 
approach has been applied on 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 
in the UK using DEFRA’s Standard 
Set conversion factors for 2015.
b) Where actual energy 
consumption data cannot be 
obtained we have estimated 
emissions, pro-rata, based on 
the data recorded by similar 
sites in the Group. Using this 
methodology the estimated 
emissions from these sites 
equate to 0.3% of the Group’s  
total emissions. 
c) Scope 3 Emissions are not 
reported on as they are outside 
our operational control. The 
Board will, however, keep this 
under review.
d) This reporting year’s emissions 
from Solstice are excluded as we 
have yet to finalise the processes 
required to obtain reliable data  
for this new subsidiary.

“Alison and I have now completed 
our seven day ‘Fire & Ice’ Trek 
across Iceland for Great Ormond 
Street Children’s Hospital. We flew 
back on Wednesday evening, and 
aside from a few aching limbs, 
we are pleased to say injuries 
sustained by the team were 
minimal! 
 
“It was a very challenging trek, 
through a lot of snow and in some 
very chilly temperatures! Throw in 
a few volcanoes, lava fields, a lot

way!), and we all made it to the 
finish line. 
Health and Safety 
The Board regards the health and 
safety of the Group’s employees 
while they are at work as a  
pre-eminent duty.
What we are doing
The Board ensures that 
responsibilities for Health and  
Safety are properly assigned, 
accepted and fulfilled within the 
organisation. A Statement of the 
Board’s approach to Health and 
Safety is publicised at all of the 
Group’s sites and each subsidiary 
company’s CEO or Managing 
Director, as appropriate, has 
formally acknowledged their 
role in ensuring that managers 
and employees at each site are 
adequately conversant with their 
legal duties under health and  
safety legislation.
 
The first item on the agenda  
for each parent Board meeting  
is to receive a report on Health  
and Safety-related KPIs, selected  
to measure and manage the 
Group’s Health and Safety 
performance, which are as follows:
• monthly and cumulative  
statistics on near misses,  
all lost time accidents and 
Reportable Accidents; the 
Group’s Accident Frequency 
Rate, the Group’s Injury Incidence 
Rate and a report on employment 
liability insurance claims;
• the circumstances of any 
Reportable Accidents and 
management action taken as a 
result are also considered; and
• Group initiatives for improving 
Health and Safety performance.
The Group operates a bespoke  
on-line Health and Safety 
Management System for:
• reporting accidents and near 
miss incidents;
• hosting a Health and Safety 
document library; and
• applying standards of 
accreditation to contractors  
who apply for consent to work  
at our sites.
A driver safety awareness 
programme is in place throughout 
the Group which is an important 
part of managing Tactical Solutions’ 
motor vehicles which are driven  
by its field marketing staff. 
 
How we are performing
The total number of accidents  
at the Group’s sites for the year 
ended 31 July 2015 which resulted 
in at least seven days’ absence 
each was three (2014 – eleven) and 
the number of days’ work lost from 
all accidents at work was 282 days 
(2014 – 447). We recorded 1,347 
‘near miss’ events during the year 
(2014 – 1,250).
A copy of the Group’s Health  
and Safety Policy and performance 
data for 2014/2015 will be made 
available on the Group’s website 
from 30 October 2015.

Dear Shareholder
The Board invests a significant amount of time on maintaining high standards of governance, in recognition of the value that sound corporate 
governance can add to the success and sustainability of the Group’s business. I am pleased, therefore, to introduce our Corporate Governance Report 
for the 52 weeks ended 31 July 2015 (‘the period’), which includes individual reports from the Chair of each of the Audit Committee, Nomination 
Committee and Remuneration Committee on pages 34 to 39).
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS MEMBERSHIP
The Board’s membership throughout the period and the Directors’ attendance at pre-arranged meetings of the Board is set out in the table opposite  
on page 31. 
The Board meets at regular intervals and is responsible to the shareholders for overall Group strategy, acquisitions and divestments, major capital 
projects, risk and financial matters. Senior executives within the Group make regular presentations to the Board to apprise the Directors on their markets 
and how they serve them, growth opportunities and future challenges and how they propose to address them. All Directors receive agendas and papers 
in advance of each meeting, detailed minutes are recorded and actions followed up.
It is the opinion of the Board that, throughout the period, each of the Company’s Non-Executive Directors was independent for corporate governance 
purposes and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of his or her judgement. In reaching this 
opinion, the Board has carefully considered potential conflicts of interest and the balance between applying good practice and what it believes is in 
the shareholders’ best interests. The Non-Executive Directors have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities, which are appropriately 
documented. The Non-Executive Directors met during the period, without any Group executive being present. Mike Butterworth fulfilled the role of  
Senior Independent Director.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and distinct and an appropriate division of responsibilities between the two has  
been set out in writing and approved by the Board. The Chairman has responsibility for the management of the Board and related matters whilst  
the Chief Executive Officer has responsibility for overall executive leadership of the Group, overall responsibility for strategy implementation and profit. 
The Company’s articles of association set out detailed provisions for the retirement of Directors and their re-appointment or appointment at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Although not required under the Code, all of the Directors have, however, voluntarily agreed to retire at the 2015 
Annual General Meeting and seek re-election.
BOARD ACTIVITY
During the period, the Board carried out a review of matters reserved to it for decision. The Executive Directors meet regularly with the chief executive 
officers and managing directors of the subsidiaries within the Group’s business segments to discuss major customers, sales growth (including cross 
selling opportunities), knowledge sharing, people issues and Group-wide procurement initiatives.
All Directors have full and timely access to all relevant information needed to enable them to properly discharge their responsibilities and have 
unrestricted access to other executives within the business to discuss any matter of concern to them. A procedure exists for Directors to seek 
independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties and to be reimbursed their reasonable legal fees and each has access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary. 
The areas of focus for the Board during the period were: Health and Safety performance; the Group’s growth strategy; the acquisition of Solstice 
Consulting LLC; the appraisal of other potential acquisitions; risk; and Governance and Board performance. The Board also held an annual strategic 
review away-day at which, inter alia, presentations were received from the Chief Executives of the Group’s Strategic Marketing businesses from which 
significant organic growth has been targeted.
BOARD PERFORMANCE
The Board confirms, following a performance review, that all of the Directors standing for re-election continue to perform effectively and demonstrate 
commitment to their roles.
Having last year undertaken a formal evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board with support from a third party consultancy, The People Stuff, this year 
the evaluation was conducted on a less formal basis, taking the form of one-to-one interviews between the Chairman and each Director. The Board is 
satisfied that the Board is operating effectively and agreed to implement a number of recommendations that arose from the interviews. The Board has 
engaged The People Stuff to facilitate the 2015/2016 evaluation. Interviews with the Directors and the Company Secretary have been conducted and 
actions will be debated and agreed by the full Board.
On appointment, each Director receives an induction appropriate to their previous experience as a Director and their knowledge of the markets in which 
the Group operates.
BOARD COMMITTEES
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees of the Board existed throughout the period, each of which is serviced by the Company Secretary from 
whom copies of the terms of reference for these committees can be obtained or may be viewed on the Group’s corporate website (www.st-ives.co.uk). 
The Audit Committee Report on pages 34 to 36 discusses the principal activities conducted by the Committee during the period and significant financial 
matters which were considered by the Committee and actions taken in respect of these. 
A report on the work of the Nomination Committee is set out on page 37.
A Statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee and the Directors’ Remuneration Report can be found on pages 38 to 53.
Evaluations of the effectiveness of the Board’s Committees were carried out during the period and the outcome in each case was that they were deemed 
effective in carrying out their terms of reference and recommendations arising from the evaluations will be implemented. 
The membership of each Committee throughout the period under review is commented on in the aforementioned reports.

INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group has in place a corporate reporting and risk management framework in compliance with Principle C3 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(September 2012) (‘the Code’) after having due regard to the Financial Reporting Council Guidance.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control, including ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls and risk management, and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. A workable and realistic system can only be designed to manage and mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and, therefore, can only provide a reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Directors consider themselves collectively responsible for ensuring that strategic, market, operational, ﬁnancial and legislative, regulatory, contractual 
and reputational risks are suitably managed and are referred to the Board, as necessary. 
The Group recognises that taking and managing risks is inherent in any business and in delivering its strategy. On pages 24 and 25 we set out the 
principal risks and uncertainties that have been identiﬁed from the reporting and risk management framework; their possible impact on the business;  
and what mitigating actions the Board has approved.
The Board carries out reviews twice per annum, both from a top-down and bottom-up perspective, and considers the impact that these principal risks 
might have on the business and on the Group’s ability to meet its strategic objectives. 
The process by which the Board exercises control is by holding (a) nine scheduled Board meetings per annum; (b) regular meetings of senior 
management drawn from each of the Strategic Marketing, Marketing Activation and Books segments which are chaired by an Executive Director; and  
(c) regular management meetings of each operation within these segments. Risk is reported on and monitored with senior management and any new 
areas of signiﬁcant risk to the businesses are then raised at the next meeting of the Board if considered appropriate. 
The Group’s Internal Audit function consists of two qualiﬁed accountants who, as necessary, draw on additional resource from professional services 
ﬁrms. The work planned for the Internal Audit team to undertake is linked closely to the risk management framework, with the internal audit plan 
designed to give assurance around key risk areas.
During the period the Internal Audit function performed work on the Group’s internal controls; reviewing the control environment and the testing of those 
controls. Controls testing of procurement, accounts payable, payroll, accounts receivable and credit control cycles took place at selected sites, including 
work at the Group’s shared services centre which provides centralised accounts payable, credit control and general ledger services to a number of the 
Group’s companies. 
Annual internal control questionnaires, supplemented by a half year questionnaire, are completed by all the Group’s businesses and reviewed by the 
Company Secretary and Head of Internal Audit. Any inconsistencies with the Group’s established corporate governance regimes which are identiﬁed  
are disclosed to the Audit Committee.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Company is required to comply with the Code, to the extent that it applies to ‘small-cap’ companies, or explain the reasons for non-compliance.  
The Code can be read in full on the Financial Reporting Council’s website (www.frc.org.uk).
In the opinion of the Board the Company has, with the exception of Code Provision E.2.4 (timing of the mailing of Notice and accompanying documents 
to shareholders), throughout the 52 weeks ended 31 July 2015 been in compliance with the Code. The non-compliance arose from having to reprint the 
Annual Report and Accounts for 2014, printed by a third party which, despite using the same paper and inks as those used the previous year, resulted in 
a product of unacceptable quality. The document was reprinted on different paper and the mailing to shareholders was completed on 4 November 2014, 
within the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Company’s articles of association, but three calendar days later than that provided under 
the Code. In future, proof copies will be examined to ensure, at an early stage, the product is of acceptable quality. 
This Corporate Governance Report, together with the reports on pages 34 to 57, describes how the Board has applied the other Main and Supporting 
Principles contained in the Code and, where appropriate, where it has adopted elements of corporate governance good practice.

6 October 2015
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present a report on the role of the Audit Committee and its activity during the period ended 31 July 2015.
CURRENT MEMBERSHIP 
I chair the Committee and bring recent and relevant financial experience to it, having served as Chief Financial Officer of a FTSE250 company for eight 
years until December 2012. Throughout the period under review and the current financial year to date, the other members of the Committee were  
Ben Gordon and Helen Stevenson.
In addition to the Committee members, the Chairman and the Executive Directors of the Board and the Head of Internal Audit are invited to attend  
each meeting. The Committee members do, however, meet separately at least once a year with the external auditors and the Head of Internal Audit  
and I am in frequent contact with the external audit partner and the Head of Internal Audit.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee carries out the functions required by DTR 7.1.3R of the UKLA Disclosure and Transparency Rules. The principal responsibilities  
of the Committee are set out in the Committee’s terms of reference, which are available from the Group’s website: (www.st-ives.co.uk). 
MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE IN 2014/2015
The Committee held three scheduled meetings in the period at which it:
• agreed an internal audit plan;
• considered reports from the Group’s Head of Internal Audit;
• considered the appropriateness of the Group’s risk management process, including the results of an internal controls questionnaire, completed  
by management within the Group’s operating sites;
• considered the re-appointment of the external auditors, their reports to the Committee, their fees and their independence, including an assessment 
of the appropriateness to conduct any non-audit work;
• reviewed the Group’s trading updates and Half Year Report prior to release;
• considered significant accounting and reporting issues pertinent to the preparation of the Half Year Report and the Annual Report and Accounts;
• monitored and reviewed the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and the effectiveness of the external audit;
• conducted a review of the Committee’s effectiveness;
• regularly monitored the quality of work performed by the Internal Audit function;
• reviewed the Group’s Whistle Blowing Policy and the effectiveness of the Group’s Anti-corruption and Bribery Policy; 
• received a report setting out the Going Concern review undertaken by management; and
• undertook a review of the effectiveness of the external audit process by reviewing replies to questionnaires completed by the management and  
Audit Committee members.
ANNUAL REPORT 2014/2015
The Committee also undertook a review and assessment of the Annual Report 2014/2015 in order to determine whether, in its opinion, the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the period, taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides shareholders with the information they need  
to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. To provide additional support to the Board in making this assessment, the Committee 
approved and monitored an enhanced review and verification process of the Annual Report and Accounts undertaken by management and provided 
confirmation to the Board that this process was both followed and effective. In this respect, the Committee:
• received reports on the requirements of Provision C.1.1. of the Code, which were updated as an ongoing part of the year end process;
• reviewed a full draft of the Annual Report and Accounts, using an evaluation tool to help judge what constitutes ‘fair’, ‘balanced’ and 
‘understandable’; how performance is reported; the explanation of the business model; and the articulation of the Group’s strategy and whether  
the Annual Report and Accounts, in the opinion of the Committee, complies with Provision C.1.1. of the Code; and
• reviewed the outcomes of reviews performed by the external auditors.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 35
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ISSUES
The Committee has assessed whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether management has made appropriate estimates and 
judgements in respect of significant financial issues. The Committee considered accounting papers which provided details on the main financial reporting 
judgements, which were addressed as follows:
Significant matters considered How the Committee addressed these issues
The assessment of the carrying value  
of goodwill and intangible assets
The Committee received reports in relation to the assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill 
for each cash generating unit (‘CGU’). The Committee considered key judgements including the 
discount rate, long-term growth rate, and the projected future cash flows of each CGU to which 
goodwill and investments are allocated, based upon the projected financial plans approved by the 
Board. The conclusion of the review and the key assumptions are disclosed in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.
During the period, the Committee reviewed the impairment assessment of the acquired intangible 
assets and goodwill for Tactical Solutions that was carried out by management and concluded that 
an impairment charge of £1.5 million should be recorded in relation to the goodwill and customer 
relationship asset. The charge has been recorded as a non-underlying item in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
The classification of non-underlying items The Committee reviewed reports from management outlining the nature and size of each  
non-underlying item, and concluded that the items conformed to the Group’s accounting policy.
The valuation of the St Ives defined benefits 
pension scheme
The valuation of the St Ives defined benefits pension scheme is judgemental due to underlying 
assumptions in determining the discount rate, inflation and life expectancy for the Scheme as at the 
balance sheet date. The Committee reviewed reports from the management and from the Company’s 
and the Scheme’s actuaries outlining the assumptions used, and agreed with those assumptions.
The key judgements relating to the assumptions 
used in valuing the acquired intangible assets 
for acquisitions
The judgments largely relate to the assumptions used to derive the value of the acquired intangible 
assets. The Committee received and reviewed reports from management outlining the basis  
of the assumptions used including the discount rate, attrition rate, useful life and valuation  
of contributory assets.
GOING CONCERN
The Committee received a report setting out the Going Concern review undertaken by management that forms the basis of the Board’s going concern 
conclusion on page 54.
EXTERNAL AUDITORS
The external auditor’s appointment is reviewed regularly and, in accordance with the Auditing Practices Board standards, the Lead Audit Partner is 
rotated at least once every five years. A full tender process was last conducted by the Company in 2009 which resulted in Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’) 
being re-appointed. The current Lead Audit Partner has completed four annual audits. The Board continues to monitor any legal or regulatory changes 
proposed or made in the UK which affect Small Cap companies. There is no present intention to conduct an audit tender. 
The Committee’s policy, which was reconfirmed during the period, for determining the level of fees for non-audit services that the external auditor can 
provide is as follows: 
a) relevant ethical guidance shall be taken into account regarding any proposal to request the Group’s external auditors to perform non-audit services; 
b) it is inappropriate to set a fixed percentage balance between audit and non-audit fees paid to the Group’s external auditors for project work;
c) subject to (d) below, the Board shall appoint whoever, in its opinion, will provide the most cost effective and timely service for undertaking  
a particular project; and
d) the Chief Financial Officer is to consult with the Chairman of the Audit Committee in advance of any non-audit work in excess of £25,000 per project 
that the external auditor may be invited to perform for the Group, so that an agreed view might be taken on whether to put the project out to tender.
The Committee has satisfied itself that this policy has been appropriately applied. The split between audit and non-audit fees for the period is disclosed 
in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The non-audit fee was of a type and level that they are not considered by the Committee to 
compromise the objectivity and independence of Deloitte.  36 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The Committee also considered the robustness of Deloitte’s safeguards and procedures to counter threats or perceived threats to their objectivity, 
the application of their independence policies and their adherence to the Ethical Standards published by the Auditing Practices Board. In all these 
respects the Committee was satisfied with Deloitte’s objectivity and independence. The Committee is satisfied that there are no relationships between 
the Company and Deloitte, its employees or its affiliates that may reasonably be thought to impair the auditors’ objectivity and independence. Private 
meetings are held with Deloitte to ensure that no restrictions are placed on the scope of their audit and to offer the external auditor opportunities  
to discuss any items the auditors did not wish to raise with the executives being present.
A review of the effectiveness of the external audit for the 2013/2014 year end was performed during the period which involved the completion of  
two questionnaires containing assertions of ‘best practice’ – one by each member of the Audit Committee containing ten assertions – and another 
completed by the management of each subsidiary containing 15 assertions. The areas covered included: the audit team expertise and experience;  
the audit planning process; audit execution; communication; adding value; responsiveness; reporting; timeliness; and focus. Participants were  
requested to score each assertion between one and four to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement. The results were then reviewed by the 
Audit Committee and Chief Financial Officer before being discussed with the external auditors. The completed questionnaires showed in aggregate  
that the external audit had achieved a clear majority of the assertions in each area of focus. 
In the absence of any adverse findings as to the objectivity and independence and effectiveness of Deloitte, the Committee has recommended to the 
Board that Deloitte be re-appointed for 2015/2016.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 37
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
The Nomination Committee’s key role is to lead the process for Board appointments and make recommendations to the Board.
6 October 2015
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Nomination Committee, I am pleased to report to you on the work it undertook during the period ended 31 July 2015.
CURRENT MEMBERSHIP
The Board has decided that a Nomination Committee, consisting of all the serving Board Directors, is workable given the size of the Board and, indeed, 
desirable. All Directors are given an equal voice in deciding on the method for reaching a short list, nominating and deciding on the selection of new 
members of the Board. It is important to a small board such as ours that the process of selection is right to suit the particular circumstances and that 
any decision made to nominate a new member of the Board is unanimous. Directors interview all candidates for appointments which come under the 
auspices of the Nomination Committee.
The Board is aware of the increasing focus on the composition of boards and the emphasis on diversity and does not feel it appropriate to set targets  
for diversity in the boardroom or, in particular, to set a percentage of women it aspires to having on the Board. The Board has recognised, however,  
that diversity within the boardroom is important to the success of the business and the Committee seeks to reflect this view. 
The Group’s policy on affording equal opportunities to all employees and suitable applicants extends to the Board. Anyone appointed to the Board will, 
however, be selected on merit against objective criteria, taking into account the skills, expertise, and experience of the candidates.
When we look outside the Group to recruit we make clear that we are keen to consider candidates from all parts of the community in terms of gender, 
ethnicity, disability, age and so on. We intend to continue with this policy.
Our disclosure on diversity generally can be found on page 27 within the Strategic Report.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The principal role of the Committee is to consider and recommend to the Board candidates who are appropriate for appointment as Executive or  
Non-Executive Directors so as to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience represented on the Board and ensure that the Board  
is refreshed as appropriate.
MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE IN 2014/2015
During the period the Committee’s main tasks were to consider the composition of the Board and a Board level succession plan. 
In considering the composition of the Board, the Committee has recognised that the Group has undergone significant acceleration in the past four years 
in its transition: the continued implementation of our strategy by the acquisition of Strategic Marketing companies and the opening of overseas offices. 
Shape change will continue through further acquisition and, increasingly importantly, from organic growth and investment in the acquired businesses.
The Board already includes a wide spectrum of experience and expertise among its Non-Executive Directors. Notwithstanding this, however, the 
Committee has concluded that, given the challenges described above, the Board would benefit from the appointment of an additional Non-Executive 
Director who would add to the knowledge and capabilities of the existing Board members. With this in mind the Committee has approved a profile for 
the type of candidate to be sought and the selection process to be followed in finding the right person. The Board’s view on diversity will be taken into 
account during the selection process. Whilst such an appointment is regarded as beneficial in the longer term the appointment is not seen as being 
urgent, given the current composition of the Board. 
Following the promotion of Matt Armitage and Brad Gray to the positions, respectively, of Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, during the 
period the Committee started the process of formulating a succession plan in respect of the Executive Directors. A third party consultancy, The People 
Stuff, was engaged to perform a Talent Audit during the year which involved interviews with 15 senior employees in the Group. The purpose of the Talent 
Audit was to review the resources in place to help the Group deliver its overall strategy.
The Committee discharged its other principal duties by:
• ensuring that an appropriate review of Board, Committee and Director effectiveness was undertaken during the period;
• considering whether the Non-Executive Directors were sufficiently independent for corporate governance purposes;
• deciding on which Directors should retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting; and
• approving the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. 
The Committee’s priorities for 2015/2016 will be to progress the possible recruitment of a further Non-Executive Director and to finalise a Board level 
succession plan.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT 38 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The Remuneration Committee’s key role is to set the broad policy for remunerating the Executive Directors and recommend  
a remuneration policy which supports the creation of value for shareholders and the delivery of the Group’s strategic priorities.
6 October 2015 
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the period ended 31 July 2015 covering  
the remuneration of Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
Similar to last year, this report is split into three parts: this Annual Statement, a Policy Report and an Annual Report on Remuneration. As our 
remuneration policy for Directors is unchanged from that approved by shareholders at the November 2014 AGM, we have provided an abbreviated 
Policy Report to give context to decisions taken by the Committee during the year. The full Policy Report, as approved by shareholders, can be found  
in our 2014 Annual Report and Accounts available on the Company’s website. As required by legislation, we will be submitting this year’s Annual Report 
on Remuneration to an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting on 26 November 2015.
PERFORMANCE AND REWARD FOR 2014/2015
During the period we continued with the successful execution of our strategy to grow our Strategic Marketing segment. The acquisition of Chicago  
based Solstice has enhanced our digital and mobile marketing capability whilst supporting international expansion. Collaboration across the Group 
continues to strengthen with an increasing number of clients working with more than one business in the Group as our offering expands. 
Good progress has been made against the financial key performance indicators (KPIs), with underlying Group revenue increasing by 5%, underlying  
PBT increasing by 10% and underlying basic EPS increasing by 9%.
In light of the 2015 performance, Executive Directors will each receive bonuses of 69.7% (from a possible 100%) of basic salary. A summary of actual 
performance against the targets set is included on page 46. Consistent with the policy operated in prior years, any bonus earned which exceeds 50%  
of basic salary will be paid in shares which will be held in the Company’s employee benefit trust for two years.
The Annual Report on Remuneration also gives details of LTIP awards granted in November 2012 which are due to vest in November 2015, subject  
to achievement of the performance conditions. The Company’s underlying basic EPS performance in the final year of the three-year period ended  
31 July 2015 warranted 50% (from a possible 50%) vesting. Further details, together with comments on the Company’s Relative Total Shareholder 
Return performance to the start of September 2015 on which vesting of the remaining 50% of the award is dependent, are given on page 47.
IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2015/2016
During the year the Committee reviewed the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the November 2014 AGM, and concluded that the 
remuneration structure continues to be appropriate. Following consultation with the Company’s major shareholders, for 2015/2016 the Committee  
has introduced (i) a second performance measure to complement EPS for annual bonuses, in line with best practice, and (ii) an additional performance 
measure for the LTIP to help reinforce and accelerate delivery of the Company’s strategy. Further details of these changes are detailed below. 
In recent years, the Company has used underlying EPS as the sole performance measure for Executive Director annual bonuses. For 2015/2016,  
the Committee has supplemented EPS with an element on like-for-like growth in underlying revenues from the Strategic Marketing segment with a  
25% weighting, to reinforce organic growth in this area. To ensure these revenues are in shareholders’ interests, the Committee must be satisfied with 
the quality of revenue growth for this element to pay out, taking into account factors such as the gross margin arising from these additional revenues. 
LTIP grants in recent years have vested after three years based 50% on underlying EPS in the final year of the performance period, and 50% on three-
year relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’). The Committee has supplemented these measures with an element based on underlying operating profit 
from the Strategic Marketing segment, with a 25% weighting. This element will be based on the percentage of the Group’s underlying operating profit 
from the Group’s Strategic Marketing segment in the final year of the performance period, underpinned by the achievement of a minimum level of EPS. 
The Committee believes that this will reinforce and accelerate a reshaping of the portfolio towards the targeted growth area of Strategic Marketing.  
The weighting on underlying EPS will be reduced to 25% to accommodate this change and the balance (50% of the total LTIP award) will continue  
to vest on relative TSR, to further reinforce alignment with shareholder interests. 
As disclosed in last year’s report, the Committee increased the basic salaries of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively,  
to £400,000 per annum and £230,000 per annum effective 1 August 2015. In confirming these increases, the Committee took into account the  
strong performance of both Matt Armitage and Brad Gray since their appointment into their new roles and is satisfied that such increases are justified.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The report is also in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules and the relevant recommendations 
contained within the UK Corporate Governance Code (September 2012) (‘the Code’) relating to Directors’ remuneration and takes into account the 
views of our major shareholders. The legislation requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain disclosures contained in this 
Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
The sections, between pages 40 and 53, which are subject to audit have been highlighted.
POLICY REPORT
SUMMARY OF DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
St Ives’ remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 27 November 2014, and took effect from that date.  
We republish below the policy table from last year’s report, updated as necessary, to give context to decisions taken by the Committee during the year. 
The full policy report, as approved by shareholders can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts 2014 available on the Company’s website.
BASIC SALARY
Purpose and Link to Strategy Operation Maximum Potential Value Performance Metrics
To provide competitive fixed 
remuneration that will attract and 
retain key employees of a high 
calibre and which will reflect their 
experience and position in the 
Company.
Normally reviewed annually with 
increases effective from 1 August; 
salaries are paid monthly.
In setting salaries, the Committee 
takes into account the following:
• capability of the individual;
• any changes in responsibility;
• increases awarded across the 
workforce; and
• external economic factors such 
as inflation.
As described in last year’s report, 
the Executive Directors’ salaries 
effective 1 August 2015 are  
as follows:
• Chief Executive Officer:  
£400,000 p.a.; and
• Chief Financial Officer:  
£230,000 p.a.
Future increases will generally be  
in line with the range (in percentage 
of salary terms) awarded across  
the Group. 
In accordance with normal practice 
at all levels in all parts of the Group, 
increases above this level (in 
percentage of salary terms) may 
be made in certain circumstances 
such as where there is a change 
in responsibility or a significant 
increase in the scale of the role or 
size and complexity of the Group.
Not applicable.
BENEFITS
Purpose and Link to Strategy Operation Maximum Potential Value Performance Metrics
To provide market competitive, yet 
cost effective, benefits to attract 
and retain high calibre executives.
Benefits generally include provision 
of a car, fuel allowance and private 
medical and life assurance cover.
The Committee may introduce 
other ancillary benefits which are on 
similar terms to those offered to the 
wider workforce or required in order 
to remain market competitive.
Overseas recruitment or an 
international assignment may 
require the benefits package to 
be more tailored to reflect cultural 
norms and/or local legislation  
and may include relocation 
costs and/or tax equalisation

PENSION
Purpose and Link to Strategy Operation Maximum Potential Value Performance Metrics
To provide market competitive, yet 
cost-effective benefits, to act as a 
retention mechanism and long-term 
reward service.
Only basic salary is pensionable.
A company contribution to a 
defined contribution pension 
scheme, a personal pension or 
provision of a cash payment in  
lieu of a pension contribution  
(or combination of such) may be 
provided at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Up to 15% of basic salary. Not applicable.
ANNUAL BONUS
Purpose and Link to Strategy Operation Maximum Potential Value Performance Metrics
Incentivises achievement of annual 
objectives which support the short-
term performance goals of the 
Company.
At the start of each year the 
Committee determines the choice 
of annual bonus measures and 
targets to ensure they reflect the 
short-term KPIs of the business  
at that time.
Payments under the annual bonus 
plan are subject to:
• compulsory payment of any 
bonus earned over 50% of  
salary (on an after tax basis)  
in the Company’s shares under 
the Company Deferred Bonus 
Shares (‘DBS’) arrangement 
which are subject to a holding 
period of two years; and
• the element of the annual bonus 
paid in shares is subject to 
clawback provisions in the event 
of a material misstatement of the 
Company’s financial position.
Deferred shares will generally be 
forfeited if a Director leaves the 
Group (unless in certain good 
leaver situations or if the Committee 
determines otherwise).
Dividends and/or dividend 
equivalent are payable on the 
deferred bonus shares during  
the two year holding period.
100% of basic salary. Performance is measured over 
one financial year.
Bonus awards are subject to 
achievement against a sliding 
scale of challenging financial 
targets and may also be 
subject to challenging personal 
objectives. 
The majority of any bonus will be 
earned for achieving challenging 
financial targets aligned with the 
Company’s key performance 
indicators (e.g. underlying basic 
EPS). A minority may be subject 
to achieving pre-set personal 
objectives which reflect the key 
priorities of the role at the time.
Bonuses become payable once 
a threshold level of performance 
is achieved against the targets(s) 
which triggers a bonus payment 
of 25% of salary, rising to 
100% of salary for meeting 
(or exceeding) the maximum 
target(s) set. Measurement of 
financial metrics is made on the 
basis of audited figures. Where 
personal targets are set it may 
not always be practicable to set 
these using a sliding scale.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
Purpose and Link to Strategy Operation Maximum Potential Value Performance Metrics
Incentivises executives to achieve 
superior financial growth and 
returns to shareholders over the 
longer-term.
Provides alignment with 
shareholders through awards  
of shares.
Promotes retention of key 
individuals.
The Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’) was approved by 
shareholders in 2010.
Eligibility to receive awards is at  
the discretion of the Committee 
each year.
Awards are normally made on an 
annual basis and vest three years 
from grant subject to continued 
employment and the satisfaction of 
challenging three-year performance 
targets.
The Committee reviews the 
quantum of awards annually and 
monitors the continuing suitability  
of the performance measures. 
Participants benefit from the value 
of dividends paid over the vesting 
period to the extent that awards 
vest. This benefit is delivered in the 
form of cash or additional shares at 
the time that awards are exercised.
All Awards granted after November 
2013 are subject to clawback in the 
event of a material misstatement of 
the Company’s financial position.
Awards with a face value of up to 
125% of basic salary (or 200% if 
the Committee believes there are 
exceptional circumstances) can  
be made on an annual basis.
The Company operates within a 
10% in ten years ABI (new share 
issue) dilution limit.
Performance is measured over  
a three-year period.
A balanced approach to target 
setting is taken with at least 
half of an award subject to 
challenging financial targets linked 
to the Group’s key performance 
indicators (e.g. underlying basic 
EPS, targets set to reflect strategic 
objectives, etc.) with the balance 
of an award subject to a relative 
Total Shareholder Return measure.
25% of an award vests at 
threshold performance (0% vests 
below this), increasing pro-rata to 
100% for maximum performance.
Where TSR performance 
conditions are set, performance 
against the condition is monitored 
independently on the Committee’s 
behalf and where financial targets 
are set performance against the 
condition is tested based on 
numbers derived from the audited 
financial statements.

ALL-EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES
Purpose and Link to Strategy Operation Maximum Potential Value Performance Metrics
Encourages long-term shareholding 
in the Company.
Invitations made by the Committee 
under the Approved Sharesave 
Scheme.
Executive Directors may participate 
in a monthly savings contract on 
the same terms as other employees 
of the Group.
As per HMRC limits (e.g. current 
maximum monthly savings towards 
share purchases is limited to £500 
per calendar month).

SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
Purpose and Link to Strategy Operation Maximum Potential Value Performance Metrics
To provide alignment between 
executives and shareholders.
A shareholding of 200% of salary 
for the Chief Executive Officer and 
150% of salary for other Executive 
Directors is expected to be 
achieved over a period of five years 
commencing 1 August 2013 or 
date of appointment, if later.
50% of the net of tax number of 
deferred bonus shares or vested 
shares under the Company’s LTIP 
will normally be required to be 
retained until the guideline is met. 
The Committee may take account 
of progress towards this target 
when determining LTIP awards.
Not applicable. Not applicable.
Notes
1. While the remuneration policy for Executive Directors is designed having had regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole, there are some differences in the structure for  
senior employees which the Committee believes to be necessary to reflect the different levels of responsibility within the Company. The following key differences exist between the Company’s  
policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors and its approach to the payment of employees generally:
• there is an increased emphasis on performance related pay and, in particular, for share based incentives at the Executive Director level;
• eligibility to participate in and the maximum opportunity in relation to annual bonus vary, based on individual role and local practice;
• participation in the LTIP is limited to the Executive Directors and certain selected senior managers; and
• benefits offered to other employees vary by subsidiary to take account of relevant market conditions.
2. The share ownership guideline levels are detailed above. The shares that an Executive Director may count towards the shareholding guidelines include: those held in the name of the Director;  
those held in the name of the Director’s spouse, partner or children; any shares held in a family trust for the benefit of the Director and/or his/her spouse, partner or children; and any shares held  
in a personal pension plan on behalf of the Director. The Committee may, in its absolute discretion, approve the holding of shares by alternate means (e.g. shares held under a deferred share bonus 
award) and, if permitted, on such terms determined by the Committee, acting fairly and reasonably.
3. For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors (such as the 
payment of a pension or the vesting/exercise of past share awards) that have been disclosed to and approved by shareholders in previous remuneration reports. Details of any payments to former 
Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
4. The Committee operates the annual bonus, LTIP and Sharesave plans, in accordance with their rules, HMRC guidance and, where relevant, the Listing Rules. To ensure these incentive plans operate 
in an efficient manner, the Committee retains a number of standard market practice discretions which include:
• determining the eligibility to participate in the plans;
• determining the timing of grant of awards and any payments;
• the size of awards and payments, although with quantum restricted to those detailed in the table above and the respective plan rules;
• the determination of whether the performance conditions have been met and the resulting vesting/pay out; 
• dealing with a change of control (for example, the timing of testing performance targets) or restructuring of the Group;
• determining a good or bad leaver for incentive plan purposes, based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
• adjustments required in certain capital events such as rights issues, corporate restructuring, events and special dividends; and
• the annual review of performance conditions for the annual bonus plan and LTIP .
In some circumstances, such as a material acquisition/divestment of a Group business, or a change in Accounting Standards and Interpretations, which mean the original performance conditions  
are no longer appropriate, the Committee can adjust the targets, set different measures and alter weightings as necessary, to ensure the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially 
less difficult to satisfy. 44 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The following sets out the fee policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors:
Purpose and Link to Strategy Operation Maximum Potential Value Performance Metrics
To attract and retain high calibre 
individuals without prejudice to the 
application of independent views. 
Non-Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is decided by  
the Executive Directors and the 
Chairman; the Chairman’s fee is  
set separately by the Committee.
Fees are set periodically by  
taking account of the time required 
to fulfil the role and fees payable 
at similar sized companies. 
Any increases in fees also take 
account of any increases payable 
to Executive Directors and to the 
general workforce.
Non-Executive Directors may 
not participate in the Group’s 
cash or share-based incentive 
arrangements.
Non-Executive Directors also 
receive reimbursement of travel  
and office related expenses.
For 2015/2016, the fees comprise 
a base fee of £42,500 p.a. plus 
additional fees of £5,000 p.a. for 
the Senior Independent Director 
position and £7,500 p.a. for 
chairing the Remuneration and 
Audit Committees. The Chairman’s 
fee is set at £130,000 p.a. 
These fees may be revised 
periodically in line with the 
Company’s policy. Given the 
periodic nature of the review any 
increases (as a % of total fees)  
may be greater than that awarded 
to the wider workforce in any 
particular year. 
The maximum aggregate fees 
are set in accordance with the 
Company’s articles of association.
Not applicable.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
The following section provides details of how St Ives’ remuneration policy was implemented during 2014/2015.
MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMITTEE
Mike Butterworth, Ben Gordon and Helen Stevenson, all independent Non-Executive Directors, served on the Committee throughout the year. 
Helen Stevenson chaired the Committee throughout the year. The number of meetings held, attendances and a description of the principal matters 
considered by the Committee in carrying out its duties during the year are described on pages 31 and 45.
During the year under review, the Committee, where appropriate, sought advice and assistance from the Company Secretary and members of the 
Board, including the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer in connection with carrying out its duties.  
None of these persons took part in decisions relating specifically to their own remuneration.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the Board the overall remuneration policy and its implementation, 
including setting the individual remuneration packages and contractual arrangements for the Executive Directors, senior management and the 
Chairman of the Board which support the creation of value for shareholders and the delivery of the Group’s strategic priorities.
When undertaking its duties, the Committee ensures that due account is taken of pay and employment conditions throughout the Group by keeping 
abreast of matters such as (i) the general level of salary increases (if any) applied throughout the Group; (ii) the levels of bonuses paid (and bonus 
opportunity offered) to the workforce as a whole; and (iii) any widespread changes that are proposed to Group-wide employment conditions.
The full terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s website (www.st-ives.co.uk).
COMMITTEE’S ADVISERS
During the year, the Committee received advice on executive remuneration matters from Kepler Associates, a brand of Mercer which is part  
of the MMC group of companies (Kepler) and New Bridge Street (NBS), an Aon plc company. Kepler was appointed to the role of independent  
advisers to the Committee, in succession to NBS, following a competitive tendering process in early 2015. Both Kepler and NBS are signatories  
to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants in the UK, details of which can be found on the Remuneration Consulting Group’s website  
at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. 
Other than in relation to advice on remuneration, neither NBS, nor any other part of Aon plc provided other services to the Company. During the  
year, one of MMC’s other companies, Marsh, acted as St Ives’ commercial insurance brokers. The fees paid to NBS in relation to advice provided  
to Committee for 2014/2015 were £30,707. Kepler’s fees were £43,400 for 2014/2015.
The Committee has reviewed the advice provided by both Kepler and NBS during the year and is satisfied that it has been objective and independent. 
The terms of engagement between the Company and Kepler are available from the Company Secretary upon request. St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 45

Notes
1. Taxable benefits constitute additional payments in lieu of the provision of a company car and fuel benefit and medical expenses insurance cover.
2. In respect of Matt Armitage and Brad Gray, bonus earned in excess of 50% of basic salary shall be satisfied with Deferred Bonus Share Awards equivalent to the value, after deduction of income tax 
and employees’ national insurance contributions, of £36,544 and £20,882 (gross pay of £68,950 and £39,400) respectively, which will be held under the terms of the DBS. A description of the DBS  
is given on page 41.
3. Figures for ‘share plans vesting’ are now based on the number of shares vesting for performance periods substantially completed as at year end. This includes an estimate of the value of the relative 
TSR element for which the performance period ends shortly after year end – as was the case for LTIP awards granted prior to 2014. We have restated the 2014 figure shown above for this change  
in methodology. For 2014/2015, the figure represents the value of shares vesting under the adjusted EPS element of the 2012 LTIP award (performance period ended on 31 July 2015) and an estimate 
at 15 September 2015 of the outcome of the relative TSR element of the 2012 LTIP award (the performance period of which will end in November 2015). The values shown are based on the average 
share price over the last quarter of 2014/2015 of 178.5 pence. This valuation will be updated in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report to reflect the actual vesting outcome of the TSR element in 
November 2015 and the mid-market share price on date of vesting. For 2013/2014, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the 2011 LTIP award valued at the mid-market share price  
on the date of vesting (189.5 pence on 13 November 2014).
4. Pension benefits were in part paid into a Group Personal Pension Plan and part paid as a cash supplement for Matt Armitage and Brad Gray and wholly as a cash supplement to Patrick Martell.  
Brad Gray participated in the Group’s defined benefits scheme until it was discontinued on 1 September 2008 and is entitled to a deferred pension under its rules. This scheme has a normal retirement 
age of 65. His pension entitlement from the scheme increased during the year to 31 July 2015 by £798 per annum, net of CPI inflation, to £47,970 per annum. £15,960 of the figure shown for  
Brad Gray relates to the capitalised increase in his defined benefit pension entitlement, calculated in accordance with the reporting requirements.
5. Brad Gray was appointed on 1 August 2014.
6. Richard Stillwell has elected to forego £10,000 per annum of his fee of £120,000 per annum. Richard Stillwell’s fees are shown above after foregoing this proportion of his fees during 2014/2015.  
The Company donates this sum so withheld, together with a matching sum from the Company, to registered charities. 
7. Patrick Martell resigned as Chief Executive on 10 July 2014 and remained a Director until 27 November 2014. Mr. Martell continued to receive salary and benefits until 27 November 2014 but did 
not participate in the Company’s variable incentive plans in respect of the 2014/2015 financial year. Full details of Mr. Martell’s payments for loss of office are included in the 2013/2014 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. During the year Patrick Martell received a fee of £13,000 from RM plc for his services as a Non-Executive Director between 1 August and 27 November 2014.
INCENTIVE OUTCOMES FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 JULY 2015 (Audited) 
ANNUAL BONUS
Executive Directors’ bonuses for the year ended 31 July 2015 provided for a payment of up to 100% of salary based on underlying EPS performance 
over the financial year.
The EPS targets were adjusted upwards to neutralise a change in accounting policy of excluding the St Ives defined benefits pension scheme  
charges in order to reflect the underlying performance. For achievement of threshold performance of 18.98 pence, 25% of the maximum bonus was 
available. The full bonus was payable for EPS of 21.23 pence. Actual performance was 20.32 pence resulting in bonuses of 69.7% of maximum for  
the Executive Directors. All bonuses in excess of 50% of basic salary are deferred into Company shares in line with the overall remuneration policy. 
Further details are provided in the table below:

2011 LTIP Award
As reported last year, 73.5% out of 75% of the 2011 LTIP awards subject to EPS and the former Marketing Services segment operating profit conditions 
vested on performance to 1 August 2014. The remaining 25% was based on TSR relative to the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Support Services 
sector (excluding FTSE100 companies) over the three-year period to 11 November 2014. Having reviewed the Company’s relative TSR performance 
over the three-year period, the Committee concluded that the Company’s ranking warranted vesting of 100% of this element, resulting in an overall 
vesting of 98.5% out of the potential 100% in respect of these awards. The total value of 2011 LTIP awards vesting is included in the single figure table 
for 2013/2014 opposite.
2012 LTIP Award
Vesting of the 2012 LTIP awards is dependent on two equally-weighted measures over a three-year period; underlying EPS and TSR relative  
to the FTSE All-Share Support Services sector. Further details, including vesting schedules and performance against each of the metrics is provided  
in the table below:

100% vesting for upper quartile performance or greater 
Straight-line vesting between these points
Performance period ends in 
November 2015 
Estimated vesting 100%
Total vesting Estimated vesting 100%
With regard to the outcome of EPS performance, the Committee, as part of testing the condition, also assessed the potential impact on the targets 
of the adoption of the amendment to IAS 19 and the impact of the change in accounting policy to treat IAS 19 charges relating to the St Ives defined 
benefits pension scheme as non-underlying items. The underlying growth rate in EPS over the three-year performance period was such that the targets 
were exceeded irrespective of the basis of testing the target (i.e. if the targets had been restated to allow for the impact of IAS 19 and the change 
in accounting policy this would not have affected the vesting result and so the Committee was comfortable that the extent of achievement was not 
impacted by the change in accounting standards and change in policy).
The TSR portion of the award is measured over three years from the date of the award and so is not due to be measured until 12 November 2015. 
Accordingly, an estimated vesting is given in the table above based on TSR performance to 15 September 2015. The Company’s TSR exceeded the 
upper quartile of the comparator group and as a result, for the purposes of the 2014/2015 single figure, it is estimated that 100% of this portion of the 
award will vest. Final vesting shall be determined on completion of the performance period for the TSR portion.

Consistent with awards made in 2013, vesting of the LTIP awards granted in 2014 is dependent on two equally-weighted measures over a three-year 
period; adjusted EPS and relative TSR. As described in last year’s report, the Committee reviewed the TSR comparator group and concluded that 
this element of the November 2014 LTIP awards should be based on performance relative to the FTSE All-Share Media sector (excluding FTSE100 
companies) as this comparator group better reflects St Ives’ business and is more in line with the comparators used by external brokers than the FTSE 
All-Share Support Services sector. Additionally, and as in previous years, the relative TSR element will be subject to an EPS underpin.
A summary of the performance conditions is shown in the table below:

All awards made after 1 October 2013 are subject to a ‘clawback’ provision, which will enable the Committee to reclaim value that should not have  
been received in the event that, if within the two-year period following the year of vesting, a material misstatement of the Company’s financial results 
relating to the year of vesting is identified. In such circumstances a clawback would be based on the extent to which the first vesting was overpaid  
based on new information.

PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS (Audited) 
As previously disclosed, a settlement agreement was signed by the Company and Lloyd Wigglesworth on 25 June 2013 setting out the treatment  
of his entitlements under the Company’s LTIP . Under the agreement, two-thirds of Mr. Wigglesworth’s 11 November 2011 LTIP award and one third  
of his 12 November 2012 LTIP are eligible to vest provided that the relevant performance targets are met. In the case of Patrick Martell, under the terms 
of his resignation, the 11 November 2011 LTIP award is eligible to vest provided that the relevant performance targets are met. All of Mr. Martell’s other 
outstanding LTIP awards lapsed in full on 27 November 2014.
As disclosed on page 47, 98.5% of the November 2011 LTIP awards vested based on EPS, the former Marketing Services segment operating profit 
and relative TSR performance conditions, with 175,181 and 463,690 shares released to Messrs. Wigglesworth and Martell respectively on 11 November 
2014 as a result. The final vesting outcome of Mr. Wigglesworth’s November 2012 LTIP awards will be determined following the end of the TSR 
performance period in November 2015, and disclosed in next year’s report. Vesting of these shares will be dependent on Mr. Wigglesworth’s  
continued adherence to the terms of the settlement agreement.
IMPLEMENTATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2015/2016 
BASIC SALARY 
As disclosed in last year’s report, the Committee increased the basic salaries of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to £400,000 p.a. 
and £230,000 p.a. effective 1 August 2015 respectively. In confirming these increases, the Committee took into account the strong performance of both 
Matt Armitage and Brad Gray since their appointment into their new roles and is satisfied that such increases are justified.
Current basic salary levels are as follows:
     From 1 August From 1 August
     2015 2014 % increase
Matt Armitage Chief Executive Officer      £400,000 £350,000 14.3%
Brad Gray Chief Financial Officer      £230,000 £200,000 15.0%
PENSION AND BENEFITS
No changes in pension contribution rates or benefits provision to the Executive Directors were applied during the year.
 
ANNUAL BONUS
The annual bonus for the 2015/2016 financial year will operate on broadly the same basis as in 2014/2015. Bonus opportunities for Executive Directors 
remain at 100% of salary, with any amount earned over 50% of salary deferred in shares for two years and subject to clawback provisions in the event  
of material misstatement. 
For 2015/2016, the Committee has introduced an element based on like-for-like growth in underlying revenues from the Strategic Marketing segment 
with a 25% weighting to help reinforce organic growth in this business area. To help ensure these revenues are in shareholders’ interests, the Committee 
must be satisfied with the quality of revenue growth for this element to pay out, taking into account factors including the gross margin arising from  
these additional revenues. The remaining 75% of Executive Director bonuses continues to be based on underlying EPS. There are no other changes  
in framework for 2015/2016.
A summary of performance measures and weightings is included in the table below:
Measure       Weighting
Underlying EPS       75%

provided in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 51
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
Awards under the 2010 LTIP are anticipated to be at 100% of basic salary for both Executive Directors, with performance measured over a three-year 
period and shares subject to clawback for two years after vesting in the event of material misstatement. 
For the 2015/2016 awards, the Committee intends to supplement the existing EPS and relative TSR measures, with an element on underlying operating 
profit from the Strategic Marketing segment, with a 25% weighting. This element will be based on the percentage of the Group’s underlying operating 
profit from our Strategic Marketing segment in the final year of the performance period, underpinned by the achievement of a minimum level of EPS. 
The Committee believes that this will help accelerate a reshaping of the portfolio towards the targeted growth area of Strategic Marketing. The weighting 
on underlying EPS will be reduced to 25% to accommodate this change and the balance (50% of the LTIP award) will continue to vest on relative TSR, 
to further reinforce alignment with shareholder interests. A summary of performance measures, weightings and targets for the forthcoming grant are 
included in the table below:

SAVE AS YOUR EARN SHARE OPTION PLAN (‘SHARESAVE PLAN’)
The Company operates a standard HMRC-approved all-employee Sharesave Plan under which Executive Directors may from time to time participate  
on the same terms as any other eligible employee. The Directors’ interests arising from the award of options under the Sharesave Plan are disclosed  
on page 53.
IMPLEMENTATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2015/2016 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the Chairman’s fee in light of the time commitment and fees payable at companies of similar size and increased 
this from £120,000 p.a. to £130,000 from 1 August 2015. With effect from the same date the Committee implemented a decision made by the Board 
to pay the Non-Executive Directors a base fee of £42,500 p.a. (2014/2015 – £35,000) with an additional fee for the Audit and Remuneration Committee 
chairs of £7,500 p.a. (2014/2015 – £5,000). The fee for acting as the Senior Independent Director remains at £5,000 p.a. The Chairman has elected  
to forego his £10,000 p.a. increase, which the Company shall donate, together with a matching sum from the Company, to registered charities.
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES AND DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN THE SHARE CAPITAL OF THE COMPANY (Audited)
Shareholding guidelines are in place that require Executive Directors to acquire a holding equivalent to 200% of basic salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 150% of basic salary for the Chief Financial Officer. These levels are considered appropriate to ensure that there is robust long-term 
alignment achieved between Executive Directors and shareholders. It is expected that the guideline will be met by the Executive Directors within  
five years from the date of their respective appointments. Directors’ share dealings must be conducted in accordance with the Company’s Directors’ 
Share Dealing Code.

DILUTION
Under the ESOS 2001, LTIP and the Sharesave Plan, awards of options over no more than an aggregate 10% of the Company’s issued share capital 
may be granted over new issue shares in any rolling ten year period (with awards made under any other share plans also being counted).
As at 31 July 2015, excluding lapsed options and options exercised and satisfied from utilising existing issued shares, options over 5,520,644 shares 
(4.2%) of the Company’s issued share capital) remain outstanding under all share plans and so count towards this limit.

The Directors present their Directors’ Report and the audited financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 31 July 2015. This Directors’ Report covers 
this period and the period up to the date of signature.
STRATEGIC REPORT, FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 
The Strategic Report which the Company is required under law to prepare can be found on pages 2 to 29. That report also includes information required 
in this Directors’ Report about (a) future developments and, on page 28, (b) the CO
2
 emissions measurement disclosure, required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013.
Certain sections of this Annual Report and Accounts contain forward-looking statements with respect to the strategy, financial condition, results, 
operations and businesses of the Group or markets in which the Group operates. These statements and forecasts involve risk and uncertainty  
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that occur in the future and relate to events, not all of which are within the Group’s control. 
Although the Group believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there are a number of factors that could 
cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The Group undertakes  
no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Nothing in the Annual Report and Accounts should be construed as a profit forecast or an 
invitation to deal in the ordinary shares of St Ives plc.
DIRECTORS AND THEIR SHARE INTERESTS
The present membership of the Board is set out on pages 32 and 33. Each Director served throughout the year. In addition, Patrick Martell served  
as a Director until 27 November 2014. 
Richard Stillwell holds a number of external Non-Executive Directorships (set out on page 33) which, in the opinion of the Board, does not prevent  
him from devoting sufficient time to his responsibilities as Chairman of the Board. 
The Directors’ interests in ordinary shares of the Company are set out in Table on page 51 within the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The Group profit for the year before taxation amounted to £8,729,000 (2014 – £11,883,000). The Directors propose a final dividend of 5.55 pence  
for each ordinary share payable on 22 December 2015 to holders on the register as at 27 November 2015. If approved, the final dividend will make  
total dividends for the year of 7.80 pence per ordinary share:

Ordinary dividends 
Interim       2,865
Proposed final       7,239
EMPLOYMENT POLICIES, EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES, EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATION AND DIVERSITY
The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities with regard to employment, free from discrimination and harassment and in a healthy and safe 
working environment. Details of how we deliver on these commitments and communicate with our employees are provided in the Report on Corporate 
and Social Responsibility on pages 26 to 29.
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the  
Strategic Report. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review. In addition, note 29 
to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk, 
liquidity risk and capital risk. The Strategic Report is to be found on pages 2 to 29 and note 29 to the financial statements on pages 95 to 97.
As highlighted in note 23 to the financial statements, the Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through an overdraft facility  
of £15 million that is part of an overall funding facility of £115 million. The facility was renewed during the year from £90 million to £115 million until  
23 March 2019 with the ability to extend the term for a further year. 
The current economic conditions create uncertainty, particularly over the level of demand for the Group’s services, but the Group’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level  
of its current facility and obtain further financing when the current facility expires. 
After making enquiries, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources and borrowing facilities to continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future. Consequently, they have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

AUDITOR
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as auditors of the Company will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to be held on  
26 November 2015. Details about this proposal are set out in the Notice of Meeting accompanying the Annual Report and Accounts. In proposing  
this resolution, the Board has taken into account the view of the Audit Committee on Auditor independence, discussed by the Chair of the Committee  
on pages 35 and 36.
Each of the Directors of the Company as at 1 October 2015 has confirmed that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. 
POLITICAL DONATIONS
The Company made no political donations during the year (2014 – £Nil) and the Board has no intention to seek shareholders’ approval to permit the 
Board to make political donations.
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY INSURANCE
The Company has made qualifying third party provisions for the benefit of its Directors (as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) which 
continue in force at the date of this report. The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity in favour of each of its Directors (on identical terms)  
who served during the year, under which the Company has granted Directors an indemnity, to the extent permitted by law and the Company’s  
articles of association, in respect of liabilities incurred by virtue of their office.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICT OF INTEREST
In accordance with the provisions of Section 175 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has procedures in place to deal with the situation where

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 57
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation and have chosen to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that year. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact  
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in  
the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.  
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement: 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets,  
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders  
to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 58 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Opinion on financial statements  
of St Ives plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and  
of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 July 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the  
52 weeks then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4  
of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets,  
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, and the 
related notes 1 to 37 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes 1 to 15 of the Company 
Financial Statements. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement on page 54 that the 
Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not  
a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors 
and we confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also confirm we have not provided any  
of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest 
effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team.
Risk (Continued) How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
The assessment of the carrying value  
of goodwill and intangible assets
The assessment of the carrying value of 
goodwill (£124.7 million) and intangible assets 
(£34.1 million), (both excluding the amounts 
recognised related to the Solstice acquisition, 
assessed separately, as described below) 
as described in note 16 to the consolidated 
financial statements, involves considerable 
judgement due to the challenges in accurately 
forecasting future cash flows in the changing 
market environment. Key assumptions in 
management’s analysis include short and long-
term growth rates and the discount rate applied 
to the future cash flows. Management disclose 
this as a critical accounting judgement in note 2 
to the consolidated financial statements.
We challenged management’s assumptions used in their impairment assessment of the Group’s 
goodwill and intangible assets. Our procedures included:
• assessing the short-term cash flow projections against recent performance, historical 
forecasting accuracy and gaining an understanding and challenging the key assumptions 
involved in the forecasts from management, including finance and those outside of finance; 
• comparing the long-term forecasts against long-term economic growth rates from external data;
• comparing the discount rate applied against a broad comparator group as well as involving our 
internal valuation specialists to assess the key components of the discount rate calculation; and
• considering the reasonableness of, and recalculating, the sensitivity assessment applied by 
management, and reviewing the sensitivity disclosure included in the Annual Report and 
Accounts; and performing further sensitivity analysis of our own on the impairment model.

Risk (Continued) How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Accounting for business combinations
St Ives plc has acquired Solstice in the year, 
for consideration of £28.1 million, recognising 
£11.6 million of intangible assets and  
£12.8 million of goodwill on acquisition. 
The purchase price allocation prepared by 
management to determine these values 
contains judgements such as the identification 
and valuation of intangible assets and an 
estimation of contingent consideration as set 
out in note 12 to the accounts. Management 
acknowledge the judgemental nature of this  
by including it as a critical accounting 
judgement in the accounting policies note 2.
We have reviewed management’s preliminary purchase price allocation for the Solstice acquisition 
and challenged the key inputs. Our procedures included:
• engaging internal valuations specialists to assist in our review of the underlying assumptions 
supporting the model, including the methodology used to calculate the value of proprietary 
techniques, customer relationships and trademarks, the value of the assembled workforce,  
the internal rate of return and the royalty rate used in valuing the trademark; and
• reviewing the accounting for contingent amounts payable to the previous owners of Solstice, 
particularly the division between consideration and deemed remuneration for both cash  
and shares.
The classification of non-underlying items
Non-underlying items amount to £24.2 million 
in 2014/2015, which consists of the items 
disclosed in note 8. Management has also 
changed their accounting policy to include 
defined benefit pension scheme costs as a 
non-underlying item this year. There is a risk 
that costs relating to the underlying business 
are being disclosed as non-underlying and that 
items are not being split out in line with St Ives 
group accounting policy, which could distort the 
information presented to shareholders.
We challenged the appropriateness of the classification of non-underlying items. Our procedures 
included:
• assessing whether there is sufficient justification for items to be classed as non-underlying, 
particularly in the context of management’s accounting policy, as described in note 2;
• challenging the justification for defined benefit pension scheme costs being included as  
non-underlying items, and comparing this treatment to other companies; and
• reviewing the non-underlying disclosure in note 8 of the accounts in line with IAS 1 
‘Presentation of financial statements’.
Accounting for retirement  
benefit obligations
The net pension deficit on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet is £27.6 million. There is 
significant judgement involved in the valuation 
of the retirement benefit obligations, particularly 
in relation to determining the assumptions, 
including discount rate, inflation rates, mortality 
assumptions (disclosed in note 28) underlying 
the valuation of the liabilities of the schemes, 
with management acknowledging this through 
its inclusion as a critical accounting judgement 
in the accounting policies note 2.
The audit procedures we performed in respect of this risk included:
• using internal specialists to consider and challenge the actuarial assumptions adopted  
by the Group for the valuation of its retirement benefit obligations. This includes benchmarking 
the assumptions against a relevant comparator group; 
• testing member data to the most recent agreed triennial funding valuation in 2013; and 
• analysing third party fund manager reports to support the carrying value of the plan assets  
at 31 July 2015 and testing a sample of asset values to independent market prices.
The valuation of strategic marketing 
revenue recognised
In the strategic marketing businesses there  
are projects where revenue is recognised  
on a percentage completion basis as noted  
in the revenue recognition policy in note 2 to 
the consolidated financial statements. There  
is a risk that revenue may be misstated due  
to the degree of judgement exercised by 
management in estimating future costs.
We have considered management’s application of revenue recognition policies to assess 
compliance with IAS 18 ‘Revenue’. In particular, this involved:
• reviewing the underlying contracts to assess whether revenue was correctly recognised in line 
with the contract; and
• selecting a sample of projects spanning the year end and understanding and challenging 
the judgements used by management in determining which period to recognise revenue and 
corroborating the judgements made to supporting information.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered 
by the Audit Committee discussed on page 35.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 60 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes  
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed 
or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating  
the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £1,580,000 (2014 – £1,450,000), which is below 
5% (2014 – 5%) of underlying pre-tax profit, and approximately 1% (2014 – 1%) of equity.  
We have used underlying pre-tax profit, adjusted for certain recurring items, as this is a key 
measure used by investors and is the measure which is focused on in the front half of the  
Annual Report as this is how management monitor the business.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in 
excess of £31,000 (2014 – £28,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, 
including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Based on that assessment, and at the request of management and the Audit Committee, all active 
entities were subject to full scope audit, with dormant entities and start-up operations in the US 
and China excluded. Solstice has also been excluded from full audit scope, although as noted 
above, we have performed procedures on the acquisition accounting for this entity to address  
our significant risk. These locations represent the principal business units and account for 99% 
(2014 – 99%) of the Group’s net assets, 97% (2014 – 99%) of the Group’s revenue and 96% 
(2014 – 99%) of the Group’s underlying profit before tax. They were also selected to provide 
an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement 
identified above. Our audit work at these locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable 
to each individual entity which were lower than group materiality and ranged from £113,000 to 
£943,000 (2014 – £115,000 to £1,040,000).
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical 
procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement 
of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit  
of specified account balances.
The group audit team have ensured that they have maintained oversight of the work performed 
at the components by involving key component team members in our planning briefing, including 
a discussion of risk assessment, to ensure an integrated approach was followed. We have 
maintained regular communications with each component throughout the audit, attended closing 
meetings for each component, and reviewed documentation of the findings from their work.
Opinion on other matters prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared  
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year  
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to  
report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and 
accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records  
and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures 
of Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to 
report arising from these matters.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ST IVES PLC CONTINUED St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 61
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
Corporate Governance Statement Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the  
Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between 
our knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the 
Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider  
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies  
or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology 
and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. 
Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3  
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the  
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
St Ives plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is One Tudor Street, 
London, EC4Y 0AH. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Chief Executive’s Performance Review,  
pages 6 to 9.
These consolidated financial statements (‘the financial statements’) are presented in Sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates.
In the current period, the following revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted:
IAS 19 (amendments) Employee Benefits;
IAS 32 (amendments) Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities;
IAS 36 (amendments) Impairment of Assets;
IFRS 10 (amendments) Consolidated Financial Statements;
IFRS 12 (amendments) Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities;
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; and
Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments asset and liability offsetting.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards, Amendments and Interpretations which have not been applied  
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU). The Group has not applied 
these standards in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:
IAS 1 (amendments) Disclosure Initiative effective after 1 January 2016;
IAS 10 (amendments) Events after the reporting period effective after 1 January 2016;
IFRS 12 (amendments) Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities effective after 1 January 2016;
IAS 28 (amendments) Investment in Associates effective after 1 January 2016;
IAS 16 (amendments) Property, Plant and Equipment; this amendment is mandatory for accounting periods effective after 1 January 2016;
IAS 27 (amendments) Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements; this amendment is mandatory for accounting periods effective after  
1 January 2016;
IFRS 9  Financial Instruments; this standard is mandatory for accounting periods effective after 1 January 2015;
IFRS 11 (amendments) Joint Arrangements; this amendment is mandatory for accounting periods effective after 1 January 2016; and
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers; this standard is mandatory for accounting periods effective after 1 January 2018.
In addition, ‘Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle’ includes amendments to a number of Standards and Interpretations including IFRS 5, IFRS 7,  
IAS 19 and IAS 34. The effective date of all the amendments is for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) adopted by the European Union 
and IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments. The significant accounting 
policies adopted are set out below.
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made judgements as to the policies that have the most significant effect on 
the amounts recognised in the financial statements. The accounting estimates and assumptions that management considers to be its critical accounting 
estimations are detailed and explained in the Audit Committee Report.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ Report on pages 54 to 56.
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 68 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiary 
undertakings) for each period. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the period are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition  
or up to the effective date of disposal, or disposed of, as appropriate. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those of the Group. All intra-Group 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
(b) Columnar classification in the Consolidated Income Statement
Income statement items are presented in the middle column under the heading ‘non-underlying items’ if they are significant in size and do not occur  
in the normal course of business, or if they comprise of restructuring costs, or if they comprise the operating results of a site arising after a formal 
decision on its closure has been taken where that site does not meet the definition of a discontinued operation under IFRS 5 – Assets held for sale  
and discontinued operations (in which case the site and its activities are referred to as a ‘non-continuing operation’), or if they comprise of setup costs  
of a subsidiary, or if they comprise of costs related to acquisitions, or if they comprise impairment or amortisation charges on acquired intangible assets, 
or if they comprise of contingent consideration required to be treated as remuneration, or if they comprise of costs related to the Group’s defined benefits 
pension scheme.
(c) Change in accounting policy
The Group operates a defined benefits pension scheme (‘the Scheme’) which was closed to new entrants from 6 April 2002 and closed to future benefits 
accrual with effect from 31 August 2008. At the period end, 7% of the Group’s employees are deferred members of the Scheme. The Group has closed 
and sold a number of businesses that were participating employers of the Scheme and has made eleven acquisitions since June 2010 that are not 
participating employers. The Board has concluded that the Scheme income and expenses do not relate to the underlying trading activities of the Group. 
Furthermore the underlying assumptions used in the Scheme’s valuation are determined by reference to external market data (notably discount and 
inflation rates) that are outside the Group’s control and can vary significantly between periods. The Group has changed its accounting policy to record 
the income and expense related to the Scheme as a non-underlying item. As a result, the comparative period has been restated.
(d) Revenue recognition
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and comprises amounts receivable for goods and services, net of trade 
discounts, up-front payments, VAT and other sales-related taxes. 
Revenue for goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the 
customer, normally on shipment of the product. 
Revenue for service is recognised as services are delivered or in proportion to the level of services performed. Revenue for the level of services 
performed is recognised using the stage of completion method when the outcome can be measured reliably. The stage of completion is determined 
using relevant criteria including service performed as a percentage of total services or as a proportion of costs incurred. 
Income from advance billings is deferred and released to revenue when conditions for its recognition have been fulfilled.
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 69
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
(e) Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at the date of the acquisition. Fair value is finalised within twelve months of the date of the acquisition. 
Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment annually in accordance with the impairment of goodwill policy set out below.
Other intangible assets – computer software
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment is classified as an intangible asset and is held on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet at cost. These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is generally two to five years.
Other intangible assets – customer relationships 
Customer relationships identified as separable intangible assets in the context of business combinations are capitalised at their fair value at the date 
of acquisition. They are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is generally five to ten years. 
Other intangible assets – proprietary techniques
Proprietary techniques identified as separable intangible assets in the context of business combinations are capitalised at their fair value at the date  
of acquisition. They are fully amortised over their estimated useful life which is generally three to eight years.
Other intangible assets – trademarks
Trademarks identified as separable intangible assets in the context of business combinations are capitalised at their fair value at the date of acquisition. 
They are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is generally ten years. 
(f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment held for use in the production or supply of goods, or for administration purposes is stated in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet at deemed cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Costs are recognised as an asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost  
of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs and maintenance are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which they  
are incurred. 
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees. Depreciation of these 
assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is charged, other than on freehold land and assets under the course of construction, so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets over 
their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis:
Freehold buildings       2% – 4%
Long leases       Period of lease
Plant and machinery       10% – 33
1
/3%
Fixture, fittings and equipment       10% – 33
1
/3%
Motor vehicles       20% – 25%
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount  
of the asset and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 70 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(g) Impairment of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered any impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit  
to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows  
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset  
(cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately as an expense in the Consolidated  
Income Statement. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate  
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined  
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior periods. 
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(h) Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to the group of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
A cash-generating unit represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group’s Board of Directors for internal management purposes. 
The recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually on a consistent 
date during each financial period, or more frequently when such events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
 
(i) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those production overheads that have been incurred in bringing  
the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is valued on a first in, first out (‘FIFO’) basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling  
price less the estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in selling and distribution.
(j) Tax
The tax expense in the Consolidated Income Statement comprises tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used  
in the computation of taxable profit; and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for  
all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against  
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise on goodwill 
or from the initial recognition (other than business combinations) of other assets or liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the 
accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control 
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax  
is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case  
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current assets against current liabilities and when they  
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 71
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
(k) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle 
the obligation, and its value can be reliably estimated. When a provision needs to be released, the provision is taken back to the Consolidated Income 
Statement within the line where it was initially booked.
Provisions for repairs
Provisions for repairs are made where the Group is committed under the terms of the lease to make repairs to leasehold property. The provision is made 
for the estimated cost over the period of the lease.
Provisions for restructuring costs
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated  
to affected parties.
(l) Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies other than Sterling are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign currency differences arising on translation or settlement of monetary items are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.  
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate  
at the date of the transaction and not retranslated each period end. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that  
are stated at fair value are translated to Sterling at exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined. Exchange gains and losses  
arising on the retranslation of non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised directly in a separate component of equity. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Income and expense items and the cash flows of foreign operations are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, except for individually 
material items which may be translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising on retranslation of  
non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised directly in a separate component of equity. 
Such translation differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation  
and translated at the closing rate.
 
(m) Borrowing costs
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from  
the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
(n) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. Allowances are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when there is objective evidence that their asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds receivable, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for  
on an accruals basis in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are included in creditors to the extent that  
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Available for sale investments
Unlisted shares held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Fair values of unlisted shares are calculated  
with reference to exit price. All available-for-sale investments carried at fair value have been fair valued using a level 3 measurement as per the fair value 
hierarchy defined in IFRS 7. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is 
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Consolidated Income Statement 
for the period.  72 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(n) Financial instruments continued
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group uses derivative 
financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange for the purchase and sale of goods and services denominated in foreign currencies.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use 
of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes. All financial derivatives carried at fair value have been fair valued using a level 2 measurement as per the fair value hierarchy 
defined in IFRS 7.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability 
is recognised, the associated gains and losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurements 
of the asset or liability. For the hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement in the same period as gains or losses are recognised on the hedged item.
The gain or loss on hedging instruments relating to the effective portion of a net investment hedge is recognised in equity and the ineffective portion 
is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Gains or losses accumulated in equity are included in the Consolidated Income 
Statement when the foreign operations are disposed of.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transition occurs.  
If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Consolidated 
Income Statement for the period. Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when 
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised 
gains or losses reported in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Those derivatives which are not designed as hedges are classified as held for trading and gains and losses on those instruments are recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
(o) Retirement benefits
The Group operates both defined benefits and defined contribution schemes for its employees. Payments to the defined contribution schemes are 
expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement as they fall due.
For the defined benefits pension scheme full actuarial calculations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method and updates 
are performed for each financial period end. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised 
outside the Consolidated Income Statement and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The retirement benefits obligation recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefits obligations and 
unrecognised past service costs, and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme’s assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service costs, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions to the scheme.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over  
the average period until the benefits become vested.
(p) Share-based payments
The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair  
value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based  
on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value of share options issued is measured using a binomial model, for the effects  
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The cumulative expense is reversed when an employee in receipt of the share options terminates service prior to the completion of vesting period.  
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified on termination of the employment, the total fair value of the share-based payments is recorded 
in the Consolidated Income Statement as non-underlying item.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
(q) Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.  
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in equal amounts over the terms of the lease.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments; 
each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a finance lease 
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability.
(r) Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed by the Group together with the equity instruments 
issued at the average mid-market share price for the five days prior to completion, in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured 
at its acquisition-date fair value. Contingent consideration carried at fair value have been fair valued using a level 3 measurement as per the fair value 
hierarchy defined in IFRS 7. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement 
period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset, liability or equity  
are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Contingent consideration payable to selling shareholders who continue to be employed by the Group, but which is automatically forfeited upon 
termination of employment, is classified as remuneration for post-combination services and is recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the 
acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income  
are reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are recognised  
at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: 
• deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance  
with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
• liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in accordance 
with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports 
provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period 
(see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date. 
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances 
that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
The value of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is calculated initially as their share of identifiable net assets, and is subsequently adjusted by their 
share of comprehensive income.
(s) Joint ventures
Joint ventures are jointly controlled entities in which the Group has an interest. The Group’s share of the post-tax results of its joint ventures is included  
in the Consolidated Income Statement using the equity method of accounting. Where the Group transacts with a joint venture, profits and losses  
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture.
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets  
of the entity, less any provision for impairment. 74 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(t) Critical accounting judgements
In the course of applying the Group’s accounting policies the following estimations have been made which could have a significant effect on the results 
of the Group were they subsequently found to be inappropriate.
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units for which goodwill has been identified.  
In arriving at the value in use an estimation of the future cash flows of cash-generating units and selecting appropriate discount rates is required to 
calculate present values, a process which involves estimation. The recoverability analysis indicates that the carrying amount of goodwill will be  
recovered in full. The situation will be monitored closely should future developments indicate that adjustments are appropriate. The carrying value  
of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £137.5 million (2014 – £123.3 million).
Impairment of acquired intangibles and plant and machinery
The Group considers the recoverability of acquired intangibles and plant and machinery, which is included within the Consolidated Balance Sheet  
at £44.3 million and £42.3 million respectively. The key areas of judgement when assessing the recoverability of these assets are in relation to the 
forecast growth rates and discount rates to be applied to forecast cash flows. 
Contingent consideration and consideration required to be treated as remuneration
Contingent consideration and consideration required to be treated as remuneration have been based on the fair value of the most likely outcome.
Retirement benefits obligations
The calculation of retirement benefits obligations requires estimates to be made of discount rates, inflation rates, pension increases and mortality.  
The net deficit in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for retirement benefits scheme is £27.6 million (2014 – £9.8 million).
Allowances against amounts receivable 
The Group considers the recoverability of certain customer and other receivable balances. Determining whether an allowance against these balances 
is required involves an assessment of the ability of counterparties to make required payments. If the financial positions of the counterparties were to 
deteriorate, affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required in future periods. The Group maintains credit insurance 
covering its larger trade debtors for its UK operations, a rigorous system of credit control is applied and amounts receivable are continually monitored. 
Management specifically monitors historical bad debt, counterparty creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in payment patterns when 
evaluating the adequacy of the allowances in place.
3. REVENUE
An analysis of the Group’s revenue from continuing operations as defined by International Accounting Standard 18 − ‘Revenue’ is as follows:
       2015 2014
      £’000 £’000
Sale of goods      233,863 237,476
Rendering of services      110,690 93,208
Revenue from the sale of goods and rendering of services     344,553 330,684
4. SEGMENT REPORTING
The Group manages its business on a market segment basis, based on the Group’s internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). 
The CODM has been determined to be the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of 
resources to the segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
As a result of the reallocation of resources and a change in the Group’s internal reporting, the segments have been redefined as Strategic Marketing, 
Marketing Activation and Books.
The Strategic Marketing segment comprises all the businesses that were previously reported under the Marketing Services segment other than the  
Field Marketing business which is now reported under the Marketing Activation segment. The Strategic Marketing segment comprises the Data,  
Digital and Consulting businesses.
The Marketing Activation segment includes the Field Marketing business, and all the Group’s Marketing Print businesses that were previously reported 
under the Print Services segment other than Clays which is now reported under the Books segment. The Marketing Activation segment comprises  
the Group’s Exhibitions and Events, Point-of-Sale, Print Management and Field Marketing businesses.
The Books segment comprises Clays that was previously reported under the Print Services segment.
Corporate costs are allocated to revenue generating segments as this presentation better reflects their profitability.
Comparatives have been restated to reflect the reclassification of reporting segments for the 52 weeks to 1 August 2014.

6. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY
The Group operates a defined benefits pension scheme (‘the Scheme’) which was closed to new entrants from 6 April 2002 and closed to future benefits 
accrual with effect from 31 August 2008. At the period end, 7% of the Group’s employees were deferred members of the Scheme. The Group has 
closed and sold a number of businesses that are participating employers of the Scheme and has made eleven acquisitions since June 2010 that are not 
participating employers. As a result, the Board has concluded that the Scheme income and expenses do not relate to the underlying trading activities 
of the Group. Furthermore, the underlying assumptions used in the Scheme’s valuation are determined by reference to external market data (notably 
discount and inflation rates) that are outside the Group’s control and can vary significantly between periods. Therefore, the accounting policy for the 
Group was amended to reclassify the Scheme income and expenses as non-underlying items (note 8).
The impact of the prior period adjustment on the previously reported Consolidated Income Statement is summarised as follows:

Hive
On 1 May 2014, the Group acquired 100% of all the issued share capital of The Health Hive Group Limited (Hive), a consultancy business. Deferred 
consideration for Hive will be payable in three tranches, based on the EBITDA achieved for the calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016. The basis of 
estimated EBITDA for the calendar year 2014 was reviewed in the period resulting in an increase in the estimate of the deferred consideration payable. 
The increase in the fair value of the consideration payable of £1,476,000 has been recorded in the period as an addition to the goodwill. Further 
adjustments decreasing the fair value of current assets at acquisition by £223,000 were recorded as an addition to the goodwill.
The final allocation of the purchase price payable for Hive is as follows:

        137,488
SP Group, Service Graphics and Tactical Solutions are reported within the Marketing Activation segment. All other CGUs are reported within the 
Strategic Marketing segment. The Data CGU represents Occam and Response One.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. As Solstice was acquired  
in the period, total consideration payable has been used as the value-in-use.
The recoverable amount of the Solstice CGU was tested by reference to the market value at 31 July 2015. The recoverable amounts of the other CGUs 
are determined using a value-in-use calculation. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates 
and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs (and therefore profits and losses) during the forecast period. Management estimates discount 
rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. Changes in selling prices 
and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from 
the most recent medium-term business forecasts with a terminal value calculation. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations and the 
sensitivities to the key revenue growth and pre-tax discount rate assumptions are detailed below.

to EBITDA excluding non-underlying items. Interest on overdraft drawdowns is charged at 2.00% over UK base rate. 
As at 31 July 2015, the Group’s outstanding loans within this facility were £79 million (2014 – £55 million). The undrawn portion of this facility  
at 31 July 2015 was £36 million (2014 – £35 million). 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the loans approximates to their fair value.

Provision for repairs
Where the Group is committed under the terms of a lease to make repairs to leasehold premises, a provision for repairs is made for these estimated 
costs over the period of the lease. It is anticipated that these liabilities will crystallise between 2015 and 2020.
Provision for reorganisation
The provision for reorganisation relates primarily to the remaining costs in respect of plant closures and relocation and comprises redundancy payments, 
plant relocation, onerous property and other costs, which are expected to be settled by the end of the 2016 financial period. The charge in the current 
period relates principally to the closure of Burnley site within the Point-of-Sale business all of which are included within the Marketing Activation segment. 
Other
The provision mainly relates to ongoing legal claims and costs incurred in the normal course of trading.
27. DEFERRED TAX
Deferred income taxes are calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a principal tax rate of 20% for UK operations  
(2014 – 20%) and 40% for US operations (2014 – Nil).

The Finance Act 2013, which provides for reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and to 20% 
effective from 1 April 2015, was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. These rate reductions have been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax  
at the balance sheet date.
The Government intends to enact further reductions in the main tax rate down to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18% effective from  
1 April 2020. As these tax rates were not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the relevant rate reductions are not yet reflected  
in these financial statements in accordance with IAS 10, as it is a non-adjusting event occurring after the reporting period. 92 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
28. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the  
Group in funds under control of the trustees. Payments to the schemes are expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement as they fall due. The total 
expense recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for continuing operations of £3,766,000 (2014 – £2,775,000) represents contributions 
payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes. At 31 July 2015, contributions of £363,000 (2014 – £508,000) 
due in respect of the 2015 reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes. The amounts were paid over subsequent to the balance sheet date, 
within the requisite time limits.
Defined benefits scheme – St Ives Group
The Group operates the St Ives defined benefits pension scheme with assets held in separate trustee administered funds. Pension benefits are linked  
to a member’s final salary at retirement and their length of services. The Scheme was closed to new entrants from 6 April 2002, and closed to future 
benefit accruals with effect from 31 August 2008. 
The defined benefits pension scheme is a registered scheme under UK legislation and is contracted out of State Second Pension. The defined benefits 
pension scheme has two current participating employers, St Ives plc and Clays Limited.
The defined benefits pension scheme was established from 30 September 1988 under trust and is governed by the defined benefits pension scheme’s 
trust deed and rules dated 23 April 1991 and subsequent amendments. The Directors of St Ives Pension Scheme Trustees Limited (‘the Trustees’) are 
responsible for the operation and the governance of the Scheme, including making decisions regarding the defined benefits pension scheme’s funding 
and investment strategy in conjunction with the Company.
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefits obligations were carried out as at April 2013 
by Jonathan Punter, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, of Punter Southall & Co Limited, (‘the actuary’) who is independent of the Group. This valuation 
was updated at 31 July 2015. The present value of the defined benefits obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were 
measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations are as follows:
       2015 2014
      per annum per annum
Discount rate      3.70% 4.40%

Other       5,828 1,978
       311,037 286,160
The defined benefits pension assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets  
used by, the Group. 
The defined benefits pension scheme’s investments include interest and inflation hedging.
The defined benefits pension scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as; market (investment) risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk, currency risk 
and longevity risk. The defined benefits pension scheme does not expose the Group to any unusual scheme-specific or company-specific risk.
Investment risk: the Scheme holds some of its investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and, while these assets 
are expected to provide the best returns over the long-term, any short-term volatility could cause additional funding to be required if a deficit emerges. 
Derivative contracts are used from time to time which would limit losses in the event of a fall in equity markets.
Interest rate risk: the Scheme’s liabilities are assessed using market rates of interest to discount the liabilities and are therefore subject to any volatility  
in the movement of the market rate of interest. The net interest income or expense recognised in profit or loss is also calculated using the market rate  
of interest. The Scheme’s swap investments are expected to provide a degree of protection from any movement in the market rate of interest.
Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation. Although the Scheme’s assets are expected to provide  
a good hedge against inflation over the long-term, movements over the short-term could lead to a deficit emerging. The Scheme’s swap investments  
are expected to provide a degree of protection from any short-term inflationary movements.
Mortality risk: in the event that members live longer than assumed the liabilities may be understated originally, and a deficit may emerge if funding has 
not adequately provided for the increased life expectancy.
A sensitivity analysis of the principle assumptions used to measure the defined benefits pension obligation as at 31 July 2015 is analysed as follows:
     Change in Impact on the defined  
     assumption benefits pension obligation 
Discount rate     Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 8%
Rate of Inflation (RPI)     Increase by 0.5% Increase by 3%
Assumed life expectancy at age 65     Increase by 1 year Increase by 4%
The defined benefits pension scheme’s investment strategy is to invest broadly 65% in return seeking assets and 35% in matching assets  
(mainly government bonds). The strategy reflects the defined benefits pension scheme’s liability profile and the Trustees’ and Group’s attitude to risk.
The last scheme funding valuation of the Scheme was as at 6 April 2013 and revealed a funding deficit of £36,698,000. In the recovery plan dated  
28 February 2014, the Company has agreed to pay £200,000 per month with the view to eliminating the shortfall by August 2019.
The liabilities of the Scheme are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cashflows to members of the Scheme over the next 75 years. 
The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 18 years.
The Scheme has two current participating employers; St Ives plc and Clays Limited. St Ives plc is responsible for paying all contributions to the Scheme. 
Each participating employer is liable for its share of the liabilities on wind-up or withdrawal from the Scheme in accordance with the Scheme’s trust  
deed and rules.

29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s treasury function is responsible for managing the Group’s exposure to financial risk and operates within a defined set of policies and 
procedures reviewed and approved by the Board.
Interest rate risk
The Group carries a cash flow risk where there are changes in the interest rate levied on the Group’s borrowings as currently interest on the majority  
of the Group’s borrowings is at floating rates. The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and bank borrowings. Group 
policy is to constantly review the exposure risk to interest rate fluctuations in relation to the risk as a proportion of Group earnings and wherever possible 
with matching short-term deposits of surplus funds. The Group is not subject to fair value interest rate risk as the majority of debt is at floating rates.
Interest rate management
An analysis of financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk by currency is set out below:
Financial assets subject to interest rate risk
       2015 2014
      £’000 £’000

Argentine Peso      27 –
Chinese Yuan       5 –
       16,392  12,336 
The Group’s financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, all of which attract interest at floating rates based upon LIBOR or equivalent measures.
Financial liabilities subject to interest rate risk
       2015 2014
      £’000 £’000
Sterling bank loans      60,000 55,000
US Dollar bank loans      19,225 –
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise loan borrowings which bear interest at floating rates based upon LIBOR, and overdraft borrowings which bear 
interest at floating rates based upon UK base rate.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis 
The analysis shows the additional charge to Consolidated Income Statement assuming that the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet 
date was outstanding for the entire period.
       2015 2014
      £’000 £’000
100% movement in Sterling LIBOR      461 308
The changes would not have impacted other equity reserves as all interest bearing financial assets and liabilities are subject to floating interest rates and 
their fair values do not fluctuate with changes in interest rates.
Foreign exchange risk
From time to time the Group enters into contracts to supply goods and services to customers trading in following regions:
• Europe at prices denominated in Euros;
• USA at prices denominated in US Dollars;
• Japan at prices denominated in Japanese Yen;
• Singapore at prices denominated in Singapore Dollars;
• China at prices denominated in Chinese Yuan; and
• Mexico at prices denominated in Mexican Peso. 96 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts and to manage the risk associated 
with anticipated sale and purchase transactions. Basis adjustments are made to the carrying amount of non-financial hedged items when the anticipated 
sale or purchase transaction takes place.
The following table details the forward currency contracts outstanding at the period end:
     Average 
    exchange rate Foreign Contract
    Sterling : foreign currency value Fair value
    currency ’000 £’000 £’000
Sell US Dollars (up to 12 months)    1.55  963  619  617 
Sell Euros (up to 12 months)    1.38  8,986  6,521  6,362 
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been used to hedge the exchange rate risk arising from these commitments which are designated as cash 
flow hedges. As at 31 July 2015, the aggregate amount of unrealised profits under forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the hedging reserve 
relating to the exposure on trade receivables and anticipated sale transactions amounted to £161,000. It is anticipated that the sales will be made  
in the twelve months following the balance sheet date. 
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, which represent the Group’s maximum exposure 
to credit risk in relation to financial assets. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and  
their assessment of the current economic environment. The Group’s credit risk is relatively low as the Group maintains credit insurance, for its UK 
operations, up to a maximum aggregate claim in any one year of £13.65 million. In addition, its UK subsidiaries’ sales are principally with a large  
number of counterparties and customers in the UK, and are denominated in Sterling.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines 
credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are reviewed regularly.
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £7.6 million (2014 – £10.9 million) which are past due at the 
reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered 
recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

Impairment losses reversed      (208) (140)
Balance at the end of the period       1,408 1,716
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the date the credit 
was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated, and being 
covered by credit insurance arrangements. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance 
for doubtful debts.

Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to maintain flexibility with respect to its liquidity position, by utilising short-term cash deposits and, where necessary, short-term 
bank borrowings for working capital and longer-term borrowings for capital expenditure requirements. The Group renegotiated its revolving multicurrency 
facility from £90.0 million to £115.0 million in the current period. The agreement includes an overdraft facility of £15.0 million to fund short-term working 
capital requirements. The contractual maturities of drawn down borrowings, as well as undrawn facilities, are detailed in note 23.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will each be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings 
disclosed in note 23, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained 
earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.

COMPANY BALANCE SHEET 104 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ Report on page 54.
(a) Accounting convention
The financial statements of the Company are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for revaluation of certain land and buildings  
and financial instruments.
(b) Accounting period
The financial statements are prepared for the 52 weeks ended 31 July 2015 (‘the financial period’). Comparative figures are for the 52 weeks ended 
1 August 2014.
(c) Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction. On other assets it is provided on cost or revalued amounts  
in equal annual instalments over the estimated lives of the assets. The annual rates of depreciation are as follows:
Freehold buildings        2% – 4%
Long leases       Period of lease
Plant and machinery        10% – 33
1
/3%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment        10% – 33
1
/3%
Motor vehicles        20% – 25%
As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 15 − Tangible Fixed Assets (‘FRS 15’), those freehold buildings valued at 31 July 1985 continue to be 
carried at that value, subject to depreciation.
(d) Investments
Investments are stated at historical cost, less any provision for impairment.
(e) Tax
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax,  
at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items 
of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted 
earnings where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than 
not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
(f) Provision for repairs
As the Company is committed under the terms of a lease to make repairs to leasehold premises, provision is made for the estimated cost of repairs  
over the lease period.
(g) Foreign currencies
Where foreign currency borrowings have been used to finance or provide a hedge against equity investments in overseas subsidiaries, exchange gains 
or losses on the borrowings have been offset in reserves to the extent that they do not exceed the associated exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of net investments.
The transactions of the Company denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.  
Amounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.  
These exchange differences are included in profit on ordinary activities before tax.
OUR FIGURES  
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 105
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
(h) Share-based payments
The Company makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value of share options issued is measured using a binomial model. The expected life  
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and  
behavioural considerations.
The cumulative expense is reversed when an employee in receipt of the share options terminates service prior to the completion of vesting period.  
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified on termination of the employment, the total fair value of the share-based payments is  
recorded in the profit and loss account.
(i) Derivative financial instruments
The Company’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses 
derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange for the purchase of capital equipment denominated in foreign currencies and 
the sale of goods similarly denominated.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use  
of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments  
for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or 
forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains and losses 
on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For the hedges that do not 
result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the profit and loss account in the same period in which the 
hedged item affects the net profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.  
If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the profit and  
loss account for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics  
are not closely related to those of their host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported  
in the profit and loss account.
Those derivatives which are not designated as hedges are classified as held for trading and gains and losses on those instruments are recognised 
immediately in the profit and loss account.
(j) Pension costs
The Company operates a defined benefits pension scheme and a defined contribution pension scheme. The Company accounts for the defined benefits 
pension scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme under the provisions of FRS 17. Pension costs for the Company’s defined contribution 
scheme are charged against profits as payable. Further details are set out in note 14.
(k) Leases
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual amounts over the periods of leases.
(l) Cash flows
A statement of cash flows has not been prepared for the Company as, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 1 (Revised): ‘Cash Flow 
Statements’ (‘FRS 1’), cash flow information has been shown in the financial statements of the ultimate parent company.
2. PROFIT FROM OPERATIONS
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no profit and loss account of the Company is included in these financial statements. The profit 
for the financial period for the Company was £8.5 million (2014 – £13.6 million).

Bank overdrafts and loans
In March 2015, the Group negotiated a new revolving multicurrency loan facility increasing the previous facility from £90 million to £115 million for a term 
of four years expiring on 23 March 2019 and with the ability to extend the term for a further year. Up to £15 million may be drawn as an overdraft facility. 
Interest on loan drawdowns is charged at LIBOR plus a margin which varies between 1.55% and 2.15%, depending on the ratio of the Group’s net debt 
to EBITDA excluding non-underlying items. Interest on overdraft drawdowns is charged at 2.00% over UK base rate. 
As at 31 July 2015, the Group’s outstanding loans within this facility were £79 million (2014 – £55 million). The undrawn portion of this facility at  
31 July 2015 was £36 million (2014 – £35 million). 
The Company’s overdraft is guaranteed by certain United Kingdom subsidiary undertakings and the Company guarantees the loans and overdrafts 
of those United Kingdom subsidiary undertakings. At 31 July 2015, the aggregate liability for the Company under this guarantee amounted to 
£101,336,000 (2014 – £93,097,000). The aggregate value of overdraft liabilities belonging to these subsidiaries which are guaranteed by the  
Company amounted to £4,808,000 (2014 – £10,509,000).
As at 31 July 2015, there was no loan or overdraft secured against the assets of the Company (2014 – £Nil). The Directors consider that the carrying 
amount of the loans and overdrafts approximates their fair value.
The Company has guaranteed amounts payable to certain property landlords and suppliers of its trading subsidiaries. The maximum aggregate liability 
under these guarantees is £12,173,000 (2014 – £3,347,000).

14. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company participates in both the defined benefits and defined contribution schemes operated by St Ives plc. The defined benefits scheme is a 
multi-employer scheme, the assets and liabilities of which are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The pension costs are based on pension 
costs across the Group as a whole. For the defined contribution scheme, the profit and loss charge represents contributions payable.
The pension costs of the Company are disclosed in note 4.
For the purpose of FRS 17, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the defined benefits scheme  
on a consistent and reasonable basis. Accordingly, the Company accounts for the defined benefits scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. 
The defined benefits scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 6 April 2002 and closed to future benefit accrual from 31 August 2008.  
There are no contributions to fund future defined benefit accrual after 31 August 2008. Regular contributions of £2,400,000 were made in the period  
and the Company expects to contribute £2,400,000 to the scheme in 2015/2016.
The Group is required to account for the defined benefits scheme under International Accounting Standard 19 − Employee Benefits (‘IAS 19’).  
The IAS 19 disclosures, included in note 28 of the notes to the Group financial statements, have been based on the results of the actuarial valuation  
of the defined benefits scheme as at 6 April 2013 adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by IAS 19 and updated to 
31 July 2015 by the scheme’s actuary. These disclosures show that the scheme’s assets represented 91.9% of the scheme’s liabilities (2014 – 96.7%).

The Dividend Reinvestment plan can be a convenient and easy way to build up your shareholding by using your cash dividends to buy more shares in 
the Company. The Plan is provided by Capita Asset Services (‘Capita’), a trading name of Capita IRG Trustees Limited, which is authorised and regulated 
by the Financial Conduct Authority.
Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact Capita Asset Services on 0371 664 0381. Calls are charged at the  
standard geographic rate and will vary by provider. Calls outside the United Kingdom are charged at the applicable international rate. Lines are open

Unauthorised brokers (‘Boiler Room Scams’)
It is very unlikely that a reputable authored firm that a shareholder has had no relationship with would make contact out of the blue offering to buy  
St Ives’ shares or offer other investment opportunities.
Therefore, shareholders are advised to be wary of anyone offering to give unsolicited advice, buy shares at a discount or give free company reports. 
These calls are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what are often worthless or high risk shares  
in US or UK investments. This sharp practice is commonly known as a ‘boiler room scam’. If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• make sure you get the correct name of the person or organisation;
• check that they are properly authorised by the FCA before taking any action by visiting: www.fca.org.uk;
• report the matter to the FCA either by calling their Consumer Helpline (0800 111 6768) or by completing an on-line form at: www.fca.org.uk/scams; and
• if calls persist, hang up.
